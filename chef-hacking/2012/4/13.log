[2012-04-13 02:17:06 -0400] mattray: Hmmm Rackspace testing just ground to a halt. "Quota exceeded: code=InstanceLimitExceeded"?
[2012-04-13 02:24:08 -0400] jtimberman: holoway: hoover_damn: its not actually required in policy to start the services. it mentions how it should be done, but it doesn't say "package installation *must* run the init script with the start action"
[2012-04-13 02:34:41 -0400] hoover_damn: mattray, time to add a new huddle?
[2012-04-13 02:34:51 -0400] hoover_damn: mattray, call up rackspace and make sure your huddle is big enough
[2012-04-13 02:34:58 -0400] mattray: rackers are fixing right now
[2012-04-13 02:35:02 -0400] hoover_damn: as that's basically what it means
[2012-04-13 02:35:03 -0400] hoover_damn: cool
[2012-04-13 02:35:07 -0400] hoover_damn: fixing up your huddle then
[2012-04-13 02:35:09 -0400] hoover_damn: ?
[2012-04-13 02:35:16 -0400] hoover_damn: btw wth is a huddle
[2012-04-13 02:35:17 -0400] hoover_damn: that's a weird name
[2012-04-13 02:39:21 -0400] mattray: beats me.
[2012-04-13 02:40:00 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, right but it's terribly annoying to install something you want to configure... so you have to cleanly stop, start and not strop when configured right
[2012-04-13 02:40:44 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damn: oh, i agree :)
[2012-04-13 02:43:57 -0400] hoover_damn: but i should have a pretty darn exciting postgresql cookbook in a day or two
[2012-04-13 02:44:04 -0400] hoover_damn: ubuntu with 9.1 + optimized setup for hosting
[2012-04-13 02:49:14 -0400] mattray: hoover_damn: dmidecode suggestion has been passed along
[2012-04-13 02:49:51 -0400] hoover_damn: mattray, excellent, I really hope they do that as that would be the simplest thing they can do
[2012-04-13 02:49:58 -0400] hoover_damn: that would be the biggest win
[2012-04-13 02:50:04 -0400] mattray: yeah
[2012-04-13 02:50:18 -0400] mattray: they like that suggestion, since it solves it generally
[2012-04-13 02:51:45 -0400] hoover_damn: yep
[2012-04-13 03:01:32 -0400] matthewvermaak: any of the rackspace ruby-cloudlb maintainers lurking around here? :0)
[2012-04-13 03:02:46 -0400] hoover_damn: matthewvermaak, doubt it
[2012-04-13 03:03:12 -0400] hoover_damn: matthewvermaak, but it looks like they might do dmidecode can't wait :)
[2012-04-13 03:03:31 -0400] matthewvermaak: hoover_damn, nice :0)
[2012-04-13 03:03:51 -0400] hoover_damn: honestly, that'll give Rackspace a +1 on Amazon
[2012-04-13 03:04:09 -0400] hoover_damn: because if they take that to heart, that will make every customers life easier on Rackspace
[2012-04-13 03:04:17 -0400] hoover_damn: oh where ami ? dmidecode and win!
[2012-04-13 03:04:41 -0400] hoover_damn: it's gonna get worse as more clouds come up, and it's hard to make yourself known as who you are and where... it really is
[2012-04-13 03:04:59 -0400] hoover_damn: simplest path sometimes is the best
[2012-04-13 03:05:02 -0400] mattray: yeah, they mentioned they'd heard some more complaints today
[2012-04-13 03:05:06 -0400] hoover_damn: same path to identify hardware in the real world
[2012-04-13 03:05:12 -0400] hoover_damn: should work in the cloud world
[2012-04-13 03:05:29 -0400] hoover_damn: mattray, i'm not suprised
[2012-04-13 03:05:48 -0400] hoover_damn: mattray, it's unfortunate that they decided that the virtual mac's from hsrp need to go away
[2012-04-13 03:05:54 -0400] hoover_damn: but i can totally get it
[2012-04-13 03:06:11 -0400] mattray: gotta run. TYT
[2012-04-13 03:06:16 -0400] hoover_damn: good luck
[2012-04-13 03:06:18 -0400] hoover_damn: have fun on your demo
[2012-04-13 03:08:27 -0400] matthewvermaak: anyone getting a Forbidden from rubygems.org?
[2012-04-13 13:50:02 -0400] roidrage: so runit is pretty neat
[2012-04-13 14:08:31 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: yes
[2012-04-13 14:08:44 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: its on my list of favorite software
[2012-04-13 14:09:04 -0400] renchap: 15:39:12        renchap | when a resource A notifies a resource B (a ruby block), is it a way to know in B's ruby code what is the resource A ?
[2012-04-13 14:09:07 -0400] renchap: lets try here ;)
[2012-04-13 14:09:09 -0400] roidrage: the cookbook comes in quite handy too :)
[2012-04-13 14:09:19 -0400] renchap: the goal is to receive a mail when a file is changed by chef
[2012-04-13 14:09:23 -0400] renchap: (and not all files)
[2012-04-13 14:10:00 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: aye. i'm working on a branch that converts runit_service definition -> lwrp
[2012-04-13 14:10:10 -0400] jtimberman: it *might* become a full resource/provider.
[2012-04-13 14:10:23 -0400] jtimberman: because i really want it to create a service resource on its own.
[2012-04-13 14:10:47 -0400] jtimberman: renchap: i'd have to look at the code to know how.
[2012-04-13 14:11:17 -0400] renchap: jtimberman: we dont see an easy way with nico
[2012-04-13 14:14:15 -0400] jtimberman: there's a class, Chef::Resource::Notification
[2012-04-13 14:15:09 -0400] nico: hoo
[2012-04-13 14:16:29 -0400] renchap: jtimberman: do you have a trip in europe (paris ? :D) planned ?
[2012-04-13 14:16:39 -0400] nico: beers !
[2012-04-13 14:16:52 -0400] renchap: ;)
[2012-04-13 14:17:22 -0400] jtimberman: renchap: not in the near future.
[2012-04-13 14:17:31 -0400] renchap: :(
[2012-04-13 14:19:49 -0400] jtimberman: renchap: Chef::Resource::Notification creates a struct
[2012-04-13 14:20:17 -0400] renchap: jtimberman: i will let nico continue digging
[2012-04-13 14:20:31 -0400] renchap: i no longer have time for this, i do *important* things
[2012-04-13 14:20:42 -0400] renchap: like, things involving ldap and mails
[2012-04-13 14:20:43 -0400] renchap: :'(
[2012-04-13 14:21:34 -0400] StormSilver: One of the things I love about Chef is that it's easy to integrate into your other Ruby apps
[2012-04-13 14:21:40 -0400] jtimberman: nico: https://gist.github.com/131b76001f3fdf0b3d74
[2012-04-13 14:21:44 -0400] jtimberman: renchap: hahahaha
[2012-04-13 14:21:47 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-04-13 14:21:58 -0400] jtimberman: StormSilver: Yes. Tell me more about what you did.
[2012-04-13 14:22:12 -0400] renchap: jtimberman: its really painful :)
[2012-04-13 14:22:31 -0400] StormSilver: jtimberman: I have a capistrano driver toolbox that I use for all my chef interactions... sometimes I just shell out to knife, but in this case I needed to edit an encrypted data bag
[2012-04-13 14:23:14 -0400] StormSilver: jtimberman: Okay, no problem. Chef::Config.from_file, Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load; edit hash; Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.encrypt_data_bag_item, and then Chef:REST.new.put_rest
[2012-04-13 14:23:41 -0400] StormSilver: jtimberman: And it only took me about 15 minutes reading the code and trying things to build what I needed.
[2012-04-13 14:24:16 -0400] StormSilver: That's what I call a huge success.
[2012-04-13 14:25:52 -0400] StormSilver: jtimberman: Granted, it's a simple case, right? It wasn't a huge autonomous robot that uses chef to pet puppies
[2012-04-13 14:26:10 -0400] StormSilver: jtimberman: But if Chef wasn't designed the way it is, it would have been a real PITA
[2012-04-13 14:31:39 -0400] matthewvermaak: i certainly hope a chef driven robot to pet puppies is on the roadmap :0)
[2012-04-13 14:32:01 -0400] matthewvermaak: somebody's roadmap at least
[2012-04-13 14:32:13 -0400] StormSilver: matthewvermaak: I think it's coming out at the same time as TextMate 2.0
[2012-04-13 14:32:31 -0400] StormSilver: ... which isn't as funny now that there's an actual alpha that's quite usable.
[2012-04-13 14:33:56 -0400] jtimberman: hah
[2012-04-13 14:33:58 -0400] jtimberman: StormSilver: thanks :D
[2012-04-13 14:34:18 -0400] jtimberman: StormSilver: and yeah, chef was designed to be used for that kind of purpose :)
[2012-04-13 14:34:38 -0400] StormSilver: I know. :)
[2012-04-13 14:35:14 -0400] jtimberman: TextMate 2.0? People still use TM? I thought they all switched to Sublime Text 2 or MacVim.
[2012-04-13 14:37:18 -0400] StormSilver: I like it.
[2012-04-13 14:38:44 -0400] StormSilver: It's got some neat multiple insertion point things that I'm sure emacs/vim have had since the dawn of time.
[2012-04-13 14:42:40 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, drnic still does
[2012-04-13 14:42:49 -0400] hoover_damn: last i heard
[2012-04-13 14:43:10 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, towards the end I was hearing rumors that more people were leaving vim for working on their laptop and using textmate
[2012-04-13 14:43:21 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, could be false, doesn't matter as editors are a choice.
[2012-04-13 14:43:27 -0400] StormSilver: hoover_damn: Amen.
[2012-04-13 14:43:48 -0400] hoover_damn: but I admit I totally believe in Emacs as a better way to organize things
[2012-04-13 14:43:58 -0400] hoover_damn: emacs M-x org-mode
[2012-04-13 14:44:07 -0400] hoover_damn: create a small GTD on how you want to refactor
[2012-04-13 14:44:15 -0400] hoover_damn: - [-] I want to move a to b
[2012-04-13 14:44:23 -0400] hoover_damn:   - [-] b should do c
[2012-04-13 14:44:39 -0400] hoover_damn: add more as you see fit, mark complete as you work through it
[2012-04-13 14:44:48 -0400] hoover_damn: add more object's to the tree as you deviate
[2012-04-13 14:44:57 -0400] hoover_damn: at least that's what i'm trying, it's kinda workiing better
[2012-04-13 14:45:35 -0400] StormSilver: Man... and I keep using paper or a whiteboard :/
[2012-04-13 14:45:50 -0400] hoover_damn: StormSilver, is emacs not a paper or a whiteboard in the right way?
[2012-04-13 14:45:55 -0400] hoover_damn: StormSilver, that or fire up omnigraffle
[2012-04-13 14:46:02 -0400] hoover_damn: StormSilver, I see nothing wrong with omnigraffle
[2012-04-13 14:46:03 -0400] StormSilver: I do use OmniGraffle sometimes for that.
[2012-04-13 14:46:13 -0400] hoover_damn: yeah I need to buy a new license for omni
[2012-04-13 14:46:21 -0400] hoover_damn: kinda avoiding it as it's 200$ I didn't want to spend
[2012-04-13 14:46:23 -0400] StormSilver: Omni is such an old Mac company... they are awesome.
[2012-04-13 14:48:43 -0400] hoover_damn: oh i know
[2012-04-13 14:48:53 -0400] hoover_damn: the excuses for not buying it are lame
[2012-04-13 14:48:55 -0400] hoover_damn: so i'm going to
[2012-04-13 14:51:34 -0400] StormSilver: hoover_damn: So I take it you're not working at EY anymore?
[2012-04-13 14:52:44 -0400] hoover_damn: StormSilver, nope freelance contractor now
[2012-04-13 14:52:52 -0400] StormSilver: hoover_damn: Wow, fancy!
[2012-04-13 14:52:53 -0400] hoover_damn: StormSilver, have been since February 2nd
[2012-04-13 14:53:17 -0400] hoover_damn: StormSilver, I'm just not going to get rich by working for a startup and I've worked for a lot of passive agressive folks
[2012-04-13 14:53:37 -0400] hoover_damn: StormSilver, I enjoy working for my clients as they are quite awesome companies who have made me remember how much fun work is
[2012-04-13 14:53:46 -0400] hoover_damn: and what we are here for.
[2012-04-13 14:53:55 -0400] StormSilver: hoover_damn: Awesome!
[2012-04-13 14:55:05 -0400] hoover_damn: and I have some fancy new skills that I brought from EY to either share, learn more about or throw away... I rather enjoy remote pairing
[2012-04-13 14:55:13 -0400] hoover_damn: and well I got my emacs on :)
[2012-04-13 14:55:53 -0400] hoover_damn: StormSilver, also spending about 8months managing a PaaS product was interesting
[2012-04-13 14:56:02 -0400] hoover_damn: StormSilver, at least managing the CM side of it that is
[2012-04-13 14:56:35 -0400] hoover_damn: makes me devalue Ubuntu a lot as I'm keenly aware of how on a 'web app' stack level... it's erraticly out of date
[2012-04-13 14:56:55 -0400] hoover_damn: working on a postgresql 9.1 recipe and had to find a PPA as Natty only has 8.4
[2012-04-13 14:57:01 -0400] hoover_damn: and Precise finally has 9.1
[2012-04-13 14:57:23 -0400] hoover_damn: the constant update game at Ubuntu that really should be an easy 'I need X'
[2012-04-13 14:57:31 -0400] hoover_damn: bring it in, done
[2012-04-13 15:13:34 -0400] roidrage: ruby 1.8 block scoping is trolling me
[2012-04-13 15:13:48 -0400] roidrage: that's what i get for now having a box with chef running on 1.8 and one on 1.9 :)
[2012-04-13 15:14:41 -0400] roidrage: but man, what wonderfully fluent switch from monit to runit <3
[2012-04-13 15:16:41 -0400] hoover_damn: roidrage, excellent
[2012-04-13 15:16:53 -0400] hoover_damn: roidrage, if you need something for memory or cpu... bluepill is awesome
[2012-04-13 15:17:01 -0400] roidrage: got monit for that
[2012-04-13 15:17:06 -0400] hoover_damn: having written monit crap for eons
[2012-04-13 15:17:13 -0400] hoover_damn: I rather am enjoying using bluepill
[2012-04-13 15:17:27 -0400] roidrage: good for you
[2012-04-13 15:17:57 -0400] roidrage: and processes on this box are supposed to grab as much memory as they can anyway
[2012-04-13 15:18:04 -0400] roidrage: it's running lots of virtualbox babies
[2012-04-13 15:19:22 -0400] hoover_damn: the main reason I just am not a party to the 'Monit' plan is after writing the whole puma stack for EY and having to write shell scripts again it reminded me of a statement I made a year and a half ago about how I hated having to write a shell script for Mongrel, Unicorn, Thin, Jetty, etc
[2012-04-13 15:19:48 -0400] roidrage: sure, sure
[2012-04-13 15:19:50 -0400] hoover_damn: Monit's spartan PATH thing makes a customized path impossible which means you immediately have to anty up a shell script
[2012-04-13 15:19:54 -0400] hoover_damn: to bring in an environment that works
[2012-04-13 15:20:02 -0400] roidrage: but monit's main task is now to keep an eye on system resources and on whether the process pid has changed
[2012-04-13 15:20:04 -0400] roidrage: that's all
[2012-04-13 15:20:16 -0400] hoover_damn: and notify right?
[2012-04-13 15:20:36 -0400] roidrage: yes
[2012-04-13 15:20:44 -0400] hoover_damn: basically right now i'm doing runit -> start bluepill -> start unicorn
[2012-04-13 15:21:03 -0400] hoover_damn: I love runit, don't want to step away from it.  I like bluepill due to it's mustache / dsl config
[2012-04-13 15:21:36 -0400] hoover_damn: and bluepill doesn't have to start it, it can just be a notifier as well
[2012-04-13 15:21:41 -0400] hoover_damn: no i'm not telling you to switch
[2012-04-13 15:21:44 -0400] hoover_damn: just telling you why I did
[2012-04-13 15:21:59 -0400] hoover_damn: my reasons do not always work for others
[2012-04-13 15:22:24 -0400] roidrage: no kidding
[2012-04-13 15:23:15 -0400] hoover_damn: and the moment they do, I better run like hell
[2012-04-13 16:40:48 -0400] jtimberman: for resolv.conf, in the resolver cookbook, does this seem like a sane default for the 'search' attribute( used for the search option in the resolv.conf):
[2012-04-13 16:40:52 -0400] jtimberman: require 'resolv'
[2012-04-13 16:40:54 -0400] jtimberman: default['resolver']['search']      = domain || Resolv::DNS::Config.default_config_hash[:search]
[2012-04-13 17:19:34 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, more context please?
[2012-04-13 17:30:44 -0400] jtimberman: yfeldblum: right now, the default value of the search attribute is just domain
[2012-04-13 17:30:50 -0400] jtimberman: but if someone hasn't set up their fqdn properly domain is nil
[2012-04-13 18:20:12 -0400] hoover_damn: gosh someone is sure excited about that jenkinswar pull I made
[2012-04-13 18:20:57 -0400] spox: "you do not have enough
[2012-04-13 18:21:06 -0400] spox: hur, sorry about that
[2012-04-13 19:44:16 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, more context about what Resolv::DNS::Config is?
[2012-04-13 19:46:44 -0400] jtimberman: yfeldblum: oh, thats in the Ruby stdlib
[2012-04-13 19:46:50 -0400] jtimberman: it gets the current resolv config
[2012-04-13 19:47:37 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, gotcha
[2012-04-13 19:47:44 -0400] jtimberman: yfeldblum: http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/resolv/1.9.2/Resolv/DNS/Config.default_config_hash
[2012-04-13 19:47:47 -0400] jtimberman: its quite nifty
[2012-04-13 19:47:57 -0400] jtimberman: i was thinkign about making that populate the attributes
[2012-04-13 19:48:08 -0400] jtimberman: so it "just works" and "does the right thing"
[2012-04-13 20:27:25 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Do you want me to make some updates to the patch I submitted for OHAI-267 or have ya'll taken that and run with it already?
[2012-04-13 20:27:49 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Updates per your comments and our discussions yesterday, that is.
[2012-04-13 20:30:59 -0400] btm: StormSilver: I haven't thought about it today, but we are going to need to solve a collapsed namespace problem for sure. ec2, ec2-vpc, rackspace, rackspace-beta?
[2012-04-13 20:31:15 -0400] hoover_damn: fujin, sounds good
[2012-04-13 20:31:29 -0400] btm: Having equipment in rackspace managed hosting, I feel like we're getting in a dirty recreation of environment, but that's probably a personal problem.
[2012-04-13 20:31:30 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Yeah, def. Easy enough to make strings like you just exampled, but is it good enough?
[2012-04-13 20:32:23 -0400] StormSilver: I mean, at the end of the day, it's just a hint to ohai to tell it whether to enable a certain type of data or not.
[2012-04-13 20:32:31 -0400] laurent\: -          ip6address iface[tmp_int][:addresses].reject{|address, hash| hash['family'] != "inet6" || hash['scope'] != 'Global'}.first.first
[2012-04-13 20:32:41 -0400] StormSilver: laurent\: Yes, that was causing me to blow up too
[2012-04-13 20:32:56 -0400] StormSilver: laurent\: nil errors?
[2012-04-13 20:33:01 -0400] laurent\: maybe it would be better to revert OHAI-347
[2012-04-13 20:33:17 -0400] laurent\: oh my by i was supposed to add some failing test cases
[2012-04-13 20:33:23 -0400] laurent\: s/by/bad/
[2012-04-13 20:37:10 -0400] btm: StormSilver: right, which feels more like we should be creating a framework for hinting to ohai.
[2012-04-13 20:37:37 -0400] StormSilver: btm: I know. *weeps*
[2012-04-13 20:49:24 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, StormSilver that was silly
[2012-04-13 20:49:45 -0400] StormSilver: Eh?
[2012-04-13 20:50:20 -0400] hoover_damn: oh it completely works but to me it feels a bit too meta
[2012-04-13 20:51:08 -0400] StormSilver: hoover_damn: I know, but short of causing the cloud provider to provide ID (which is not an option at this point), how else do you propose to do it?
[2012-04-13 20:51:17 -0400] hoover_damn: and having ohai depend on something to give it a hinting framework would make things a lot cleaner i bet
[2012-04-13 20:51:33 -0400] hoover_damn: but at the same time my mind goes oOo wow that's deep
[2012-04-13 20:51:42 -0400] StormSilver: I know. :(
[2012-04-13 20:52:30 -0400] hoover_damn: mixlib-cloudlibs
[2012-04-13 20:52:32 -0400] hoover_damn: ?
[2012-04-13 20:52:40 -0400] hoover_damn: or cloudid?
[2012-04-13 20:52:55 -0400] StormSilver: Tell me more.
[2012-04-13 20:53:23 -0400] hoover_damn: use your imagination :)
[2012-04-13 20:53:28 -0400] hoover_damn: it's much more fun that way
[2012-04-13 20:53:55 -0400] github-bawt: [ohai] btm pushed 7 new commits to master: http://git.io/HWkAKw
[2012-04-13 20:53:56 -0400] github-bawt: [ohai/master] network/linux: won't set ipaddress if the src addr is not set on the node - Laurent
[2012-04-13 20:53:56 -0400] github-bawt: [ohai/master] linux/network spec: Linux-VServer and OpenVZ test cases regarding ipaddress - Laurent

[2012-04-13 21:05:14 -0400] btm: Ohai::Config[:hints] = { "cloud" => { "provider": "rackspace" } }
[2012-04-13 21:06:19 -0400] btm: Thoughts?
[2012-04-13 21:06:48 -0400] btm: holoway / kallistec? --^
[2012-04-13 21:11:34 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, mattray mentioned that they seemed to like the dmidecode suggestion
[2012-04-13 21:12:14 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, a nice easy short term work around would be sweet... but we shouldn't spend too much time on it if rackspace can deliver a better path
[2012-04-13 21:12:41 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, which then Opscode can go to other providers and say see! this works follow Rackspace and help us help you!
[2012-04-13 21:14:01 -0400] mattray: hoover_damn: yeah, but how long will that be from happening, and what if it's just for the new cloud
[2012-04-13 21:14:37 -0400] hoover_damn: mattray, a wedge is a wedge no matter what
[2012-04-13 21:14:53 -0400] mattray: I think the /etc/chef/cloud file is worthwhile because there will be plenty of other vendors who can't or won't fix their junk
[2012-04-13 21:15:05 -0400] mattray: yes indeed, a wedge
[2012-04-13 21:15:07 -0400] hoover_damn: agreed
[2012-04-13 21:15:28 -0400] hoover_damn: and as knife is generally the provider, it's also the consumer
[2012-04-13 21:15:34 -0400] hoover_damn: it should be easy to provide a format :)
[2012-04-13 21:15:42 -0400] hoover_damn: knife and chef heh
[2012-04-13 21:15:57 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Ohai::Config[:hints] = { "cloud" => { "provider": "rackspace", "variant": "beta" } }
[2012-04-13 21:16:29 -0400] StormSilver: or variant: "your shit doesn't detect my shit right, so use this thing instead"
[2012-04-13 21:16:44 -0400] StormSilver: But is that a variant, or just another provider?
[2012-04-13 21:16:57 -0400] mattray: it's currently a separate 'OSRackspace' provider
[2012-04-13 21:17:15 -0400] mattray: I'm going to merge it and parse the URL to determine how to use it within Fog
[2012-04-13 21:17:32 -0400] mattray: if it's got v2.0 in the url, you get the new stuff
[2012-04-13 21:18:02 -0400] mattray: which may make the code heinous, but at least there will be just 1 'Rackspace' provider and just 1 knife-rackspace
[2012-04-13 21:18:13 -0400] btm: hoover_damn: dmi would be awesome, but this problem already exists on ec2 vpc, and our ec2 solution is as fragile as rackspace was before it was broken.
[2012-04-13 21:18:45 -0400] mattray: btm: good point, forgot about vpc
[2012-04-13 21:18:54 -0400] StormSilver: mattray: So is the network detection vastly different on the beta? Enough that we need to differentiate the hint we provide to ohai?
[2012-04-13 21:19:45 -0400] mattray: well, there's IPv6 support, so it's kinda different
[2012-04-13 21:19:56 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, Ohai::Conig[:hints] = { "cloud" => hash }
[2012-04-13 21:19:59 -0400] hoover_damn: and we all win
[2012-04-13 21:20:13 -0400] mattray: I'm still debugging bootstrapping boxes
[2012-04-13 21:20:42 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, when I scoped out some whimsical thing I did at EY it wrapped up like this
[2012-04-13 21:20:53 -0400] hoover_damn: * `provider` - required - { "terramark": { "dmz": "dmz-310", "location": "pod30" } }
[2012-04-13 21:21:26 -0400] hoover_damn: which shows terramark's pattern for one product, which maybe different for another product
[2012-04-13 21:21:41 -0400] hoover_damn: so just tossing it in as a hash and letting a plugin deal with that data may be the sanest way
[2012-04-13 21:22:30 -0400] StormSilver: hoover_damn: Good point.
[2012-04-13 21:22:53 -0400] StormSilver: We just need to differentiate with the 'provider' field inside the hash so the appropriate plugin can deal with it
[2012-04-13 21:23:00 -0400] hoover_damn: Ohai::Config[:hints] = { "cloud" => { "provider": "me", "localip": 74.94.68.193" }}
[2012-04-13 21:23:18 -0400] hoover_damn: lookup a provider called me in the local ohai, and then look at external plugins
[2012-04-13 21:23:29 -0400] hoover_damn: and throw a sane error message when all else fumbles
[2012-04-13 21:23:55 -0400] yfeldblum: mattray, 1 deterministic method > 1000 patchwork ever-changing kludges
[2012-04-13 21:24:15 -0400] StormSilver: That's what we want to do.
[2012-04-13 21:24:25 -0400] StormSilver: Even if the 1 deterministic method sort of makes us all :(
[2012-04-13 21:24:28 -0400] mattray: yfeldblum: agreed. Rackspace should fix it both ways
[2012-04-13 21:24:57 -0400] mattray: meaning, if and when the dmidecode stuff shows up, we'll probably use it
[2012-04-13 21:25:13 -0400] mattray: but until then push some junk when we bootstrap
[2012-04-13 21:25:18 -0400] yfeldblum: mattray, cloud vendors and IaaS OSS projects should agree on a way to identify their VMs from within the VM, or at least publish their own ways, but if they don't, inject the info rather than guess the info
[2012-04-13 21:25:22 -0400] hoover_damn: you can't be deterministic if rackspace doesn't give you something to determine
[2012-04-13 21:25:44 -0400] mattray: yfeldblum: I believe there's a session at next week's OpenStack Design Summit, I'll bring it up
[2012-04-13 21:26:07 -0400] mattray: hoover_damn: yeah, I meant we'll switch to their deterministic technique when it shows up
[2012-04-13 21:26:12 -0400] StormSilver: mattray: Should we push the pause button on this until then?
[2012-04-13 21:26:22 -0400] mattray: StormSilver: no
[2012-04-13 21:26:35 -0400] mattray: just because we talk about it next week doesn't mean people are committed
[2012-04-13 21:26:51 -0400] StormSilver: Sure. Just thinking it might give us direction on the type of wedge we build.
[2012-04-13 21:26:55 -0400] mattray: every OpenStack (and cloud) provider needs a general solution
[2012-04-13 21:27:55 -0400] hoover_damn: yep and Opscode is the company that should drive the solution
[2012-04-13 21:28:06 -0400] mattray: hah
[2012-04-13 21:28:08 -0400] hoover_damn: as they are in the position to help :) Deliver
[2012-04-13 21:28:19 -0400] hoover_damn: both in design, and in solution to use it
[2012-04-13 21:28:22 -0400] mattray: you overestimate our influence, but I'll bang the drum
[2012-04-13 21:28:35 -0400] hoover_damn: mattray, you underestimate yours
[2012-04-13 21:28:40 -0400] mattray: heck, I'll talk with Puppet to help push it
[2012-04-13 21:28:46 -0400] hoover_damn: mattray, been there can totally see where you can believe that.
[2012-04-13 21:29:16 -0400] mattray: next week I'll have HP, Rackspace, Rightscale, Red Hat, Puppet and me in a room talking Fog. I'll plant the seed there
[2012-04-13 21:31:03 -0400] mattray: if someone has a working implementation I'll be happy to use/show it
[2012-04-13 21:31:58 -0400] StormSilver: Of what? dmidecode?
[2012-04-13 21:32:12 -0400] hoover_damn: mattray, uhm ohai already supports dmidecode
[2012-04-13 21:33:01 -0400] hoover_damn: mattray, so once dmi is available all you'd have to do is start plucking the data out of the node[:dmi] array
[2012-04-13 21:33:57 -0400] btm: http://twitter.com/btmspox/statuses/190915619170951168 <-- twittered. now we wait for the internet to respect and fix their clouds.
[2012-04-13 21:34:54 -0400] StormSilver: Won't be long now. :D
[2012-04-13 21:35:34 -0400] StormSilver: mattray: Thoughts on having `knife rackspace server delete` also delete the corresponding client and node from chef?
[2012-04-13 21:35:35 -0400] btm: mattray: yeah, they could populate something traditional like system manufacturer or model name. At the end of the day they could choose different shit as long as they all did something :P
[2012-04-13 21:36:05 -0400] StormSilver: Sounds like user agent.
[2012-04-13 21:36:45 -0400] mattray: StormSilver: I think that's in knife-ec2 master already, I'll look for it and put it into my knife-rackspace
[2012-04-13 21:37:16 -0400] mattray: btm: can the hypervisor push something into dmi of vms?
[2012-04-13 21:37:49 -0400] mattray: maybe we push that into OpenStack and encourage other folks to do the same
[2012-04-13 21:37:54 -0400] jtimberman: the problem with the DMI approach is you'd have to get the DMI package updated everywhere.
[2012-04-13 21:38:07 -0400] mattray: jtimberman raining on our parade
[2012-04-13 21:38:12 -0400] jtimberman: I know.
[2012-04-13 21:39:37 -0400] mattray: jtimberman: dmidecode type 11 OEM Strings
[2012-04-13 21:39:45 -0400] jtimberman: my 13 yr old called me "Daddy destroyer of fun" recently
[2012-04-13 21:39:48 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, nah i don't think we have to update DMI
[2012-04-13 21:39:58 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, OEM strings should be just fine
[2012-04-13 21:40:00 -0400] mattray: just push stuff into 11
[2012-04-13 21:40:05 -0400] mattray: yeah, OEM strings
[2012-04-13 21:40:10 -0400] cwj: jtimberman: i bet you relished that :)
[2012-04-13 21:40:54 -0400] jtimberman: best list of BUGS in a man page (dmidecode): More often than not, information contained in the DMI tables is inaccurate, incomplete or simply wrong.
[2012-04-13 21:41:01 -0400] jtimberman: cwj: hehehehe
[2012-04-13 21:42:42 -0400] btm: mattray: yeah, like, KVM now puts the libvirt uuid into DMI, which was pretty ________ awesome, because you can garden data from virsh on your hosts and then programmatically deduce what hosts your guests are on with chef search.
[2012-04-13 21:43:25 -0400] mattray: btm: we'll gloss that over for the security folks
[2012-04-13 21:49:30 -0400] mattray: excellent, talking in the rackspace cloud servers beta channel, they're researching it
[2012-04-13 21:49:39 -0400] mattray: trying to figure how Xen does it
[2012-04-13 21:49:44 -0400] mattray: err, xenserver

[2012-04-13 22:17:33 -0400] btm: ohai should just portscan the network by default :P
[2012-04-13 22:20:07 -0400] mattray: later gents

[2012-04-13 23:26:53 -0400] laurent\: it's not really helping in the end
[2012-04-13 23:28:06 -0400] fujin: anyway to rely on node attributes being available in an lwrp, like, load_current_resource ?
[2012-04-13 23:28:13 -0400] fujin: seems to have trouble loading these attributes in our gdash cookbook
[2012-04-13 23:29:27 -0400] fujin: n/m think I got it
[2012-04-13 23:32:11 -0400] fujin: .. yeah,it's kind of like
[2012-04-13 23:32:12 -0400] fujin: lwrps
[2012-04-13 23:32:16 -0400] fujin: are synchronized earlier than attributes
[2012-04-13 23:33:44 -0400] fujin: that would be kinda sweet. cause you could lock down params validate :kind_of => node.some.array
[2012-04-13 23:35:08 -0400] yfeldblum: fujin, i would say that all data should be passed into resources via resource attributes, and not via node attributes at all
[2012-04-13 23:40:37 -0400] jtimberman: yeah, i'd rely on the resource not the node. since the node can modify shit in flight.
[2012-04-13 23:45:49 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, also, just the rules of proper abstraction, composition, & encapsulation
[2012-04-13 23:53:52 -0400] fujin: more often than not the parameters to resources have suitable defaults defined in the cookbook
[2012-04-13 23:54:00 -0400] fujin: seems like a pretty suitable use case.
[2012-04-13 23:54:01 -0400] fujin: w/e
[2012-04-13 23:54:54 -0400] fujin: actually, we ripped it out
[2012-04-13 23:54:58 -0400] fujin: now I'm more permissive
[2012-04-13 23:55:07 -0400] fujin: just take what the user specifies and chuck it in to the attribute anyway
