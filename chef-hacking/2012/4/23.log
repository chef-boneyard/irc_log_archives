[2012-04-23 22:29:34 -0400] c_t: well damn
[2012-04-23 22:29:50 -0400] c_t: I was hacking on chef so intently, I plumb forgot that I was supposed to take the kids to the dentist today
[2012-04-23 22:30:39 -0400] cwj: ruh roh
[2012-04-23 23:18:45 -0400] fujin: fuck nagios lol
[2012-04-23 23:21:30 -0400] fujin: sensu!!!!
[2012-04-23 23:36:15 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: does sensu alert?
[2012-04-23 23:36:37 -0400] jtimberman: send notifications on conditions
[2012-04-23 23:41:19 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: I have handlers wired in for pagerduty, campfire and IRC
[2012-04-23 23:41:24 -0400] fujin: soo.. yes, yes it does. :)
[2012-04-23 23:41:36 -0400] fujin: You can also simulate arbitrary alert conditions just by dumping json into a socket
[2012-04-23 23:42:42 -0400] fujin: the checks themselves have occurences/interval/refresh, so you can tune how and when it alerts pretty easily :)
[2012-04-23 23:42:52 -0400] fujin: not to mention you could modify any of the handlers yourself, or write your own
[2012-04-23 23:42:57 -0400] fujin: easy mode ruby
