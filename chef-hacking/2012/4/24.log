[2012-04-24 00:20:10 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: cool. i'll check it out sooner rather than later.
[2012-04-24 00:20:28 -0400] fujin: =)
[2012-04-24 00:20:32 -0400] fujin: Maybe I can show you at chefconf.
[2012-04-24 00:20:36 -0400] fujin: Hell, no maybe about it
[2012-04-24 00:20:52 -0400] fujin: at least webframp will show you it at chefconf in his presentation :)
[2012-04-24 01:00:55 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: woot :)
[2012-04-24 01:01:00 -0400] jtimberman: i could set it up but
[2012-04-24 01:01:02 -0400] jtimberman: i'm lazy.
[2012-04-24 01:01:03 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-04-24 15:36:23 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] btm pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/p4Z2Tg
[2012-04-24 15:36:23 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] using Pathname#cleanpath on paths before comparing them - Laurent
[2012-04-24 15:36:23 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] a test for needs_updating? - Laurent
[2012-04-24 15:36:23 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] Merge branch 'CHEF-3033' - Bryan McLellan
[2012-04-24 15:39:48 -0400] btm: laurent\: it looks like CHEF-2389 removes a test and doesn't add any for the use case that you're fixing.
[2012-04-24 15:39:53 -0400] btm: laurent\: so, why? :)
[2012-04-24 15:47:40 -0400] juanje: btm: thanks for the tip with the Yajl at CHEF-2352. It worked :-)
[2012-04-24 15:47:52 -0400] juanje: btm: and I added some more tests
[2012-04-24 15:49:00 -0400] juanje: There was a old bug without any tests and I didn't know if Yajl could cause a regression
[2012-04-24 15:50:03 -0400] jtimberman: omg
[2012-04-24 15:50:14 -0400] jtimberman: does that mean we s/json-gem/yajl/??!
[2012-04-24 15:50:17 -0400] jtimberman: this makes me happy
[2012-04-24 15:50:58 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, replacing C extensions does not solve everything
[2012-04-24 15:51:07 -0400] hoover_damn: but yes you can d a jig
[2012-04-24 15:51:12 -0400] hoover_damn: do a jig*
[2012-04-24 15:51:42 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damn: I *loathe* that json gem.
[2012-04-24 15:51:54 -0400] jtimberman: so if we can avoid it even if it means another C ext gem, I am happy.
[2012-04-24 15:52:27 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, you see me tell people every day how horrible the json gem is
[2012-04-24 15:52:40 -0400] hoover_damn: worst ruby gem /EVER/
[2012-04-24 15:53:04 -0400] jtimberman: you should be doing a happy dance too.
[2012-04-24 15:55:16 -0400] hoover_damn: nah
[2012-04-24 15:55:24 -0400] hoover_damn: I'm waiting to see the json gem dead
[2012-04-24 15:55:27 -0400] hoover_damn: that's when I will be happy
[2012-04-24 15:55:29 -0400] btm: juanje: glad we're getting rid of json_class. kallistec will probably buy you a beer.
[2012-04-24 15:55:38 -0400] hoover_damn: until rails new ~/bob doesn't bring in json by accident
[2012-04-24 15:55:39 -0400] juanje: hahaha
[2012-04-24 15:55:48 -0400] jtimberman: patch rails
[2012-04-24 15:55:51 -0400] hoover_damn: or other ways people use json in error
[2012-04-24 15:55:52 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-04-24 15:56:01 -0400] jtimberman: I only use json in anger!
[2012-04-24 15:56:12 -0400] hoover_damn: the json gem itself is the best way to make yourself not run on all rubies
[2012-04-24 15:56:19 -0400] kallistec: juanje: yeah, json_class is evil
[2012-04-24 15:56:21 -0400] juanje: btw, jtimberman: well, actually, I didn't remove the json, I just replaced in a few places for that bug
[2012-04-24 15:56:35 -0400] juanje: but I think I could remove with a bit more of checks and work...
[2012-04-24 15:56:48 -0400] juanje: kallistec: it IS!
[2012-04-24 15:57:23 -0400] kallistec: get rid of json_class entirely and sfalcon and I will buy you a case of Sound Spirits liquor
[2012-04-24 15:57:38 -0400] hoover_damn: lol
[2012-04-24 15:57:55 -0400] juanje: kallistec: hahahaha
[2012-04-24 16:00:07 -0400] yfeldblum: json_class should be removed
[2012-04-24 16:01:18 -0400] juanje: yfeldblum: yep
[2012-04-24 16:01:39 -0400] juanje: Is there and part of Chef that really use/need it?
[2012-04-24 16:01:51 -0400] kallistec: pro tip: you can use JSON.create_id = "I hate json_class"
[2012-04-24 16:02:00 -0400] kallistec: when you need it turned off
[2012-04-24 16:02:35 -0400] kallistec: juanje: yeah, the server expects merb to automatically parse JSON and use the json_class to turn things into ruby objects
[2012-04-24 16:02:39 -0400] juanje: kallistec: nice id :-P
[2012-04-24 16:03:21 -0400] juanje: kallistec: I thought so... :-/
[2012-04-24 16:04:50 -0400] kallistec: dunno if you guys will find it as useful as us, we use that at opscode when we're debugging api stuff w/ shef
[2012-04-24 16:10:17 -0400] laurent\: btm: basically because it was useless, wrong logic I'd say. I don't know how to replace the test in that case.
[2012-04-24 16:10:42 -0400] laurent\: i'm in shop looking for a toilet bowl :-)
[2012-04-24 16:41:20 -0400] cwj: i am looking at this ticket http://help.opscode.com/discussions/problems/1560-lots-of-400s-and-500s-today and wondering if it has to do with the 400s i am getting back from node.save, seemingly at random
[2012-04-24 16:41:46 -0400] cwj: i dont use activesupport, so i am wondering what else could be contributing to run_list validation problems
[2012-04-24 16:49:22 -0400] hoover_damn: cwj, guess a reason to use prerelease?
[2012-04-24 16:49:59 -0400] cwj: think if i use pre-release client i get errors locally?
[2012-04-24 16:50:44 -0400] hoover_damn: you actually load up activesupport
[2012-04-24 16:50:46 -0400] hoover_damn: ?
[2012-04-24 16:50:49 -0400] hoover_damn: you said you don't
[2012-04-24 16:50:52 -0400] cwj: no, i don't
[2012-04-24 16:51:23 -0400] hoover_damn: hrm got a stack trace of some of em your getting?
[2012-04-24 16:51:35 -0400] cwj: going to try to get one now
[2012-04-24 16:51:44 -0400] cwj: every time i try to get a debug trace it doesn't happen :)
[2012-04-24 16:58:31 -0400] hoover_damn: btw, I want Opscode to understand how stupid LC_ALL="C" is
[2012-04-24 16:58:33 -0400] hoover_damn: /usr/apps/howaboutwe/shared/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/bundler/gems/rspec_formatters-24813adb69aa/rspec-extra-formatters.gemspec:6: invalid multibyte char (US-ASCII)
[2012-04-24 16:58:55 -0400] hoover_damn: having the rspec-extra-formatters.gemspec cause nginx to fail to start, just because you have LC_ALL="C" set on shellout
[2012-04-24 16:59:02 -0400] hoover_damn: is really annoying
[2012-04-24 16:59:17 -0400] hoover_damn: restart nginx and it'll catch the regular LC_ALL=""
[2012-04-24 16:59:33 -0400] hoover_damn: but having to force export LC_ALL="" in startup commands in chef
[2012-04-24 16:59:36 -0400] hoover_damn: and other parts of chef
[2012-04-24 16:59:37 -0400] hoover_damn: is just wrong
[2012-04-24 16:59:47 -0400] btm: shelling out everywhere is hard.
[2012-04-24 17:00:23 -0400] hoover_damn: currently have to do it with god, nginx, unicorn
[2012-04-24 17:00:24 -0400] hoover_damn: and more
[2012-04-24 17:00:33 -0400] hoover_damn: it really begs the question of, can we make this a freaking option?
[2012-04-24 17:00:45 -0400] hoover_damn: because I totally get why you did LC_ALL="C"
[2012-04-24 17:00:57 -0400] hoover_damn: I haven't forgotten it
[2012-04-24 17:01:04 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, indeed
[2012-04-24 17:01:10 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, seems like a ever-changing minefield
[2012-04-24 17:01:17 -0400] yfeldblum: why was it done?
[2012-04-24 17:01:34 -0400] hoover_damn: yfeldblum, LANG="turkish" then run chef-client
[2012-04-24 17:01:42 -0400] hoover_damn: yfeldblum, ifconfig had different output... so ohai had nada
[2012-04-24 17:01:54 -0400] yfeldblum: gotcha
[2012-04-24 17:02:08 -0400] hoover_damn: LC_ALL="C" allows you to still have the turkish language, but with a C locale...
[2012-04-24 17:02:20 -0400] hoover_damn: not offending the end user likely, and allowing you to still work
[2012-04-24 17:02:29 -0400] hoover_damn: the problem is when that application wants to run UTF-8
[2012-04-24 17:02:33 -0400] yfeldblum: perhaps Mixlib::ShellOut should simply mark strings obtained from the command's stdout as binary?
[2012-04-24 17:02:35 -0400] hoover_damn: or use charecters outside of C
[2012-04-24 17:02:44 -0400] hoover_damn: yep
[2012-04-24 17:02:48 -0400] hoover_damn: that's kinda what we had to do at EY
[2012-04-24 17:02:53 -0400] hoover_damn: before I left
[2012-04-24 17:02:59 -0400] hoover_damn: we started forcing everything to binary
[2012-04-24 17:03:08 -0400] hoover_damn: Net::SSH is evil on this
[2012-04-24 17:03:25 -0400] hoover_damn: actual bug filed here http://net-ssh.lighthouseapp.com/projects/36253/tickets/48-netssh-fails-with-different-encodings
[2012-04-24 17:03:42 -0400] yfeldblum: i'm sure
[2012-04-24 17:04:17 -0400] hoover_damn: yfeldblum, i'm not sure that's the right answer
[2012-04-24 17:04:23 -0400] hoover_damn: yfeldblum, but it's annoying
[2012-04-24 17:04:53 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damn, if the string is coming back from the command as binary, then it should be marked binary in ruby
[2012-04-24 17:05:25 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damn, marking as encoded in a particular encoding is begging for problems ...
[2012-04-24 17:05:58 -0400] hoover_damn: i'm going to be the encoding newb today
[2012-04-24 17:06:08 -0400] hoover_damn: because it's been a few years since I pretended to care about encodings
[2012-04-24 17:15:14 -0400] cwj: load average: 5.74, 5.17, 4.45
[2012-04-24 17:15:17 -0400] cwj: thanks chef-client!
[2012-04-24 17:15:47 -0400] hoover_damn: lol
[2012-04-24 17:16:12 -0400] cwj: granted it is a t1.micro, but i know its generating a huge stack trace right now
[2012-04-24 17:19:30 -0400] cwj: i just don't know at what point it's run so long as to be hopeless
[2012-04-24 17:21:33 -0400] hoover_damn: cwj, ubuntu 10.04?
[2012-04-24 17:21:34 -0400] hoover_damn: or older?
[2012-04-24 17:21:46 -0400] hoover_damn: cwj, huge load generally reaks of TSC bug
[2012-04-24 17:21:46 -0400] cwj: 10.04 exactly
[2012-04-24 17:21:49 -0400] hoover_damn: yep
[2012-04-24 17:21:52 -0400] hoover_damn: tsc bug
[2012-04-24 17:21:56 -0400] hoover_damn: EY has it too
[2012-04-24 17:22:00 -0400] hoover_damn: it's damn annoying
[2012-04-24 17:22:16 -0400] hoover_damn: https://silverline.librato.com/blog/main/EC2_Users_Should_be_Cautious_When_Booting_Ubuntu_10_04_AMIs
[2012-04-24 17:22:27 -0400] hoover_damn: basically apt-get dist-upgrade and create-image with a newer kernel
[2012-04-24 17:22:32 -0400] hoover_damn: and you should get around the TSC bug
[2012-04-24 17:22:50 -0400] cwj: 2.6.32-318-ec2
[2012-04-24 17:22:54 -0400] cwj: its newer than the fix
[2012-04-24 17:22:55 -0400] hoover_damn: over a period of 2 years I can honestly say this bug has cost thousands of dollars of wasted compute time
[2012-04-24 17:23:03 -0400] hoover_damn: doesn't mean your fixed
[2012-04-24 17:23:23 -0400] hoover_damn: the TSC bug went back and forth for people... some tried to say it was normal
[2012-04-24 17:23:31 -0400] hoover_damn: the loosers are the end users suffering
[2012-04-24 17:23:59 -0400] hoover_damn: cwj, your cpu steal when chef is running is insane right?
[2012-04-24 17:24:05 -0400] hoover_damn: cwj, 60% steal with 40% cpu usage?
[2012-04-24 17:24:18 -0400] hoover_damn: cwj, that's how you can tell it's TSC
[2012-04-24 17:24:20 -0400] cwj: i only notice when its generating stack trace from hell
[2012-04-24 17:25:27 -0400] cwj: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5380898/Screenshots/0t0r.png
[2012-04-24 17:25:35 -0400] cwj: looks like what you're describing
[2012-04-24 17:26:00 -0400] hoover_damn: yep that's the cpu steal bug
[2012-04-24 17:26:10 -0400] hoover_damn: it freaking sucks
[2012-04-24 17:26:16 -0400] hoover_damn: a/k/a tsc
[2012-04-24 17:26:51 -0400] cwj: so is my stack trace ever going to finish? :)
[2012-04-24 17:32:07 -0400] hoover_damn: it'll take awhile
[2012-04-24 18:26:53 -0400] btm: laurent\: a regression test / failing test pre CHEF-2389 would be really good if you could figure it out.
[2012-04-24 18:30:57 -0400] cwj: hoover_damn: hm seems like activesupport is getting loaded by another gem i am calling (tinder, for communicating with campfire)
