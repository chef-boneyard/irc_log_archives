[2012-04-03 15:38:30 -0400] jtimberman: http://finance.yahoo.com/news/omniti-debuts-omnios-open-source-130000928.html
[2012-04-03 15:38:42 -0400] jtimberman: wonder what, if anything, shows up for node['platform'] on that...
[2012-04-03 16:16:31 -0400] thom: haven't had time to try
[2012-04-03 16:16:46 -0400] thom: might do tomorrow actually
[2012-04-03 16:20:10 -0400] roidrage: so everyone's doing their own OS now? i like it
[2012-04-03 16:20:23 -0400] roidrage: waiting for OpscodeOS
[2012-04-03 16:30:59 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, they always have
[2012-04-03 16:31:05 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, it's just they never talked about it
[2012-04-03 16:31:16 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, HP had their own OS for WebOS
[2012-04-03 16:31:33 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, there was someone the other day talking about blackfoot linux
[2012-04-03 16:31:37 -0400] hoover_damm: on Cisco phones
[2012-04-03 16:42:27 -0400] c_t: seems like it was even worse in the early 2000s, to be obvious
[2012-04-03 16:42:38 -0400] hoover_damm: it was
[2012-04-03 16:42:43 -0400] hoover_damm: but people forget the past
[2012-04-03 16:42:44 -0400] c_t: Every Tom, Dick, and Oracle was putting out their own "distro"
[2012-04-03 16:42:51 -0400] hoover_damm: it's why we are often doomed to repeat our own mistakes
[2012-04-03 16:42:57 -0400] c_t: which was generally slapping their name on Debian as I recall
[2012-04-03 16:42:58 -0400] hoover_damm: because we have failed to learn from them the first time properly
[2012-04-03 16:43:05 -0400] c_t: (not Oracle specifically, but you get the idea)
[2012-04-03 16:43:09 -0400] hoover_damm: right
[2012-04-03 16:44:06 -0400] c_t: even now there seem to be a remarkable pile of Linux distros you've never heard of and hardly anyone appears to use
[2012-04-03 16:46:06 -0400] thom: this is evolution (and open source) in action though; someone (or many someones) have an itch to scratch; it's very cheap - just some compute time - to build an OS these days given fedora spins and ubuntu derivatives and so on
[2012-04-03 16:46:31 -0400] c_t: I wasn't saying it was *bad*, as such
[2012-04-03 16:46:46 -0400] c_t: just that there's an awful lot of them
[2012-04-03 16:48:23 -0400] c_t: Some of them even look interesting for one reason or another
[2012-04-03 16:48:45 -0400] c_t: there's an awful lot that seem to be going for the "easy to use for new people" thing, though
[2012-04-03 16:48:53 -0400] c_t: snip those out and the list would shrink considerably
[2012-04-03 16:52:46 -0400] thom: "easy to use for new people who are exactly like me" always amused me as a genre of linuxes
[2012-04-03 16:53:27 -0400] c_t: there's one Linux distro out there that doesn't use ELF binaries
[2012-04-03 16:53:39 -0400] c_t: not sure what it's status is right now, but last I checked the guy hadn't abandoned it
[2012-04-03 16:54:46 -0400] thom: i imagine he lives in a shack in the sub arctic and doesn't hold with those new fangled guns, either
[2012-04-03 16:55:03 -0400] c_t: close, I get the impression the guy lives in Portland
[2012-04-03 16:55:28 -0400] c_t: http://mastodon.biz/ <-- last release 2002, but the page was last updated Jan 21, 2011
[2012-04-03 16:59:37 -0400] thom: he sounds like a bit of a loon
[2012-04-03 17:01:58 -0400] c_t: he apparently feels really strongly about, erm, ELF
[2012-04-03 17:02:01 -0400] c_t: and code bloat
[2012-04-03 17:02:09 -0400] thom: and the GPL
[2012-04-03 17:02:12 -0400] thom: and the FHS
[2012-04-03 17:02:23 -0400] thom: well, omnios boots on virtualbox at least
[2012-04-03 17:04:23 -0400] c_t: a while back for the hell of it I tried booting Slackware 3.5 in Xen and VMware
[2012-04-03 17:04:34 -0400] c_t: oddly enough, it didn't work very well at all
[2012-04-03 17:05:50 -0400] thom: now to deal with the aldrich horror of solaris commands
[2012-04-03 17:05:54 -0400] thom: heh
[2012-04-03 17:06:06 -0400] thom: slack 3.5 was my first linux
[2012-04-03 17:06:47 -0400] hoover_damm: sls here
[2012-04-03 17:06:47 -0400] c_t: my *very* first was RH 3.0.3 (came in some book I picked up and I installed it), but the first I used on a routine basis was Slack 3.6
[2012-04-03 17:07:07 -0400] hoover_damm: or AT&T SysV
[2012-04-03 17:07:12 -0400] hoover_damm: if you really want to talk about my first unix
[2012-04-03 17:07:34 -0400] hoover_damm: i wish i took more liberties to learn the old
[2012-04-03 17:11:09 -0400] c_t: at one point I tried getting a hacked up 2.9BSD running on a PDP-11 I picked up at Goodwill
[2012-04-03 17:11:22 -0400] c_t: that would be the oldest Unix I came close to running on real hardware
[2012-04-03 17:11:28 -0400] c_t: sadly the hard drive had died :-(
[2012-04-03 17:17:47 -0400] jtimberman: yggdrasil!
[2012-04-03 17:17:59 -0400] jtimberman: its making a comeback i hear, thanks to all the Scandanavian Metal.
[2012-04-03 17:18:03 -0400] jtimberman: These things are related.
[2012-04-03 17:19:43 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, so there's hope from you escaping ubuntu's bad grasps?
[2012-04-03 17:22:12 -0400] jtimberman: yeah man
[2012-04-03 17:22:21 -0400] jtimberman: i'm going to run suse
[2012-04-03 17:22:26 -0400] jtimberman: it just makes the most sense.
[2012-04-03 17:36:52 -0400] hoover_damm: I actually tried that back in 2004
[2012-04-03 17:36:54 -0400] hoover_damm: seriously
[2012-04-03 17:37:01 -0400] hoover_damm: I dumped Debian for SuSE
[2012-04-03 17:37:05 -0400] hoover_damm: horrible mistake
[2012-04-03 17:37:18 -0400] hoover_damm: corrected by moving to Gentoo
[2012-04-03 17:37:19 -0400] hoover_damm: :D
[2012-04-03 17:45:52 -0400] c_t: I tried Gentoo for a bit, probably somewhere around 2004 or so
[2012-04-03 17:46:04 -0400] c_t: I got sick of recompiling shit constantly
[2012-04-03 17:46:24 -0400] c_t: "Oh, you're upgrading 'cat'? Better start recompiling X too, just to be safe."
[2012-04-03 17:47:50 -0400] hoover_damm: that's not a big deal so much now
[2012-04-03 17:47:55 -0400] hoover_damm: --as-needed changed that
[2012-04-03 17:48:15 -0400] hoover_damm: Gentoo actually has tried to help stabalize a large problem that FreeBSD and DragonflyBSD and others tried
[2012-04-03 17:48:18 -0400] hoover_damm: did it differently
[2012-04-03 17:48:22 -0400] hoover_damm: it seems to work
[2012-04-03 17:48:43 -0400] hoover_damm: it's required a lot of patching of open source code to get lazy open's out (i think) and more
[2012-04-03 17:49:06 -0400] hoover_damm: but yeah it's ridiculus to update portage or ports and install gettext and blow up half your box
[2012-04-03 17:49:26 -0400] hoover_damm: doesn't happen to me anymore
[2012-04-03 17:49:26 -0400] hoover_damm: :D
[2012-04-03 17:51:21 -0400] c_t: oh, FreeBSD could pull shit like that too if one was not paying attention
[2012-04-03 17:51:28 -0400] c_t: "OK, I needz to install teh vim"
[2012-04-03 17:51:41 -0400] c_t: "WTF Y U INSTALLING X???"
[2012-04-03 17:51:56 -0400] c_t: (the make option telling it not to does wonders)
[2012-04-03 17:52:37 -0400] hoover_damm: let's install X
[2012-04-03 17:52:41 -0400] hoover_damm: oh let's have a dialog script pop up
[2012-04-03 17:52:45 -0400] hoover_damm: what X driver do you need?
[2012-04-03 17:52:54 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-04-03 17:53:15 -0400] c_t: for a while, some kid in Taiwan was posting Linux advocacy diaries on DKos
[2012-04-03 17:53:22 -0400] c_t: dunno why, but whatever
[2012-04-03 17:53:32 -0400] hoover_damm: it annoyed me to no end always having to install freetype
[2012-04-03 17:53:38 -0400] hoover_damm: just for vim and php
[2012-04-03 17:53:51 -0400] hoover_damm: but we had our own freebsd package server
[2012-04-03 17:53:56 -0400] hoover_damm: so between upstream and ours
[2012-04-03 17:53:59 -0400] hoover_damm: we kinda had a decent life
[2012-04-03 17:54:44 -0400] c_t: anyway, I dropped into one of them once and offhandedly mentioned the Good Old Days when you had to do shit like edit /etc/printcap to get the damn printer working, or worry a bit about blowing up your monitor setting up X
[2012-04-03 17:54:52 -0400] c_t: blew the kid's mind
[2012-04-03 17:55:30 -0400] hoover_damm: the good old days where you actually had to have a brain cell in order to set something up
[2012-04-03 17:55:48 -0400] hoover_damm: heck even the shell scripts to help write /etc/printcap
[2012-04-03 17:55:50 -0400] hoover_damm: were arcane as heck
[2012-04-03 17:56:31 -0400] hoover_damm: there's old sysadmins rolling over in their grave with laughter about what the new kids bitch about
[2012-04-03 17:56:37 -0400] hoover_damm: it's so simple compared to the shit they dealt with
[2012-04-03 17:56:55 -0400] c_t: then again, I used to have this neighbor
[2012-04-03 17:56:58 -0400] c_t: old mainframe guy
[2012-04-03 17:56:59 -0400] hoover_damm: and being on the bleeding edge 20 years ago is the same, as it is today
[2012-04-03 17:57:10 -0400] hoover_damm: knocks a few bolts loose
[2012-04-03 17:57:21 -0400] c_t: he'd gripe about his Windows box, because it would do shit like just make a file for you when you asked for it
[2012-04-03 17:57:36 -0400] c_t: like, you didn't have to tell it what cylinder to put it on or anything
[2012-04-03 17:57:40 -0400] c_t: he didn't care for that much at all
[2012-04-03 17:58:22 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm not sure our children solve problems better
[2012-04-03 17:59:13 -0400] hoover_damm: old thing I heard when I was a kid
[2012-04-03 18:01:22 -0400] c_t: huh
[2012-04-03 18:01:27 -0400] c_t: twm is still being maintained
[2012-04-03 18:02:16 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-04-03 18:02:29 -0400] hoover_damm: i hear cde is making a comeback
[2012-04-03 18:02:51 -0400] c_t: oh gawd

[2012-04-03 18:07:29 -0400] hoover_damm: c_t, events often repeat themselves if people don't pay attention to history
[2012-04-03 18:07:41 -0400] hoover_damm: c_t, and it seems that people are not paying as much attention lately

[2012-04-03 18:50:10 -0400] roidrage: Chef 1.0!!
[2012-04-03 18:54:55 -0400] hoover_damm: 1.0 is a bit away no?
[2012-04-03 18:55:09 -0400] hoover_damm: although i admit i'd love it if opscode untied the versioning of chef-client from their server components
[2012-04-03 18:55:19 -0400] hoover_damm: so that chef-client could be released / updated independently of chef-server
[2012-04-03 18:55:58 -0400] hoover_damm: as I don't know many folks who'd update merb
[2012-04-03 18:56:00 -0400] hoover_damm: heh
[2012-04-03 19:05:30 -0400] btm: hoover_damm: merb -> rails3 next major release. that work is almost done.
[2012-04-03 19:27:26 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, poor thing
[2012-04-03 19:27:29 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, you did it too?
[2012-04-03 19:27:36 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, :(
[2012-04-03 19:28:18 -0400] hoover_damm: having the mixed codebase of merb and rails in the same app
[2012-04-03 19:28:20 -0400] hoover_damm: made life fun

[2012-04-03 19:33:35 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, but I still think that pulling chef-server and chef apart is good
[2012-04-03 19:33:59 -0400] hoover_damm: as I really don't think chef should depend on the server component, depend on hosted, or install the gems to do the server :)
[2012-04-03 19:34:00 -0400] btm: hoover_damm: we don't really want to support merb forever-more, so we had some folks do the port for us.
[2012-04-03 19:34:29 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, :) yeah that's why I said split it apart, chef-server-api could be just a simple sinatra ditty
[2012-04-03 19:34:31 -0400] btm: separating the code releases may be a good idea. I'll bring it up at an appropriate time.
[2012-04-03 19:34:49 -0400] hoover_damm: provided api compatability is there, it should be fine to split em
[2012-04-03 19:34:53 -0400] hoover_damm: :) and yes appropriate time
[2012-04-03 19:34:58 -0400] hoover_damm: can't make everything nownownow

[2012-04-03 20:46:29 -0400] c_t: I suppose someone will be complaining bitterly about requiring git 1.6.5+
[2012-04-03 20:46:44 -0400] cwj: complaining? on the internet?
[2012-04-03 20:46:57 -0400] c_t: remarkable I know
[2012-04-03 20:46:58 -0400] btm: we looked at the time and 1.6.5 was pretty old.
[2012-04-03 20:47:32 -0400] c_t: I'm sure it's not that onerous a request, btm
[2012-04-03 20:47:47 -0400] btm: it only affects you if you use sub-modules anyway. people who like old git shouldn't be using new features, it's not very neck-beard of them.
[2012-04-03 20:47:52 -0400] c_t: but someone, somewhere, will be dead set against upgrading I'm sure
[2012-04-03 20:48:15 -0400] c_t: I think the last time I got a support request for someone using MacOS 9 & IE 5.2 for Mac was...
[2012-04-03 20:48:15 -0400] btm: the commit message is stern to entrap those folks.
[2012-04-03 20:48:20 -0400] c_t: January 2009, I think?
[2012-04-03 20:48:23 -0400] c_t: maybe 2010
[2012-04-03 20:48:50 -0400] c_t: I keep waiting to hear from someone running Netscape Gold on Win 3.1
[2012-04-03 20:49:07 -0400] cwj: i recently had to interface with someone who was trying to export their catalog to us in csv format from an AS/400
[2012-04-03 20:49:20 -0400] c_t: in EBCDIC?
[2012-04-03 20:49:41 -0400] cwj: i've repressed most of what followed
[2012-04-03 20:49:54 -0400] c_t: might be for the best
[2012-04-03 20:50:17 -0400] c_t: I *think* the AS/400s use EBCDIC, but I could be wrong
[2012-04-03 20:50:31 -0400] c_t: heck, they may well use their own special, subtly different, EBCDIC
[2012-04-03 20:55:40 -0400] hoover_damm: they can monkeypatch support for chef 1.6.4 and older
[2012-04-03 20:55:51 -0400] hoover_damm: but yeah 1.6.5 is quite ancient
[2012-04-03 20:56:00 -0400] hoover_damm: only ey runs that old
[2012-04-03 21:09:05 -0400] btm: hahaha
[2012-04-03 21:12:14 -0400] c_t: mmm
[2012-04-03 21:12:22 -0400] c_t: this sphinx cookbook's coming along
[2012-04-03 21:16:24 -0400] hoover_damm: what's it for?
[2012-04-03 21:16:26 -0400] hoover_damm: installing it?
[2012-04-03 21:16:33 -0400] hoover_damm: you install, yuu index? what else?
[2012-04-03 21:20:41 -0400] c_t: installing, configuring, indexing
[2012-04-03 21:21:09 -0400] c_t: the existing sphinx cookbook(s) that I could find seemed to be a bit lacking
[2012-04-03 21:21:26 -0400] c_t: of course, I did make a deb for the latest sphinx for squeeze

[2012-04-03 21:58:24 -0400] laurent\: playing with specs ... :)
[2012-04-03 22:00:58 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] btm pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/423amQ
[2012-04-03 22:00:58 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] update tests for knife cookbook site install on windows - Bryan McLellan
[2012-04-03 22:14:43 -0400] laurent\: oh ohai/network doesn't has specs
[2012-04-03 22:14:52 -0400] laurent\: have
[2012-04-03 22:19:43 -0400] btm: ohai/network is all weirdly based on other plugins. I looked at it funny once.
[2012-04-03 22:20:06 -0400] btm: IIRC I couldn't figure out how to deal with require_plugin && _require_plugin correctly.
[2012-04-03 22:22:52 -0400] laurent\: ok
[2012-04-03 22:25:12 -0400] laurent\: looking at OHAI-347 https://github.com/aussiegeek/ohai/commit/47ebc4ffe7baab4228ee2e807811bff4d5a49db8 it's going to get complex quite soon i think :)
[2012-04-03 22:29:50 -0400] laurent\: we could have an ipv4 default route using iface1 and ipv6 default route using iface2. the patch does quite a brutal assumption without even trying to set default_gateway6 (or whatever the attribute name should be) :-)
[2012-04-03 22:44:26 -0400] hoover_damm: c_t, yeah we use 0.9.9 but we use thinking-sphinx
[2012-04-03 22:44:50 -0400] hoover_damm: c_t, so it's basically wget, ./configure, make install, su - user be rake ts:rebuild
[2012-04-03 22:44:59 -0400] hoover_damm: c_t, and win
[2012-04-03 22:44:59 -0400] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-04-03 22:45:07 -0400] c_t: I took the 2.0.3 debian control files, the 2.0.4 tarball, and built a 2.0.4 deb
[2012-04-03 22:45:13 -0400] c_t: and stuck it on our repo
[2012-04-03 22:45:15 -0400] hoover_damm: 0.9.9 here
[2012-04-03 22:45:19 -0400] c_t: so, still some win there
[2012-04-03 22:45:22 -0400] hoover_damm: 2.0 is still new to me
[2012-04-03 22:45:28 -0400] hoover_damm: 1.1.0beta was rocky to me
[2012-04-03 22:45:35 -0400] c_t: seems to be OK so far
[2012-04-03 22:45:36 -0400] hoover_damm: it's kinda how I got stuck on ES
[2012-04-03 22:45:39 -0400] hoover_damm: (elasticsearch)
[2012-04-03 22:45:49 -0400] c_t: but I'm just setting the infrastructure up
[2012-04-03 22:46:01 -0400] c_t: I'm going to let someone else deal with dealing with it
[2012-04-03 23:40:42 -0400] ampledata: anyone used lsync or csync2
[2012-04-03 23:46:33 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-04-03 23:48:01 -0400] laurent\: btm: fixed both corp and Emmanuel issues in OHAI-343
