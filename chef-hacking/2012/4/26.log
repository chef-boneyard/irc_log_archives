[2012-04-26 12:17:27 -0400] laurent\: btm: CHEF-3060 <= another trailing slash thingy :)
[2012-04-26 13:22:08 -0400] roidrage: anyone seen this mofo happen before? http://pastebin.com/1ppr6q2G
[2012-04-26 13:23:03 -0400] nico: fs full ?
[2012-04-26 13:23:05 -0400] nico: perms ?
[2012-04-26 13:23:17 -0400] roidrage: ugh, file system is full, haha
[2012-04-26 13:23:21 -0400] roidrage: 16M /tmp ftw!
[2012-04-26 13:23:25 -0400] roidrage: thanks for the hint
[2012-04-26 13:23:52 -0400] nico: running on a 2G IDE disk ?
[2012-04-26 13:23:57 -0400] nico: :)
[2012-04-26 13:24:58 -0400] roidrage: no, on a 436GB disk ;)
[2012-04-26 13:25:02 -0400] roidrage: it's quite hilarious
[2012-04-26 13:38:21 -0400] roidrage: actually, i blame vserver for this
[2012-04-26 13:42:18 -0400] roidrage: thanks nico ;)
[2012-04-26 13:49:36 -0400] nico: np
[2012-04-26 14:06:43 -0400] hoover_damn: vserver sets up 16M /tmp?
[2012-04-26 14:06:50 -0400] roidrage: this one does
[2012-04-26 14:07:18 -0400] hoover_damn: that's annoying
[2012-04-26 14:07:27 -0400] hoover_damn: 16M don't go far
[2012-04-26 14:07:48 -0400] hoover_damn: not saying you host rails apps, but rails apps that handle uploads
[2012-04-26 14:07:48 -0400] nico: it goes to nil
[2012-04-26 14:07:50 -0400] hoover_damn: can burn through that
[2012-04-26 14:08:39 -0400] roidrage: it's just hilarious, because most cookbooks that download stuff, download to /tmp, and it's usually a fixed path in the recipes ;)
[2012-04-26 14:09:29 -0400] hoover_damn: I do /mnt/#{name}
[2012-04-26 14:09:46 -0400] roidrage: of course you do ;)
[2012-04-26 14:09:49 -0400] hoover_damn: it's because I generally deal with EC2 and or places where /mnt isn't small
[2012-04-26 14:10:02 -0400] roidrage:  /mnt wins
[2012-04-26 14:10:04 -0400] roidrage: on ec2
[2012-04-26 14:10:11 -0400] hoover_damn: lol yeah
[2012-04-26 14:10:14 -0400] hoover_damn: that's not hard
[2012-04-26 14:10:24 -0400] hoover_damn: they drop so much storage on there that most people don't use
[2012-04-26 14:10:31 -0400] hoover_damn: 3.4tb on a hvm instance in ephemeral storage
[2012-04-26 14:10:33 -0400] hoover_damn: backed by SSD
[2012-04-26 14:10:36 -0400] hoover_damn: who knew?
[2012-04-26 14:14:25 -0400] roidrage: orly?
[2012-04-26 14:17:56 -0400] hoover_damn: rly
[2012-04-26 14:18:18 -0400] hoover_damn: roidrage, I was made aware the HVM's were special by Amazon last year when they were launched... how much of it was under wraps
[2012-04-26 14:18:32 -0400] hoover_damn: roidrage, hvm instances are like dedicated... you get the whole thing to yourself
[2012-04-26 14:18:56 -0400] hoover_damn: roidrage, it is ssd backed... it's not wildly faster
[2012-04-26 14:19:12 -0400] hoover_damn: roidrage, but I do push over 8k ops with less then 30% utilization on a raid-10 array over the ephemeral disks
[2012-04-26 14:19:17 -0400] hoover_damn: and higher
[2012-04-26 14:19:40 -0400] hoover_damn: roidrage, basically I had to host graphite... wasn't too sure where the topline of the metrics was so I overprovisioned
[2012-04-26 14:19:44 -0400] roidrage: yeah, i love the CC instances. they're the only really useful types on EC2 really ;)
[2012-04-26 14:19:52 -0400] hoover_damn: roidrage, i'm doing 800k a second metrics
[2012-04-26 14:20:08 -0400] hoover_damn: yep
[2012-04-26 14:20:20 -0400] hoover_damn: i'm half tempted to get a few CC's and lxc them for the rest of my production
[2012-04-26 14:20:23 -0400] hoover_damn: :D
[2012-04-26 14:20:25 -0400] roidrage: your numbers are very impressive, sir
[2012-04-26 14:20:35 -0400] roidrage: i for one, do a measly 10 messages per second ;)
[2012-04-26 14:20:39 -0400] roidrage: and i like it that way ;)
[2012-04-26 14:20:57 -0400] roidrage: i'm a small data guy
[2012-04-26 14:21:13 -0400] hoover_damn: I always find contracts who deal with banners
[2012-04-26 14:21:19 -0400] hoover_damn: not really big data
[2012-04-26 14:22:10 -0400] roidrage: medium data
[2012-04-26 14:22:41 -0400] roidrage: i like my data medium

[2012-04-26 14:23:56 -0400] github-bawt: [knife-ec2/master] Bump fog version to 1.3.  Make version constraint more optimistic. - Steven Danna
[2012-04-26 14:29:10 -0400] hoover_damn: I think it's more big data, but they act medium sized.
[2012-04-26 14:29:23 -0400] hoover_damn: added some postgresql to see if we can backoff mongo onto postgres
[2012-04-26 14:30:04 -0400] hoover_damn: the question really becomes on how big the data is that isn't really stored in a store we own...
[2012-04-26 14:30:09 -0400] hoover_damn: and moving that into a store we own..
[2012-04-26 14:30:13 -0400] hoover_damn: it's all stored in google app engine
[2012-04-26 14:30:23 -0400] hoover_damn: it was an interesting migration
[2012-04-26 14:30:32 -0400] hoover_damn: I don't know half the deets and it was interesting
[2012-04-26 14:31:14 -0400] hoover_damn: but yeah having a 10gig uplink is the only way EBS can not scale still

[2012-04-26 15:02:59 -0400] hoover_damn: ...
[2012-04-26 15:04:17 -0400] mattray: and RDS
[2012-04-26 15:04:25 -0400] yfeldblum: yep
[2012-04-26 15:04:32 -0400] mattray: and elb
[2012-04-26 15:04:53 -0400] mattray: probably some other acronyms too
[2012-04-26 15:05:02 -0400] yfeldblum: they have already had cloud load balancers for over a year i believe
[2012-04-26 15:05:14 -0400] hoover_damn: jokes
[2012-04-26 15:05:19 -0400] yfeldblum: they are getting vpc though with cloud networks
[2012-04-26 15:05:21 -0400] hoover_damn: they don't do x-forwarded-for
[2012-04-26 15:05:22 -0400] hoover_damn: no ssl
[2012-04-26 15:05:42 -0400] hoover_damn: i'm not saying amazon is better
[2012-04-26 15:05:48 -0400] hoover_damn: rackspace has a lot of catching up to do
[2012-04-26 15:06:39 -0400] yfeldblum: SSL is all about the end-to-end unbreakable tunnel ... you need SSL termination or no go
[2012-04-26 15:06:52 -0400] yfeldblum: no go w.r.t. transforming or adding info to the connection
[2012-04-26 15:14:21 -0400] hoover_damn: ahh booting rackspace
[2012-04-26 15:14:23 -0400] hoover_damn: and getting 500's
[2012-04-26 15:14:48 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damn, it is amusing
[2012-04-26 15:14:50 -0400] hoover_damn: yfeldblum, I thought SSL was all about this imaginary thing
[2012-04-26 15:15:05 -0400] hoover_damn: yfeldblum, and this trust thing
[2012-04-26 15:15:17 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damn, but if at first you don't succeed, try, try again :P
[2012-04-26 15:15:19 -0400] hoover_damn: like we trust the companies that can buy ssl certificates
[2012-04-26 15:15:21 -0400] hoover_damn: like end users can't
[2012-04-26 15:15:56 -0400] hoover_damn: and the fact that SPDY requires SSL unneccesarily
[2012-04-26 15:15:59 -0400] hoover_damn: means I hope it dies
[2012-04-26 15:16:13 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damn, well, that's the PKI, and the PKI is broken, but SSL is actually pretty good
[2012-04-26 15:17:10 -0400] hoover_damn: yfeldblum, personally I have no great opinion on SSL other then it's a big sham trying to make people believe in a certificate you can't even hold in your hand
[2012-04-26 15:17:17 -0400] yfeldblum: people are coming out with alternatives to the CA model, including distributed & heuristics based, so we'll see what happens there, but they all use SSL
[2012-04-26 15:17:21 -0400] hoover_damn: and people say that if you buy the certificate from x vendor instead of y vendor
[2012-04-26 15:17:25 -0400] hoover_damn: you can get more sales
[2012-04-26 15:17:36 -0400] hoover_damn: because more people trust verisign certs over godaddy
[2012-04-26 15:17:52 -0400] hoover_damn: I know I always verify the store's SSL Cert I buy stuff at to make sure it's not on some 3rd rate SSL cert... ;)
[2012-04-26 15:18:31 -0400] hoover_damn: right, and I don't think the SSL model is the best.  We need to change but we need to be mindful of legacy
[2012-04-26 15:18:39 -0400] yfeldblum: heh, yeah that's the CA model, which is a layer on top of SSL
[2012-04-26 15:18:41 -0400] hoover_damn: and making this as least painful as possible for the people having to do it
[2012-04-26 15:19:27 -0400] hoover_damn: multiplexing tcp connections may not be the best thing for us
[2012-04-26 15:19:43 -0400] hoover_damn: first thing i'm going to ask is how is an ops guy going to help the latency on 1 stream vs the other?
