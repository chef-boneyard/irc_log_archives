[2012-04-04 00:19:01 -0400] ampledata: hoover: feedback?
[2012-04-04 00:19:03 -0400] ampledata: good/bad?
[2012-04-04 00:19:18 -0400] ampledata: we might roll it out for syncing some dir trees between our machines
[2012-04-04 00:19:59 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, feedback on?
[2012-04-04 00:22:52 -0400] ampledata: <ampledata 4:40> anyone used lsync or csync2
[2012-04-04 00:23:23 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, sorry the yep wasn't in reference to that.
[2012-04-04 00:23:29 -0400] hoover_damm: i haven't used either
[2012-04-04 00:24:10 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, trying to keep 2 filesystems in sync? any reason your not using a shared?
[2012-04-04 00:24:29 -0400] hoover_damm: doesn't have to be nfs
[2012-04-04 00:34:40 -0400] ampledata: holy shit check that neckbeard http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4036736/Screenshots/dtuk.png
[2012-04-04 00:42:59 -0400] hoover_damm: eh?
[2012-04-04 00:43:14 -0400] hoover_damm: I guess I should show my face more often
[2012-04-04 00:45:07 -0400] hoover_damm: hrm perhaps mine doesn't look so big
[2012-04-04 09:42:46 -0400] laurent\: https://github.com/opscode/ohai/commit/0dc0475ae7f331551538706608343539d820c43c#L1R47 scope is only set in the network/linux plugin ...
[2012-04-04 09:43:48 -0400] laurent\: do you really want OHAI-347 to be fixed just like that ?
[2012-04-04 15:23:26 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] btm pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/KuEM8Q
[2012-04-04 15:23:26 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] Refactor cookbook_upload, fixing CHEF-2543. - Steven Danna
[2012-04-04 15:23:26 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] Merge branch 'CHEF-2543' - Bryan McLellan
[2012-04-04 15:44:42 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, any chance we're getting close to 0.10.10?
[2012-04-04 15:47:52 -0400] roidrage: 1.0, 1.0, 1.0!
[2012-04-04 15:50:39 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, they have already hinted at 0.12 and 0.14
[2012-04-04 15:50:43 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, so that bursts your bubble baby
[2012-04-04 15:50:49 -0400] roidrage: maybe 0.16 and 0.18 too
[2012-04-04 15:50:55 -0400] roidrage: 1.0 in 2020!!
[2012-04-04 15:50:58 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, honestly I think 0.14 should be 1.0
[2012-04-04 15:51:08 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, from what they've said of the feature set, that feels closer to 1.0
[2012-04-04 15:51:18 -0400] roidrage: they can say that for any version ;)
[2012-04-04 15:51:20 -0400] hoover_damm: but i'm not opscode
[2012-04-04 15:51:28 -0400] hoover_damm: only they dictate versions
[2012-04-04 15:51:40 -0400] roidrage: well, not like there's anything you could do  about it, they're hiring ;)
[2012-04-04 15:54:46 -0400] hoover_damm: honestly I haven't applied, it would feel weird for me to apply through the front door
[2012-04-04 15:54:57 -0400] hoover_damm: I haven't really thought about working for Opscode ever really
[2012-04-04 15:55:06 -0400] hoover_damm: other then as a notion to help with cookbooks
[2012-04-04 15:55:16 -0400] hoover_damm: doesn't fit within my career goals
[2012-04-04 15:55:19 -0400] hoover_damm: or life goals
[2012-04-04 15:56:35 -0400] laurent\: btm: OHAI-347 has to be reverted until it is correctly fixed i think
[2012-04-04 15:59:30 -0400] laurent\: \o/ wrote my first simple spec from scratch \o/ i'm trying to rework the ohai/network plugin :)
[2012-04-04 16:10:10 -0400] btm: hoover_damm: I've almost finished merging for 0.10.10 and I'll ship a beta within a day or two. Maybe we'll feature freeze next week and ship an RC.
[2012-04-04 16:11:11 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, excellent
[2012-04-04 16:11:29 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, only reason I asked is we're using a old version of master for a client, and we were hoping to get back onto a release soon
[2012-04-04 16:12:03 -0400] laurent\: gosh that means i need to resolve a chef ticket the evening
[2012-04-04 16:12:08 -0400] laurent\: s/the/this
[2012-04-04 16:13:46 -0400] laurent\: btm: do you plan on releasing ohai with major fixes as well ?
[2012-04-04 16:13:58 -0400] laurent\: thinking of OHAI-343
[2012-04-04 16:17:11 -0400] jtimberman: btm: \m/
[2012-04-04 16:27:36 -0400] btm: laurent\: sometime before ChefConf. I'm still dancing with a couple possible regressions to try to divine the best time to do so.
[2012-04-04 16:27:56 -0400] btm: jtimberman: O_o?
[2012-04-04 16:29:27 -0400] btm: man. patches that fix indentation are so hard to merge.
[2012-04-04 16:29:44 -0400] roidrage: four tabs, dude
[2012-04-04 16:30:18 -0400] laurent\: oh yes it's nearly chefconf time. nevermind :)
[2012-04-04 16:30:20 -0400] btm: Dear tab, please find a word processor to love you. I don't.
[2012-04-04 16:30:55 -0400] jtimberman: btm: beta 0.10.10 makes me happy
[2012-04-04 16:50:17 -0400] btm: laurent\: were you writing a failing test for OHAI-347?
[2012-04-04 16:51:37 -0400] laurent\: not yet, i'm still working on OHAI-343
[2012-04-04 16:53:54 -0400] laurent\: ohai-343 might need splitting in two (Emmanuel and corp issues aren't the same)
[2012-04-04 18:53:26 -0400] roidrage: anyone know of a plugin for knife that just triggers a daemonized chef-client?
[2012-04-04 19:02:37 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: you can send SIGUSR1
[2012-04-04 19:02:41 -0400] jtimberman: to the chef-client
[2012-04-04 19:02:58 -0400] roidrage: yes, but i don't want to log in via ssh and do that manually when i can just have a plugin to do the dirty work for me
[2012-04-04 19:03:09 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: we'll have a "run" action in the init scripts soon. if you're using runit or daemontools for your chef-client daemon you can just sv{c} 1 chef-client
[2012-04-04 19:03:29 -0400] roidrage: still involves manual work ;)
[2012-04-04 19:03:31 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: i think ranjibd was doing something like that with mcollective?
[2012-04-04 19:03:54 -0400] jtimberman: other than using knife ssh, i'm not aware of such a plugin
[2012-04-04 19:05:49 -0400] ranjibd: roidrage, i have an mcollective agents that i use to send USR2 (for linux only systems) and USR1 (for windows/linux dualboot systems)
[2012-04-04 19:06:12 -0400] roidrage: ah, well that's almost too complex for something simple as making chef-client run ;)
[2012-04-04 19:06:19 -0400] roidrage: especially when i have only a handful of servers
[2012-04-04 19:06:38 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: if you only have a handful
[2012-04-04 19:06:40 -0400] jtimberman: knife ssh
[2012-04-04 19:06:41 -0400] jtimberman: :D
[2012-04-04 19:06:57 -0400] roidrage: yeah, may have to go for an alias there
[2012-04-04 19:07:06 -0400] jtimberman: rake task all the things!
[2012-04-04 19:07:11 -0400] ranjibd: roidrage, all linux? then use alias
[2012-04-04 19:07:21 -0400] roidrage: something that sends the signal and tails the logs
[2012-04-04 19:07:47 -0400] ranjibd: exactly .. alias knife ssh '*:*' 'service chef-client restart'?
[2012-04-04 19:08:17 -0400] jtimberman: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1160
[2012-04-04 19:08:26 -0400] jtimberman: coming soon to a chef-client cookbook near you
[2012-04-04 19:09:44 -0400] roidrage: doesn't need to be a restart but yeah
[2012-04-04 19:10:04 -0400] roidrage: slow jira is slow
[2012-04-04 19:10:23 -0400] jtimberman: https://github.com/opscode/chef/commit/bac8863fbbad94ff323ae6bc0cac059a4ac21262
[2012-04-04 19:10:27 -0400] jtimberman: thats faster :)
[2012-04-04 19:16:56 -0400] roidrage: i like the fact that stuff just roles out eventually with hosted chef/chef server but sometimes i just want to see an immediate effect :)
[2012-04-04 19:19:06 -0400] roidrage: especially being new with chef-server and all :)
[2012-04-04 19:19:37 -0400] roidrage: though i can't even reach manage.opscode.com right now?
[2012-04-04 19:20:14 -0400] roidrage: weird
[2012-04-04 19:30:19 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, rackspace?
[2012-04-04 19:30:48 -0400] roidrage: i can reach it from my vpn endpoint in Amsterdam, but couldn't reach it from my home connection. weird
[2012-04-04 19:30:54 -0400] roidrage: fuuuuuu rackspace
[2012-04-04 19:30:55 -0400] hoover_damm: weird
[2012-04-04 19:31:03 -0400] hoover_damm: rackspace just dropped EU
[2012-04-04 19:31:09 -0400] hoover_damm: not sure what happened exactly
[2012-04-04 19:31:17 -0400] hoover_damm: but i was testing collectd scale for a client
[2012-04-04 19:31:23 -0400] hoover_damm: and my route to the EU dropped
[2012-04-04 19:31:34 -0400] hoover_damm: :(
[2012-04-04 19:31:51 -0400] hoover_damm: seems to be back up now
[2012-04-04 19:31:56 -0400] hoover_damm: but I just terminated all my tests
[2012-04-04 19:31:57 -0400] hoover_damm: so screw it
[2012-04-04 19:32:20 -0400] roidrage: maybe you're to blame then
[2012-04-04 19:33:46 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, not this time
[2012-04-04 19:33:54 -0400] hoover_damm: can't blame me for everything
[2012-04-04 19:36:44 -0400] roidrage: haven't blamed you for anything so far, so this seemed like a safe bet
[2012-04-04 19:49:19 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-04-04 19:49:22 -0400] hoover_damm: nope
[2012-04-04 19:49:26 -0400] hoover_damm: not me but nice try
[2012-04-04 19:51:34 -0400] roidrage: damn, manage.opscode is currently unreachable from germany
[2012-04-04 19:53:30 -0400] roidrage: so is the wiki and jira :/
[2012-04-04 19:55:47 -0400] roidrage: hosted chef Y U NO THERE!?!?!
[2012-04-04 20:03:13 -0400] roidrage: jtimberman: you guys aware of any rackspace issues?
[2012-04-04 20:03:57 -0400] ranjibd: status?
[2012-04-04 20:03:58 -0400] bawt: status is slow.
[2012-04-04 20:04:02 -0400] ranjibd: status?
[2012-04-04 20:04:02 -0400] bawt: status is slow.
[2012-04-04 20:04:42 -0400] roidrage: cupcakes?
[2012-04-04 20:04:42 -0400] bawt: cupcakes are strong like rock. or http://www.cupcakeberlin.de or nom nom nom or http://www.cupcakeroyale.com/
[2012-04-04 20:07:18 -0400] roidrage: stoopid rackspace
[2012-04-04 20:07:38 -0400] roidrage: the whole 184.106 network seems to be unreachable from germany
[2012-04-04 20:08:27 -0400] c_t: in hindsight, putting a Class B behind a wrt54g was a bad choice
[2012-04-04 20:21:53 -0400] roidrage: guess i'll have to do this change manually :/
[2012-04-04 20:22:15 -0400] hoover_damm: still?
[2012-04-04 20:22:15 -0400] bawt: still is giggling over that.
[2012-04-04 20:22:18 -0400] hoover_damm: that's ridiculus
[2012-04-04 20:23:23 -0400] ranjibd: status?
[2012-04-04 20:23:23 -0400] bawt: status is slow.
[2012-04-04 20:23:25 -0400] roidrage: yeah, still unreachable from here
[2012-04-04 20:23:31 -0400] ranjibd: status is http://status.opscode.com/
[2012-04-04 20:23:34 -0400] ranjibd: status?

[2012-04-04 20:25:29 -0400] hoover_damm: ranjibd, forget status
[2012-04-04 20:25:30 -0400] hoover_damm: err
[2012-04-04 20:25:32 -0400] hoover_damm: bawt, forget status
[2012-04-04 20:25:33 -0400] bawt: okay
[2012-04-04 20:25:41 -0400] hoover_damm: bawt, status is  http://status.opscode.com/
[2012-04-04 20:25:41 -0400] bawt: incorrect usage, ask for help using 'bawt: help status'
[2012-04-04 20:25:50 -0400] hoover_damm: bawt, status is http://status.opscode.com/
[2012-04-04 20:25:50 -0400] bawt: incorrect usage, ask for help using 'bawt: help status'
[2012-04-04 20:26:01 -0400] ranjibd: status is http://status.opscode.com/

[2012-04-04 20:26:16 -0400] hoover_damm: that works
[2012-04-04 20:26:27 -0400] hoover_damm: ty ranjibd
[2012-04-04 20:26:59 -0400] roidrage: i triggered rackspace about it
[2012-04-04 20:27:05 -0400] roidrage: all their other networks are reachable
[2012-04-04 20:27:13 -0400] fujin: hmm
[2012-04-04 20:27:14 -0400] fujin: ?
[2012-04-04 20:27:17 -0400] hoover_damm: huh?
[2012-04-04 20:27:26 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, so why can't you connect then?
[2012-04-04 20:27:34 -0400] hoover_damm: i can connect to eu again
[2012-04-04 20:27:39 -0400] hoover_damm: so clearly my issue was not yours
[2012-04-04 20:27:49 -0400] roidrage: because the network manage is in is not reachable from here
[2012-04-04 20:28:17 -0400] hoover_damm: huh? they block the network manager from germany?
[2012-04-04 20:28:24 -0400] roidrage: why block?
[2012-04-04 20:28:38 -0400] roidrage: this particular network currentlyisn't reachable, but others from rackspace seem to be
[2012-04-04 20:28:50 -0400] hoover_damm: rght why
[2012-04-04 20:28:57 -0400] roidrage: why would i know why?
[2012-04-04 20:29:01 -0400] roidrage: because they hate germans?
[2012-04-04 20:29:45 -0400] hoover_damm: can't call and ask?
[2012-04-04 20:30:05 -0400] roidrage: i triggered them on the twitters, i'm not gonna call rackspace about this, thank you
[2012-04-04 20:30:37 -0400] hoover_damm: they won't respond
[2012-04-04 20:30:43 -0400] hoover_damm: that's not how rackspace really rolls
[2012-04-04 20:30:46 -0400] hoover_damm: their security is tight
[2012-04-04 20:30:58 -0400] hoover_damm: if you have a problem open a ticket
[2012-04-04 20:32:26 -0400] hoover_damm: or i doubt they would
[2012-04-04 20:33:42 -0400] hoover_damm: and their repsonse indicates that
[2012-04-04 20:35:42 -0400] roidrage: oh they did respond
[2012-04-04 20:36:05 -0400] roidrage: but i'm glad you know better ;)
[2012-04-04 20:38:01 -0400] hoover_damm: just have dealt with rackspace enough to know how they roll
[2012-04-04 20:38:10 -0400] hoover_damm: ultra tight on security
[2012-04-04 20:38:22 -0400] hoover_damm: I cannot call them up and impersonate my client
[2012-04-04 20:38:48 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm not authorized, so that's why I can't
[2012-04-04 20:39:04 -0400] hoover_damm: unlike some managed hosting companies i've worked with
[2012-04-04 20:42:28 -0400] roidrage: all i have is a traceroute, so that's what they'll get ;)
[2012-04-04 20:43:29 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, ping to show it fails, traceroute to show the fail in a ticket
[2012-04-04 20:43:38 -0400] hoover_damm: and good luck
[2012-04-04 20:43:52 -0400] roidrage: didn't need a ticket ;)
[2012-04-04 20:44:02 -0400] hoover_damm: you still do
[2012-04-04 20:44:12 -0400] hoover_damm: did they tell you otherwise on twitter?
[2012-04-04 20:44:32 -0400] hoover_damm: Nothing at the moment. Can you please create a ticket in your control panel and paste a traceroute?
[2012-04-04 20:44:38 -0400] hoover_damm: then you responded, then nada
[2012-04-04 20:44:45 -0400] roidrage: nope, not nada
[2012-04-04 20:44:48 -0400] hoover_damm: hrm, weird
[2012-04-04 20:44:51 -0400] hoover_damm: they replied badly
[2012-04-04 20:45:02 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, i'm wrong you don't need a ticket
[2012-04-04 20:45:03 -0400] roidrage: they replied, so i don't care. there's not much i can do
[2012-04-04 20:45:04 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, you lucky sob
[2012-04-04 20:45:11 -0400] roidrage: i don't have an account anyway
