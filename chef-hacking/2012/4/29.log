[2012-04-29 01:22:01 -0400] cwj: so i tried to deploy one of my stacks on 0.10.10 beta and it seems like something has changed that is modifying the behavior of the python_pip LWRP
[2012-04-29 01:24:19 -0400] hoover_damn: more deets?
[2012-04-29 01:24:48 -0400] cwj: i have chef pip install some stuff from a url instead of pypi. under 0.10.8 this works, but, because its name is the url when its installed and the provider fails to find the url in the output of pip freeze the provider cant see that its installed , so it gets installed every time.
[2012-04-29 01:25:01 -0400] cwj: that behavior has been acceptable for now
[2012-04-29 01:25:12 -0400] cwj: but under 0.10.10 it seems that the install fails when i use a url
[2012-04-29 01:25:23 -0400] hoover_damn: strange
[2012-04-29 01:26:13 -0400] hoover_damn: -l debug?
[2012-04-29 01:26:18 -0400] hoover_damn: with some output?
[2012-04-29 01:26:45 -0400] cwj: i will reproduce it and open a ticket but i am wondering if thats a chef bug or a cookbook bug
[2012-04-29 01:26:58 -0400] hoover_damn: without more details, *shrug*
[2012-04-29 01:27:08 -0400] cwj: i guess it should be tracked as a regression for chef anyway
[2012-04-29 01:27:18 -0400] hoover_damn: yep
[2012-04-29 01:27:23 -0400] hoover_damn: make sure you have the latest version of the python cookbook
[2012-04-29 01:28:06 -0400] cwj: sure
[2012-04-29 11:27:56 -0400] laurent\: btm: can you merge the fix for OHAI-362 please ?
