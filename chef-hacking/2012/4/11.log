[2012-04-11 00:44:08 -0400] jtimberman: btm, not sure why but i'm getting a bunch of these with 0.10.10.beta.1 installed under an omnibus: DEBUG: Platform ubuntu not found, using all defaults. (Unsupported platform?)
[2012-04-11 00:56:03 -0400] btm: hrm, don't know. I'll look tomorrow. it's 9pm ET
[2012-04-11 00:59:09 -0400] jtimberman: btm: orite :D
[2012-04-11 00:59:13 -0400] jtimberman: i'm debuggering now
[2012-04-11 13:48:36 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Was thinking on OHAI-267 this morning and wondering if the file injection technique suggested by RS might not be the best approach for the time being.
[2012-04-11 13:50:22 -0400] StormSilver: btm: I got bit by it yesterday with a plain ol' RS cloud server that didn't match the MAC address detection.
[2012-04-11 14:03:14 -0400] mattray: StormSilver: I'm testing on their new beta, I'll poke around and see if anything looks useful
[2012-04-11 14:03:29 -0400] mattray: StormSilver: if you're interested, I'm actively hacking on knife-rackspace and fog to support it
[2012-04-11 14:03:42 -0400] StormSilver: mattray: To support what?
[2012-04-11 14:03:52 -0400] mattray: Rackspace Cloud Servers beta
[2012-04-11 14:04:19 -0400] mattray: their OpenStack-based stuff
[2012-04-11 14:04:45 -0400] mattray: it's quite different
[2012-04-11 14:04:56 -0400] StormSilver: orly?
[2012-04-11 14:04:56 -0400] mattray: at least, API wise
[2012-04-11 14:05:02 -0400] StormSilver: Oh, good. :/
[2012-04-11 14:05:19 -0400] mattray: well, it's at least based off OpenStack, so similar to knife-openstack and knife-hp
[2012-04-11 14:05:40 -0400] mattray: there's definitely some overlap that could be refactored out of the 3
[2012-04-11 14:05:45 -0400] mattray: at least at the fog level
[2012-04-11 14:05:52 -0400] StormSilver: Interesting.
[2012-04-11 14:05:56 -0400] StormSilver: I missed that news
[2012-04-11 14:06:10 -0400] StormSilver: So it looks like they will be replacing their whole infrastructure?
[2012-04-11 14:06:14 -0400] mattray: yup
[2012-04-11 14:06:17 -0400] mattray: slowly
[2012-04-11 14:06:22 -0400] StormSilver: Sure. Still crazy.
[2012-04-11 14:06:23 -0400] mattray: like they did with slicehost
[2012-04-11 14:06:25 -0400] StormSilver: What a project.
[2012-04-11 14:07:06 -0400] StormSilver: So since this is going on, is OHAI-267 sort of on-hold?
[2012-04-11 14:07:07 -0400] mattray: I'm working on a demo for it right now, so if you're all up on RS stuff, I'll be happy to share
[2012-04-11 14:07:22 -0400] StormSilver: mattray: Nah, I'm building the infra now.
[2012-04-11 14:07:24 -0400] mattray: I haven't talked with btm specifically about that
[2012-04-11 14:07:44 -0400] mattray: but like I said, it may
[2012-04-11 14:07:51 -0400] StormSilver: I mean, it would make sense.
[2012-04-11 14:08:08 -0400] mattray: not sure how I'm going to make knife-rackspace play well with both APIs, since I expect they'll both be live at the same time for production
[2012-04-11 14:08:10 -0400] StormSilver: Which would make the feasibility of something like the file injection technique higher
[2012-04-11 14:08:23 -0400] StormSilver: mattray: Yeah, you'll prolly have to see how RS plays that one out.
[2012-04-11 14:08:23 -0400] mattray: already doing file injection for the bootstrap
[2012-04-11 14:08:40 -0400] StormSilver: Really?? I looked a month ago and couldn't find it.
[2012-04-11 14:08:40 -0400] mattray: in progress, no support for keypairs yet
[2012-04-11 14:08:49 -0400] jtimberman: mattray: are we going to move the "official" hp cloud knife plugin to github.com/opscode from /mray at some point? :)
[2012-04-11 14:08:59 -0400] mattray: jtimberman: probably
[2012-04-11 14:09:26 -0400] mattray: jtimberman: they're moving to paid beta next month
[2012-04-11 14:09:46 -0400] mattray: so I'll probably take another whack at fixing outstanding issues with it, then move it to github/opscode
[2012-04-11 14:09:59 -0400] mattray: same with the knife-rackspace refactor
[2012-04-11 14:10:03 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-04-11 14:10:08 -0400] StormSilver: mattray: I was thinking if, from bootstrap, we just always automatically inject something at /etc/rscloud or similar, and then have the rackspace ohai plugin look for that file... not perfect, but it would work
[2012-04-11 14:10:16 -0400] mattray: jtimberman: apparently I'm the knife guy
[2012-04-11 14:10:24 -0400] jtimberman: mattray: rockin'! :D
[2012-04-11 14:10:36 -0400] mattray: StormSilver: agreed. I'll look into that
[2012-04-11 14:10:44 -0400] jtimberman: mattray: can you add other VCS support to the 'cookbook site install' plugin while you're at it?
[2012-04-11 14:10:52 -0400] mattray: jtimberman: paint my fence
[2012-04-11 14:11:10 -0400] StormSilver: Plus it gives you the ability to touch /etc/rscloud if for some reason it's not working but you know for a fact you are on RS cloud
[2012-04-11 14:11:10 -0400] StormSilver: (or want the rackspace ohai plugin to work)
[2012-04-11 14:11:44 -0400] jtimberman: mattray: that's my fence!
[2012-04-11 14:11:47 -0400] jtimberman: you paint it!
[2012-04-11 14:12:42 -0400] StormSilver: mattray: I'd be glad to hack on it if you need me to, but if you've already piped support for file injection through bootstrap, you're most of the way there.
[2012-04-11 14:13:37 -0400] mattray: StormSilver: agreed. I'm working over here: https://github.com/mattray/knife-rackspace/tree/beta-api
[2012-04-11 14:13:46 -0400] mattray: I'm working on server create today
[2012-04-11 14:14:00 -0400] mattray: just got it working in fog, now I need to get creds on the box
[2012-04-11 14:15:20 -0400] StormSilver: Did fog not already support openstack?
[2012-04-11 14:15:58 -0400] StormSilver: (fog didn't exist when I started with chef, so I'm just now catching up with the rest of the world :D)
[2012-04-11 14:21:42 -0400] mattray: StormSilver: it's got patches in lots of places
[2012-04-11 14:21:53 -0400] mattray: and used the ec2 API previously
[2012-04-11 14:22:10 -0400] mattray: knife-openstack used that API as well, I switched it to the OpenStackAPI
[2012-04-11 14:22:28 -0400] mattray: and testing against Diablo Keystone worked, but something broke with Essex
[2012-04-11 14:22:31 -0400] mattray: (of course)
[2012-04-11 14:22:47 -0400] mattray: HP has their own auth, Rackspace looks similar to keystone
[2012-04-11 14:23:00 -0400] StormSilver: Yikes
[2012-04-11 14:23:20 -0400] mattray: so it's a big ball of conflict. I've got a Fog session at the OpenStack Developer Summit next week. Gonna work on resolving conflict
[2012-04-11 14:40:18 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, hope you invite Geemus
[2012-04-11 14:40:52 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: I'm pretty sure he's aware of it.
[2012-04-11 14:41:12 -0400] hoover_damm: rarely works out that way
[2012-04-11 14:41:26 -0400] mattray: does he run the @fog twitter account?
[2012-04-11 14:41:29 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, I say that as we only know what he can know
[2012-04-11 14:41:36 -0400] hoover_damm: sometimes we miss
[2012-04-11 14:41:37 -0400] hoover_damm: and yes
[2012-04-11 14:41:38 -0400] hoover_damm: i think
[2012-04-11 14:41:47 -0400] mattray: he's retweeted my calls for folks
[2012-04-11 14:41:50 -0400] mattray: to show up
[2012-04-11 14:42:24 -0400] hoover_damm: this honestly drives down the point of deltacloud
[2012-04-11 14:42:35 -0400] hoover_damm: and accepting deltacloud as your provisioning point
[2012-04-11 14:42:39 -0400] hoover_damm: and stop mucking with different api's
[2012-04-11 14:43:04 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: yup
[2012-04-11 14:43:19 -0400] hoover_damm: that was the original idea of fog was make a multi-cloud library that uses the same functionality almost model it
[2012-04-11 14:43:23 -0400] hoover_damm: and exploit it as an EY product
[2012-04-11 14:43:44 -0400] hoover_damm: they did the last part more as an open source product :) it's given them great fame and lots of confusion
[2012-04-11 14:44:14 -0400] hoover_damm: but even I saw the point of Deltacloud... it's so tiresome to care about my cloud api's
[2012-04-11 14:44:26 -0400] hoover_damm: and rackspace's api isn't that fast
[2012-04-11 14:44:36 -0400] hoover_damm: that's honestly the biggest issue for me is bootup speed of instances
[2012-04-11 14:44:54 -0400] hoover_damm: I thought when I beta tested HP Cloud their scheduler was slow... (it was) and then I moved over to rackspace and it's like oh hum
[2012-04-11 14:45:02 -0400] hoover_damm: 5 minutes to wait for the scheduler? okay go play hackeysack
[2012-04-11 14:45:31 -0400] hoover_damm: you get hella spoiled at the 30-38second spinup time of ec2
[2012-04-11 14:46:08 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: I believe RS is addressing that
[2012-04-11 14:46:18 -0400] mattray: but I agree with the theory of deltacloud
[2012-04-11 14:46:19 -0400] hoover_damm: it's the scheduler of openstack no?
[2012-04-11 14:46:28 -0400] mattray: custom scheduler undoubtedly
[2012-04-11 14:46:28 -0400] hoover_damm: I totally get that it's partially the scheduler
[2012-04-11 14:46:31 -0400] jtimberman: i'm sure hp has modified theirs?
[2012-04-11 14:46:33 -0400] hoover_damm: and they cannot fix it overnight
[2012-04-11 14:46:41 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, of course
[2012-04-11 14:46:46 -0400] hoover_damm: it has to provision other bits
[2012-04-11 14:47:03 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, scheduler calls out to all the points of provisioning... it's nothing but a big eventloop i bet
[2012-04-11 14:47:09 -0400] hoover_damm: in a big token ring topology
[2012-04-11 14:47:28 -0400] mattray: yeah, lots of scheduler implementations out there for OpenStack
[2012-04-11 14:47:45 -0400] hoover_damm: so it isn't really anything but the provisioners its' calling out to
[2012-04-11 14:47:49 -0400] hoover_damm: and their timelyness
[2012-04-11 14:47:59 -0400] hoover_damm: it might take 3 minutes to scrape up a vm running
[2012-04-11 14:48:15 -0400] hoover_damm: doubt it, but it's a lot more then just a kvm exec :)
[2012-04-11 14:48:44 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, perhaps we need a knife-deltacloud plugin to help move that movement
[2012-04-11 14:48:47 -0400] hoover_damm: and a set of cookbooks
[2012-04-11 14:49:03 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: I'd welcome that, just not sure people want to run the middleware
[2012-04-11 14:49:10 -0400] mattray: but I agree
[2012-04-11 14:49:16 -0400] mattray: it would be nice to have as an option
[2012-04-11 14:49:20 -0400] hoover_damm: doubt it
[2012-04-11 14:49:27 -0400] hoover_damm: but if it could give them the ability to write 1 class of code
[2012-04-11 14:49:36 -0400] hoover_damm: they should not care
[2012-04-11 14:49:37 -0400] mattray: yeah, chef don't care :)
[2012-04-11 14:49:50 -0400] hoover_damm: but these guys shouldn't care about couchdb or solr or rabbitmq imo either
[2012-04-11 14:49:53 -0400] hoover_damm: and they do
[2012-04-11 14:51:27 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: I listened to the DeltaCloud FLOSS Weekly episode, it sounded kinda immature still
[2012-04-11 14:51:50 -0400] mattray: EC2 and VMware were well covered
[2012-04-11 14:52:31 -0400] hoover_damm: naturally
[2012-04-11 14:52:39 -0400] mattray: I think it would make sense to have a knife-deltacloud for that day when more stuff is available
[2012-04-11 14:52:45 -0400] mattray: so you'd have that as yet another option
[2012-04-11 14:52:50 -0400] hoover_damm: nah, that should be a good start actually
[2012-04-11 14:52:54 -0400] hoover_damm: because if it has good vmware ability
[2012-04-11 14:52:57 -0400] hoover_damm: that becomes a +1
[2012-04-11 14:53:04 -0400] hoover_damm: you added something to the box that didn't exist before
[2012-04-11 14:53:35 -0400] hoover_damm: provision your vmware esx server from knife? check!
[2012-04-11 14:53:47 -0400] mattray: true
[2012-04-11 16:28:49 -0400] btm: StormSilver: I'm open to a file based patch for OHAI-267. It's not ideal, but would work when we're creating the instances. I would expect some thought to go into what file it creates and its content though.
[2012-04-11 16:29:35 -0400] jtimberman: what if someone creates an instance with something besides the knife plugin?
[2012-04-11 16:31:27 -0400] btm: jtimberman: they either create said file themselves, or they could buy Rackspace and issue a stockholder demand to have them create a reasonable method for determining if you're on their cloud or not.
[2012-04-11 16:32:06 -0400] btm: "use knife to create your instances" is better than "sucks, right?"
[2012-04-11 16:32:10 -0400] holoway: hehehe
[2012-04-11 16:34:13 -0400] jtimberman: ha!
[2012-04-11 16:34:17 -0400] btm: we've got the same problem on Amazon VPC in OHAI-310 and unfortunately the cloud providers tend to provide such a commodity that we can't tell them apart. If the trend is for cloud providers to not consider this important, we're going to have to manage the wilds alone.
[2012-04-11 16:34:38 -0400] btm: that said, we have been leaning on them whenever we can to be better about this.
[2012-04-11 16:35:33 -0400] jtimberman: Totally
[2012-04-11 16:36:04 -0400] jtimberman: Seems reasonable - "If you don't create this instance with Knife, then Chef wouldn't know about it"
[2012-04-11 16:40:07 -0400] btm: I think my official line would be, "If the cloud provider does not provide identifying information, you should populate /etc/cloud. The following knife plugins will do this for you when used to create new instances: "
[2012-04-11 16:40:42 -0400] btm: "P.S. the list of clouds that are self-interested jerks are: "
[2012-04-11 16:40:44 -0400] btm: ;)
[2012-04-11 16:40:56 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, can we use the detection of meta-data?
[2012-04-11 16:41:01 -0400] hoover_damn: as a method of determing which cloud?
[2012-04-11 16:41:13 -0400] hoover_damn: if ec2-like... check meta-data... is it ec2? is it foobar?
[2012-04-11 16:41:14 -0400] btm: hoover_damn: where is the metadata?
[2012-04-11 16:41:28 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, sigh sadly usually a remote host...
[2012-04-11 16:41:34 -0400] c_t: if I worked at a cloud provider, I'd try to arrange the servers so they were shaped kinda like a sheep
[2012-04-11 16:41:35 -0400] btm: hoover_damn: the problem with ec2 metadata is you have to make a network call to look it up.
[2012-04-11 16:42:07 -0400] hoover_damn: http://169.254.169.254/
[2012-04-11 16:42:11 -0400] hoover_damn: should be valid inside the instance
[2012-04-11 16:42:33 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, and honestly this is important
[2012-04-11 16:42:35 -0400] btm: hoover_damn: which means that all non-ec2 hosts incur an ohai delay of whatever the timeout is on that call. We've seen that making that timeout too short can cause ec2 instances to identify otherwise when under load or on micro instances.
[2012-04-11 16:42:41 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, the cloud providers are just shiznizzles
[2012-04-11 16:42:54 -0400] hoover_damn: can we make them do dmi?
[2012-04-11 16:43:00 -0400] hoover_damn: and we can just dmidecode who they are?
[2012-04-11 16:43:22 -0400] hoover_damn: because honestly calling out to some remote host or looking for arp is unrealistic
[2012-04-11 16:43:27 -0400] btm: hoover_damn: we can ask them to do dmi. unfortunately we have not had success at making them do dmi.
[2012-04-11 16:43:46 -0400] btm: (thus my comment about buying all their stock)
[2012-04-11 16:43:48 -0400] hoover_damn: right, but I think as a standard if we can push it into openstack
[2012-04-11 16:43:57 -0400] hoover_damn: we can push it into another product easier
[2012-04-11 16:44:01 -0400] hoover_damn: horrible pattern that sadly works
[2012-04-11 16:44:55 -0400] hoover_damn: stock doesn't work
[2012-04-11 16:45:04 -0400] btm: hoover_damn: generally virtualization gets it right. it's sort of shocking to me that DMI isn't obvious to cloud providers.
[2012-04-11 16:45:39 -0400] hoover_damn: no actually it isn't, it's using something that exists already... why would you do that?
[2012-04-11 16:45:56 -0400] hoover_damn: it seems everything about cloud providers is creating a 'elastic x'
[2012-04-11 16:46:29 -0400] hoover_damn: that would mean they would need to send identity information in DMI and zomg maybe it couldn't change?
[2012-04-11 16:46:42 -0400] hoover_damn: I mean it could if you stopped it, modified, started it back up
[2012-04-11 16:46:53 -0400] hoover_damn: I really don't understand the hesitation of DMI
[2012-04-11 16:47:00 -0400] hoover_damn: seems too easy of a choice to ignore
[2012-04-11 17:03:41 -0400] hoover_damn: huh
[2012-04-11 17:03:47 -0400] hoover_damn: why does this rackspace instance only have 1 nic?
[2012-04-11 17:04:02 -0400] StormSilver: ??
[2012-04-11 17:04:07 -0400] StormSilver: That's... weird!
[2012-04-11 17:04:40 -0400] hoover_damn: totally
[2012-04-11 17:04:45 -0400] hoover_damn: get this
[2012-04-11 17:04:53 -0400] hoover_damn: ? (209.20.86.1) at 00:15:17:70:1b:1e [ether] on eth0
[2012-04-11 17:04:58 -0400] hoover_damn: totally new rackspace mac
[2012-04-11 17:05:13 -0400] hoover_damn: gonna trash this instance and try again but w t f
[2012-04-11 17:05:27 -0400] hoover_damn: hate charging my client for a w t f
[2012-04-11 17:06:36 -0400] btm: So the old mac for the gateway was Cisco HSRP not a Rackspace feature. Rackspace has told us that's going away.
[2012-04-11 17:08:27 -0400] StormSilver: Yeah, I created a new instance yesterday that had what looked like a normal, unique MAC
[2012-04-11 17:08:47 -0400] hoover_damn: or gone away
[2012-04-11 17:09:03 -0400] StormSilver: No, I had two NICs like normal... don't know what happened to yours
[2012-04-11 17:09:15 -0400] hoover_damn: 4gig instance, 160gig disk
[2012-04-11 17:09:20 -0400] hoover_damn: ip range 209.20.86.x
[2012-04-11 17:09:33 -0400] hoover_damn: yeah i didn't have the rs kernel
[2012-04-11 17:09:43 -0400] hoover_damn: had to hack the rackspace plugin to stop caring about the kernel even
[2012-04-11 17:09:53 -0400] hoover_damn: so perhaps this image on this new dc is not right?
[2012-04-11 17:10:13 -0400] hoover_damn: i'll have to file a ticket here shortly if that's the case and the new one lacks the eth1 again
[2012-04-11 17:10:52 -0400] btm: hoover_damn: make sure you mention OHAI-267 and emphasize the importance of them trying harder.
[2012-04-11 17:10:54 -0400] StormSilver: Yeah, that's crazy
[2012-04-11 17:10:59 -0400] hoover_damn: clouds are a commodity you told us to be flexible... so we'll be flexible and we can leave
[2012-04-11 17:11:12 -0400] StormSilver: heh
[2012-04-11 17:11:38 -0400] StormSilver: Well mattray mentioned that he's using their new beta servers (based on openstack)
[2012-04-11 17:11:46 -0400] StormSilver: He didn't know if that would solve our problem for us
[2012-04-11 17:12:47 -0400] StormSilver: It seems like the rackspace detection is failing more and more often for more and more people... so even a stopgap solution like the file existence seems like a necessary evil
[2012-04-11 17:13:29 -0400] btm: "on 4/10/2012 before noon, I was able to build with image 49 and NOT experience this issue."
[2012-04-11 17:13:48 -0400] btm: It sounds like RS has changed datacenters.
[2012-04-11 17:14:24 -0400] hoover_damn: the problem is when the stopgaps cause more problems
[2012-04-11 17:14:27 -0400] hoover_damn: then they solve
[2012-04-11 17:14:44 -0400] hoover_damn: we must be mindful and vigil about loose monkeypatches to solve a IaaS's pain
[2012-04-11 17:15:04 -0400] StormSilver: hoover_damn: True, and it's hard to know with something as low-level and essential as rackspace detection what other problems we might cause
[2012-04-11 17:15:12 -0400] StormSilver: laaS?
[2012-04-11 17:16:03 -0400] StormSilver: yeah, I was reading somewhere that they have a DFW2 datacenter now
[2012-04-11 17:17:14 -0400] hoover_damn: i'm guessing this is OFW2
[2012-04-11 17:17:37 -0400] StormSilver: btm: I like the extensibility of populating /etc/cloud with a JSON blob that tells you exciting things about your cloud
[2012-04-11 17:17:39 -0400] hoover_damn: time to actually login to the panel and file a ticket
[2012-04-11 17:17:42 -0400] hoover_damn: meh
[2012-04-11 17:18:01 -0400] StormSilver: btm: But I also like the ease of "touch /etc/cloud-rs"
[2012-04-11 17:18:14 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Populating your own /etc/cloud with a JSON blob is much harder
[2012-04-11 17:19:31 -0400] StormSilver: Because if all you have to do is touch a file to get the functionality you want, the case of someone not creating their instance thru a knife plugin becomes much less unwieldy
[2012-04-11 17:19:41 -0400] hoover_damn: it shows ORD1
[2012-04-11 17:19:46 -0400] hoover_damn: but clearly not the right image
[2012-04-11 17:20:44 -0400] btm: StormSilver: echo rackspace > /etc/cloud?
[2012-04-11 17:21:00 -0400] btm: StormSilver: I don't know, but we shouldn't just go with the easiest solution because it is easy.
[2012-04-11 17:21:18 -0400] StormSilver: btm: For sure. Thinking through it is ++good
[2012-04-11 17:22:37 -0400] StormSilver: Just want to make sure it's easy to fix it yourself if you need to... like with the example you just gave. I like that.
[2012-04-11 17:23:49 -0400] StormSilver: Okay guys. How about this. First, we install ferret...
[2012-04-11 18:01:37 -0400] hoover_damn: turns out it's a problem with rackspace and a huddle that we are gettting stuck n
[2012-04-11 18:07:10 -0400] StormSilver: hoover_damn: That's good
[2012-04-11 18:41:15 -0400] hoover_damn: not really
[2012-04-11 18:41:21 -0400] hoover_damn: they can't fix it so i'm waiting for a callback
[2012-04-11 18:41:27 -0400] hoover_damn: customer can't provision instances
[2012-04-11 18:44:53 -0400] StormSilver: hoover_damn: Right, but better than "oh yeah, we changed how we're doing that... only one interface now"
[2012-04-11 18:45:57 -0400] hoover_damn: god i hope not
[2012-04-11 18:46:07 -0400] hoover_damn: that would be a mess
[2012-04-11 18:46:36 -0400] hoover_damn: i wish ec2 had multiple nic's
[2012-04-11 18:46:45 -0400] hoover_damn: no i don't care about vpc please don't mention it
[2012-04-11 18:50:07 -0400] StormSilver: hoover_damn: So... VPC then? :D
[2012-04-11 18:50:33 -0400] hoover_damn: nope
[2012-04-11 18:50:35 -0400] hoover_damn: never
[2012-04-11 18:50:45 -0400] hoover_damn: vpc has enough spof's that i will giggle
[2012-04-11 18:50:47 -0400] hoover_damn: and heckle
[2012-04-11 18:51:16 -0400] StormSilver: When you say VPC you mean Amazon Virtual Private Cloud?
[2012-04-11 18:51:20 -0400] hoover_damn: yep
[2012-04-11 18:51:29 -0400] StormSilver: Never tried it.
[2012-04-11 18:51:38 -0400] StormSilver: Sounds like I never will. :)
[2012-04-11 18:51:57 -0400] hoover_damn: to have the multi network vpc requires a nat instance
[2012-04-11 18:52:07 -0400] hoover_damn: there is no HA around the NAT instance
[2012-04-11 18:52:11 -0400] hoover_damn: completely ruins it for me
[2012-04-11 18:52:45 -0400] hoover_damn: it's like great a nat instance that's a regular ec2 instance with no ha... and all my traffic goes through it?
[2012-04-11 18:52:47 -0400] hoover_damn: *gulp*
[2012-04-11 20:10:21 -0400] github-bawt: [knife-ec2] mattray pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/lGmP-Q
[2012-04-11 20:10:21 -0400] github-bawt: [knife-ec2/master] switch to uneven_columns_across for prettier output - mattray
[2012-04-11 20:10:21 -0400] github-bawt: [knife-ec2/master] Merge branch 'KNIFE_EC2-53' - mattray
[2012-04-11 20:15:52 -0400] StormSilver: So, being a total rspec newb, what's the best way to test file operations?
[2012-04-11 20:16:24 -0400] StormSilver: The test is simple so I think I could just mock the .exist? method and the like, but.
[2012-04-11 20:16:34 -0400] holoway: StormSilver: what are you trying to test?
[2012-04-11 20:17:14 -0400] StormSilver: holoway: An ohai plugin that looks at the existence and contents of a file
[2012-04-11 20:18:41 -0400] StormSilver: FakeFS looks neat but I don't want to introduce new dependencies
[2012-04-11 20:20:33 -0400] StormSilver: And I didn't know if it was acceptable to use actual File methods to actually modify the filesystem
[2012-04-11 20:20:49 -0400] holoway: StormSilver: yeah, I would just mock it
[2012-04-11 20:20:49 -0400] btm: StormSilver: we usually stub File.
[2012-04-11 20:20:50 -0400] holoway: sadly
[2012-04-11 20:21:14 -0400] StormSilver: Okay
[2012-04-11 20:21:15 -0400] StormSilver: Thanks guys
[2012-04-11 20:22:58 -0400] btm: StormSilver: in future-land, we want tests that will be run against each platform unmocked/unstubbed. Unfortunately future-land is in the future still.
[2012-04-11 20:23:58 -0400] StormSilver: btm: WTF future-land? Y U IN FUTUR STILL.
[2012-04-11 20:24:47 -0400] jtimberman: haha
[2012-04-11 20:26:58 -0400] btm: Time-travel: The paradox of moving forward in time, but never being able to reach the future.
[2012-04-11 20:27:38 -0400] StormSilver: We should engineer a way around that.
[2012-04-11 20:27:50 -0400] StormSilver: Cause it's a real PITA.
[2012-04-11 21:14:39 -0400] StormSilver: Would some people like to quickly look at this in regards to OHAI-267 and check for obvious signs of idiocy/brokenness/unacceptability?
[2012-04-11 21:14:42 -0400] StormSilver: https://github.com/stormsilver/ohai/compare/OHAI-267
[2012-04-11 21:15:33 -0400] StormSilver: btm: in particular ^
[2012-04-11 21:20:36 -0400] matthewvermaak: any opinions on loadbalancer vs load balancer, particularily in context of knife commands?
[2012-04-11 21:22:15 -0400] matthewvermaak: seems like the convention leans towards load balancer (convention established by data bag that is) :0)
[2012-04-11 21:22:32 -0400] StormSilver: matthewvermaak: Yes, I would agree
[2012-04-11 21:32:31 -0400] mattray: matthewvermaak: data_bag also works
[2012-04-11 21:34:47 -0400] matthewvermaak: mattray in the knife command?
[2012-04-11 21:35:07 -0400] mattray: yeah, I think both variants work
[2012-04-11 21:35:19 -0400] mattray: knife data bag  and knife data_bag
[2012-04-11 21:35:45 -0400] matthewvermaak: yup your right
[2012-04-11 21:36:41 -0400] matthewvermaak: hmmm, at that apparently comes from somewhere higher in the chain
[2012-04-11 21:36:51 -0400] matthewvermaak: the custom commands im making for load balancer, have gained load_balancer
[2012-04-11 21:36:52 -0400] matthewvermaak: :0)
[2012-04-11 21:38:33 -0400] matthewvermaak: ah ha, and further nuggets of knowledge, you can underscore all the spaces after knife...
[2012-04-11 21:38:44 -0400] matthewvermaak: gsubin me thinks
