[2012-04-02 07:08:13 -0400] Cope: hoover_damm: most interesting
[2012-04-02 13:58:19 -0400] hoover_damm: Cope, that's kinda how I felt but I figured there was more to expand on chef-mode
[2012-04-02 13:58:29 -0400] hoover_damm: Cope, i'm not personally clear on what exactly i'd expose on chef-mode
[2012-04-02 14:38:41 -0400] pom_: so, my pressing question: is hosted chef already running on erlang/mysql? :)
[2012-04-02 14:40:35 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, I guess you were not at the summit to know that answer?
[2012-04-02 14:40:51 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, the opscode answer I heard was, they are replacing bits and pices one by one
[2012-04-02 14:40:55 -0400] roidrage: nice
[2012-04-02 14:41:09 -0400] roidrage: and no, i wasn't at the summit, which should've been pretty obvious, as you haven't met me there, no? :)
[2012-04-02 14:41:18 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, so certain parts of hosted Chef are the there
[2012-04-02 14:41:19 -0400] hoover_damm: or getting there
[2012-04-02 14:41:40 -0400] hoover_damm: i think their goal is mysql by .14? or by .12?
[2012-04-02 14:41:48 -0400] hoover_damm: those numbers mean nothing to me
[2012-04-02 14:41:56 -0400] roidrage: chef 1.0 in 2020!
[2012-04-02 14:42:08 -0400] hoover_damm: eh 1.0 is a state of stability now adays
[2012-04-02 14:42:14 -0400] hoover_damm: 1.0 should be .10
[2012-04-02 14:42:37 -0400] hoover_damm: I'm prolly one of the idiots who doesn't agree with the whole leaving of couchdb/etc
[2012-04-02 14:42:40 -0400] hoover_damm: but i'm prolly wrong
[2012-04-02 14:42:55 -0400] roidrage: you are
[2012-04-02 14:50:53 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: API migration is still in progress.
[2012-04-02 14:51:09 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: I know search and nodes are converted, but I don't know what else yet.
[2012-04-02 14:53:51 -0400] roidrage: cool
[2012-04-02 14:53:56 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: runit.
[2012-04-02 14:53:57 -0400] jtimberman: btw
[2012-04-02 14:53:59 -0400] jtimberman: is awesome.
[2012-04-02 14:54:02 -0400] jtimberman: thats why you should use it!
[2012-04-02 14:54:25 -0400] jtimberman: You should use the thing that solves the problem. I can tell you why I like runit if you want to hear it.
[2012-04-02 14:54:50 -0400] roidrage: well, that's all i really want to know ;)
[2012-04-02 14:55:01 -0400] roidrage: just telling me "use runit" doesn't answer the question of the why for me
[2012-04-02 14:55:28 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, I'm not
[2012-04-02 14:55:34 -0400] roidrage: you are
[2012-04-02 14:55:45 -0400] hoover_damm: NOT NOT NOT WRONG
[2012-04-02 14:56:00 -0400] hoover_damm: cannot assert right or wrong
[2012-04-02 14:56:08 -0400] hoover_damm: afk
[2012-04-02 14:58:51 -0400] roidrage: you are
[2012-04-02 14:58:58 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: Why I use runit: it is very simple to get it managing daemons. you create a directory, link it to the right place and it runs the "run" script to start the daemon and keeps it running in the foreground. the logging is all captured and automatically rotated. it has a lot of built in control for the process, including the chpst utility, "env" and "control" directories.
[2012-04-02 14:58:58 -0400] roidrage: can't be right all the time, dude
[2012-04-02 14:59:01 -0400] roidrage: true story
[2012-04-02 14:59:14 -0400] roidrage: okay, that sounds good
[2012-04-02 14:59:24 -0400] roidrage: and that's actually not even obvious from the stupid runit website
[2012-04-02 14:59:41 -0400] jtimberman: it also gives you a simple semantic to get "lsb compatible" functionality, so it will play nice with other tools like the "service" command.
[2012-04-02 15:00:00 -0400] jtimberman: (whereby you link /usr/sbin/sv to /etc/init.d/SERVICENAME
[2012-04-02 15:00:39 -0400] roidrage: cool
[2012-04-02 15:00:42 -0400] roidrage: that sounds nice
[2012-04-02 15:00:50 -0400] roidrage: actually sounds like pretty much what i need :)
[2012-04-02 15:00:55 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-04-02 15:00:59 -0400] roidrage: pretty much what my little forkrage library does
[2012-04-02 15:01:12 -0400] jtimberman: its pretty much what every single service supervision software does.
[2012-04-02 15:01:26 -0400] jtimberman: or, the goal thereof.
[2012-04-02 15:01:42 -0400] jtimberman: http://smarden.org/runit/benefits.html
[2012-04-02 15:02:02 -0400] roidrage: well, i'd still add monit to the mix for alerting, but yeah
[2012-04-02 15:02:32 -0400] jtimberman: sure :)
[2012-04-02 15:09:43 -0400] roidrage: stupid virtualbox
[2012-04-02 15:19:30 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, you can be right all the time.  But at the same time you are always wrong
[2012-04-02 15:19:56 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, runit is a good alternative to monit
[2012-04-02 15:20:02 -0400] roidrage: i'm never right
[2012-04-02 15:20:09 -0400] hoover_damm: it really doesn't do cpu or memory restarting
[2012-04-02 15:20:14 -0400] hoover_damm: so find a better way to do that
[2012-04-02 15:20:18 -0400] roidrage: i don't see it as an alternative, rather as a compliment for my current requirement
[2012-04-02 15:20:31 -0400] hoover_damm: I consider bluepill+runit a alternative
[2012-04-02 15:20:37 -0400] hoover_damm: that solves the package
[2012-04-02 15:20:38 -0400] roidrage: good on ya, bro
[2012-04-02 15:20:50 -0400] roidrage: me and monit, we get along just fine
[2012-04-02 15:21:01 -0400] hoover_damm: now for the provisioning problem
[2012-04-02 15:21:06 -0400] roidrage: one new tool at a time
[2012-04-02 15:21:21 -0400] jtimberman: you can use chpst to limit the memory usage.
[2012-04-02 15:21:29 -0400] roidrage: jtimberman: thanks for the runit input
[2012-04-02 15:21:36 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: my pleasure.
[2012-04-02 15:21:36 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, we've discussed previously how stupid it is to use chpst to limit memory
[2012-04-02 15:21:42 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, even chef-client segfaults on that :)
[2012-04-02 15:21:43 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damm: ok
[2012-04-02 15:21:46 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, irclogs from the beginning
[2012-04-02 15:21:48 -0400] roidrage: i'm actually not up for that part, this is to supervise our travis worker which takes up almost all memory when added together
[2012-04-02 15:21:50 -0400] roidrage: and it should
[2012-04-02 15:21:57 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, basically proper behavior
[2012-04-02 15:22:07 -0400] jtimberman: i said you *can* use it.
[2012-04-02 15:22:08 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, chpst says wait you want > 256meg of ram? no way! abort!
[2012-04-02 15:22:12 -0400] jtimberman: I didn't make a recommendation to do so.
[2012-04-02 15:22:14 -0400] hoover_damm: no
[2012-04-02 15:22:21 -0400] hoover_damm: monit solves a different problem then chpst provides
[2012-04-02 15:22:32 -0400] hoover_damm: the problem i'm referring to is the leaking bloat of crappy code
[2012-04-02 15:22:44 -0400] hoover_damm: rails apps that bloat up 10megs of RSS per Request
[2012-04-02 15:22:58 -0400] hoover_damm: these are things that runit/chpst is not designed for
[2012-04-02 15:23:04 -0400] roidrage: yeah
[2012-04-02 15:23:20 -0400] hoover_damm: you don't want something to choke off your RSS during a http request
[2012-04-02 15:23:22 -0400] hoover_damm: and cause a segfault
[2012-04-02 15:23:24 -0400] hoover_damm: that's massively bad
[2012-04-02 15:23:59 -0400] hoover_damm: it's not just a ruby problem, but with Ruby it's a disease that starts with rails new ~/bob
[2012-04-02 15:24:09 -0400] hoover_damm: and only add's up the further you go
[2012-04-02 15:24:23 -0400] hoover_damm: use the JSON Gem and use Ruby? that's 150k allocations for you
[2012-04-02 15:24:31 -0400] hoover_damm: or was it 150k objects? /me forgets
[2012-04-02 15:24:48 -0400] hoover_damm: it's actually the #1 reason why chef-server has a scaling issue
[2012-04-02 15:25:08 -0400] roidrage: may look into bluepill eventually, but right now, monit does the trick just fine :)
[2012-04-02 15:25:09 -0400] hoover_damm: if you guys could replace some of your C Extensions for ones that didn't create excessive objects during init
[2012-04-02 15:25:14 -0400] hoover_damm: you could definetly help your GC problem
[2012-04-02 15:25:20 -0400] hoover_damm: 15% or more CPU time consistent on GC
[2012-04-02 15:25:21 -0400] hoover_damm: LOLZ
[2012-04-02 15:25:41 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, main difference with bluepill is you can use mustache
[2012-04-02 15:25:51 -0400] roidrage: {
[2012-04-02 15:25:57 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, so instead of writing a start script and a stop script... I just do kill -USR2 {{PID}}
[2012-04-02 15:26:04 -0400] roidrage: ah, nice
[2012-04-02 15:26:25 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/damm/chef-unicorn
[2012-04-02 15:27:17 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/damm/chef-unicorn/blob/master/templates/default/unicorn.pill.erb
[2012-04-02 15:27:54 -0400] hoover_damm: I won't bother with that horrible shell script I created at EY for controlling unicorn
[2012-04-02 15:27:58 -0400] hoover_damm: i'd rather just use bluepill
[2012-04-02 15:28:04 -0400] roidrage: gonna look into it. for now, me and monit will get along just fine
[2012-04-02 15:28:19 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm just saying it's an alternative that won't burn you too much
[2012-04-02 15:28:29 -0400] roidrage: well, i have to learn about it and get used to it
[2012-04-02 15:28:33 -0400] hoover_damm: monit does work, arguably in odd qualities
[2012-04-02 15:28:34 -0400] roidrage: that'll burn me right away ;)
[2012-04-02 15:28:42 -0400] hoover_damm: nah the DSL is super easy
[2012-04-02 15:28:47 -0400] roidrage: of course it is
[2012-04-02 15:28:51 -0400] roidrage: it's always super-easy
[2012-04-02 15:28:59 -0400] hoover_damm: for me
[2012-04-02 15:29:01 -0400] roidrage: but now i have monit running and don't really need to change it
[2012-04-02 15:29:05 -0400] hoover_damm: what's easy for me and what's easy for you
[2012-04-02 15:29:07 -0400] hoover_damm: is not always easy
[2012-04-02 15:29:08 -0400] roidrage: because you're a genius, and i'm stupid
[2012-04-02 15:29:16 -0400] hoover_damm: I'm not a genius
[2012-04-02 15:29:41 -0400] hoover_damm: I just have patiently learned and tried to build up enough of a rationale that I can deal with things
[2012-04-02 15:29:59 -0400] hoover_damm: and have enough confidence to know how to handle a situation
[2012-04-02 15:30:03 -0400] roidrage: sure
[2012-04-02 15:30:05 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm by no means a Genius
[2012-04-02 15:30:07 -0400] roidrage: and i'm the same with monit :)
[2012-04-02 15:30:18 -0400] hoover_damm: just another man trying to solve the problems, I've just decided to share my problems
[2012-04-02 15:30:25 -0400] hoover_damm: to see if that helps others solve their problems
[2012-04-02 15:30:32 -0400] hoover_damm: my solution won't work for anyone as is
[2012-04-02 15:30:38 -0400] hoover_damm: but if it can help them get a leg up
[2012-04-02 15:30:44 -0400] hoover_damm: sheet why not?
