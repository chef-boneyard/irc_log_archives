[2012-04-25 03:18:54 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/whyrun] Add whyrun to user provider, updated tests - Marc Paradise
[2012-04-25 03:49:17 -0400] sascha_d: question: if I write a require in an ohai plugin to require a second plugin, if that 2nd plugin is disabled in the client.rb, who wins?  The require or the disable?
[2012-04-25 04:01:03 -0400] fujin: hmm
[2012-04-25 04:01:20 -0400] fujin: the disable probably prevents the plugin from running even though it is required, since require is the standard code loading mechanism, no?
[2012-04-25 04:01:23 -0400] fujin: sascha_d: test it and see ;)
[2012-04-25 04:02:08 -0400] sascha_d: :)
[2012-04-25 04:02:47 -0400] sascha_d: I was just wondering if I needed to write an unless to query the disabled_plugins array or if I could just let the disabling function win
[2012-04-25 04:03:11 -0400] sascha_d: I'm trying to bust up the windows kernel plugin into two pieces to facilitate disabling the second piece
[2012-04-25 04:03:21 -0400] fujin: ah nice
[2012-04-25 04:03:23 -0400] fujin: reduce node data size?
[2012-04-25 04:03:28 -0400] fujin: are you ripping the drivers out?
[2012-04-25 04:03:36 -0400] sascha_d: yeah, it looks like it queries the entire device manaer
[2012-04-25 04:03:40 -0400] sascha_d: great way to pass the time
[2012-04-25 04:03:41 -0400] fujin: lolol
[2012-04-25 04:03:56 -0400] fujin: I can see how that would be useful for some people.
[2012-04-25 04:04:14 -0400] sascha_d: it's an enormous amount of what appears to be useless data and there have been complaints about how long ohai takes to complete on windows
[2012-04-25 04:06:17 -0400] sascha_d: I originally just made the data its own new-named plugin.  Then it occurred to me that people might actually be using the data and that I just borked it for them.  So now I'm trying to write a second sub-kernel plugin and include it with the main kernel

[2012-04-25 21:35:17 -0400] laurent\: ok, so i guess i need to add the same kind of test to my CHEF-2389-2 branch :)
[2012-04-25 21:49:42 -0400] laurent\: hmm no it's not ok yet, i'm starting to like the tests, it's really helping :)

[2012-04-25 22:33:08 -0400] laurent\: is there any windows user out there ? :)
[2012-04-25 22:52:12 -0400] juanje: btm: Thanks for the comment at the .length bug (CHEF-2744). I had misderstood the feature :-/ Now I understood it better, I found a simple and actual solution :-)
[2012-04-25 22:53:26 -0400] juanje: btm: the real problem was the order at the if stament...
[2012-04-25 23:03:25 -0400] laurent\: grrr ohai-347 needs to be resolved before the next ohai release
[2012-04-25 23:04:13 -0400] laurent\: just commented on ohai-322 :)
