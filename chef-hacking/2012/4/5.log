[2012-04-05 01:22:15 -0400] laurent\: procrastination, that's exactly what I've been doing today
[2012-04-05 01:28:12 -0400] hoover_damm: there's no cure for that.
[2012-04-05 14:58:45 -0400] roidrage: provisioning new boxes with chef <3 <3 <3
[2012-04-05 15:04:03 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: :D
[2012-04-05 15:04:15 -0400] StormSilver: roidrage: feels good man
[2012-04-05 15:04:57 -0400] roidrage: the moment of truth will be if my cookbooks still work properly on a clean box
[2012-04-05 15:05:50 -0400] StormSilver: That moment when you provision a clean box for the last time and your cookbooks actually work.
[2012-04-05 15:06:24 -0400] roidrage: i need to find a way to make them work proper on vagrant, maybe just not use the virtualbox cookbooks. the cookbooks set up virtualbox inside virtualbox ;)
[2012-04-05 15:09:01 -0400] StormSilver: Oh snapz, just saw the public IRC logs pages.
[2012-04-05 15:09:03 -0400] StormSilver: Who built those?
[2012-04-05 15:09:23 -0400] StormSilver: They are fancy.
[2012-04-05 15:10:53 -0400] jtimberman: StormSilver: I know coderanger worked on that. I don't remember who else.
[2012-04-05 15:12:14 -0400] atomic-penguin: So wiki down, or just me?
[2012-04-05 15:12:27 -0400] roidrage: works for me today ;)
[2012-04-05 15:12:54 -0400] atomic-penguin: weird

[2012-04-05 15:14:20 -0400] roidrage: dang it, should've supplied the runlist for bootstrap right away
[2012-04-05 15:14:35 -0400] roidrage: can i double-bootstrap? :)
[2012-04-05 15:14:42 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: sure
[2012-04-05 15:14:55 -0400] roidrage: gonna try that and run the chef-client cookbook while i'm at it
[2012-04-05 15:18:09 -0400] roidrage: \o/

[2012-04-05 15:49:15 -0400] hoover_damm: lnxchk, do you say totes in real life?
[2012-04-05 15:49:20 -0400] hoover_damm: like totally totes cute?
[2012-04-05 15:49:26 -0400] StormSilver: Haha
[2012-04-05 15:49:30 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damm: she does.
[2012-04-05 15:49:50 -0400] hoover_damm: lnxchk, jeff foxworthy fan?
[2012-04-05 15:50:02 -0400] lnxchk: hoover_damm not a chance
[2012-04-05 15:50:08 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, he had a good skit on a show about people doing that
[2012-04-05 15:50:12 -0400] hoover_damm: it was quite funny
[2012-04-05 15:50:55 -0400] hoover_damm: lnxchk, humor is humor.  I could care less that he's a redneck from the south that may have political views I may not share.
[2012-04-05 15:51:28 -0400] lnxchk: hoover_damm that's fine. i grew up in that sort of environment. there's nothing amusing to me about it.
[2012-04-05 15:52:14 -0400] jtimberman: i didn't grow up in that kind of environment, but i don't find it amusing.
[2012-04-05 16:01:42 -0400] roidrage: !merge: to the rescue! (for now)
[2012-04-05 16:02:25 -0400] c_t: I grew up around plenty of people like Jeff Foxworthy, but a more serious issue is that he's just not all that funny
[2012-04-05 16:20:35 -0400] hoover_damm: lnxchk, shrug it's a tv show trying to make fun of life
[2012-04-05 16:20:40 -0400] hoover_damm: I really don't see the problem
[2012-04-05 16:23:46 -0400] hoover_damm: even I overcare from time to time
[2012-04-05 16:23:52 -0400] hoover_damm: so i'm just trying to stop my over care itis

[2012-04-05 16:49:42 -0400] roidrage: rvm really can suck it
[2012-04-05 16:50:28 -0400] roidrage: next step: ditch rvm and use fpm to build packages
[2012-04-05 16:53:47 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, what do you need? ruby 1.9.3?
[2012-04-05 16:54:05 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, if you tell me you need 1.9.3p125 on Ubuntu
[2012-04-05 16:54:06 -0400] hoover_damm: heh
[2012-04-05 16:54:07 -0400] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-04-05 16:54:16 -0400] roidrage: i don't
[2012-04-05 16:54:26 -0400] hoover_damm: https://launchpad.net/~scott-likens/+archive/ppa
[2012-04-05 16:54:39 -0400] hoover_damm: wanted 1.9.3p125 for ocealot
[2012-04-05 16:54:45 -0400] hoover_damm: and i'm totally not doing the rvm thing
[2012-04-05 16:54:46 -0400] roidrage: since i installed rvm on this box chef-client keeps dying on me
[2012-04-05 16:54:53 -0400] hoover_damm: not shocked
[2012-04-05 16:54:55 -0400] hoover_damm: rvm implode
[2012-04-05 16:55:00 -0400] hoover_damm: make it go away
[2012-04-05 16:55:08 -0400] roidrage: that's such great advice
[2012-04-05 16:55:23 -0400] roidrage: all the existing cookbooks are built around rvm
[2012-04-05 16:55:55 -0400] hoover_damm: rvm's a broken pattern to me... it helps solve the problem in a way that doesn't work well for me long-term
[2012-04-05 16:56:12 -0400] roidrage: of course
[2012-04-05 16:56:18 -0400] roidrage: but that still doesn't solve my problem currently
[2012-04-05 16:56:27 -0400] roidrage: weird because this worked before :(
[2012-04-05 16:56:33 -0400] hoover_damm: so tell us how chef is dying with a gist or something
[2012-04-05 16:56:36 -0400] hoover_damm: so we can help
[2012-04-05 17:02:54 -0400] roidrage: if only i had a stacktrace or anything
[2012-04-05 17:03:32 -0400] roidrage: just dies when it starts
[2012-04-05 17:04:38 -0400] roidrage: nice invalid gem specs for json and mime-types
[2012-04-05 17:05:06 -0400] hoover_damm: don't you hate that?
[2012-04-05 17:05:17 -0400] roidrage: i do
[2012-04-05 17:05:29 -0400] roidrage: now the box is nicely messed up
[2012-04-05 17:06:09 -0400] roidrage: bah
[2012-04-05 17:06:59 -0400] roidrage: but this is weird, it works on the one box but the gems fail on the other
[2012-04-05 17:07:00 -0400] roidrage: wtf?
[2012-04-05 17:07:00 -0400] bawt: wtf is that about..
[2012-04-05 17:11:05 -0400] roidrage: weird, json 1.6.1 gem suddenly barfs with ruby 1.8.7 on ubuntu
[2012-04-05 17:11:19 -0400] hoover_damm: you still run 1.8.7?
[2012-04-05 17:11:23 -0400] hoover_damm: :(
[2012-04-05 17:11:27 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah running 1.8.x is a dying breed
[2012-04-05 17:11:36 -0400] hoover_damm: your going to get more spec issues as more people move to psych/1.9.x
[2012-04-05 17:11:41 -0400] roidrage: please
[2012-04-05 17:11:52 -0400] roidrage: of course
[2012-04-05 17:11:57 -0400] roidrage: sorry for bringing up this little fact
[2012-04-05 17:12:02 -0400] hoover_damm: I only say that as I've dealt with the stupidity of having psych based rubies build gems
[2012-04-05 17:12:11 -0400] hoover_damm: and trying to install them in a syck enabled ruby
[2012-04-05 17:12:23 -0400] hoover_damm: it was very painful keeping ey_resin working
[2012-04-05 17:12:45 -0400] hoover_damm: the amount of yaml / spec parsing bugs I'd run into from time to time that broke things
[2012-04-05 17:12:49 -0400] hoover_damm: gargle
[2012-04-05 17:12:56 -0400] roidrage: i don't really need that kind of talk right now
[2012-04-05 17:12:59 -0400] hoover_damm: no ey_resin is just as horrific
[2012-04-05 17:13:04 -0400] roidrage: the math is simple: it works on one box, doesn't on the other
[2012-04-05 17:13:16 -0400] hoover_damm: *cackle*
[2012-04-05 17:13:18 -0400] hoover_damm: good luck
[2012-04-05 17:13:20 -0400] roidrage: whether or not i'm using 1.8.7 is not really the issue here
[2012-04-05 17:16:35 -0400] roidrage: ah, something installed rubygems 1.7.2, nice
[2012-04-05 17:17:01 -0400] hoover_damm: 1.7.2? that's old
[2012-04-05 17:17:16 -0400] hoover_damm: remember 1.3.6?
[2012-04-05 17:17:17 -0400] hoover_damm: :D
[2012-04-05 17:17:46 -0400] roidrage: the other box is running 1.6.2 so i don't care
[2012-04-05 17:18:00 -0400] roidrage: and you have a weird way of mocking everything i say in here
[2012-04-05 17:18:54 -0400] hoover_damm: hrm, there was that load order patch in the 1.7.x series
[2012-04-05 17:18:57 -0400] hoover_damm: that didn't happen in 1.6.x?
[2012-04-05 17:21:24 -0400] coderanger: StormSilver: If you have ideas to improve them, send them my way :)
[2012-04-05 17:24:12 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: did you use the ubuntu10.04-gems bootstrap template?
[2012-04-05 17:24:48 -0400] roidrage: i didn't use any template
[2012-04-05 17:25:19 -0400] roidrage: which one should i use?
[2012-04-05 17:26:04 -0400] roidrage: on both boxes chef is installed via gems, just weird that the other box only has rubygems 1.6.2 installed
[2012-04-05 17:26:45 -0400] roidrage: and it works on that box properly
[2012-04-05 17:27:01 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: *I* like our chef-full template which will be in 0.10.10, as it installs Chef with the omnibus package.
[2012-04-05 17:27:15 -0400] roidrage: :( doesn't help me right now either
[2012-04-05 17:27:18 -0400] jtimberman: but it puts ruby off in its own place, so you'd need a recipe to manage the ruby you want.
[2012-04-05 17:27:34 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: how did you provision the system?
[2012-04-05 17:27:46 -0400] jtimberman: knife {ec2,rackspace,bootstrap}?
[2012-04-05 17:27:53 -0400] roidrage: bootstrap
[2012-04-05 17:28:24 -0400] roidrage: the major difference is that one system was restored from a rescue system because i had to properly set up the SSD, the other was not. maybe i'll just have to wipe it and see what happens
[2012-04-05 17:28:25 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, I love doing omnibus
[2012-04-05 17:28:37 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, makes my bootstrap process so freaking simple
[2012-04-05 17:28:48 -0400] hoover_damm: oh and I don't have to install any gems! ZOMG!
[2012-04-05 17:29:48 -0400] roidrage: probably just have to go through this procedure with every box if this turns out to be true
[2012-04-05 17:29:49 -0400] roidrage: sad
[2012-04-05 17:33:49 -0400] roidrage: time for a reprovision, oh well
[2012-04-05 17:38:48 -0400] holoway: when did this channel go from kind of light-hearted and fun to harassment about ruby versions and age? :)
[2012-04-05 17:39:48 -0400] roidrage: well, it honestly doesn't help me if every problem i have is accompanied by a comment of why i'm even using version x.y.z and what kind of problems are associated with it
[2012-04-05 17:40:05 -0400] roidrage: anyone using chef on oneiric? i'm currently considering just dumping it to 11.04
[2012-04-05 17:40:18 -0400] StormSilver: roidrage: Why are you using version x.y.z? Don't you know that has problems??
[2012-04-05 17:40:52 -0400] holoway: roidrage: right, that's my point
[2012-04-05 17:40:56 -0400] holoway: it's a useless statement
[2012-04-05 17:41:24 -0400] StormSilver: roidrage: Uhm, yes, I suppose I am.
[2012-04-05 17:41:33 -0400] holoway: roidrage: how is it breaking?
[2012-04-05 17:41:51 -0400] StormSilver: roidrage: But I just used the stock ruby 1.9.2 install
[2012-04-05 17:41:51 -0400] holoway: (I only saw the strange interaction, I didn't catch the actual symptoms)
[2012-04-05 17:42:04 -0400] roidrage: rubygems 1.7.2 doesn't seem to like the json 1.6.1 gemspec
[2012-04-05 17:42:10 -0400] roidrage: and the mime-types one
[2012-04-05 17:42:12 -0400] holoway: gack
[2012-04-05 17:42:17 -0400] roidrage: i can only assume that's why chef-client dies :/
[2012-04-05 17:43:33 -0400] DarrinEden: roidrage: any chance you're building 1.9.3 on ubuntu without libyaml being available?
[2012-04-05 17:44:07 -0400] DarrinEden: i know syck behaves quite oddly in that case
[2012-04-05 17:44:39 -0400] holoway: roidrage: fascinating - strange that 1.7.2 is there at all
[2012-04-05 17:45:05 -0400] holoway: ahh
[2012-04-05 17:45:08 -0400] holoway: 1.7.2-1 is the latest
[2012-04-05 17:45:12 -0400] roidrage: DarrinEden: it's actually just the stock 1.8.7 with rubygems 1.7.2, ruby 1.9.2 was installed via rvm
[2012-04-05 17:45:16 -0400] holoway: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/amd64/rubygems
[2012-04-05 17:45:23 -0400] roidrage: according to the ubuntu packages, 1.7.2 should be in oneiric
[2012-04-05 17:45:37 -0400] holoway: roidrage: yeah, and 1.6.2-1 was earlier
[2012-04-05 17:45:49 -0400] holoway: the 1.6.2-1 box just ahsn't had an apt-get upgrade to the new rubygems package
[2012-04-05 17:45:58 -0400] holoway: if you just do the upgrade, does it break again?
[2012-04-05 17:46:05 -0400] holoway: s/again/as well/
[2012-04-05 17:46:51 -0400] roidrage: the other box?
[2012-04-05 17:46:51 -0400] bawt: the other box is running 1.6.2 so i don't care
[2012-04-05 17:46:55 -0400] roidrage: haha
[2012-04-05 17:47:30 -0400] StormSilver: !botsnack
[2012-04-05 17:47:30 -0400] bawt: StormSilver: cheers
[2012-04-05 17:47:48 -0400] hoover_damm: honestly if you run oneric
[2012-04-05 17:47:52 -0400] hoover_damm: and you want 1.9.3
[2012-04-05 17:47:54 -0400] hoover_damm: you should be using my deb
[2012-04-05 17:47:56 -0400] hoover_damm: :-P
[2012-04-05 17:48:00 -0400] roidrage: i don't want 1.9.3
[2012-04-05 17:48:06 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, you want a working system
[2012-04-05 17:48:07 -0400] roidrage: that's not the issue i'm seeing
[2012-04-05 17:48:21 -0400] holoway: hoover_damm: stop giving him non-answers to his problem that he's already rejected
[2012-04-05 17:48:26 -0400] roidrage: ;)
[2012-04-05 17:48:37 -0400] hoover_damm: holoway, it's fun to tease him :)
[2012-04-05 17:48:43 -0400] holoway: hoover_damm: it's not fun
[2012-04-05 17:49:04 -0400] holoway: hoover_damm: it's irritating and damaging to the idea of having a community of peers who respect each other
[2012-04-05 17:49:37 -0400] holoway: he's clearly not enjoying it
[2012-04-05 17:49:52 -0400] hoover_damm: holoway, my attempt was only to offer it once.  mentioned mine only because of your rubygems link above
[2012-04-05 17:50:22 -0400] roidrage: hrm, how to get back to 1.6.2, default now is 1.7.2
[2012-04-05 17:50:31 -0400] holoway: roidrage: you can pin
[2012-04-05 17:50:39 -0400] holoway: roidrage: use apt-pinning
[2012-04-05 17:52:31 -0400] StormSilver: Is upgrading to the latest rubygems not an option?
[2012-04-05 17:52:58 -0400] roidrage: it'd be an option as well
[2012-04-05 17:53:58 -0400] roidrage: what is weird though is that the first chef runs worked
[2012-04-05 17:54:03 -0400] roidrage: then things suddenly halted
[2012-04-05 17:54:13 -0400] StormSilver: roidrage: But on a different rubygems, right?
[2012-04-05 17:54:30 -0400] roidrage: the initial system now has 1.7.2 when i install it
[2012-04-05 17:54:40 -0400] roidrage: so i can only assume it had it before i wiped it to start again
[2012-04-05 17:54:47 -0400] StormSilver: Huh
[2012-04-05 17:55:18 -0400] roidrage: export REALLY_GEM_UPDATE_SYSTEM=1
[2012-04-05 17:55:19 -0400] roidrage: so great
[2012-04-05 17:55:47 -0400] StormSilver: You have to be running 1.8.7? Just curious.
[2012-04-05 17:55:53 -0400] roidrage: nah, not really
[2012-04-05 17:56:25 -0400] roidrage: it's not a requirement, it's just the minimal setup of ubuntu and it's what's installed.
[2012-04-05 17:56:38 -0400] StormSilver: My 11.10 box is working well with the ruby1.9.1 package
[2012-04-05 17:57:03 -0400] StormSilver: But I'm also using a template, which it sounds like you're not doing.
[2012-04-05 17:57:13 -0400] roidrage: nope, but i probably should be
[2012-04-05 17:57:47 -0400] roidrage: StormSilver: which rubygems version do you have running?
[2012-04-05 17:57:56 -0400] StormSilver: roidrage: 1.8.15
[2012-04-05 17:58:26 -0400] holoway: roidrage: I don't think that's neccessarily true
[2012-04-05 17:58:37 -0400] holoway: roidrage: you could have installed before 1.7.2 was released
[2012-04-05 17:59:23 -0400] StormSilver: It was weird to come back to chef after being away, and start using the new version, instead of doing everything the 0.8 way. :)
[2012-04-05 17:59:34 -0400] StormSilver: With lots of holdovers from 0.7
[2012-04-05 17:59:40 -0400] roidrage: holoway: that'd be weird though, the box was set up this morning
[2012-04-05 18:02:19 -0400] roidrage: i'm just baffled by this pretty subtle difference with horrific consequences ;)
[2012-04-05 18:05:23 -0400] StormSilver: roidrage: Let me know if you want the template I'm using. It's basically just the stock 11.04 template but I think I tweaked it a bit for 11.10
[2012-04-05 18:05:26 -0400] roidrage: shame 1.7.2 is now in base, guess pinning won't work then
[2012-04-05 18:06:46 -0400] roidrage: just weird, really weird. guess a template that bumps it to 1.8 would be best
[2012-04-05 18:08:09 -0400] StormSilver: Yeah, when it comes to these things sometimes it's more cost effective to start over with a clean slate than figure out why it's broken
[2012-04-05 18:08:31 -0400] StormSilver: Chef made the state of my server a commodity.
[2012-04-05 18:08:55 -0400] StormSilver: If that's an option for you, of course. Which it isn't always.
[2012-04-05 18:09:15 -0400] holoway: roidrage: out of date mirror?
[2012-04-05 18:10:45 -0400] roidrage: possibly
[2012-04-05 18:11:01 -0400] roidrage: it is an option for me, it's a good option
[2012-04-05 18:11:23 -0400] roidrage: for our current setup we can reprovision whenever we want without affecting too much, so it's neat, and i can live with it ;)
[2012-04-05 18:11:33 -0400] roidrage: only started adding customers today and this is a new box ;)
[2012-04-05 18:11:39 -0400] roidrage: the old one is happily serving
[2012-04-05 18:11:52 -0400] roidrage: cheers for the help, guys, much appreciated. i'll look into a template
[2012-04-05 18:12:09 -0400] roidrage: StormSilver: i'd also go for that template offer of yours. it looks like the way to go
[2012-04-05 18:13:11 -0400] StormSilver: roidrage: https://gist.github.com/2312942
[2012-04-05 18:13:25 -0400] roidrage: thanks, StormSilver!
[2012-04-05 18:13:30 -0400] roidrage: thanks, holoway

[2012-04-05 20:28:30 -0400] laurent\: btm: it should, i've commented and asked John in the comment
[2012-04-05 20:32:54 -0400] laurent\: but as i said in the last comment of OHAI-343, the quick fix (only choosing a global scope ipaddress) might/will introduce another regression
[2012-04-05 20:35:37 -0400] laurent\: that's why i've been procrastinating with OHAI-355 :) (yep i might^W have more important stuff do in my life right now)
