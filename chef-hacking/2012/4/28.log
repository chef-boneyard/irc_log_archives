[2012-04-28 00:02:34 -0400] laurent\: i'm struggling with the node[:network][:interface] tree
[2012-04-28 00:03:38 -0400] laurent\: it's not very convenient to get ip addresses
[2012-04-28 00:04:23 -0400] laurent\: to get arp (or ipv6 neighbours) associations it's not convenient either
[2012-04-28 00:06:56 -0400] laurent\: i'm trying to extend routing information, i don't think it's possible to put routes under node[:network][:interface][IFACE][:routes]
[2012-04-28 00:07:47 -0400] laurent\: i think routes have to go in node[:network][:routes]
[2012-04-28 00:12:09 -0400] laurent\: err they would have to go to nodenode[:network][:interface][:routes]
[2012-04-28 00:12:27 -0400] laurent\: node[:network][:interface][IFACE][:routes]
[2012-04-28 00:13:27 -0400] laurent\: hey that's what i'm doing already ! nevermind
