[2012-04-19 16:50:07 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Did you folks happen to discuss the code cleanliness issues I mentioned in OHAI-267? Namely platform_specific_path?
[2012-04-19 16:53:31 -0400] btm: StormSilver: we didn't talk about upfactoring it, naw, it didn't come up.
[2012-04-19 16:53:37 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Cool beans
[2012-04-19 16:54:03 -0400] btm: I'm not really worried about it, it's a simple method.
[2012-04-19 17:01:22 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Okay, I fixed the spec on CHEF-3025, it was due to a JSON parse order thing, so give it another shot...

[2012-04-19 17:05:12 -0400] btm: :(
[2012-04-19 17:05:53 -0400] StormSilver: Hrmmmm
[2012-04-19 17:06:01 -0400] btm: that's the cloud stuff
[2012-04-19 17:06:07 -0400] yfeldblum: StormSilver, incidental duplication is not a problem
[2012-04-19 17:06:56 -0400] yfeldblum: StormSilver, even more so, one should *not* attempt to "refactor" incidentally duplicated code into a single class/method
[2012-04-19 17:07:22 -0400] StormSilver: Grr, don't want to have to figure out how to install chef on my winders box
[2012-04-19 17:07:41 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Let me know if you see what's wrong with it right off the bat, otherwise, I'll have to get into it.
[2012-04-19 17:08:13 -0400] btm: StormSilver: fortunately we have a full-stack MSI for windows.
[2012-04-19 17:40:53 -0400] josephholsten: btm: AND ITS AWESOME
[2012-04-19 17:41:01 -0400] josephholsten: ;)
[2012-04-19 17:45:00 -0400] hoover_damn: what you dont' use railsinstaller?
[2012-04-19 17:45:01 -0400] hoover_damn: :O

[2012-04-19 17:55:22 -0400] github-bawt: [ohai/master] OHAI-267: Add windows specific paths to stubs (unnnnnngh) - Bryan McLellan
[2012-04-19 17:56:56 -0400] josephholsten: anyone want to critique my yaml-support branch? https://github.com/josephholsten/chef/tree/yaml-support
[2012-04-19 17:57:26 -0400] josephholsten: definitely needs tests, but I'm not sure where to start
[2012-04-19 18:04:53 -0400] btm: StormSilver: the stubs weren't accounting for the windows path. ideally we would upfactor platform_mock from Chef and put some platform_specific_path into it. schisamo could do that in his free time for us. :)
[2012-04-19 18:05:33 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Dahur, of course :)
[2012-04-19 18:05:38 -0400] jtimberman: btm: what about the sane path method from Chef::Config?
[2012-04-19 18:05:57 -0400] StormSilver: Well, to get us going, I can just use platform_specific_path for now?
[2012-04-19 18:06:01 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, btw if your curious you can find my postgresql fork in github.com/damm
[2012-04-19 18:06:21 -0400] btm: jtimberman: we're talking about /etc/chef/foo versus c:\chef/foo, not $PATH
[2012-04-19 18:06:34 -0400] jtimberman: btm: yeah it has some mangling for that
[2012-04-19 18:07:01 -0400] btm: StormSilver: yeeeeah, well, I fixed it above --^ getting platform_specific_path out of Ohai::Config was annoying. I just duplicated the stubs.
[2012-04-19 18:07:14 -0400] jtimberman: This: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/config.rb#L50-58
[2012-04-19 18:07:18 -0400] jtimberman: btm ^
[2012-04-19 18:07:23 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Hah, didn't even see that commit
[2012-04-19 18:07:25 -0400] jtimberman: oh
[2012-04-19 18:07:31 -0400] jtimberman: wow, you said that :D
[2012-04-19 18:08:28 -0400] btm: jtimberman: yeah, StormSilver copied that over to Ohai::Config in this branch for OHAI-267.
[2012-04-19 18:08:51 -0400] jtimberman: nevermind me.
[2012-04-19 18:09:03 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Ohai::Config.platform_specific_path didn't work?
[2012-04-19 18:09:46 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] marcparadise pushed 2 new commits to whyrun: http://git.io/Iq8-cg
[2012-04-19 18:09:46 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/whyrun] allow some assertions to be run for all actions - Marc Paradise
[2012-04-19 18:09:47 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/whyrun] target_revision validity check should be an assertion - Marc Paradise
[2012-04-19 18:10:47 -0400] btm: StormSilver: it didn't. I started over and added debugging to see what the paths actually looked like. I think it was ultimately a / vs \ problem, wherein we use both in windows paths because we suck. so like "C:\chef\ohai\hints/ec2.json" != "C:\chef\ohai\hints\ec2.json"
[2012-04-19 18:11:19 -0400] btm: StormSilver: knowing everything I know now, I might have been able to [/\\] it or something. *cry*
[2012-04-19 18:11:48 -0400] StormSilver: I'm familiar with that feeling.
[2012-04-19 18:12:26 -0400] StormSilver: And the inevitable question of: Do I go back and spend more time to fix it because it's The Right Thing? Or do I just leave it because it's already committed?
[2012-04-19 18:13:39 -0400] StormSilver: Great, that full-stack MSI worked really well.
[2012-04-19 18:13:44 -0400] btm: StormSilver: I'd leave it. If you have time, talk to schisamo and Hosh (who I don't know if he is on IRC) about creating a better testing world for this.
[2012-04-19 18:13:56 -0400] StormSilver: Up and running for dev on Windows in about 15 mins.
[2012-04-19 18:14:02 -0400] btm: StormSilver: the platform_mock stuff on chef is a good start.
[2012-04-19 18:15:29 -0400] btm: StormSilver: your pulls appear to be for commits rather than your shiny topic branch, btw.
[2012-04-19 18:16:01 -0400] StormSilver: btm: So my pull should always be against a branch, not a specific commit?
[2012-04-19 18:16:56 -0400] jtimberman: StormSilver: yeah, so, create a topic branch for a ticket off the latest master for the repo, and create the pull request off your branch.
[2012-04-19 18:17:09 -0400] jtimberman: StormSilver: also, if you push new commits to your branch, thep ull request will update automagically
[2012-04-19 18:17:27 -0400] StormSilver: jtimberman: Might be worth updating the Working with Git page to reflect that last bit of wisdom
[2012-04-19 18:17:34 -0400] btm: StormSilver: we usually: gh track stormsilver ; git fetch stormsilver CHEF-3025:CHEF-3025 ; git checkout CHEF-3205 ; git rebase master ; # review code ; rake spec ; git checkout master ; git merge [--no-ff] CHEF-3025
[2012-04-19 18:18:10 -0400] jtimberman: for cookbooks, i smash the green merge button like a bandit.
[2012-04-19 18:18:19 -0400] jtimberman: ... if bandits smash green merge buttons anyway
[2012-04-19 18:18:33 -0400] StormSilver: btm: So should I even bother with a pull request?
[2012-04-19 18:20:09 -0400] jtimberman: StormSilver: they don't hurt - they're great for code review.
[2012-04-19 18:20:25 -0400] StormSilver: Okies
[2012-04-19 18:20:52 -0400] jtimberman: I really like them for cookbooks :)
[2012-04-19 18:20:58 -0400] jtimberman: see also: green buttons.
[2012-04-19 18:22:42 -0400] hoover_damn: for 80% more performance
[2012-04-19 18:22:43 -0400] hoover_damn: lol
[2012-04-19 18:24:28 -0400] btm: StormSilver: a pull request lets us click 'diff' and see the changes. if you just give a link to a branch like https://github.com/btm/chef/commits/CHEF-1251, then we've got to copy the last SHA that looks like it was upstream and make github give us a diff by manually crafting a url like https://github.com/btm/chef/compare/3f2e12f54a448106f5b407ca3c8ba48845cd8a43...CHEF-1251
[2012-04-19 18:25:29 -0400] StormSilver: The fancy new compare view is pretty rockin'
[2012-04-19 18:25:45 -0400] btm: so pull requests are nice, but they also add the step where we need to make sure to relate pull requests to tickets in a more convenient way than just the branch name.
[2012-04-19 18:25:56 -0400] btm: we really need like, an open source administrative assistant. :)
[2012-04-19 18:26:05 -0400] StormSilver: Hah
[2012-04-19 18:26:47 -0400] btm: StormSilver: so did that last patch to CHEF-3025 fix that test for you? It's not working for me.
[2012-04-19 18:26:59 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Well, the test was working in the first place for me
[2012-04-19 18:27:05 -0400] btm: hah
[2012-04-19 18:27:12 -0400] StormSilver: btm: The issue is with how the JSON gets dumped
[2012-04-19 18:27:23 -0400] StormSilver: So in the test we say run_list, then foo
[2012-04-19 18:27:27 -0400] btm: I wonder why that would vary.
[2012-04-19 18:27:28 -0400] StormSilver: But the output is foo, then run_list
[2012-04-19 18:27:34 -0400] StormSilver: Unordered hash, bro.
[2012-04-19 18:27:43 -0400] btm: oh. effing ruby.
[2012-04-19 18:27:52 -0400] StormSilver: Oh, I should just parse the output and compare the object
[2012-04-19 18:27:53 -0400] btm: we should just sort.
[2012-04-19 18:27:59 -0400] StormSilver: Damn pre-lunch fixes.
[2012-04-19 18:28:00 -0400] btm: or that
[2012-04-19 18:38:13 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Okay, try that.
[2012-04-19 18:41:40 -0400] btm: workey
[2012-04-19 18:41:45 -0400] StormSilver: Yay!
[2012-04-19 18:43:23 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] btm pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/ZDueXA
[2012-04-19 18:43:23 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] [CHEF-3025] Add --json-attributes option to knife bootstrap, which will be merged into the first_boot variable in the bootstrap context along with the run list. - Eric Hankins
[2012-04-19 18:43:23 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] [CHEF-3025] Fixed failing spec due to JSON parse order error - Eric Hankins
[2012-04-19 18:43:23 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] [CHEF-3025] Attempting to fix spec comparison. Again. - Eric Hankins
[2012-04-19 18:44:01 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Are you doing any merges on knife-rackspace, or is that all mattray?
[2012-04-19 18:46:05 -0400] btm: StormSilver: right now mattray was working on those, but he's been at the openstack conference so he's distracted ATM.
[2012-04-19 18:46:32 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Okay, just checking. I've got KNIFE_RACKSPACE-30, which is related to CHEF-3025
[2012-04-19 18:47:06 -0400] StormSilver: btm: Also going to make a ticket in KNIFE_RACKSPACE to support OHAI-267, so I didn't know if you'd want to merge those in while you're working on related things
[2012-04-19 18:47:11 -0400] StormSilver: Or just wait for him to get back and do it
[2012-04-19 18:47:39 -0400] btm: well, knife-rackspace could ship before 0.10.10 and 0.6.14
[2012-04-19 18:47:50 -0400] btm: so those dependencies are important to be aware of.
[2012-04-19 18:47:52 -0400] StormSilver: Okay, makes sense.
[2012-04-19 18:48:09 -0400] StormSilver: Just wanted to make you aware in case you wanted to merge them, not a big deal at all.
[2012-04-19 18:48:41 -0400] btm: StormSilver: you should be able to use the 'link' option under 'more actions' (I hit '.' then type link) to create a two-way link between tickets. there's one in there for dependencies. Easier than commenting twice.
[2012-04-19 18:48:59 -0400] StormSilver: Ooh, schweet.
[2012-04-19 18:49:19 -0400] jtimberman: btm: thanks for merging my fix for knife ssh attribute :D
[2012-04-19 18:49:32 -0400] jtimberman: not that i couldn't build the gem off my branch..
[2012-04-19 18:50:39 -0400] btm: jtimberman: anything for you, homeskillet.
[2012-04-19 18:52:19 -0400] jtimberman: lol
[2012-04-19 19:43:51 -0400] cwj: jtimberman or btm: i have updated the pull request for COOK-1195 (aws_resource_tag), should i mark the ticket as resolved again?
[2012-04-19 19:44:16 -0400] jtimberman: cwj: if you think its resolved, yes :)
[2012-04-19 20:38:59 -0400] jtimberman: cwj: Looks okay to me, I merged it :)
[2012-04-19 20:40:35 -0400] cwj: thanks! :)
[2012-04-19 20:40:49 -0400] jtimberman: no, thank *you* :)
[2012-04-19 20:40:53 -0400] cwj: i was going to test it a little more before i resolved the ticket but i think it will be fine
[2012-04-19 20:41:18 -0400] jtimberman: its not released in the cookbook on the community site yet, so i'm happy to take updates ;)
[2012-04-19 20:42:44 -0400] cwj: ok, will open a ticket if needed
[2012-04-19 20:43:54 -0400] jtimberman: cool!
[2012-04-19 22:01:02 -0400] btm: I know Amazon was acting up today.
[2012-04-19 22:08:19 -0400] hoover_damn: well this is locally uploading
[2012-04-19 22:08:23 -0400] hoover_damn: amazon irrelevent
[2012-04-19 22:09:30 -0400] btm: the cloud is everywhere man.
[2012-04-19 22:10:14 -0400] hoover_damn: and your on rackspace no?
[2012-04-19 22:11:02 -0400] hoover_damn: anywho i'm just speaking sorry if that's annoying... thought maybe someone else had issues
[2012-04-19 22:11:28 -0400] hoover_damn: in #chef sure
[2012-04-19 22:11:36 -0400] hoover_damn: perhaps i'm wrong?
[2012-04-19 22:12:51 -0400] btm: sometimes there are support folks wandering around.
[2012-04-19 22:12:57 -0400] btm: I can't even follow #chef myself.
[2012-04-19 22:13:33 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, right I just didn't think you guys would respond in that capacity in here
[2012-04-19 22:25:46 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damn: opscode hosted chef is running in rackspace hosting, but cookbooks are stored in s3.
[2012-04-19 22:28:12 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, oooo
[2012-04-19 22:28:16 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, you sneaky little
[2012-04-19 22:28:23 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, that totally clicks now
[2012-04-19 22:30:26 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damn: :)
