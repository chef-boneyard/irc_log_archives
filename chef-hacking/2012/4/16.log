[2012-04-16 14:11:39 -0400] StormSilver: btm_: Spent a little time massaging the patch for OHAI-267, comments added to ticket... take a look when you get a moment. Don't know if JIRA notifies you when someone adds comments if you're not watching the ticket so I thought I'd ping you here.
[2012-04-16 15:00:29 -0400] StormSilver: laurent\: You around?
[2012-04-16 15:00:39 -0400] laurent\: yep
[2012-04-16 15:01:19 -0400] StormSilver: I'm having trouble with ipv6 address detection, not sure if it's related to OHAI-343, but it's near that code so I wasn't sure: https://gist.github.com/2399277
[2012-04-16 15:01:44 -0400] StormSilver: If it's unrelated, that's fine, just wondering.
[2012-04-16 15:03:44 -0400] laurent\: it's a bug introduced by http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/OHAI-347
[2012-04-16 15:04:53 -0400] StormSilver: laurent\: Okay, would it be helpful if I attached my gist to that ticket?
[2012-04-16 15:05:52 -0400] laurent\: not necessary, i've already included tests to explain the 2 wrong assumptions made by this patch
[2012-04-16 15:06:18 -0400] StormSilver: I'll add it anyway, just to throw my weight on it.
[2012-04-16 15:06:31 -0400] laurent\: sure :)
[2012-04-16 15:16:20 -0400] laurent\: StormSilver: oops i think i answered to quickly, if you're using 0.6.12 you're not supposed to be hit by OHAI-347
[2012-04-16 15:17:11 -0400] StormSilver: laurent\: I'm using master as of a few days ago
[2012-04-16 15:19:09 -0400] laurent\: ok, line 221, makes sense. in that case a quick fix would be to comment out line 221
[2012-04-16 15:20:58 -0400] StormSilver: laurent\: Yep, that's what I've done to get going
[2012-04-16 15:21:14 -0400] StormSilver: Just wanted to make sure the right people were aware of the problem
