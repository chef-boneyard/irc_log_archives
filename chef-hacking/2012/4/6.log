[2012-04-06 00:15:14 -0400] fujin: hoover_damm: makes it much more portable
[2012-04-06 00:15:17 -0400] fujin: :D
[2012-04-06 00:21:03 -0400] hoover_damm: fujin, it really does, so if you want just a straight up war it'll be easier
[2012-04-06 00:21:13 -0400] hoover_damm: fujin, include_recipe java, remote_file stable war
[2012-04-06 00:21:18 -0400] hoover_damm: service start
[2012-04-06 00:21:18 -0400] hoover_damm: bam
[2012-04-06 00:23:06 -0400] fujin: a lot of people ask me about redhat
[2012-04-06 00:23:11 -0400] fujin: so straight war makes that a bit easier
[2012-04-06 00:23:16 -0400] fujin: what service provider, still plain service ?
[2012-04-06 00:23:26 -0400] fujin: i'd like runit but I don't think we can foist that on people
[2012-04-06 00:28:03 -0400] hoover_damm: just /etc/init.d
[2012-04-06 00:28:06 -0400] hoover_damm: right
[2012-04-06 00:28:10 -0400] hoover_damm: i wanted to do runit too
[2012-04-06 00:28:17 -0400] hoover_damm: but it makes the recipe not so far
[2012-04-06 00:28:37 -0400] fujin: cool
[2012-04-06 00:28:42 -0400] hoover_damm: i've got my guys looking for init or runit without too much of an issue
[2012-04-06 00:29:19 -0400] hoover_damm: i just wish i didn't use chpst /bin/bash -c
[2012-04-06 00:29:21 -0400] hoover_damm: in runit
[2012-04-06 00:29:22 -0400] hoover_damm: :|
[2012-04-06 00:29:26 -0400] hoover_damm: i need to find a better way
[2012-04-06 00:29:32 -0400] fujin: why spawn bash ?
[2012-04-06 00:29:52 -0400] hoover_damm: well for graphite, i dunno
[2012-04-06 00:30:16 -0400] fujin: exec chpst -u www-data:www-data -l /opt/graphite/storage/carbon-cache.lock -- /opt/graphite/bin/carbon-cache.py --debug start
[2012-04-06 00:30:21 -0400] hoover_damm: chpst -u graphite -l /opt/graphite/storage/carbon-cache.lock -- bash -c source /opt/graphite/.venv/bin/activate && /opt/graphite/bin/carbon-cache.py start
[2012-04-06 00:30:30 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm using virtualenv
[2012-04-06 00:30:33 -0400] hoover_damm: so it's not so straight forward
[2012-04-06 00:30:41 -0400] hoover_damm: need to activate, then start
[2012-04-06 00:30:45 -0400] hoover_damm: no?
[2012-04-06 00:30:56 -0400] fujin: thought you could just modify path once it has been activated..
[2012-04-06 00:31:09 -0400] fujin: don't have to activate every time
[2012-04-06 00:31:13 -0400] fujin: at least, to best of my recollection
[2012-04-06 00:32:03 -0400] hoover_damm: i do a fe wthings odd in graphite for virtualenv
[2012-04-06 00:32:16 -0400] hoover_damm: I'm able to do the sync without activation
[2012-04-06 00:32:33 -0400] hoover_damm: i'll have to just test and try a better way
[2012-04-06 00:32:40 -0400] hoover_damm: and then i can update my collectd cookbook to 5.1.0
[2012-04-06 00:32:41 -0400] hoover_damm: and whatnot
[2012-04-06 00:32:45 -0400] hoover_damm: as 5.1.0 is released
[2012-04-06 00:32:53 -0400] hoover_damm: collectd write to graphite is released... :)
[2012-04-06 00:33:28 -0400] fujin: i use coderanger's cookbooks
[2012-04-06 00:33:39 -0400] fujin: we have had collectd->whisperdb for months via carbon cache
[2012-04-06 00:33:43 -0400] fujin: collectd-carbon on github
[2012-04-06 00:33:53 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah
[2012-04-06 00:33:55 -0400] hoover_damm: that's what i modified
[2012-04-06 00:34:06 -0400] hoover_damm: i need to update the public version to 5.1.0
[2012-04-06 00:34:38 -0400] hoover_damm: modified the credis library and redis plugin
[2012-04-06 00:34:40 -0400] hoover_damm: to get more stats out of it
[2012-04-06 00:34:52 -0400] hoover_damm: unfortunately that patch is lost until i remake it against 5.1.0
[2012-04-06 00:34:57 -0400] hoover_damm: so that's what I gotta do first
[2012-04-06 00:35:47 -0400] hoover_damm: i didn't push my changes back on credis... and what's up with google code to remote_file off lately?
[2012-04-06 00:35:50 -0400] hoover_damm: does it always suck?
[2012-04-06 00:45:08 -0400] hoover_damm: credis fetch url goes 404 after a few minutes of downloading it
[2012-04-06 00:45:19 -0400] hoover_damm: and it seems to require you to click on download, and then run chef
[2012-04-06 00:45:21 -0400] hoover_damm: for it to work
[2012-04-06 00:45:31 -0400] hoover_damm: which likely doesn't make sense or sound right
[2012-04-06 00:52:38 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: github.com/jtimberman/runit/tree/CHEF-154 :)
[2012-04-06 00:54:34 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, when that going in?
[2012-04-06 00:55:02 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/runit/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L29 small bug there
[2012-04-06 00:55:07 -0400] hoover_damm: could you please change that to /var/service?
[2012-04-06 00:55:21 -0400] hoover_damm: i haven't gotten around to filing the ticket / pull
[2012-04-06 00:55:28 -0400] hoover_damm: but that always bums runit out on gentoo for me
[2012-04-06 00:55:41 -0400] hoover_damm: if you need a pull, i'll make one later
[2012-04-06 00:57:20 -0400] jtimberman: orly? I thought that was correct.
[2012-04-06 00:57:25 -0400] jtimberman: no one has changed it in 2 yrs :)
[2012-04-06 00:57:39 -0400] hoover_damm: nope it's not
[2012-04-06 00:57:40 -0400] hoover_damm: never was
[2012-04-06 00:57:46 -0400] hoover_damm: it was close
[2012-04-06 00:58:07 -0400] hoover_damm: and runit works out of the box except for 'restart' actions
[2012-04-06 00:58:13 -0400] hoover_damm: that's where this change comes into affect
[2012-04-06 00:58:42 -0400] jtimberman: well
[2012-04-06 00:58:45 -0400] jtimberman: at least its an attribute :)
[2012-04-06 00:58:48 -0400] jtimberman: stick it in your base role
[2012-04-06 00:58:50 -0400] hoover_damm: right
[2012-04-06 00:58:53 -0400] hoover_damm: totally easy to fix
[2012-04-06 00:59:00 -0400] jtimberman: better to fix it forealies
[2012-04-06 00:59:01 -0400] hoover_damm: which is another reason why it may have not been reported
[2012-04-06 00:59:03 -0400] hoover_damm: too easy to fix
[2012-04-06 00:59:29 -0400] hoover_damm: lemme login and file a ticket
[2012-04-06 01:00:58 -0400] jtimberman: https://github.com/jtimberman/runit/blob/CHEF-154/attributes/default.rb
[2012-04-06 01:01:00 -0400] jtimberman: fixed
[2012-04-06 01:01:02 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-04-06 01:01:49 -0400] hoover_damm: cool, then i'll notate that iin COOK-1165
[2012-04-06 01:02:27 -0400] hoover_damm: and fixed
[2012-04-06 01:02:29 -0400] hoover_damm: tote easy

[2012-04-06 20:43:51 -0400] btm: jtimberman: but you're a zero-day arch linux master!
[2012-04-06 20:44:04 -0400] jtimberman: btm: lulz
[2012-04-06 20:44:08 -0400] jtimberman: thanks, i think?
[2012-04-06 20:44:14 -0400] btm: haha

[2012-04-06 20:48:53 -0400] jtimberman: different system does not have a separate ruby installed (it has no ruby apps)
[2012-04-06 20:49:13 -0400] btm: jtimberman: omnibus install?
[2012-04-06 20:49:18 -0400] jtimberman: yeah
[2012-04-06 20:49:38 -0400] jtimberman: so i have two systems
[2012-04-06 20:49:46 -0400] jtimberman: both are omnibus installs
[2012-04-06 20:49:54 -0400] btm: hrm. yeah, that should be a chef_gem in the future. I thought that we stuffed omnibus into the path but maybe we don't.
[2012-04-06 20:49:58 -0400] jtimberman: the first one where things ran fine has ruby installed for another thing i was testing.
[2012-04-06 20:50:16 -0400] jtimberman: second doesn't have another ruby
[2012-04-06 20:50:40 -0400] jtimberman: well, looks like its /usr/bin/gem there
[2012-04-06 20:50:58 -0400] jtimberman: but, my workstation, which has ruby (and chef) installed under rbenv, was just fine.
[2012-04-06 20:51:15 -0400] jtimberman: hurm wait
[2012-04-06 20:51:59 -0400] jtimberman: oh that might be an artifact of a previous install.
[2012-04-06 20:52:45 -0400] jtimberman: btm: ah - sorry - its fixed by removing the bad gem command :D
[2012-04-06 20:57:04 -0400] btm: apt would have deleted that for you. :)
