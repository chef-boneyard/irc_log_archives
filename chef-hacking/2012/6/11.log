[2012-06-11 21:12:32 -0400] hoover_damm: coderanger, now we're taking pychef further in our deploys and making it index what we want :)
[2012-06-11 21:13:03 -0400] hoover_damm: coderanger, reason why I say this is I wanted to thank you for your absolutely freaking easy / lovely docs
[2012-06-11 21:14:23 -0400] ampledata: some dude on twitter was asking about pychef/fabric the other day
[2012-06-11 21:14:45 -0400] ampledata: i was thinking about writing a post about integ the two
[2012-06-11 21:14:57 -0400] ampledata: oh it's already in the pychef docs
[2012-06-11 21:15:01 -0400] ampledata: dunno why that guy missed that
[2012-06-11 21:15:55 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, a lot of people are super lazy
[2012-06-11 21:16:05 -0400] hoover_damm: and it shows
[2012-06-11 21:16:45 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, coworker asked about pychef stuff and I was actually going to have him hop in here and ask until I rtfm'd and LOL'd
[2012-06-11 21:16:59 -0400] hoover_damm: not really a coworker I guess as i'm just a contractor
[2012-06-11 21:17:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but whatever
[2012-06-11 21:22:32 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, happens all the time in the line of watching irc and answering questions
[2012-06-11 21:22:46 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, yep

[2012-06-11 21:36:01 -0400] fnichol: hoover_damm, ampledata: haha, I bet that was me! total phone tweeting around the house, I fail :)
[2012-06-11 21:37:52 -0400] hoover_damm: fnichol, we'll there's a few of us... maybe we should just start #pychef
[2012-06-11 21:37:53 -0400] hoover_damm: and log it

[2012-06-11 21:40:44 -0400] fnichol: hoover_damm, no kidding, I'd lurk there too
[2012-06-11 21:41:04 -0400] hoover_damm: fnichol, well I just /j'd it if others want to they can...
[2012-06-11 21:41:07 -0400] fnichol: as soon as I remember to connect to this tmux session
[2012-06-11 21:41:16 -0400] hoover_damm: but coderanger can if he wants
[2012-06-11 21:41:33 -0400] coderanger: Hmm?
[2012-06-11 21:41:40 -0400] hoover_damm:  #pychef
[2012-06-11 21:42:07 -0400] coderanger: Just ask in here or #chef, no need for more IMO :)
[2012-06-11 21:42:31 -0400] hoover_damm: ideally, but it would get lost in the signal noise
[2012-06-11 21:42:52 -0400] hoover_damm: where a mostly idle prone channel to ask and it could remain idle for long periods and the question could be valid and answered
[2012-06-11 21:42:55 -0400] coderanger: If you include my name, I'll notice it sooner or later
[2012-06-11 21:42:57 -0400] fnichol: wow, the are docs /are/ great
[2012-06-11 21:43:00 -0400] hoover_damm: where as if we come back 4 hours later
[2012-06-11 21:43:00 -0400] coderanger: Thats fair
[2012-06-11 21:43:09 -0400] hoover_damm: we could come back and see it
[2012-06-11 21:43:13 -0400] hoover_damm: we're also stating the docs are fantastic
[2012-06-11 21:43:18 -0400] hoover_damm: so #pychef maybe too extreme
[2012-06-11 21:43:39 -0400] fnichol: http://pychef.readthedocs.org/
[2012-06-11 21:43:44 -0400] ampledata: we use pychef+fabric pretty extensively here, so if you've to ?'s i can chime in as well
[2012-06-11 21:43:56 -0400] hoover_damm: I just like the notion of being able to fire a question and come back 4 hours later and not have 40 people try and answer it the ruby way
[2012-06-11 21:44:00 -0400] hoover_damm: is that horrible of me?
[2012-06-11 21:44:03 -0400] hoover_damm: likely
[2012-06-11 21:44:08 -0400] ampledata: some dude was giving a preso at pycon on fabric and i went off about pychef+fabric and people were like 'omgwtforly?'
[2012-06-11 21:44:27 -0400] coderanger: hoover_damm I should probably register it at least, just to camp the name :)
[2012-06-11 21:44:56 -0400] hoover_damm: coderanger, I can register it and give you owner
[2012-06-11 21:44:58 -0400] hoover_damm: afaik
[2012-06-11 21:45:17 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, or you can leave and when I rejoin I'll get op
[2012-06-11 21:45:19 -0400] coderanger: up to you
[2012-06-11 21:45:51 -0400] coderanger: ampledata: but omgruby, why not just use salt, thats written in python!
[2012-06-11 21:45:57 -0400] coderanger: </trolol>
[2012-06-11 21:46:03 -0400] hoover_damm:  /msg ChanServ SET #pychef FOUNDER coderanger
[2012-06-11 21:46:09 -0400] hoover_damm: and it will be yours coderanger
[2012-06-11 21:46:36 -0400] ampledata: first we need to upgrade from fabric 1.2
[2012-06-11 21:46:57 -0400] hoover_damm: but i have a double proc issue
[2012-06-11 21:47:04 -0400] hoover_damm: likely due to my fabfile quirks
[2012-06-11 21:49:25 -0400] coderanger: Okay, add ampledata and bitprophet as ops too, just to be safe
[2012-06-11 21:49:30 -0400] coderanger: er, added
[2012-06-11 21:50:59 -0400] ampledata: wordup
[2012-06-11 21:51:08 -0400] ampledata: more places to idle
[2012-06-11 21:51:44 -0400] hoover_damm: well I was actually going to stop idling in ##monitoringsucks
[2012-06-11 21:52:07 -0400] hoover_damm: as it still sucks, it's gotten so cold that #chef-hacking makes it look like a highschool gossip house
[2012-06-11 21:52:45 -0400] ampledata: heh i've never actually gone in there
[2012-06-11 21:53:02 -0400] coderanger: Hah http://pychef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/auth.html still exists
[2012-06-11 21:53:11 -0400] coderanger: Might be useful if others are making API clients too
