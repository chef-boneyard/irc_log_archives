[2012-06-21 04:36:22 -0400] sascha_d: so, can I do this in a resource file? https://gist.github.com/e7b1873fee3d903f16ad
[2012-06-21 05:04:10 -0400] spheromak: sascha_d: not so confident that would work have you tried ?
[2012-06-21 05:04:35 -0400] sascha_d: no, that's why I asked. It was kind of a 'dear lazyweb'
[2012-06-21 05:04:56 -0400] sascha_d: I'm going to assume I can and then adjust if not
[2012-06-21 05:05:09 -0400] sascha_d: I'm building a resource from some existing repetitive code
[2012-06-21 05:06:18 -0400] sascha_d: the original peeps took two files and eventually catted them into one file - I don't see that the extra steps are necessary, but thought I'd leave them the option to keep the files separate if they wanted
[2012-06-21 05:06:18 -0400] spheromak: you might try   :default => @new_resource.foofile
[2012-06-21 05:06:29 -0400] spheromak: if it doesn't work as you are trying now
[2012-06-21 05:06:42 -0400] sascha_d: I will stick that in my notes; thanks
[2012-06-21 08:30:06 -0400] nico: holoway: hacked around chef-rundeck today
[2012-06-21 08:30:38 -0400] nico: holoway: added caching to this, 15 times execution run time improved

[2012-06-21 16:03:55 -0400] hoover_damm: so how's openstack looking mattray? ;) after NASA splitting
[2012-06-21 16:04:10 -0400] hoover_damm: Rackspace doesn't run full / real openstack (they modify it)
[2012-06-21 16:04:19 -0400] hoover_damm: I get the feeling it's more of a success in small orgs
[2012-06-21 16:04:21 -0400] hoover_damm: then big
[2012-06-21 16:04:23 -0400] mattray: yeah, NASA doesn't make tinfoil or tang anymore either ;)
[2012-06-21 16:04:42 -0400] hoover_damm: how am I going to keep the voices out then?
[2012-06-21 16:04:47 -0400] hoover_damm: without my tinfoil hat!
[2012-06-21 16:04:49 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: Rackspace is my #1 collaborator on Chef cookbooks for OpenStack
[2012-06-21 16:05:14 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, they're the most commercial at the time
[2012-06-21 16:05:36 -0400] mattray: and they announced yesterday(?) August 1 is when they leave beta for Cloud Server on OpenStack
[2012-06-21 16:05:55 -0400] mattray: and Rackspace Cloud Files has always been Swift trunk
[2012-06-21 16:07:08 -0400] mattray: AFAIK, Rackspace's OpenStack deployment is pretty "pure" OpenStack, minus the dashboard of course
[2012-06-21 16:12:37 -0400] hoover_damm: my understanding is they modify a few bits here and there
[2012-06-21 16:12:39 -0400] hoover_damm: to fit themselves
[2012-06-21 16:13:09 -0400] hoover_damm: If that's true, that's rather unfortunate as they are one of the biggest supporters
[2012-06-21 16:13:16 -0400] hoover_damm: one would hope they would run close to pure as possible
[2012-06-21 16:13:54 -0400] hoover_damm: Perhaps i'm viewing it too simplistic ;)
[2012-06-21 16:15:05 -0400] mattray: The dashboard is meant to be replaced so you can add things like billing and the like, with all sorts of customizations for your site
[2012-06-21 16:15:18 -0400] mattray: but it's getting pretty good
[2012-06-21 16:15:33 -0400] mattray: HP has a Rails front-end for their dashboard
[2012-06-21 16:15:38 -0400] mattray: Rackspace is PHP I think
[2012-06-21 16:15:51 -0400] mattray: The Dashboard project is a Django app
[2012-06-21 16:16:12 -0400] mattray: but there's even a billing project in progress, so that's getting standardized
[2012-06-21 16:17:45 -0400] mattray: from my vantage point, Rackspace has done an excellent job with OpenStack
[2012-06-21 16:18:08 -0400] mattray: they're walking the walk
[2012-06-21 17:00:44 -0400] geekbri: Even though my company is a big AWS client, I am super pleased and excited about openstack

[2012-06-21 17:43:48 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: I suspect it's Rails since it consumes their Fog bindings
[2012-06-21 17:43:49 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, Dashboards shouldn't really matter for Openstack
[2012-06-21 17:43:51 -0400] hoover_damm: tbh
[2012-06-21 17:44:07 -0400] hoover_damm: those are still highly personal

[2012-06-21 19:58:23 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, did you want a picture then?
[2012-06-21 19:58:39 -0400] ampledata: nah i think i've seen it
[2012-06-21 19:58:53 -0400] jtimberman: huh... I don't have one...
[2012-06-21 19:58:58 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-06-21 19:59:09 -0400] ampledata: jt i'll send you a splunk gerber for an opscode leatherman
[2012-06-21 19:59:23 -0400] ampledata: well
[2012-06-21 19:59:32 -0400] ampledata: that doesn't make sense sinceyou don't have one
[2012-06-21 19:59:38 -0400] ampledata: lets start over
[2012-06-21 19:59:48 -0400] ampledata: i'll send you a set of my house keys and you can have your pick of the litter
[2012-06-21 20:00:17 -0400] hoover_damm: does anyone have any stupid shell tools they use to swap between ec2 accounts?
[2012-06-21 20:00:17 -0400] c_t: opscode sends out shit?
[2012-06-21 20:00:31 -0400] c_t: damn, I haven't gotten anything like that
[2012-06-21 20:00:34 -0400] ampledata: hoover
[2012-06-21 20:00:36 -0400] hoover_damm: I use multiple AWS accounts and it's such a slore to emacs my .zshrc
[2012-06-21 20:00:36 -0400] ampledata: i've got like
[2012-06-21 20:00:39 -0400] ampledata: a ghetto ass function
[2012-06-21 20:00:43 -0400] ampledata: let me paste
[2012-06-21 20:00:49 -0400] hoover_damm: and comment out my enabled
[2012-06-21 20:00:53 -0400] hoover_damm: and uncomment the ones I want up
[2012-06-21 20:00:55 -0400] hoover_damm: and then fire up a new one
[2012-06-21 20:01:05 -0400] hoover_damm: I totally need to wrap this properly in a shell script
[2012-06-21 20:01:17 -0400] hoover_damm: it could be one off per shell and totally win
[2012-06-21 20:01:29 -0400] hoover_damm: but I never thought about it
[2012-06-21 20:01:33 -0400] hoover_damm: or bitched lol
[2012-06-21 20:02:03 -0400] hoover_damm: hrm, do people still write chef dashboards?
[2012-06-21 20:02:05 -0400] hoover_damm: like aether?
[2012-06-21 20:02:21 -0400] ampledata: hoover https://gist.github.com/2968201
[2012-06-21 20:02:36 -0400] ampledata: i have some splunk dashboards to show metrics and such
[2012-06-21 20:02:38 -0400] hoover_damm: managing like 500+nodes on ec2
[2012-06-21 20:02:51 -0400] hoover_damm: I really need to write a dashboard to just display my stats honestly
[2012-06-21 20:02:55 -0400] hoover_damm: pretty sad
[2012-06-21 20:03:38 -0400] hoover_damm: 'Role: foobar' => {'ec2' => {'us-east-1a' => "running" => 42 }, }'
[2012-06-21 20:03:38 -0400] ampledata: i think etsy has a handler to send stats to graphite
[2012-06-21 20:03:50 -0400] ampledata: oh u want ec2 stats
[2012-06-21 20:03:53 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah I was writing that stuff to graphite in a silly loop script
[2012-06-21 20:04:03 -0400] hoover_damm: but it created a lot of cpu churn
[2012-06-21 20:06:24 -0400] jtimberman: ampledata: i have a gerber multi-tool actually :)
[2012-06-21 20:06:31 -0400] jtimberman: i've had it for like 15 years.
[2012-06-21 20:06:43 -0400] jtimberman: (which is why I don't mind not having a leatherman)
[2012-06-21 20:06:51 -0400] ampledata: i switched from gerber to leatherman a while back
[2012-06-21 20:07:00 -0400] ampledata: speaking of which, anyone ever had to clean one of either of those badboys
[2012-06-21 20:07:09 -0400] ampledata: i was thinking of taking some graphite powder to it
[2012-06-21 20:07:41 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, forked.  I'll definetly have to expand on that
[2012-06-21 20:07:50 -0400] hoover_damm: great start
[2012-06-21 20:08:29 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, server status.  Not everyone does EC2, so it's pure server status based on IaaS or metal or fizbang
[2012-06-21 20:08:47 -0400] hoover_damm: sure that server status can and should have additional status if it's in a cloud or in fizbang
[2012-06-21 20:36:56 -0400] btm: the leathermans went to MVPs. jtimberman was at opscode when it founded so he didn't get a chance to become an MVP.
[2012-06-21 20:37:47 -0400] jtimberman: btm: hehehehe :)
[2012-06-21 20:38:48 -0400] btm: I have one, but they aren't the Super Tool so I don't use it. It resides on level 2 of backup leathermans in my collection.
[2012-06-21 20:39:28 -0400] hoover_damm: the leatherman is just one of many tools in my drawer that is used commonly
[2012-06-21 20:39:35 -0400] c_t: it's ok, though, because jtimberman has this kind of Leatherman thing going on: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leatherman_(vagabond)
[2012-06-21 20:39:58 -0400] btm: hoover_damm: mine is always on my belt. except on airplanes. :(
[2012-06-21 20:41:02 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, I stopped doing that when an my spouses uncle got arrested for bringing a 9" Knife into the Hospital
[2012-06-21 20:41:30 -0400] hoover_damm: I didn't want to be the person that forgot it and had to goto the hospital in an emergency and find out halfway during the emergency that you get to goto jail
[2012-06-21 20:44:36 -0400] hoover_damm: and i'm actually one that would forget :(
[2012-06-21 20:45:31 -0400] ampledata: fwiw this guy usually gets through TSA: http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/tools/6d98/?srp=2
[2012-06-21 20:58:50 -0400] dschultz: Hey all, wondering if someone can provide some help. I've marked an issue as resolved (http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2906). Note that this is my first experience with the JIRA ticket system, so forgive me my noobish ignorance if it shouldn't have been marked as resolved.
[2012-06-21 20:58:58 -0400] dschultz: The solution has been tested and is really just a hack of the bootstrap script. Any insight on this is welcome as far as tickets go. I'm trying to get more involved in the community as my role at my day job increases.
[2012-06-21 21:01:17 -0400] hoover_damm: so anyone deploy any pypy with chef?
[2012-06-21 21:01:54 -0400] hoover_damm: client has a developer interested in it and he's installing in such a way that I wish that I was installing it in chef for him
[2012-06-21 21:07:47 -0400] btm: hoover_damm: a 9" knife is going to be a weapon to most people. a leatherman usually isn't. although security at the holocaust museum accosted me 7 years ago over it.
[2012-06-21 21:08:26 -0400] c_t: the Holocaust Museum kind of has reason to be a little touchy about weapons though, honestly
[2012-06-21 21:08:45 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, I keep a 7" knife next to my desk at all times and a 9" under my bed
[2012-06-21 21:08:59 -0400] hoover_damm: I have nothing to fear.
[2012-06-21 21:09:08 -0400] c_t: except a man with a 10" knife
[2012-06-21 21:09:09 -0400] btm: dschultz: I'm not sure what the resolution actually is there. normally you would mark it 'resolved/fixed' and we would look at the proposed fix in our regular code review meetings.

[2012-06-21 21:10:25 -0400] dschultz: btm: Understood, I didn't submit a pull request. Just commented on the issue with a proposed addition to the bootstrap script.
[2012-06-21 21:10:47 -0400] btm: dschultz: I didn't understand why you marked it 'resolved/duplicate' normally duplicate is if you're not going to do anything because this ticket duplicates another existing ticket.
[2012-06-21 21:11:28 -0400] btm: dschultz: I removed the triage status bit from it today as we use that to mark if code review has reviewed the ticket or not.
[2012-06-21 21:13:40 -0400] dschultz: btm: Gotcha. New to the JIRA system and the whole process.
[2012-06-21 21:16:02 -0400] btm: dschultz: best thing to do here is to mark that ticket 'resolved/fixed' (leave untriaged) and make a clear comment at the end about what the proposed fix is.
[2012-06-21 21:16:13 -0400] btm: dschultz: no worries, thanks [for playing] :)
