[2012-06-01 00:34:40 -0400] c_t: Does anyone use splunk on s390?
[2012-06-01 01:07:33 -0400] ampledata: no
[2012-06-01 01:07:34 -0400] ampledata: heh
[2012-06-01 01:07:49 -0400] ampledata: we cross compile to ensure we haven't written any hugely divergent platform code
[2012-06-01 01:10:59 -0400] c_t: that would certainly do it
[2012-06-01 01:13:41 -0400] ampledata: i mean we already have to build for hpux ia64/haprisc, aix ppc, macos universal, sparc, x86/x64
[2012-06-01 01:13:46 -0400] ampledata: you figure that'd be enough
[2012-06-01 01:14:34 -0400] c_t: no VMS?
[2012-06-01 01:15:13 -0400] ampledata: no vms
[2012-06-01 01:58:04 -0400] atomic-penguin: We just turned off our last VMS machine not too long ago
[2012-06-01 14:04:32 -0400] kisoku: does anyone from dtolabs hang out in here ?
[2012-06-01 15:40:42 -0400] hoover_damm: there must be some wacky lawyers out there
[2012-06-01 15:41:17 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damm: there's a lot of people who won't sign it because it "asks for personal information"
[2012-06-01 15:41:32 -0400] jtimberman: because finding personal information about people who contribute code to open source projects is hard.
[2012-06-01 15:41:33 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, and yet most of these people likely have Facebook accounts
[2012-06-01 15:41:41 -0400] jtimberman: Exactly.
[2012-06-01 15:41:54 -0400] hoover_damm: they should jam their fist in their mouth a little harder
[2012-06-01 15:43:16 -0400] hoover_damm: The only valid excuse I ever heard out of a employer was 'I don't want you working on Chef for 20+hours and giving away code when I'm paying you".  My response to him was 'If those 20 hours benefit you, and other users.  Doesn't that negate the cost? and make us look better because we're willing to spend the time to help patch it?'
[2012-06-01 15:46:43 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damm: "Hundreds of people have already written code for, in, and with Chef for free that you can use it. YUNO like communities?"
[2012-06-01 15:46:46 -0400] jtimberman: ;)
[2012-06-01 15:49:26 -0400] hoover_damm: Perception is often nine tenths of reality...
[2012-06-01 15:49:58 -0400] hoover_damm: I wish people spent more time to look around the question to see more of the possible viewpoints
[2012-06-01 16:02:59 -0400] sascha_d: Something I heard from a Puppet client once was, "We want to participate in the community where we can, but this particular set of code is our competitive advantage and we don't want to share it."
[2012-06-01 16:08:23 -0400] c_t: ohai chefs
[2012-06-01 16:09:14 -0400] yfeldblum: hi
[2012-06-01 16:43:18 -0400] hoover_damm: sascha_d, likely this is why I burn myself a lot with jobs/companies.  I don't see alot of value in keeping things a secret.
[2012-06-01 16:44:17 -0400] hoover_damm: If your working on X and there are people who might be interested in it, and you open source your work and they help you finish it.  You launch your product and with success.  Should you care if they launch too? or should you gloat? if they launch and it burns you perhaps you didn't have the best idea afterall
[2012-06-01 16:45:02 -0400] hoover_damm: Everyone wants an advantage.  I think the best advantage someone can have is an open mind and ear and willing to grow / change
[2012-06-01 16:45:52 -0400] hoover_damm: and remember the first rule of contributing.  Your trying to solve your problem and not everyone will see your problem the same way as you do.
[2012-06-01 16:47:35 -0400] sascha_d: I know it.  I was tempted to call shenanigans, but I kind of understood their point
[2012-06-01 16:48:03 -0400] sascha_d: it was automating a product whose specialists tend to be stuck in the dark ages and they are a hoster who specialized in that product
[2012-06-01 16:48:14 -0400] hoover_damm: I really can't say anything until I run a company and stand in their feet
[2012-06-01 16:48:22 -0400] hoover_damm: I can say what I would do, but would I do that?
[2012-06-01 16:48:30 -0400] sascha_d: truthfully probably no one else would bother to automate because that's how dark agey they are
[2012-06-01 16:48:42 -0400] hoover_damm: my morality tells me to open source it and damn the product
[2012-06-01 16:48:45 -0400] sascha_d: :)
[2012-06-01 16:48:49 -0400] hoover_damm: but often my morality is messed up
[2012-06-01 16:48:54 -0400] sascha_d: I think that's pretty sound
[2012-06-01 16:49:12 -0400] sascha_d: even look at the Iron Chef stuff
[2012-06-01 16:49:21 -0400] sascha_d: that's a great product but it's still complex as hell
[2012-06-01 16:49:23 -0400] hoover_damm: I deserved it
[2012-06-01 16:50:49 -0400] sascha_d: I mean Ironfan :)
[2012-06-01 16:53:14 -0400] hoover_damm: I got a little burned by metachef/silverware recently which caused me to fork a redis cookbook
[2012-06-01 16:53:20 -0400] hoover_damm: but that's kinda life sometimes
[2012-06-01 16:53:50 -0400] hoover_damm: i'll have my graphite cookbook updated or multiple carbon-caches
[2012-06-01 16:53:55 -0400] hoover_damm: and relay under runit
[2012-06-01 16:54:03 -0400] hoover_damm: and on 0.9.10 :)
[2012-06-01 16:58:46 -0400] hoover_damm: .. /opt/opscode/embedded/lib/libxml2.so: undefined reference to `gzopen64@ZLIB_1.2.3.3'
[2012-06-01 17:00:49 -0400] hoover_damm: oh duh
[2012-06-01 17:00:54 -0400] hoover_damm: build on natty, run on precise
[2012-06-01 17:00:58 -0400] hoover_damm: valid bug on myself bad on me
[2012-06-01 17:02:10 -0400] jtimberman: sascha_d: weblogic? :)
[2012-06-01 17:02:18 -0400] sascha_d: ATG
[2012-06-01 17:02:25 -0400] jtimberman: just as bad
[2012-06-01 17:02:30 -0400] jtimberman: ;)
[2012-06-01 17:02:35 -0400] jtimberman: (hard to automate enterprisey software)
[2012-06-01 17:02:43 -0400] sascha_d: yes, that's the thing. I'm not sure anyone would bother to automate it even if we handed them a free tool
[2012-06-01 17:02:58 -0400] sascha_d: owait
[2012-06-01 17:03:05 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, any xvfb cookbooks yet for automating X installs?
[2012-06-01 17:03:13 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damm: i don't know
[2012-06-01 17:03:25 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, I've always had a few installers that fire up X... man if I could automate those
[2012-06-01 17:03:28 -0400] hoover_damm: dope!
[2012-06-01 17:03:38 -0400] jtimberman: there's a thing that atomic-penguin made for oracle requirements
[2012-06-01 17:03:48 -0400] jtimberman: ckbk.it/oracle I guess?
[2012-06-01 17:03:49 -0400] atomic-penguin: yup
[2012-06-01 17:03:52 -0400] jtimberman: maybe helpful
[2012-06-01 17:04:15 -0400] atomic-penguin: its certified "works for me"
[2012-06-01 17:06:32 -0400] atomic-penguin: we treat most of the ERP tree and Oracle stuff as data, just restore it from backup
[2012-06-01 17:06:52 -0400] atomic-penguin: or even rsync it for migrations
[2012-06-01 17:07:21 -0400] atomic-penguin: isn't weblogic a fancy Oracle name for Apache?
[2012-06-01 17:07:53 -0400] sascha_d: no, it's closer to jboss
[2012-06-01 17:08:01 -0400] sascha_d: in function
[2012-06-01 17:08:33 -0400] atomic-penguin: I must be thinking of Oracle Application Server, or Fusion, or whatever they call it this year
[2012-06-01 17:10:44 -0400] atomic-penguin: Enterprisey software *usually* comes with a big long check sheet, and "insert disc here".  I go with automate the enterprisey check sheet, not the insert disc here.
[2012-06-01 17:11:36 -0400] hoover_damm: Honestly that's the hardest part of configuration management
[2012-06-01 17:11:42 -0400] hoover_damm: is automating things that are not easy to automate
[2012-06-01 17:12:47 -0400] jtimberman: has someone foudn the command-line way to auto-enable Java on OS X lion?
[2012-06-01 17:12:55 -0400] jtimberman: because I'd love to drop that into the java cookbook.
[2012-06-01 17:13:23 -0400] atomic-penguin: The Apache that comes with Oracle Application Server has its own expectations, and layout, you wouldn't be able to break that component away from the enterprisey software easily and manage it with say "apache2"
[2012-06-01 17:13:33 -0400] jtimberman: right
[2012-06-01 17:13:39 -0400] jtimberman: IBM is the same with IBM HTTPD

[2012-06-01 19:10:18 -0400] fnichol: jtimberman: I haven't found anything automagic yet for mac/java. So far I've been firing `java` *before* I do my initial chef run :(
[2012-06-01 19:12:16 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol: yeah. i got prompted on the new laptop while chef-client was running (I think the ohai plugin runs java). i don't need it for anything i'm doing in chef, and just clicked the button.
[2012-06-01 19:13:10 -0400] fnichol: jtimberman: yeah, that was my first experience with new-style java installs in Lion. I was like, wha!?
[2012-06-01 19:26:11 -0400] atomic-penguin: hey fnichol, have fun in mexico?
[2012-06-01 19:28:26 -0400] fnichol: oh yeah, it was a great break. although i kept a tiny daily commit going each day to keep up my record :)
[2012-06-01 19:29:39 -0400] atomic-penguin: fnichol, I tried out your chef-rvm stuff to build my jenkins up
[2012-06-01 19:30:27 -0400] fnichol: and ... great success? total failure?
[2012-06-01 19:30:27 -0400] atomic-penguin: fnichol, for some reason the LWRP wouldn't work, but that big ugly attribute structure does work
[2012-06-01 19:30:48 -0400] fnichol: ha, yeah that thing gives me nightmares and should be attributes by now
[2012-06-01 19:30:55 -0400] fnichol: the rvm_ruby LWRP?
[2012-06-01 19:31:15 -0400] atomic-penguin: The user recipe, to install rvm for jenkins
[2012-06-01 19:31:32 -0400] atomic-penguin: Apparently jenkins comes with its own rvm plugin, which doesn't work either
[2012-06-01 19:31:56 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol: rbenv cookbook was an awesome thing for me
[2012-06-01 19:32:07 -0400] jtimberman: once i set all the package attributes to [] instead of ["git"] :)
[2012-06-01 19:32:12 -0400] fnichol: Huh, that is unfortunate. I haven't tried using it myself
[2012-06-01 19:32:25 -0400] jtimberman: (brew install git apparently doesn't work w/ just the GCC for OSX installer)
[2012-06-01 19:32:32 -0400] atomic-penguin: Once you have rvm in there for jenkins, it totally detects that shit though
[2012-06-01 19:32:55 -0400] atomic-penguin: Don't know if jenkins, is rbenv aware
[2012-06-01 19:33:05 -0400] fnichol: jtimberman: argh. that's messed up! I've been holding back with a full xcode 4.1 on lion so far
[2012-06-01 19:34:28 -0400] fnichol: atomic-penguin, i don't know if there's a plugin for rbenv, but i set up our jenkins at work with rbenv and it's been good so far
[2012-06-01 19:35:02 -0400] fnichol: although rvm would allow you to auto-install versions of rubies just by mentioning them. something that i'd only like on a ci server :0
[2012-06-01 19:35:30 -0400] atomic-penguin: fnichol, exactly
[2012-06-01 19:35:35 -0400] fnichol: jtimberman: hm, I wonder if I could detect that gcc-osx-installer and act accordingly
[2012-06-01 19:36:02 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol: i think it'd be better if brew install git just worked :)
[2012-06-01 19:36:13 -0400] jtimberman: though Lion has /usr/bin/git
[2012-06-01 19:36:23 -0400] fnichol: jtimberman: well, you're right there.
[2012-06-01 19:36:30 -0400] jtimberman: -rwxr-xr-x  109 root  wheel  2500640 May 16  2011 /usr/bin/git
[2012-06-01 19:36:52 -0400] jtimberman: so, if platform osx and version >= 10.7...?
[2012-06-01 19:37:02 -0400] jtimberman: there's also the 'git' cookbook :)
[2012-06-01 19:37:09 -0400] jtimberman: which supports OS X installing the "Git" package.
[2012-06-01 19:37:18 -0400] fnichol: jtimberman: because i install xcode so fast i couldn't remember if git ships with vanilla lion or comes with a dev toolcahin
[2012-06-01 19:37:43 -0400] jtimberman: GitOSX.Installer.git1794.git.pkg
[2012-06-01 19:38:00 -0400] jtimberman: i think its in vanilla lion
[2012-06-01 19:38:06 -0400] fnichol: jtimberman: no, you're right. now that mac_os_x(_server)? is starting to spread into other cookbooks i think we could use that as a dependency
[2012-06-01 19:39:59 -0400] atomic-penguin: I find it disconcerting that ark installs in /usr/local, even when I pass --prefix=/usr as a configure option
[2012-06-01 19:41:20 -0400] atomic-penguin: The path attributes in that library make my head hurt
[2012-06-01 19:41:52 -0400] atomic-penguin: Although it really is quite a slick library at the same time
[2012-06-01 19:53:22 -0400] yfeldblum: fnichol, hey there!
[2012-06-01 20:02:10 -0400] fnichol: yfeldblum: hey! how are you!
[2012-06-01 20:02:28 -0400] fnichol: woah, gotta tone down my !'s
[2012-06-01 20:02:50 -0400] yfeldblum: fnichol, swamped, but doing alright
[2012-06-01 20:03:42 -0400] fnichol: yfeldblum, so I'm going to have to head your way some day to meet in person :)
[2012-06-01 20:05:46 -0400] atomic-penguin: fnichol, yfeldblum has been providing tech support for your chef-rvm to random users in your absence
[2012-06-01 20:05:58 -0400] yfeldblum: fnichol, that would be cool
[2012-06-01 20:07:24 -0400] fnichol: holy shit, thank you!
[2012-06-01 20:07:34 -0400] yfeldblum: heh no probs
[2012-06-01 20:07:41 -0400] yfeldblum: also, !'s ?
[2012-06-01 20:07:44 -0400] yfeldblum: :P
[2012-06-01 20:12:17 -0400] atomic-penguin: yfeldblum, where are you located?
