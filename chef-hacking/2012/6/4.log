[2012-06-04 01:20:51 -0400] jtimberman: jbarnette: :D
[2012-06-04 01:21:37 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: So full disclosure, this is something I'm hacking on in both Chef and Puppet for various reasons, including a talk, so apologies in advance if I'm consorting with the enemy or something :)
[2012-06-04 01:21:58 -0400] jtimberman: its cool
[2012-06-04 01:22:13 -0400] jtimberman: I use apache *and* nginx :)
[2012-06-04 01:22:15 -0400] jtimberman: e.g.
[2012-06-04 01:22:21 -0400] jtimberman: (or django and rails, etc)
[2012-06-04 01:22:30 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: I've been working a fair amount recently on dev environment automation for a really wide-ranging set of folks, from people who use VMs exclusively to devs and designers who do everything on their Mac laptop.
[2012-06-04 01:22:37 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, emacs *and* vim?
[2012-06-04 01:22:59 -0400] jbarnette: yfeldblum: Let's not get crazy here.
[2012-06-04 01:23:09 -0400] jtimberman: i've used both emacs *and* vim today, in fact.
[2012-06-04 01:23:19 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, how did that make you feel?
[2012-06-04 01:23:37 -0400] miah: i hate that people equate opinions, and software to religion.
[2012-06-04 01:23:51 -0400] jtimberman: heeheh
[2012-06-04 01:23:55 -0400] jtimberman:   377* 2012-06-03 16:22  0:00  git clone git@github.com:jtimberman/dotvim.git .vim
[2012-06-04 01:24:02 -0400] jtimberman: i actually didn't have my vim config on this laptop yet.
[2012-06-04 01:24:05 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: One interesting consequence of this environment work is that automatically running any configuration management tool is poison: I don't ever want to change things under someone who's working.
[2012-06-04 01:24:05 -0400] jtimberman: so anyway
[2012-06-04 01:24:13 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: I can multitask :)
[2012-06-04 01:24:25 -0400] jbarnette: miah: Hey, people have to get crazy about *something*
[2012-06-04 01:25:04 -0400] miah: i'm just crazy in general. no need to specialize on insanity.
[2012-06-04 01:25:19 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: Anyhow, all this is working in a very pleasant and modular way, modulo a few bumps in the road, but we're getting to the point where -- especially for non-dev folks -- we're going to have a nice little icon that glows blue in the menubar when your dev environment is out-of-date.
[2012-06-04 01:25:54 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: When someone chooses to update their dev env, I'd really like to be able to give them sane progress and output in a more GUI-friendly way. You can see how this potentially requires access to the resource graph. :)
[2012-06-04 01:26:34 -0400] jtimberman: totally
[2012-06-04 01:26:41 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: Puppet has a noop mode that appears to allow me to see to some degree of truthfulness what's about to happen to a system, but IIRC Chef is kinda philosophically opposed to that, right?
[2012-06-04 01:26:51 -0400] jtimberman: not entirely opposed
[2012-06-04 01:27:03 -0400] jtimberman: philosophical sidebar!
[2012-06-04 01:27:16 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: it's the weekend, philosophical sidebars are mandatory
[2012-06-04 01:27:16 -0400] jtimberman: the thing about a no-op mode in *any* tool is it has to make assumptions about the state.
[2012-06-04 01:27:57 -0400] jtimberman: like, if i have "package foo" and "service foo" but i didn't have "template service-file-foo", there has to be an assumption that in order to manage the service, the service file for it (like an init script of course) was dropped off by the package.
[2012-06-04 01:28:54 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: you basically mean that resources must be completely capable of saying whether they're currently satisfied or not, right? idempotence can't exist outside the tool if it's going to reliably offer noon
[2012-06-04 01:28:56 -0400] jtimberman: we're actually in the middle of adding a no-op mode feature to chef. its pretty close to being release ready, and is in a branch on the opscode/chef repo.
[2012-06-04 01:29:02 -0400] jbarnette: s/noon/noop/
[2012-06-04 01:29:14 -0400] jtimberman: one of the really nice things about the mode, is that we're also adding something called "output formatters"
[2012-06-04 01:29:40 -0400] jtimberman: which coupled with reporting/exception handling stuff, and chef's normal logging, gives you a rich data set for talking about what might change.
[2012-06-04 01:30:12 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: the holy grail for me would be twofold: 1. loading a graph and getting a structured list of the things that probably need to happen on a node, which allows me to tell people when they're out of date *and* give them a nicely formatted UI to see what's going to happen at a high level,
[2012-06-04 01:30:25 -0400] jtimberman: well, if the resource is declared in the recipe/manifest, then we know we can manage it, since its... declared :). and the tool will take care of converging the node to bring it in line with the declaration.
[2012-06-04 01:30:46 -0400] jbarnette: and 2. the ability to hook in and grab lifecycle events before and after any given resource gets executed so I can show sane, granular progress
[2012-06-04 01:31:07 -0400] jtimberman: yeah.. like, i don't know what UI *we* will ship outside the default output formatters for this part.
[2012-06-04 01:31:43 -0400] jtimberman: the data is available in the resource collection though, any resource that was modified gets marked with "updated", so like, myresource.updated will == true
[2012-06-04 01:32:04 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: man, that would take me a long way
[2012-06-04 01:32:07 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-06-04 01:32:14 -0400] jtimberman: if you want to just play with things
[2012-06-04 01:32:19 -0400] jtimberman: fire up 'shef'
[2012-06-04 01:33:18 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: sweet, glancing at your gist right now
[2012-06-04 01:34:01 -0400] jtimberman: https://gist.github.com/2865800
[2012-06-04 01:34:06 -0400] jtimberman: glance at that gist.
[2012-06-04 01:34:29 -0400] jtimberman: the other one was for demonstrating pry by someone
[2012-06-04 01:36:12 -0400] c_t: are you trying to lure people into looking at your gists?
[2012-06-04 01:36:32 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: that's an awesome way to be able to explore
[2012-06-04 01:36:47 -0400] jtimberman: jbarnette: Yes. Shef makes me happy all the time. I've hugged kallistec for writing it. :)
[2012-06-04 01:37:25 -0400] jtimberman: it has a few quirks about the way it behaves for certain modes, but for general use, it is super handy
[2012-06-04 01:38:45 -0400] jtimberman: this one is fun: https://gist.github.com/1585062
[2012-06-04 01:40:05 -0400] jtimberman: I should do a talk on using Shef.
[2012-06-04 01:40:45 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: yes you should
[2012-06-04 01:43:14 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: thanks for the pointers, i'm going to go play with shef a bit :)
[2012-06-04 01:43:19 -0400] jtimberman: jbarnette: enjoy!
[2012-06-04 01:43:48 -0400] jtimberman: oh!
[2012-06-04 01:43:55 -0400] jtimberman: aside from run_context.resource_collection
[2012-06-04 01:44:00 -0400] jtimberman: you'll be interested in 'resources'
[2012-06-04 03:21:30 -0400] hoover_damm: it'd have to be cleaned up so it could grok roles and not just read a single file as it's runlist ;)
[2012-06-04 03:22:35 -0400] hoover_damm: what it produces is really beautiful for graphviz
[2012-06-04 03:38:02 -0400] hoover_damm: man, I can see how /msg memoserv sendops blah... could get annoying
[2012-06-04 12:56:27 -0400] renchap: any patches for CHEF-2694 ?
[2012-06-04 17:44:00 -0400] github-bawt: [omnibus] btm pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/NnCTJg

[2012-06-04 17:45:03 -0400] fnichol: Happy Monday everyone! So I know the omnibus packages are availble from http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/ but are the open source Chef server omnibus installers available anywhere yet?
[2012-06-04 17:46:27 -0400] hoover_damm: that seems to be the craze lately fnichol
[2012-06-04 17:49:10 -0400] fnichol: you bet, omnibus me my os please :)
[2012-06-04 17:50:19 -0400] btm: fnichol: opscode engineering is working on those this sprint.
[2012-06-04 17:50:36 -0400] btm: fnichol: not sure if they'll be done when we ship 10.12, but close.
[2012-06-04 17:53:46 -0400] fnichol: btm, good to know. it occured to me last week that the chefconf demo could have /just/ been a demo :)
[2012-06-04 17:54:13 -0400] fnichol: but it was impressive, nonetheless

[2012-06-04 17:55:36 -0400] btm: fnichol: its mostly that there's so much tidying up to do. there's a whole CI infrastructure as part of the build system, many platforms, getting stuff onto S3....
[2012-06-04 17:59:50 -0400] fnichol: btm, honestly that sounds like such a fun project :)

[2012-06-04 18:40:38 -0400] btm: yfeldblum: that's the part that takes the time.
[2012-06-04 18:41:14 -0400] yfeldblum: btm, thought chef was a magical fairyland of instaneneiety
[2012-06-04 18:42:33 -0400] btm: yfeldblum: hug-driven-development still takes time, unlike magical ponies.
