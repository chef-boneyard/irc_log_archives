[2012-06-20 17:28:59 -0400] miah: comments: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/OHAI-385
[2012-06-20 17:30:49 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah i figured you'd hit that miah
[2012-06-20 17:31:54 -0400] yfeldblum: miah, what about platforms that do not have a major/minor structure to their versions?
[2012-06-20 17:35:23 -0400] miah: then that value would be nil?
[2012-06-20 17:36:03 -0400] miah: but fwiw, many platforms have major/minor
[2012-06-20 17:36:45 -0400] miah: obviously, archlinux wouldn't have one...
[2012-06-20 17:37:50 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah we laughed when we had to import percona into ey's gentoo linux
[2012-06-20 17:37:56 -0400] hoover_damm: thankfully gentoo didn't give a hoot
[2012-06-20 17:40:03 -0400] miah: its possible that this is just something more useful for yum usage. but i suspect it could be usful in other instances as well.
[2012-06-20 18:01:03 -0400] new-chef-guy: any one use iptables?
[2012-06-20 18:01:49 -0400] new-chef-guy: I am trying to limit the outbound network traffic but it seems the to talk to hosted chef you need several ports to be open besides 443
[2012-06-20 18:02:10 -0400] new-chef-guy: any one have experience with this?
[2012-06-20 18:07:00 -0400] miah: just remember: loading iptables on your server will negatively impact your network performance
[2012-06-20 18:18:58 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, but how much?
[2012-06-20 18:19:13 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, regular profiling 3% or more? i always wondered
[2012-06-20 18:19:32 -0400] hoover_damm: i know it's dependent on load/etc likely
[2012-06-20 18:25:25 -0400] miah: its dependant on lots of things.
[2012-06-20 18:25:35 -0400] miah: but especially if you are dealing with lots of packets =)
[2012-06-20 19:45:26 -0400] hoover_damm: and what kind of rules you have
[2012-06-20 19:45:30 -0400] hoover_damm: ... yeah
[2012-06-20 19:45:34 -0400] hoover_damm: but that's why you have fast cpu's
[2012-06-20 20:00:04 -0400] laurent\: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-948 this specific issue happens to me every now and then, I just have to restart chef-client for it to go away
[2012-06-20 20:01:13 -0400] laurent\: is there a CHEF ticket for it ?
[2012-06-20 20:02:24 -0400] laurent\: I'm pretty sure it does impact quite a considerable number of people
[2012-06-20 20:05:19 -0400] jtimberman: laurent\: well, for the mysql ruby bindings, there's a couple tickets about that, and i just haven't had a chance to sit down and make a solid fix.
[2012-06-20 20:06:59 -0400] laurent\: oh nothing do to with the mysql ruby binding, it's more of a gem_package issue
[2012-06-20 20:07:20 -0400] laurent\: "gem_package[mysql] (mysql::client line 46) had an error: NoMethodError: undefined method `full_name' for nil:NilClass"
[2012-06-20 20:08:54 -0400] laurent\: i'm pretty sure there's already a opened chefticket for that, but i can't find it anymore
[2012-06-20 20:12:23 -0400] jtimberman: ah, i dunno
[2012-06-20 20:12:29 -0400] laurent\: not that i'm saying the jira search is not satisfactory, i wouldn't like you to replace jira by google ;-)
[2012-06-20 20:14:57 -0400] laurent\: btw when i want to search the mailing list, i just feed some keyworks + site:lists.opscode.com to google
[2012-06-20 20:17:13 -0400] jtimberman: laurent\: yes... however... soon the lists are going to be google groups (per recent discussion by Jesse on the main list)
[2012-06-20 20:17:18 -0400] hoover_damm: So, anyone been noticing AWS errors on the 'aws' cookbook? I say this as I basically traced it back to AWS API failures
[2012-06-20 20:17:38 -0400] hoover_damm: basic ebs volume create, nothing too special
[2012-06-20 20:17:43 -0400] hoover_damm: had to add a rescue / retry
[2012-06-20 20:17:50 -0400] hoover_damm: it worked
[2012-06-20 20:17:53 -0400] hoover_damm: but dammit!
[2012-06-20 20:17:58 -0400] hoover_damm: that's not the right way to fix it
[2012-06-20 20:18:02 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damm: i think there's a retries parameter available to all resources now
[2012-06-20 20:18:05 -0400] jtimberman: should work on that one
[2012-06-20 20:18:22 -0400] erratic: I need to clear my solr indexes and rebuild them
[2012-06-20 20:18:29 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, ths provider is failing around def currently_attached_volume
[2012-06-20 20:18:54 -0400] hoover_damm: not so straight forward
[2012-06-20 20:19:12 -0400] hoover_damm: we have about 3k volumes setup right now
[2012-06-20 20:19:17 -0400] hoover_damm: so ec2-describe-volumes is pretty heavy
[2012-06-20 20:19:32 -0400] hoover_damm: or ec2.describe.volumes.find :)
[2012-06-20 20:19:37 -0400] jtimberman: :O
[2012-06-20 20:19:43 -0400] jtimberman: thats a lot of volumes sir
[2012-06-20 20:19:46 -0400] hoover_damm: nah
[2012-06-20 20:19:48 -0400] hoover_damm: not really
[2012-06-20 20:19:56 -0400] hoover_damm: jaimie has more then me by far
[2012-06-20 20:20:00 -0400] erratic: you guys use a lot of amazon stuff
[2012-06-20 20:20:08 -0400] hoover_damm: i remember when jaimie busted our ebs limit
[2012-06-20 20:20:12 -0400] hoover_damm: and snapshot limit
[2012-06-20 20:20:19 -0400] hoover_damm: and amazon told us 'no sir we can't give you more'
[2012-06-20 20:20:22 -0400] hoover_damm: and we had to tell him :(
[2012-06-20 20:20:50 -0400] hoover_damm: the 5000 volume limit is per region so it's not a huge foul
[2012-06-20 20:20:52 -0400] hoover_damm: and 20tb is real
[2012-06-20 20:21:02 -0400] hoover_damm: a lot of folks can hit 20tb very easily when they ebs raid
[2012-06-20 20:21:15 -0400] hoover_damm: so yes I absolutely did that
[2012-06-20 20:21:56 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, https://gist.github.com/551626790d3f480e57d4
[2012-06-20 20:21:58 -0400] erratic: http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/how-to-reset-the-index-in-solr-td496574.html
[2012-06-20 20:22:07 -0400] hoover_damm: horrible huh?
[2012-06-20 20:29:13 -0400] mattray: reminds me of the Cycle Computing talk at ChefConf. After the talk I was talking with the speaker and he said they were looking at other clouds because "we can't get enough cores on EC2"
[2012-06-20 20:37:52 -0400] laurent\: i don't really mind the move to google groups, at first i was a bit surprised by the reasons but in the end i'm pretty sure you guys always make the right choice :-)
[2012-06-20 20:39:29 -0400] mattray: I just set up one for opscode-chef-openstack, it seems pretty good for now
[2012-06-20 20:42:34 -0400] laurent\: mattray: can you give me an url so i can subscribe to it please ?
[2012-06-20 20:43:09 -0400] mattray: http://groups.google.com/group/opscode-chef-openstack
[2012-06-20 20:43:35 -0400] mattray: I'm just populating a few status emails to get it started, we'll have a bigger announcement next week
[2012-06-20 20:46:33 -0400] laurent\: hmm so to join it  i need to sign in to google. just need to throw an incognito/private browsing session.
[2012-06-20 20:48:00 -0400] laurent\: lets hope facebook never does groups/mailing list :)
[2012-06-20 20:49:18 -0400] laurent\: to be honnest, the drawback is definitely the google registration
[2012-06-20 20:50:21 -0400] mattray: yeah
[2012-06-20 20:50:45 -0400] mattray: email management and forums are a time-consuming beast
[2012-06-20 20:51:22 -0400] mattray: if it wasn't publicly viewable we wouldn't use it
[2012-06-20 20:51:50 -0400] mattray: but as the mailing list thread showed, there aren't a lot of great alternatives out there
[2012-06-20 21:09:13 -0400] laurent\: please forgive me if it sounds a bit blunt or too frank, but I felt like the decision was already made when the thread started.
[2012-06-20 21:11:31 -0400] mattray: laurent\: we'd already looked at alternatives and didn't want to do it ourselves. So the decision was researched but we'd hoped someone would have some compelling evidence to change our minds
[2012-06-20 21:11:43 -0400] mattray: at least, that's my take
[2012-06-20 21:23:19 -0400] laurent\: mattray: we do use sympa here and we do have like thousands of lists, despite the move to 6.1.something to get a more modern interface i still don't like it, i don't think the archive browsing is straightforward and I'm pretty sure the non-computer-geeks don't even give it a try
[2012-06-20 21:32:33 -0400] laurent\: but i wouldn't replace it by facebook groups
[2012-06-20 21:32:50 -0400] laurent\: err, google groups
[2012-06-20 21:36:31 -0400] laurent\: every time i speak Jesse quits ! is that a sign ? :-)
