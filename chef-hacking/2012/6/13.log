[2012-06-13 18:52:32 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/whyrun] [reporting] hide nested resources from reporting - Daniel DeLeo
[2012-06-13 19:09:33 -0400] hoover_damm: Hey, so what omnibus build system is the current system now? omnibus-software or omnibus?
[2012-06-13 19:09:56 -0400] hoover_damm: I was going to update to p194 and update our own packages internally and wanted to do it from the right current path
[2012-06-13 19:10:01 -0400] hoover_damm: Thanks
[2012-06-13 19:33:42 -0400] kisoku: hrm. is it possible to use a chef handler shipped in a gem directly from the chef_handler lwrp ?
[2012-06-13 19:35:52 -0400] kisoku: I've tried something like this with little success https://gist.github.com/2925977
[2012-06-13 19:38:21 -0400] kisoku: hrm
[2012-06-13 19:38:39 -0400] kisoku: adding a "gem 'chef-handler-mail'" seems to make it work
[2012-06-13 19:39:08 -0400] kisoku: one would think chef_gem would do all of the magix required to use the bloody thing right away
[2012-06-13 19:39:13 -0400] kisoku: :-P
[2012-06-13 20:14:53 -0400] josephholsten: ugh
[2012-06-13 20:15:37 -0400] josephholsten: anyone know about mixlib-shellout in windows?
[2012-06-13 20:32:34 -0400] josephholsten: where does get_last_error come from?
[2012-06-13 20:36:26 -0400] fnichol: kisoku: yes I thought that chef_gem should handle a gem install in the pre-converge phase. there's a cookbook on the community site which shims in chef_gem for older chef versions
[2012-06-13 20:44:57 -0400] spox: it also fixes chef_gem in 10.10 omnibus installs :)
[2012-06-13 21:15:21 -0400] kisoku: so it does install the gem nicely
[2012-06-13 21:15:32 -0400] kisoku: but is doesn't load the gem
[2012-06-13 21:15:48 -0400] kisoku: so if you want to require something that is installed by the gem
[2012-06-13 21:16:06 -0400] kisoku: you still need to call "gem" after "chef_gem"
[2012-06-13 21:16:49 -0400] kisoku: I
[2012-06-13 21:16:51 -0400] spox: right. it doesn't know that actual name of the library to be included
[2012-06-13 21:16:58 -0400] spox: chef_gem 'orderedhash'
[2012-06-13 21:17:01 -0400] spox: require 'orderedhash'
[2012-06-13 21:17:04 -0400] kisoku: I've updated my gist to reflect reality
[2012-06-13 21:17:06 -0400] spox: generally

[2012-06-13 21:25:34 -0400] countdigi: just curious what part of chef is checking this?
[2012-06-13 21:25:36 -0400] countdigi:  DEBUG: Platform aix not found, using all defaults. (Unsupported platform?)
[2012-06-13 21:25:58 -0400] countdigi: is it the main provider code?
[2012-06-13 21:47:26 -0400] c_t: countdigi: that's in ohai
[2012-06-13 21:47:44 -0400] countdigi: gotcha tx
[2012-06-13 21:47:54 -0400] countdigi: i know aix gets no love in devops :-)
[2012-06-13 21:48:06 -0400] c_t: I was just wondering the other day how chef would do with AIX, actually
[2012-06-13 21:48:31 -0400] countdigi: i am going to probably write some lwrp for it
[2012-06-13 21:48:59 -0400] countdigi: ironically aix actually has a decent object model for most of its stuff but so few use it it probably doesn't make sense for chef/puppet to spend a lot of time on it
[2012-06-13 21:49:46 -0400] countdigi: unfortunately u cant just fire up an aix vm in virtualbox ;-)
[2012-06-13 22:11:43 -0400] josephholsten: mmm libvirt wrapper for vm/cms

[2012-06-13 22:47:20 -0400] josephholsten: Anyone know the maintainer/repo for http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/solr ?
[2012-06-13 22:49:34 -0400] mattray: josephholsten: jtimberman is listed as a Collaborator
[2012-06-13 22:49:59 -0400] mattray: bug him about it and if the guy doesn't show up, I guess we can replace him
[2012-06-13 22:50:18 -0400] josephholsten: yes, it's an old opscode-cookbook, removed in the great unmaintaining
[2012-06-13 22:50:28 -0400] josephholsten: no releases since
[2012-06-13 22:50:53 -0400] josephholsten: will do
[2012-06-13 22:53:48 -0400] hoover_damm: josephholsten, why you wanted to update the solr cookbook?
[2012-06-13 22:57:53 -0400] josephholsten: my guys are already running on solr, I don't have the bandwidth to investigate elastic search today
[2012-06-13 23:04:33 -0400] hoover_damm: Elasticsearch is the bees knees
[2012-06-13 23:04:45 -0400] hoover_damm: I got hooked on that cracker jack when I was working at EY

[2012-06-13 23:29:34 -0400] renchap: elasticsearch <3
[2012-06-13 23:31:19 -0400] hoover_damm: Every time a client asks me to help them setup Sphinx I cry
[2012-06-13 23:31:27 -0400] hoover_damm: or scale sphinx
[2012-06-13 23:31:43 -0400] hoover_damm: and then you get the 'I need a dedicated Database replica for just sphinx'
[2012-06-13 23:32:05 -0400] hoover_damm: indexing shouldn't be that silly
