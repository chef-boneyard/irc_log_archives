[2012-06-05 01:47:03 -0400] fujin: who can I talk to about getting a few orgs migrated to erlchef?
[2012-06-05 02:19:16 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: er?
[2012-06-05 02:19:45 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: the erlang endpoints on hosted chef are on search and nodes, but no others now. they're the same for all orgs on hosted.
[2012-06-05 02:19:57 -0400] hoover_damm: so we're all on erlchef?
[2012-06-05 02:19:59 -0400] jtimberman: i am not sure if any other endpoints have been moved.
[2012-06-05 02:20:05 -0400] hoover_damm: for said endpoints
[2012-06-05 02:20:09 -0400] jtimberman: yes
[2012-06-05 02:20:19 -0400] hoover_damm: sorry was just confirming what it sounded like you said :)
[2012-06-05 02:21:46 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: I saw a merb HTTP error on a node call, thus the question
[2012-06-05 02:21:59 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: I recall seth mentioning something about maybe contacting to be bumped up
[2012-06-05 02:22:04 -0400] fujin: maybe invented. who cares
[2012-06-05 02:22:05 -0400] fujin: disregard
[2012-06-05 02:22:29 -0400] hoover_damm: fujin, using lxc for testing?
[2012-06-05 02:23:11 -0400] fujin: no.
[2012-06-05 02:23:26 -0400] fujin: well maybe, but not currently.
[2012-06-05 02:23:56 -0400] fujin: hoover_damm: why's that?
[2012-06-05 02:24:16 -0400] hoover_damm: been pondering it
[2012-06-05 02:24:29 -0400] hoover_damm: it would be an quick an easy build up / destroy
[2012-06-05 02:24:45 -0400] fujin: a-huh
[2012-06-05 02:24:46 -0400] hoover_damm: and one thing i love about testing is pristine environments... and with snapshots I think I can test regressions
[2012-06-05 02:24:47 -0400] fujin: https://github.com/exceedhl/toft
[2012-06-05 02:25:00 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah i need to ponder toft more
[2012-06-05 02:25:09 -0400] fujin: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci
[2012-06-05 02:25:11 -0400] fujin: uses vbox
[2012-06-05 02:25:20 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah i'm trying to skip virtualization
[2012-06-05 02:25:59 -0400] fujin: we're going to use lxc for a lot of stuff
[2012-06-05 02:26:33 -0400] hoover_damm: I was going to drop my graphite stuff in lxc but I kinda got strapped for time and realized that'd be more confusing then heck
[2012-06-05 02:27:27 -0400] hoover_damm: gotta love how scaling makes you evolve your cookbooks
[2012-06-05 02:31:19 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: yeah i don't know if there's an early migration thing, email support to find out?
[2012-06-05 02:37:23 -0400] fujin: sure
[2012-06-05 02:37:27 -0400] fujin: thx
[2012-06-05 07:00:10 -0400] nico: anyone using chef with virtualbox/vagrant around ?
[2012-06-05 07:00:35 -0400] nico: ohai network/interfaces is empty for me, but I can't see where the fail is
[2012-06-05 11:55:41 -0400] Mithrandir: hmm, it seems like the cron provider explodes in interesting ways if you feed it weekdays instead of weekdaynumbers
[2012-06-05 11:55:55 -0400] nico: nice
[2012-06-05 13:41:26 -0400] zined: ohai! :)
[2012-06-05 15:36:19 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, sorry to move it here...
[2012-06-05 15:36:32 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, basically I have 2 roles currently that really are 1 role.
[2012-06-05 15:36:50 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, cron and worker.  The only difference is one has cron entries, and runs resque:scheduler
[2012-06-05 15:36:59 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, outside of that it has no real difference between the two
[2012-06-05 15:37:24 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, to try and make that neater I was removing the cron role and making it search to determine if it was the first node or not, and if it was... set up those services
[2012-06-05 15:38:09 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, the reason i'm moving from the second role is they load application::#{node.roles.first}
[2012-06-05 15:38:12 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, so it's drying up code
[2012-06-05 15:39:12 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, i would go the opposite direction: you have two purposes, so they get two roles, even if the implementations are very similar; it's about the interface, about the intention, not about the implementation; if the implementations are very similar, you can certainly delegate most of the implementations to a shared recipe
[2012-06-05 15:39:40 -0400] hoover_damm: well the shared state is only momentary
[2012-06-05 15:41:15 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, the second role can simply set a node attribute, and the recipe backing both roles can check the node attribute and see whether the node is intended to be a normal worker or primary worker node
[2012-06-05 15:42:16 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, the first role wouldn't set the node attribute, and its absence would be interpreted by the recipe to mean the node is a normal worker node
[2012-06-05 15:42:44 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, or you could have a single role, and just set that attribute at the normal level via `knife node edit`
[2012-06-05 15:43:08 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, i like to use tags for a similar purpose, actually
[2012-06-05 15:43:36 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, perhaps tags would work...
[2012-06-05 15:43:46 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, if a node has a particular tag that is recognized by the recipe, then the node is a primary worker; else it's a normal worker
[2012-06-05 15:43:47 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, I mean secondary roles work but I really don't want that so i'm trying different
[2012-06-05 15:44:23 -0400] hoover_damm: it's just the chore of working with rails
[2012-06-05 15:44:24 -0400] hoover_damm: hehe
[2012-06-05 15:44:26 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, tags are just a normal-level attribute anyway with some special methods around it
[2012-06-05 15:45:07 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, so it's actually just a particular instance of the `knife node edit` normal-level attributes strategy
[2012-06-05 15:46:17 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, well i've always wanted to use tags to identify more...
[2012-06-05 15:46:27 -0400] hoover_damm: they just feel more natural then roles in this regard
[2012-06-05 15:46:34 -0400] hoover_damm: and that's wrong thinking
[2012-06-05 15:47:25 -0400] yfeldblum: they're both fine to me; the particular choice of strategy will depend on how roles are thought of: as code, as data, or some roles are code and some roles are data
[2012-06-05 15:48:15 -0400] yfeldblum: tags are always data; if what you want is data and you think of roles as being code, then you may want tags rather than roles for this case
[2012-06-05 15:48:47 -0400] hoover_damm: roles do more then just identify, they can setup attributes, runlist, etc
[2012-06-05 15:48:55 -0400] hoover_damm: where as a tag can just say 'hey i'm also this'
[2012-06-05 15:51:01 -0400] yfeldblum: heh ... there's no intrinsic notion of identifying that inheres in either tags or roles ... that just happens to be how you're thinking about tags and roles in this particular case :P
[2012-06-05 15:51:46 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, perception is 9/10th's of the law
[2012-06-05 15:51:49 -0400] yfeldblum: :P
[2012-06-05 15:52:30 -0400] yfeldblum: these are primitives, and everyone needs to have some way of assembling the primitives and constructing a coherent whole
[2012-06-05 15:54:56 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-06-05 15:55:03 -0400] yfeldblum: e.g. putting roles and data bag items into git may be an element of your way of assembling and constructing, but leaving them out of git may be an element of my way ... there are many options, and none is necessarily intrinsically better, but everyone needs to choose an option and go with it :P
[2012-06-05 15:56:38 -0400] yfeldblum: SOWH
[2012-06-05 15:56:42 -0400] yfeldblum: everyone needs one
[2012-06-05 15:57:02 -0400] yfeldblum: (strong opinion, weakly held)
[2012-06-05 16:01:54 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, I haven't really formed an opinion on how to structure your app
[2012-06-05 16:02:20 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, I've always come in to help out with this or that.  But I've never really created from the beginning in some time
[2012-06-05 16:02:55 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, I've always pondered if ZooKeeper / ZooKeeperlike services and Chef are getting closer
[2012-06-05 16:03:09 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, I store a lot of the same data in Chef that I would toss in ZK...
[2012-06-05 16:06:51 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, there are some things that chef just plain and simple has no support for that are sometimes necessary, and for which you may need something like zookeeper: e.g., HTTP PUT with If-Match support for data bag items
[2012-06-05 16:08:44 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, not that zk has that either necessary, just that that's a way to do optimistic determinism within concurrency that chef doesn't support, and zk might have another way to support it
[2012-06-05 16:10:04 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, so at least for the moment, you may still need a separate bus and a separate coordination server etc
[2012-06-05 16:11:17 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, it would certainly be nice if chef started integrating a bus and integrating some coordination server etc, but we shall see
[2012-06-05 16:23:00 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah
[2012-06-05 16:23:04 -0400] hoover_damm: that's .12? or .14?
[2012-06-05 16:23:05 -0400] hoover_damm: i forget
[2012-06-05 20:53:42 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] lamont-opscode pushed 1 new commit to whyrun: http://git.io/Xfikog

[2012-06-05 21:40:25 -0400] yfeldblum: aws probably fails things on purpose in order to impel you to write code that can tolerate and recover from failures
[2012-06-05 21:54:45 -0400] miah: well, i dont think aws does it on purpose. but thats still a task you should practice
