[2012-06-14 04:16:37 -0400] jtimberman: josephholsten: yeah uh, i haven't touched that cb in a while
[2012-06-14 04:17:01 -0400] jtimberman: i'm collaborator because i was previously maintainer
[2012-06-14 12:00:54 -0400] ashb: whats the procedure for getting a cookbook pull request taken?
[2012-06-14 12:01:28 -0400] ashb: I signed the dev agreement awhile back, forked the repo, submitted a ticket on tickets.opscode and then did a pull request with the ticket name as the branch name
[2012-06-14 12:01:40 -0400] ashb: is that it or do I need to do anything else?
[2012-06-14 12:05:36 -0400] yfeldblum: ashb, "And critically, in order for any fixes to be found by the Opscode triage team, any tickets that include fixes should have the ticket status changed to resolved, with the resolution stating "fixed"."
[2012-06-14 12:08:39 -0400] ashb: ah thought there was something like that, but Jira confuses me
[2012-06-14 12:09:19 -0400] ashb: yfeldblum: yeah, how do i do that?
[2012-06-14 12:10:05 -0400] ashb: Mor Actions just has 'Stop watching', 'Create Sub-Task', and 'Clone'
[2012-06-14 12:12:23 -0400] yfeldblum: ashb, you may need to contact opscode support to get perms adjusted
[2012-06-14 12:12:29 -0400] ashb: supprt@ ?
[2012-06-14 12:12:30 -0400] yfeldblum: support@opscode.com
[2012-06-14 12:12:32 -0400] ashb: ta
[2012-06-14 15:18:12 -0400] geekbri: Once you sign the CLA they usually change your perms
[2012-06-14 15:28:21 -0400] geekbri: within a day or so
[2012-06-14 18:12:02 -0400] hoover_damm: my apologies for the sales talk in #chef heh
[2012-06-14 18:12:20 -0400] hoover_damm: It just seemed like a good idea as aslan's been around awhile and always needs help
[2012-06-14 18:18:38 -0400] mattray: it's always nice to have people not working for Opscode say nice things
[2012-06-14 18:19:58 -0400] hoover_damm: I know at times I can be a pain in the butt, but honestly I can't say anything negative really.
[2012-06-14 18:20:16 -0400] hoover_damm: It's not like a love/hate relationship like people have with Apple
[2012-06-14 18:20:18 -0400] hoover_damm: it's just love love.
[2012-06-14 18:20:25 -0400] yfeldblum: mattray, screenshot that
[2012-06-14 18:20:37 -0400] hoover_damm: which part?
[2012-06-14 18:20:37 -0400] bawt_: which part is wrong on the wiki
[2012-06-14 18:20:40 -0400] hoover_damm: the whole thing?
[2012-06-14 18:20:40 -0400] bawt_: the whole thing is written in C with libev
[2012-06-14 18:20:45 -0400] hoover_damm: bawt_, forget the whole thing?
[2012-06-14 18:20:45 -0400] bawt_: couldn't find keyword the whole thing?
[2012-06-14 18:20:50 -0400] yfeldblum: bawttrolling?
[2012-06-14 18:20:52 -0400] hoover_damm: bawt_, forget the whole thing
[2012-06-14 18:20:52 -0400] bawt_: sure
[2012-06-14 18:20:58 -0400] hoover_damm: bawt_, forget which part?
[2012-06-14 18:20:58 -0400] bawt_: couldn't find keyword which part?
[2012-06-14 18:21:00 -0400] hoover_damm: bawt_, forget which part
[2012-06-14 18:21:00 -0400] bawt_: alright
[2012-06-14 18:21:05 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, seriously
[2012-06-14 18:21:17 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, it's a good thing the Markov is turned off
[2012-06-14 18:21:25 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, he used to answer questions
[2012-06-14 18:21:49 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, http://www.xkcd.com/1068/
[2012-06-14 18:22:13 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, irclogs are proof
[2012-06-14 18:22:15 -0400] hoover_damm: search em sometime
[2012-06-14 18:22:32 -0400] hoover_damm: bawt was better then xkcd at times
[2012-06-14 18:23:50 -0400] mattray: http://community.opscode.com/chat/chef-hacking#id-136190 knows all
[2012-06-14 18:24:59 -0400] mattray: yeah, bawt does have the tendency to confuse people sometimes
[2012-06-14 18:25:13 -0400] mattray: more than a few times I've seen people try to talk to it
[2012-06-14 18:27:02 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, :) were you around when markov was enabled?
[2012-06-14 18:28:05 -0400] c_t: at one point, I meant to make a Sarah Palin Markov generator
[2012-06-14 18:28:18 -0400] c_t: I had one working somewhat, but then lost the code
[2012-06-14 18:28:47 -0400] hoover_damm: c_t, http://phrasegenerator.com/
[2012-06-14 18:29:13 -0400] c_t: heh
[2012-06-14 18:29:21 -0400] hoover_damm: The smart investor this season will never insure non-defaulted systemic risks.
[2012-06-14 18:30:41 -0400] yfeldblum: that is actually good advice, but is rarely followed
[2012-06-14 18:30:58 -0400] yfeldblum: just look at the dummies who wrote CDSes on Greek debt
[2012-06-14 18:32:24 -0400] hoover_damm: My supporters know that I have faith in our perseverance, our right to borrow money from Asia and our innocent babies' smiles.
[2012-06-14 18:32:28 -0400] hoover_damm: that better?
[2012-06-14 18:32:40 -0400] yfeldblum: hah, now that is pure nonsense
[2012-06-14 18:33:03 -0400] hoover_damm: When I'm elected, I'll make sure tribal warlords and oil cartels cannot sabotage our iPhone apps.
[2012-06-14 18:33:54 -0400] hoover_damm: try not to abuse phrasegenerator.com too much.  Don't want to ruin your work week

[2012-06-14 23:23:26 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, fwiw i'm going to update my graphite cookbook into a lwrp
[2012-06-14 23:24:25 -0400] hoover_damm: dunno how crazy it'll end up at.  Hopefully not too
[2012-06-14 23:24:59 -0400] hoover_damm: we'll see :)
[2012-06-14 23:31:19 -0400] hoover_damm: just pouring all my knowledge of scaling graphite into a cookbook that can host multiple carbon caches
[2012-06-14 23:31:28 -0400] hoover_damm: and basically turn my setup into an idempotent basic setup
[2012-06-14 23:36:26 -0400] ampledata: man i took a swipe at graphite today
[2012-06-14 23:36:37 -0400] ampledata: after it missed the 2nd django req i was like "wow srsly?"
[2012-06-14 23:36:58 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-06-14 23:37:13 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm gonna fixup my runit pattern with virtualenv so it's +1
[2012-06-14 23:37:18 -0400] hoover_damm: finally got that solid
[2012-06-14 23:37:37 -0400] hoover_damm: had a stupid activation trick that just left an extra wrong stderr process open
