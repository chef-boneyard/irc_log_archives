[2012-06-19 14:07:22 -0400] github-bawt: [omnibus/master] Add more debugging statements to powershell script - Bryan McLellan
[2012-06-19 15:20:55 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damm: I'd prefer that the whole aws cookbook be rewritten to use fog instead of right_aws, personally.
[2012-06-19 15:22:13 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, *nod*
[2012-06-19 15:22:48 -0400] hoover_damm: time is the enemy here
[2012-06-19 15:23:23 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm actually suprised that right_aws still works as well as it does
[2012-06-19 15:31:01 -0400] jtimberman: I'm not. It's a fine library. We just use fog everywhere else, there's a bit of cognitive dissonance.
[2012-06-19 15:32:18 -0400] yfeldblum: i'd prefer it to generate assembly which generates raw ethernet packets
[2012-06-19 15:33:33 -0400] cwj: but what about my tokenring cloud
[2012-06-19 15:55:34 -0400] hoover_damm: cwj, last time I ran token ring I had to reset the MAU every couple days
[2012-06-19 15:55:43 -0400] hoover_damm: would lead to some pretty crappy downtime I imagine
[2012-06-19 15:55:59 -0400] hoover_damm: 'Sorry customers, had to reset the MAU to US-East-1C... Sorry everyone went down for 5 minutes'
[2012-06-19 16:45:01 -0400] atomic-penguin: why didn't chef just get renumbered to 1.y.z instead of 0.10.10 -> 10.12.0?
[2012-06-19 16:45:48 -0400] atomic-penguin: Just seems a bit inconsistent
[2012-06-19 16:46:32 -0400] c_t: Communism, duh
[2012-06-19 16:46:39 -0400] paulmooring: atomic-penguin: In short so we can have more quick bug-fix releases
[2012-06-19 16:46:46 -0400] btm: atomic-penguin: its inconsistent if you think we should be working toward '1.0.0' but that concept was lost a long time ago.
[2012-06-19 16:46:58 -0400] c_t: I think there's precedent with emacs and Chrome though
[2012-06-19 16:47:14 -0400] c_t: theoretically Emacs is supposed to be 1.24 or whatever it is now
[2012-06-19 16:48:08 -0400] atomic-penguin: btm, I was thinking along the lines, this has a stable programming interface, lets call it 1.0
[2012-06-19 16:48:17 -0400] btm: atomic-penguin: I think its more obvious to people following along that 10.12.0 comes after 0.10.10 than a sudden meaningless jump to 1.0.0. We've been talking about "Chef 9, 10 and 11" for a while as if the first digit wasn't there.
[2012-06-19 16:48:33 -0400] atomic-penguin: btm, true enough
[2012-06-19 16:48:55 -0400] btm: atomic-penguin: it would have been nice to switch to 1.0 when that fact was true. Unfortunately that didn't happen at the time.
[2012-06-19 16:49:05 -0400] btm: atomic-penguin: and we're now well past that time.
[2012-06-19 16:49:18 -0400] atomic-penguin: btm, fair enough
[2012-06-19 17:02:21 -0400] mattray: Date based releases foreva! Chef 20120619!
[2012-06-19 17:07:02 -0400] btm: mattray: cooking on the edge, the only version you need is master.
[2012-06-19 17:07:34 -0400] mattray: I'd like to subscribe to your newsletter

[2012-06-19 17:14:38 -0400] atomic-penguin: mattray, coffee is for coders
[2012-06-19 17:16:50 -0400] hoover_damm: I actually really like Opscode's semver
[2012-06-19 17:16:54 -0400] hoover_damm: matches my train of thought
[2012-06-19 17:17:00 -0400] mattray: atomic-penguin: this ends up in almost every slide deck I do: http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrchippy/443960682/in/faves-mray/
[2012-06-19 17:17:22 -0400] atomic-penguin: mattray, I saw it when I watched your spiceweasel talk
[2012-06-19 17:24:31 -0400] hoover_damm: in my semver
[2012-06-19 17:24:56 -0400] hoover_damm: lots between 1.0 and 2.0... major between 2.0 and 2.1 and minor between 2.0.1 and 2.0.2
[2012-06-19 17:25:42 -0400] c_t: I paint my version numbers red
[2012-06-19 17:25:44 -0400] atomic-penguin: "10,120 was the number of hugs given in this release, we think its an appropriate version"
[2012-06-19 17:28:20 -0400] hoover_damm: it's how i rolled at EY
[2012-06-19 17:28:23 -0400] hoover_damm: i like it here
[2012-06-19 17:29:25 -0400] hoover_damm: i also don't like going to 1.0 until you hit a real stable spot
[2012-06-19 17:29:33 -0400] hoover_damm: seems wrong to jump from 0.10 to 1.0 overnight
[2012-06-19 17:29:51 -0400] hoover_damm: and no i'm not referring to opscode i'm just pulling it out of my butt.  If the version is similar, ignore it

[2012-06-19 18:52:25 -0400] ampledata: commented out code = verboten
[2012-06-19 18:53:16 -0400] kallistec: wat?
[2012-06-19 18:53:20 -0400] ampledata: wat
[2012-06-19 18:53:38 -0400] ampledata: commented out code shouldn't make it into production
[2012-06-19 18:53:50 -0400] ampledata: 1. if it's good enough code, why is it commented out?
[2012-06-19 18:53:59 -0400] ampledata: 2. if you're a good enough programmer you should be able to reproduce the code
[2012-06-19 18:54:01 -0400] kallistec: where?
[2012-06-19 18:54:22 -0400] ampledata: i don't want anyone to get butt hurt
[2012-06-19 18:54:24 -0400] mattray: 3. pull it out of version control if you didn't really want it
[2012-06-19 18:54:38 -0400] mattray: ampledata: it's OK if it's my code :)
[2012-06-19 18:55:12 -0400] ampledata: i am seeing a weird error in the rest/rest_request handler in 0.10.12 though
[2012-06-19 18:55:21 -0400] ampledata: debugging
[2012-06-19 18:59:13 -0400] ampledata: ah yeah
[2012-06-19 19:06:51 -0400] ampledata: ah bummer, something in the http_request Resource changed between 10.8 and 10.10
[2012-06-19 19:11:02 -0400] kallistec: ampledata: gzip support added
[2012-06-19 19:11:10 -0400] ampledata: yeah wonder if that's it
[2012-06-19 19:11:13 -0400] ampledata: let me fill out this jira
[2012-06-19 19:11:39 -0400] ampledata: btw 0.10.12 isn't in jira yet?
[2012-06-19 19:11:40 -0400] kallistec: we found an issue where some sites send you tarballs as encoding gzip and content type tar
[2012-06-19 19:11:56 -0400] ampledata: ah
[2012-06-19 19:11:56 -0400] kallistec: it's 10.12.0 now
[2012-06-19 19:12:24 -0400] kallistec: and that bug is fixed in 10.12.0, final release was yesterday
[2012-06-19 19:12:44 -0400] ampledata: yeah the recipe i'm using is broken in 10.10 and 10.12
[2012-06-19 19:14:42 -0400] kallistec: puta madre

[2012-06-19 19:20:09 -0400] kallistec: ampledata: meh, Chef::REST is kind of a struggle, it has too many responsibilities in one place
[2012-06-19 19:20:28 -0400] ampledata: ok if i strip the tarball off of the URL
[2012-06-19 19:20:30 -0400] ampledata: HEAD works
[2012-06-19 19:20:51 -0400] kallistec: ampledata: you can add :disable_gzip => true
[2012-06-19 19:21:49 -0400] kallistec: which the http_request resource should do automatically
[2012-06-19 19:23:16 -0400] kallistec: chef > rest = Chef::REST.new(url, nil, nil, :disable_gzip => true)
[2012-06-19 19:23:22 -0400] ampledata: word
[2012-06-19 19:23:24 -0400] kallistec: chef > modified = rest.run_request(:HEAD, rest.create_url(url), {}, false, 10, false)
[2012-06-19 19:23:24 -0400] kallistec:  => true
[2012-06-19 19:23:47 -0400] ampledata: nice one
[2012-06-19 19:23:47 -0400] ampledata: thanks
[2012-06-19 19:23:49 -0400] kallistec: well, the http_request resource will do that automatically in 10.12
[2012-06-19 19:23:53 -0400] ampledata: odd
[2012-06-19 19:23:57 -0400] ampledata: i was testing against 10.12
[2012-06-19 19:24:07 -0400] ampledata: let me rewrite this as a recipe and test
[2012-06-19 19:24:26 -0400] kallistec: Chef::REST will not do it when using it directly, you have to tell it to do that
[2012-06-19 19:24:54 -0400] kallistec: I guess you could argue we should move the disable_gzip hack into Chef::REST
[2012-06-19 19:26:23 -0400] ampledata: sadness
[2012-06-19 19:27:41 -0400] ampledata: updated that jira w/ the output and the recipe
[2012-06-19 19:35:39 -0400] ampledata: actually yeah that Zlib error lead me to this error

[2012-06-19 21:16:09 -0400] hoover_damm: I cringe when I see 'can I ask a question?' because I wish they'd just ask it instead
[2012-06-19 21:16:16 -0400] hoover_damm: instead of asking if they can ask a question
[2012-06-19 21:16:24 -0400] hoover_damm: being funny wouldn't help
[2012-06-19 21:21:07 -0400] btm: hoover_damm: I usually just say "Ask your question and if someone in the room is available and can answer they will; in the meantime you can read ESR's Asking Questions The Smart Way" while you wait.
[2012-06-19 21:27:48 -0400] sascha_d: hoover_damm when I was doing Window work, I usually prefaced my questions with "are there any windows people around?" because I'd learned that 99.99999% of the time, I never got a reply on IRC or the email list to windows questions
[2012-06-19 21:28:05 -0400] sascha_d: which is also why I now have my IRC client alert on Windows keywords

[2012-06-19 22:22:27 -0400] ampledata: noah you around
[2012-06-19 22:29:01 -0400] erratic: trying to figure out a quick and dirty way to implement my own mixlib
[2012-06-19 22:29:27 -0400] erratic: and now I'm curious, how does stuff like
[2012-06-19 22:29:37 -0400] erratic: https://github.com/coderanger/pychef
[2012-06-19 22:29:40 -0400] erratic: authenticate
[2012-06-19 22:30:20 -0400] ampledata: so glad u asked
[2012-06-19 22:30:21 -0400] erratic: and if it doesn't then I really need to think of something else to use besides chef because there's a bunch of data that I don't want public
[2012-06-19 22:30:34 -0400] ampledata: noah wrote docs on that
[2012-06-19 22:30:44 -0400] erratic: cool
[2012-06-19 22:30:51 -0400] erratic: do you have a linky
[2012-06-19 22:30:54 -0400] erratic: I'd appreciate it
[2012-06-19 22:30:56 -0400] ampledata: searching
[2012-06-19 22:31:00 -0400] erratic: ty
[2012-06-19 22:31:21 -0400] ampledata: http://pychef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/auth.html?highlight=opscode
[2012-06-19 22:32:12 -0400] erratic: ah that helps a lot
[2012-06-19 22:32:21 -0400] erratic: I was looking at the api.py thinking man
[2012-06-19 22:32:32 -0400] erratic: this is .. probably a lot more sophisticated than I need it to be
[2012-06-19 22:32:37 -0400] erratic: lol
[2012-06-19 22:33:07 -0400] erratic: my other question is can anybody just connect to this service if its not restricted by iptables and query it
[2012-06-19 22:33:18 -0400] erratic: and get stuff out of it like my mysql cookbook passwords for a node
[2012-06-19 22:33:25 -0400] erratic: because if they can I really don't like that
[2012-06-19 22:33:30 -0400] ampledata: well that's kind of what databags do
[2012-06-19 22:33:33 -0400] ampledata: and the search endpoint
[2012-06-19 22:33:49 -0400] ampledata: but those require auth
[2012-06-19 22:33:52 -0400] ampledata: i get what you're asking
[2012-06-19 22:33:58 -0400] erratic: I thought that might be the case
[2012-06-19 22:33:59 -0400] mattray: erratic: only with a client key and privileges
[2012-06-19 22:34:15 -0400] erratic: so basically you have to auth with validation.pem first right
[2012-06-19 22:34:22 -0400] mattray: yes
[2012-06-19 22:34:30 -0400] erratic: the pychef doesn't seem to do that anywhere..
[2012-06-19 22:34:33 -0400] erratic: which is why I'm asking
[2012-06-19 22:34:49 -0400] erratic: or again is that what databags are for
[2012-06-19 22:35:02 -0400] mattray: erratic: noah is coderanger
[2012-06-19 22:35:06 -0400] mattray: ask him :)
[2012-06-19 22:35:28 -0400] erratic: otay
[2012-06-19 22:36:24 -0400] erratic: oo jabber
[2012-06-19 22:36:52 -0400] erratic: is coderanger going to the seattle devops meetup or does he work in seattle I wonder
[2012-06-19 22:36:54 -0400] hoover_damm: pychef autoconfigures
[2012-06-19 22:37:02 -0400] hoover_damm: or it should
[2012-06-19 22:37:31 -0400] hoover_damm: i've heard references to coderanger not living in Seattle
[2012-06-19 22:37:31 -0400] hoover_damm: hehe
[2012-06-19 22:37:37 -0400] jtimberman: He lives in California.
[2012-06-19 22:37:54 -0400] erratic: hoov you should hang out for a minute I'll try to get there early or something
[2012-06-19 22:38:05 -0400] erratic: I gotta leave and go home and get ready and take a shower and stuff
[2012-06-19 22:38:08 -0400] erratic: and grab my power adapter
[2012-06-19 22:38:13 -0400] erratic: I'm all the way out in woodinville atm
[2012-06-19 22:38:16 -0400] ampledata: dude it's a devops meetup
[2012-06-19 22:38:22 -0400] ampledata: no one will notice if you dont shower
[2012-06-19 22:38:27 -0400] jtimberman: lol
[2012-06-19 22:38:49 -0400] erratic: hehe
[2012-06-19 22:39:19 -0400] hoover_damm: seriously
[2012-06-19 22:39:32 -0400] coderanger: Heh, guessing you are this devel.ws acct that just added me?
[2012-06-19 22:39:39 -0400] erratic: coderanger yar
[2012-06-19 22:42:19 -0400] erratic: I was thinking about maybe just connecting to to couchdb directly for searching for stuff but that seemed like a nightmare the last time I tried
[2012-06-19 22:42:34 -0400] erratic: that's all this would ever be doing
[2012-06-19 22:42:45 -0400] erratic: currently I use "backup files"
[2012-06-19 22:42:56 -0400] erratic: basically just .json files created with knife from a script
[2012-06-19 22:43:07 -0400] erratic: which was quick and dirty enough
[2012-06-19 22:43:26 -0400] erratic: bu I got permission to make something simple enough in PHP and opensource it so I thought I might work on that this evening
[2012-06-19 22:43:44 -0400] coderanger: erratic: If you have questions you can either ask in here or in #pychef
[2012-06-19 22:43:59 -0400] coderanger: I don't tend to watch scrollback during the day unless you mention me though
[2012-06-19 22:44:14 -0400] erratic: coderanger okay
[2012-06-19 22:44:16 -0400] hoover_damm: #pychef is there for pychef questions so you can ask and idle
[2012-06-19 22:44:19 -0400] hoover_damm: and wait for an answer
[2012-06-19 22:44:29 -0400] erratic: I didn't even know about it
[2012-06-19 22:44:37 -0400] hoover_damm: blame me
[2012-06-19 22:44:59 -0400] erratic: is there gonna be pizza at that meetup should I eat first
[2012-06-19 22:45:02 -0400] erratic: there usually is
[2012-06-19 22:45:07 -0400] erratic: free pizza is cool
[2012-06-19 22:45:15 -0400] hoover_damm: I don't know i haven't gone in a few months
[2012-06-19 22:45:17 -0400] hoover_damm: i imagine so?
