[2012-06-06 11:19:32 -0400] BryanWB_: ruby dummy here, what the easiest way to hack on the chef gem while using rvm? do I git clone into the folder location where I currently have the chef gem? that seems hacky
[2012-06-06 11:59:58 -0400] BryanWB_: change gempath in ~/.gemrc?
[2012-06-06 12:26:10 -0400] geekbri: BryanWB_: I use bundler to do it.  Then I just point the bundler to my version of the chef gem
[2012-06-06 12:26:19 -0400] geekbri: BryanWB_: the only caveat there is that you have to do bundle exec knife
[2012-06-06 12:26:22 -0400] geekbri: or bundle exec chef
[2012-06-06 12:26:40 -0400] geekbri: rather bundle exec chef-client or chef-solo, whatever it is you are hacking on
[2012-06-06 12:27:45 -0400] BryanWB_: geekbri: tks, that's very helpful, will try that, fuck so much shit to learn ;p
[2012-06-06 12:28:16 -0400] geekbri: BryanWB_: you can always feel free to poke me with questions.  I won't claim to be a ruby guru, but i've done enough poking around and written enough ruby code to have a decent enough clue
[2012-06-06 12:28:38 -0400] BryanWB_: geekbri: tks, alot, i probably will. i complain a lot, but i eventually learn thingz
[2012-06-06 12:29:03 -0400] geekbri: no problemo
[2012-06-06 12:29:16 -0400] geekbri: I know the feeling.  Currently smacking my head against rspec :)
[2012-06-06 12:29:23 -0400] BryanWB_: hey ! me too!
[2012-06-06 12:30:06 -0400] geekbri: Fun times right?
[2012-06-06 12:31:14 -0400] BryanWB_: actually is, but challenging to learn and solve work problems at same time
[2012-06-06 12:31:27 -0400] geekbri: Yes, but so is the story of my life :)
[2012-06-06 12:39:19 -0400] geekbri: BryanWB_: if you wanted to avoid using bundler and pointing to your git repo, you could just checkout the code, make your edits, build the gem locally then just install from that local gem you built.
[2012-06-06 12:40:28 -0400] BryanWB_: geekbri: but i learn how it works by adding breakpoints w/ pry, so i need  to make lots of little changes
[2012-06-06 12:40:44 -0400] BryanWB_: that's how i learn how the methods and objs work
[2012-06-06 12:41:33 -0400] geekbri: BryanWB_: you could always checkout the code locally, then create a symlink in your gems directory
[2012-06-06 12:41:40 -0400] BryanWB_: t
[2012-06-06 12:41:49 -0400] geekbri: I mean it all depends on how you want to do your workflow.
[2012-06-06 12:42:25 -0400] geekbri: it could be a hassle if you are making a ton of changes and trying to use bundler, because anytime you make a change you'd have to commit it to git, push it up to github, then bundle update
[2012-06-06 12:43:20 -0400] BryanWB_: can't i tell bundler to use a :path ?
[2012-06-06 12:43:57 -0400] geekbri: BryanWB_: Yes, but you'll still have to bundle update I believe
[2012-06-06 12:44:02 -0400] geekbri: or bundle install each time
[2012-06-06 12:44:14 -0400] BryanWB_: ouch, just like librarian
[2012-06-06 12:44:18 -0400] geekbri: yeah
[2012-06-06 12:44:23 -0400] geekbri: librarian uses the bundler model
[2012-06-06 12:55:27 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, you can use many tools, including straight-up monkey-patching in your knife.rb
[2012-06-06 12:55:48 -0400] geekbri: it depends what specifically you are hacking on
[2012-06-06 12:56:14 -0400] geekbri: for knife plugins, when im really doing heavy active dev, i usually just create some symlinks in my .chef/plugins/knife directory
[2012-06-06 12:56:31 -0400] geekbri: it really depends on what im doing, where I am in the development
[2012-06-06 12:56:32 -0400] geekbri: etc etc
[2012-06-06 13:12:09 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum: good morning!
[2012-06-06 13:20:32 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, good morning!
[2012-06-06 13:40:00 -0400] c_t: Good morning, cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefs!
[2012-06-06 13:50:41 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, you don't have to rerun `librarian-chef install` for changes to path-sourced cookbooks if you use the knife integration :P
[2012-06-06 13:59:59 -0400] nico: heya chefs
[2012-06-06 14:03:27 -0400] nico: when I set a default_attribute in an env or role, even after running chef client, the attribute does not appear in the node attributes
[2012-06-06 14:03:52 -0400] nico: am I missing something ?
[2012-06-06 14:04:19 -0400] nico: I can get it in a recipe, no problem, but searching for it won't work then
[2012-06-06 14:04:30 -0400] nico: and knife node edit does not show  it
[2012-06-06 14:08:56 -0400] yfeldblum: nico, `knife node edit` is for editing normal-level attributes, which are the only kind of attributes that can be edited
[2012-06-06 14:10:27 -0400] nico: sure, but once the run is made, client should push back its attributes, which get indexed and then appear ?
[2012-06-06 14:11:15 -0400] renchap: in search, not in node edit (in theory)
[2012-06-06 14:15:59 -0400] yfeldblum: nico, the node saves the attributes at each level separately, so it saves the default-level attributes as default-level, etc
[2012-06-06 14:16:09 -0400] yfeldblum: nico, however, the merged set of attributes should be indexed
[2012-06-06 14:16:26 -0400] renchap: so an attribute at the role level should be searchable
[2012-06-06 14:16:35 -0400] renchap: (once chef-client ran on this node)
[2012-06-06 14:16:35 -0400] nico: yfeldblum: yeah, got it now
[2012-06-06 14:16:45 -0400] nico: it was my mistake
[2012-06-06 14:17:27 -0400] nico: thx
[2012-06-06 17:29:33 -0400] ampledata: oh man
[2012-06-06 17:29:41 -0400] ampledata: our chat email list was long overdue for a debate on headphones
[2012-06-06 17:31:18 -0400] hoover_damm: lol headphones
[2012-06-06 17:52:51 -0400] Mithrandir: just get qc15s, they're great
[2012-06-06 17:56:13 -0400] hoover_damm: I'm a Sennheiser fan
[2012-06-06 17:56:46 -0400] hoover_damm: PC360 actually
[2012-06-06 17:56:59 -0400] hoover_damm: big and a bit awkward
[2012-06-06 17:57:04 -0400] hoover_damm: but beautiful sound quality both input and output

[2012-06-06 19:56:39 -0400] iamsmrtk: Hey all, I'm trying to get the dev environment set up per the instructions on github but I'm running into a "No such file or directory - /etc/chef/server.rb" even after a rake install. Any ideas?
[2012-06-06 20:43:33 -0400] yfeldblum: iamsmrtk, rake install?
[2012-06-06 20:55:13 -0400] iamsmrtk: yfeldblum: Did that but it doesn't seem to touch /etc/chef. I've installed the chef-server via my OS's repo and so I'm past that now. However, I'm getting a dependency error now: http://pastebin.com/PabfqVuZ
[2012-06-06 20:57:47 -0400] yfeldblum: iamsmrtk, i have no idea what `rake install` you were looking at, and distro-shipped packages are likely to be incorrect, or at least behind
[2012-06-06 21:01:51 -0400] iamsmrtk: yfeldblum: I'm running it in the root of my local repo. Although, I am trying it on v 0.10.6 of Chef...
[2012-06-06 21:04:51 -0400] yfeldblum: iamsmrtk, i don't understand what you're trying to do - are you sure you're looking at a current guide rather than an outdated guide?
[2012-06-06 21:07:16 -0400] iamsmrtk: yfeldblum: Yup, I'm looking at the opscode/chef github. I just created a branch of the 0.10.6 release because that's the version I want to play with.
[2012-06-06 21:18:57 -0400] yfeldblum: iamsmrtk,
[2012-06-06 21:19:01 -0400] yfeldblum: iamsmrtk, ok
[2012-06-06 21:19:32 -0400] yfeldblum: iamsmrtk, you'll obviously need to install the gem dep_selector as the readme says, which requires gecode which may be a platform package for your platform
[2012-06-06 21:22:29 -0400] iamsmrtk: yfeldblum: Already done :). I made sure to install gecode and the gecode-devel packages offered by my OS. I also installed the dep_selector gem to no avail.
