[2012-06-28 16:08:15 -0400] adriancole: aloha all
[2012-06-28 16:09:21 -0400] adriancole: just wanted to let you know that we (and particularly nacx) are dusting off a clean release of the java + clojure chef api https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds-chef
[2012-06-28 16:09:50 -0400] adriancole: should be coming out soon.  we've not tested on hosted or private chef, as yet, but nearly there
[2012-06-28 16:10:38 -0400] adriancole: so the magic maven coordinates will be org.jclouds.api/chef:1.5.0 and should support latest chef server api
[2012-06-28 16:11:01 -0400] adriancole: feel free to ping nacx or I if you are interested in beta testing
[2012-06-28 16:26:09 -0400] hoover_damm: adriancole, neat
[2012-06-28 16:26:35 -0400] hoover_damm: adriancole, I've been meaning to get around to a Dashboard for provisioning written in clojure.  That was one of the things I hadn't done yet.
[2012-06-28 16:26:57 -0400] adriancole: hoover_damm def we need a proper readme with clojure in it :)
[2012-06-28 16:27:32 -0400] adriancole: this is what it looks like-ish https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds-chef/blob/master/core/src/test/clojure/org/jclouds/chef_test.clj
[2012-06-28 16:27:48 -0400] adriancole: though I should check to ensure the clojure test plugin is active :P
[2012-06-28 16:27:54 -0400] hoover_damm: adriancole, :o
[2012-06-28 16:27:55 -0400] hoover_damm: neat
[2012-06-28 16:28:14 -0400] adriancole: transientchef is our WIP mock impl of chef server
[2012-06-28 16:28:16 -0400] hoover_damm: adriancole, know of any java/clojure like things to integrate this with like fabric?
[2012-06-28 16:28:36 -0400] adriancole: :)
[2012-06-28 16:28:46 -0400] adriancole: so abiquo integrate with it directly
[2012-06-28 16:28:47 -0400] hoover_damm: nah just written enough mocks
[2012-06-28 16:29:00 -0400] adriancole: that's where nacx works
[2012-06-28 16:29:34 -0400] adriancole: I've heard rumors of other places inc a virtualization company
[2012-06-28 16:29:58 -0400] adriancole: some other jclouds guys have used it in pet projects
[2012-06-28 16:30:12 -0400] adriancole: so, bascially abiquo is by far the biggest user
[2012-06-28 16:30:24 -0400] hoover_damm: give it time
[2012-06-28 16:30:25 -0400] adriancole: I think fabric probably would look at it one day..
[2012-06-28 16:30:26 -0400] hoover_damm: that'll change
[2012-06-28 16:30:43 -0400] adriancole: well, it is easier now, too
[2012-06-28 16:30:55 -0400] hoover_damm: or not solve it
[2012-06-28 16:30:56 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-06-28 16:30:58 -0400] adriancole: because we were'nt building + releasing it properly
[2012-06-28 16:31:42 -0400] adriancole: haha disambiguation
[2012-06-28 16:31:56 -0400] adriancole: so, heh which fabric
[2012-06-28 16:32:12 -0400] adriancole: so the fabric you probably mean is farther away than the fabric I was talking about
[2012-06-28 16:32:13 -0400] adriancole: :)
[2012-06-28 16:32:32 -0400] adriancole: http://fuse.fusesource.org/fabric/
[2012-06-28 16:32:49 -0400] adriancole: personally, I'll probably integrate this w ning atlas
[2012-06-28 16:33:11 -0400] adriancole: they already have chef-solo support, so adding chef-server would be pretty easy with jclouds-chef stable
[2012-06-28 16:33:29 -0400] adriancole: I'm working w/brianm etc to ec2 jailbreak that
[2012-06-28 16:33:49 -0400] adriancole: "I'll probably integrate this w ning atlas" first I mean
[2012-06-28 16:34:03 -0400] adriancole: it is jruby frontend
[2012-06-28 16:34:28 -0400] adriancole: https://github.com/jclouds/atlas/tree/jclouds
[2012-06-28 16:34:48 -0400] hoover_damm: atlas looks pretty capistrano oriented?
[2012-06-28 16:35:03 -0400] hoover_damm: at least looking at the resources that's what pops to my head
[2012-06-28 16:35:20 -0400] adriancole: well primary focus is galaxy
[2012-06-28 16:35:31 -0400] adriancole: but yeah, I like its ability to allow choice
[2012-06-28 16:35:59 -0400] hoover_damm: totally
[2012-06-28 16:36:03 -0400] adriancole: def similarities w/capistrano
[2012-06-28 16:36:23 -0400] hoover_damm: and the fact that all the notes are in org mode
[2012-06-28 16:36:24 -0400] adriancole: jailbreaking looked like a bitch since includes rdb
[2012-06-28 16:36:24 -0400] hoover_damm: +1 it
[2012-06-28 16:36:36 -0400] hoover_damm: anyone who includes org-mode files
[2012-06-28 16:36:40 -0400] hoover_damm: gets an automatic cookie
[2012-06-28 16:36:47 -0400] adriancole: :)
[2012-06-28 16:37:07 -0400] adriancole: so.. here's an excuse to a. try cloud databases from rax. b. replace rdb w/ rollout maybe via chef
[2012-06-28 16:37:16 -0400] adriancole: as an alternative if you are using openstack or something
[2012-06-28 16:37:25 -0400] hoover_damm: I'm moving a client to metal
[2012-06-28 16:37:29 -0400] adriancole: should be a fun thing to provide a RDB emulator
[2012-06-28 16:37:40 -0400] hoover_damm: the metal i'm dealing with thankfully has an api
[2012-06-28 16:37:41 -0400] adriancole: hoover_damm what's your favorite metal mover?
[2012-06-28 16:37:43 -0400] hoover_damm: which makes it more sexy
[2012-06-28 16:37:51 -0400] adriancole: I just got gear to try canonical MAAS
[2012-06-28 16:38:08 -0400] adriancole: couple proliants +remote cards freshly unwrapped :)
[2012-06-28 16:38:56 -0400] hoover_damm: heh should be fun
[2012-06-28 16:39:06 -0400] hoover_damm: adriancole, just abusing internap/voxel at the time being
[2012-06-28 16:39:27 -0400] adriancole: ahh
[2012-06-28 16:39:51 -0400] hoover_damm: moving to colo for people who are only cloud is harder then I expected
[2012-06-28 16:40:41 -0400] adriancole: sounds like a blog in progress :)
[2012-06-28 16:40:58 -0400] adriancole: hey gotta run.  ttul8r
[2012-06-28 18:31:00 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, as i'm discovering in other contexts, just because it has an API doesn't mean it's sexy ... some APIs are just plain stupid
[2012-06-28 18:33:46 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, Right.  Just because you have an API doesn't mean it's worth a damn
[2012-06-28 18:33:53 -0400] hoover_damm: documenting the api is part of it
[2012-06-28 18:34:00 -0400] hoover_damm: providing a clean api interface is another part
[2012-06-28 18:34:32 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, you can document a turd all you like - helps some, but it's still a turd
[2012-06-28 18:36:42 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, e.g., if you want to have an API thingy that combines two separate functions in one call, for the love of god, provide the ability to do each function independently in its own call
[2012-06-28 18:41:55 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, preaching to the choir
[2012-06-28 18:42:55 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, venting to the choir :P
[2012-06-28 18:44:04 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, that too
