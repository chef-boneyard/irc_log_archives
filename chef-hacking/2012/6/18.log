[2012-06-18 00:12:56 -0400] atomic-penguin: hoover_damm, I don't get it
[2012-06-18 00:13:05 -0400] atomic-penguin: only_if new_resource.only_if
[2012-06-18 00:14:41 -0400] atomic-penguin: Doesn't really make sense unless only_if is a method of new_resource, right?
[2012-06-18 00:20:20 -0400] dschultz__: Hey all, wondering if someone can provide some help. I've marked an issue as resolved (http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2906). Note that this is my first experience with the JIRA ticket system, so forgive me my noobish ignorance if it shouldn't have been marked as resolved.
[2012-06-18 00:21:51 -0400] dschultz__: The solution has been tested and is really just a hack of the bootstrap script. Any insight on this is welcome as far as tickets go. I'm trying to get more involved in the community as my role at my day job increases.
[2012-06-18 00:28:58 -0400] hoover_damm: atomic-penguin, that's a fork for upstream who's going to rewrite it.
[2012-06-18 00:29:14 -0400] hoover_damm: atomic-penguin, I really only forked it for the war changes.  I don't even use it myself it's for a client tbh
[2012-06-18 00:29:19 -0400] hoover_damm: so pardon the lack of caring :(
[2012-06-18 09:45:08 -0400] Sephi: hi
[2012-06-18 09:45:16 -0400] Sephi: got an issue
[2012-06-18 09:45:34 -0400] Sephi: when i'm running chef on windows i got that
[2012-06-18 09:45:40 -0400] Sephi: Run List is []
[2012-06-18 09:46:30 -0400] nico: knife node show YOURNODE shows the good run list ?
[2012-06-18 09:46:34 -0400] Sephi: but in my file it's more like that : "run_list": ["recipes[file::default]"]
[2012-06-18 09:46:52 -0400] Sephi: it's chef solo i'm running
[2012-06-18 09:46:59 -0400] Sephi: so i'm not using knife
[2012-06-18 09:47:19 -0400] nico: ho, I'm not a solo guy
[2012-06-18 09:47:28 -0400] Sephi: =$
[2012-06-18 09:52:55 -0400] ashb: Sephi: recipes vs recipe
[2012-06-18 10:00:55 -0400] Sephi: ashb: woot?
[2012-06-18 10:01:35 -0400] Sephi: is it because i have a recipes dir and not a recipe
[2012-06-18 10:01:40 -0400] Sephi: or something like that ?
[2012-06-18 10:02:05 -0400] nico: it's recipe[foo] even if the dir name is recipes
[2012-06-18 10:02:07 -0400] ashb: nothing to do with that. in the cookbooks/x/recipes/ is right, just not in the run list
[2012-06-18 10:04:00 -0400] Sephi: ok
[2012-06-18 10:05:25 -0400] Sephi: sorry but doesn't make any difference

[2012-06-18 21:29:52 -0400] hoover_damm: you can always be an ass to the britts like the kids in my highschool were
[2012-06-18 21:30:33 -0400] hoover_damm: we got away with a lot thinking back.  We hecked him because there was a study that Married couples in the UK would rather have Tea and crumpets... then make love
[2012-06-18 21:30:52 -0400] hoover_damm: so if you wanted to be mean, you can always ask them if they've had tea and crumpets lately?
[2012-06-18 21:31:06 -0400] hoover_damm: and laugh to yourself and move on
[2012-06-18 21:31:19 -0400] hoover_damm: or you can get to know them and find out how cool they are to talk to..
[2012-06-18 21:31:21 -0400] ashb: to which their response sohuld just be "NO TAXATION WITHOUT RESPRE... oh wait"
[2012-06-18 21:33:01 -0400] c_t: they don't call it "making love" there though, they call it a "lorry"
[2012-06-18 21:33:12 -0400] ashb: news to me :)
[2012-06-18 21:33:28 -0400] ampledata: wait so when my in laws feed me tea
[2012-06-18 21:33:35 -0400] c_t: "crisps" are especially depraved

[2012-06-18 21:35:19 -0400] ampledata: but yeah sure

[2012-06-18 23:46:15 -0400] hoover_damm: any reason why we're not using ohai here?
[2012-06-18 23:49:01 -0400] hoover_damm: basically aws cookbook is failing because it's detecting the instance id wrong
[2012-06-18 23:49:08 -0400] hoover_damm: says a instance in us-east-1a is an instance id of one in 1d
[2012-06-18 23:49:12 -0400] hoover_damm: pretty bizzare
[2012-06-18 23:51:48 -0400] hoover_damm: and moving it to /2008-02-01/meta-data/
[2012-06-18 23:51:52 -0400] hoover_damm: instead of /latest/meta-data/
[2012-06-18 23:51:53 -0400] hoover_damm: fixes it
[2012-06-18 23:52:00 -0400] ampledata: versioning is awesome

[2012-06-18 23:53:20 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah the aws cookbook is 0.7.12 era
[2012-06-18 23:53:34 -0400] hoover_damm: it's got a lot of history to it
