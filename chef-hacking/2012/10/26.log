[2012-10-26 12:00:36 -0400] alfem: Hi! Good X ! (X depends on your timezone)
[2012-10-26 12:01:33 -0400] alfem: I am programming a web2py interface to chef, but I think I can not use pychef to interact with cookbooks. Is that right?
[2012-10-26 15:45:07 -0400] laurent\: btm: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3564
[2012-10-26 15:47:01 -0400] laurent\: it's 5:45pm here, i don't feel like digging into the code and writing a test case and a patch right now :)
[2012-10-26 17:26:33 -0400] ohlol: https://gist.github.com/d39d42ee2152b17e9070 dafuq? cc jtimberman
[2012-10-26 17:33:23 -0400] paulmooring: ohlol: where did you get that cookbook?
[2012-10-26 17:33:49 -0400] paulmooring: just pulled it off the community site and line 33 should look like this:
[2012-10-26 17:33:50 -0400] paulmooring: default['djbdns']['public_dnscache_allowed_networks'] = [node['ipaddress'].split(".")[0,2].join(".")]
[2012-10-26 17:34:03 -0400] ohlol: i presume via knife cookbook site install
[2012-10-26 17:34:09 -0400] ohlol: that's the most recent, no?
[2012-10-26 17:34:12 -0400] paulmooring: yep
[2012-10-26 17:34:16 -0400] ohlol: i'm on 0.99.2
[2012-10-26 17:34:20 -0400] ohlol: (working on updating it now)
[2012-10-26 17:40:42 -0400] paulmooring: well in that case I'll second your dafuq cause I don't see where ipaddress is coming from
[2012-10-26 17:43:10 -0400] ohlol: hmm
[2012-10-26 18:12:34 -0400] BryanWB: how would one monkey-patch chef-client so that it drops u into a pry session when it hits an exception?
[2012-10-26 19:12:08 -0400] jtimberman: paulmooring: in an attributes file, you're in the context of Chef::Node so you can access the attributes w/o the "node['thing']"; e.g. "thing"
[2012-10-26 19:13:27 -0400] paulmooring: thanks jtimberman I did not know that
[2012-10-26 19:18:29 -0400] jtimberman: its totally not the "right" way to do it :)
[2012-10-26 19:18:41 -0400] jtimberman: its much better to be clear about the intent.
