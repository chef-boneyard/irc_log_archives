[2012-10-20 01:36:46 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: !
[2012-10-20 01:37:04 -0400] miah: herp
[2012-10-20 01:37:12 -0400] hoover_damm: he's kind of confused
[2012-10-20 01:37:28 -0400] hoover_damm: tablet's still on in his room i guess
[2012-10-20 01:37:48 -0400] hoover_damm: god i so need to convert this postgresql to a lwrp
[2012-10-20 01:37:53 -0400] hoover_damm: trying to fix some of these dumb bugs
[2012-10-20 01:37:55 -0400] hoover_damm: is dumb
[2012-10-20 01:42:20 -0400] kisoku: miah: derp
[2012-10-20 01:42:41 -0400] miah: kisoku: see you tomorrow =)
[2012-10-20 01:42:45 -0400] kisoku: :-)
[2012-10-20 01:42:55 -0400] miah: we get in early
[2012-10-20 01:42:55 -0400] kisoku: you staying at the 1000 ?
[2012-10-20 01:43:01 -0400] kisoku: hoover_damm: you going to the summit ?
[2012-10-20 01:43:03 -0400] miah: across the street, 1007, at the alexis
[2012-10-20 01:43:07 -0400] kisoku: orite
[2012-10-20 01:43:12 -0400] kisoku: now I remember
[2012-10-20 01:43:21 -0400] kisoku: been drinking alot this week
[2012-10-20 01:43:26 -0400] miah: ah
[2012-10-20 01:43:27 -0400] kisoku: openstack summit
[2012-10-20 01:43:34 -0400] miah: ive been smoking every day and i still remembered :P
[2012-10-20 01:44:04 -0400] hoover_damm: of course
[2012-10-20 01:44:22 -0400] kisoku: I have a pretty hacked up postgres cookbook
[2012-10-20 01:44:29 -0400] kisoku: like to show it to you
[2012-10-20 01:44:34 -0400] hoover_damm: you poor thing
[2012-10-20 01:44:35 -0400] kisoku: mine is now cluster safe
[2012-10-20 01:44:40 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-10-20 01:44:46 -0400] hoover_damm: congrats
[2012-10-20 01:44:50 -0400] hoover_damm: that's why i want to lwrp it
[2012-10-20 01:45:03 -0400] hoover_damm: so much to do that a simple recipe isn't straight forward on
[2012-10-20 01:45:13 -0400] kisoku: yeah I have lwrp + dsls for both pg_hba and config entries
[2012-10-20 01:45:36 -0400] hoover_damm: no i was going to do it all
[2012-10-20 01:45:42 -0400] hoover_damm: like i did with the diamond cookbook
[2012-10-20 01:45:43 -0400] kisoku: all my lwrps are write safe on nodes that are pg_is_in_recovery()
[2012-10-20 01:46:03 -0400] hoover_damm: after creating resources for the basic functionality you realize that attributes are weak
[2012-10-20 01:46:19 -0400] hoover_damm: and they only clutter up the end
[2012-10-20 01:46:59 -0400] hoover_damm: and having at&t fork my cookbook and pull the ppa out as a separate recipe made me realize the installation should be even that
[2012-10-20 01:47:12 -0400] hoover_damm: because with postgres what version you run might matter to you
[2012-10-20 01:47:26 -0400] hoover_damm: having that slapped on the side or some weird hack
[2012-10-20 01:47:28 -0400] hoover_damm: feels wrong
[2012-10-20 01:47:33 -0400] miah: ya
[2012-10-20 01:48:00 -0400] miah: i feel like cookbook lwrp's should handle 'install', 'config', and 'service' as separate items.
[2012-10-20 01:48:04 -0400] hoover_damm: i want to keep the ppa because the goal is to always have the latest and greatest to me
[2012-10-20 01:48:11 -0400] hoover_damm: i basically did
[2012-10-20 01:48:21 -0400] hoover_damm: have you looked a my evil?
[2012-10-20 01:48:33 -0400] miah: simply because you might want multiple instances of whatever you're installing
[2012-10-20 01:48:45 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/damm/diamond
[2012-10-20 01:48:51 -0400] kisoku: I'm looking at it
[2012-10-20 01:49:06 -0400] kisoku: the multiple instance thing is something I have been thinking about
[2012-10-20 01:49:07 -0400] hoover_damm: obv you'll always install via git, but the deb pattern was valid
[2012-10-20 01:49:20 -0400] hoover_damm: so postgres_install "cluster_a" do
[2012-10-20 01:49:25 -0400] hoover_damm:   version 8.3
[2012-10-20 01:49:34 -0400] hoover_damm: ..
[2012-10-20 01:49:49 -0400] jtimberman: https://gist.github.com/3921644
[2012-10-20 01:49:51 -0400] jtimberman: progress!
[2012-10-20 01:50:07 -0400] miah: hot
[2012-10-20 01:50:16 -0400] hoover_damm: what test framework is that?
[2012-10-20 01:50:16 -0400] jtimberman: yeah so
[2012-10-20 01:50:25 -0400] hoover_damm: looks very unit/test
[2012-10-20 01:50:26 -0400] miah: test-kitchen meguess
[2012-10-20 01:50:28 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damm: minitest-chef-handler running under test-kitchen.
[2012-10-20 01:50:50 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah I (or someone in our org) needs to make test-kitchen work on lxc
[2012-10-20 01:51:12 -0400] hoover_damm: having it work with virtualbox basically made me ignore it (i'm a hater i guess)
[2012-10-20 01:51:20 -0400] jtimberman: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KITCHEN-15
[2012-10-20 01:51:21 -0400] jtimberman: :-)
[2012-10-20 01:51:31 -0400] jtimberman: I'm not a huge fan of virtualbox either.
[2012-10-20 01:51:42 -0400] hoover_damm: well heavywater has a lxc cookbook
[2012-10-20 01:51:46 -0400] miah: erikh and i are going to push for another 'testing' session at the summit
[2012-10-20 01:51:49 -0400] jtimberman: but, it does mean running it on os x is fine
[2012-10-20 01:51:51 -0400] hoover_damm: maybe i'll bug aj to give us 15hours
[2012-10-20 01:51:56 -0400] fujin: We got some next level lxc shit
[2012-10-20 01:51:58 -0400] jtimberman: the fastest machine i have in my house is my mbp
[2012-10-20 01:52:03 -0400] fujin: I am the pipes
[2012-10-20 01:52:06 -0400] hoover_damm: fujin, wanna hook up kitchen-15?
[2012-10-20 01:52:07 -0400] fujin: In the pipes even
[2012-10-20 01:52:08 -0400] hoover_damm: for us?
[2012-10-20 01:52:28 -0400] hoover_damm: well hell the world... but making testing easier :)
[2012-10-20 01:52:44 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, have you gotten to the point where you want a pool of ready servers to beatup yet?
[2012-10-20 01:52:44 -0400] fujin: I don't have a machine to work on while I am here but I will do what I can
[2012-10-20 01:52:57 -0400] jtimberman: oh we have an openstack cluster
[2012-10-20 01:53:04 -0400] fujin: miah: you in tomorrow?
[2012-10-20 01:53:06 -0400] miah: yes
[2012-10-20 01:53:12 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, I mean to test with
[2012-10-20 01:53:13 -0400] fujin: Let's chill
[2012-10-20 01:53:15 -0400] miah: i'll be in the area by noon
[2012-10-20 01:53:15 -0400] miah: ok
[2012-10-20 01:53:21 -0400] jtimberman: yeah we have an openstack cluster for testing.
[2012-10-20 01:53:27 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, at ey we had a 'pool' of servers in a 'ready' state for testing
[2012-10-20 01:53:30 -0400] jtimberman: i'm just lazy and haven't set up my account on it :)
[2012-10-20 01:53:49 -0400] miah: http://www.dopenstack.com/
[2012-10-20 01:53:51 -0400] miah: =)
[2012-10-20 01:53:52 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, once it was done with a test, the server was terminated, new one was booted to replace it
[2012-10-20 01:54:12 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, shouldn't that be we're gonna smoke up your cloud?
[2012-10-20 01:54:21 -0400] miah: possibly
[2012-10-20 01:54:24 -0400] hoover_damm: or was i reading that wrong?
[2012-10-20 01:54:25 -0400] miah: i would smoke up a cloud
[2012-10-20 01:54:26 -0400] kallistec: fujin: here's the whole patch for attributes: https://github.com/opscode/chef/compare/4e4310f694d9d5d6289384c7084d26dadc5410c1...76552800f21f9027bf11273f5d7f75c52ba51f13
[2012-10-20 01:54:33 -0400] jtimberman: badass, these tests pass.
[2012-10-20 01:54:54 -0400] miah: yay
[2012-10-20 01:55:59 -0400] fujin: Gangster
[2012-10-20 01:56:20 -0400] jtimberman: erlang::default#test_0002_can_process_erlang_code_with_the_erl_command_ =
[2012-10-20 01:56:21 -0400] jtimberman: i love that test
[2012-10-20 01:56:27 -0400] jtimberman: used the example from the erl man page :)
[2012-10-20 01:59:04 -0400] hoover_damm: hrmph badass
[2012-10-20 01:59:08 -0400] hoover_damm: postgres recipe cleaned up a little
[2012-10-20 01:59:11 -0400] hoover_damm: now to take it to the next level
[2012-10-20 01:59:28 -0400] jtimberman: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/erlang/commit/a882414b1e7e9b7291194b6ba8678de708024a2f
[2012-10-20 02:00:18 -0400] fujin_: Ugh, elevator gotta elevate
[2012-10-20 02:00:59 -0400] fujin_: kallistec: you are a beast
[2012-10-20 02:01:07 -0400] kisoku: jtimberman: btw. you forgot to tag the apache2 cb when you released 1.2.0
[2012-10-20 02:01:14 -0400] kisoku: bad kitty
[2012-10-20 02:01:32 -0400] fujin_: Anyone ale
[2012-10-20 02:01:50 -0400] fujin_: Already at hotel 10000
[2012-10-20 02:02:02 -0400] fujin_: Over 9000!!!
[2012-10-20 02:02:09 -0400] miah: ok. time to eat foods, pack, and pass the fuck out. flight at 8:45am ftw.
[2012-10-20 02:02:35 -0400] hoover_damm: kisoku, heh how many people do that?
[2012-10-20 02:02:41 -0400] fujin_: Bai! Safe travwla
[2012-10-20 02:02:45 -0400] hoover_damm: tag it and such
[2012-10-20 02:02:46 -0400] miah: hoover_damm: i do!
[2012-10-20 02:02:53 -0400] hoover_damm: seems like i've been seeing slackers
[2012-10-20 02:02:54 -0400] miah: taging releases is important
[2012-10-20 02:02:55 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, you don't count
[2012-10-20 02:02:57 -0400] kisoku: you should tag your cookbooks when you release them
[2012-10-20 02:03:05 -0400] miah: downloading HEAD is bad juju
[2012-10-20 02:03:07 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah i've been failing on that
[2012-10-20 02:03:10 -0400] miah: ok. time for food.
[2012-10-20 02:03:15 -0400] miah: see yalls soon =)
[2012-10-20 02:03:17 -0400] hoover_damm: but with mydiamond cookbook i'm cool with that fail
[2012-10-20 02:03:24 -0400] hoover_damm: because the point of it was to be a lwrp to pull in
[2012-10-20 02:03:25 -0400] fujin_: <3
[2012-10-20 02:03:32 -0400] kisoku: yeah I don't use your stuff so I haven't bugged you about it yet :-P
[2012-10-20 02:03:44 -0400] hoover_damm: i haven't really released much
[2012-10-20 02:03:54 -0400] hoover_damm: cept my postgres cookbook
[2012-10-20 02:04:02 -0400] jtimberman: kisoku:  * [new tag]         1.2.0 -> 1.2.0
[2012-10-20 02:04:02 -0400] hoover_damm: i mean i have a lot of old cruft
[2012-10-20 02:04:03 -0400] kisoku: soon my robots will annoy all of the non-tagging cookbook hackers
[2012-10-20 02:04:05 -0400] hoover_damm: but that doesn't count
[2012-10-20 02:04:07 -0400] jtimberman: i forgot to push tags you mean :)
[2012-10-20 02:04:07 -0400] kisoku: jtimberman: :-)
[2012-10-20 02:04:09 -0400] jtimberman: the repo is tagged.
[2012-10-20 02:04:14 -0400] jtimberman: #worksonmymachine
[2012-10-20 02:04:25 -0400] kisoku: we should make the tagging part of the knife-community process
[2012-10-20 02:04:42 -0400] hoover_damm: kisoku, bring it up
[2012-10-20 02:04:45 -0400] jtimberman: and with that successful erlang testing, ima go read to the kiddo :)
[2012-10-20 02:05:15 -0400] hoover_damm: kisoku, basically if we want to push that as a standard, it should be spelled out
[2012-10-20 02:05:20 -0400] jtimberman: kisoku: open an issue on the gem :) https://github.com/miketheman/knife-community/issues
[2012-10-20 02:05:23 -0400] jtimberman: it makes the tag
[2012-10-20 02:05:25 -0400] jtimberman: it just doens't push it
[2012-10-20 02:05:31 -0400] kisoku: ah cool
[2012-10-20 02:05:37 -0400] kisoku: I was planning on looking at that tomorrow
[2012-10-20 02:05:38 -0400] jtimberman: apparently.
[2012-10-20 02:05:48 -0400] jtimberman: its one of my favorite things
[2012-10-20 02:05:51 -0400] kisoku: I will open an issue and a patch tomorrow then
[2012-10-20 02:05:52 -0400] hoover_damm: basically my belief is if you want to change something... change it and make sure people use it
[2012-10-20 02:05:57 -0400] jtimberman: Mike's gonna get a hug
[2012-10-20 02:06:00 -0400] hoover_damm: don't change it and leave it a hanging chad
[2012-10-20 02:06:11 -0400] kisoku: yeah I totally intend to talk about this at the summit
[2012-10-20 02:06:32 -0400] hoover_damm: kisoku, move your config files to the top of the recipe yet?
[2012-10-20 02:06:36 -0400] hoover_damm: so you don't have ucf issues?
[2012-10-20 02:06:43 -0400] kisoku: I also have a tool I have written I can use to mine the community site and find all the missing tags
[2012-10-20 02:07:01 -0400] kisoku: hoover_damm: you mean postgres ?
[2012-10-20 02:07:03 -0400] kisoku: yes
[2012-10-20 02:07:11 -0400] hoover_damm: yep... configs should be installed before the package i'm told
[2012-10-20 02:07:18 -0400] hoover_damm: gonna try that and see how far it splats
[2012-10-20 02:07:23 -0400] kisoku: I also use chef-accumulator to do evil things
[2012-10-20 02:07:25 -0400] hoover_damm: feels weird to me
[2012-10-20 02:07:45 -0400] kisoku: I need to sanitize my cookbook and publish it so other people can see my fail
[2012-10-20 02:10:51 -0400] hoover_damm: kisoku, one cannot learn without failure
[2012-10-20 02:15:57 -0400] kisoku: I know all about that :-)
[2012-10-20 02:48:05 -0400] fujin_: Hackers
[2012-10-20 02:48:23 -0400] hoover_damm: The only thing I hack is my brain
[2012-10-20 02:48:24 -0400] hoover_damm: my life
[2012-10-20 02:48:28 -0400] hoover_damm: to improve it tomorrow
