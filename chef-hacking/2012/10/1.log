[2012-10-01 13:55:23 -0400] leifmadsen: morning hackers!   I'm trying to track down an issue where "something" calls the file resource incorrectly (ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (2 for 1)). The backtrace seems to be useless in terms of telling me where the issue is. I think it's in minitest-chef-handler, but I'm having a hard time trying to figure out how to modify it to output data that shows me the things being called, and how they are being ca

[2012-10-01 21:37:00 -0400] dougireton: I'm trying to write a spec to test Cookbook_file on Windows and I'm getting this error: undefined method `rights' for Chef::Resource::CookbookFile
[2012-10-01 21:37:02 -0400] dougireton: I'm using the Windows 'rights' attribute in my cookbook, but Chefspec doesn't seem to like it

[2012-10-01 21:37:37 -0400] dougireton: Is this a Chefspec limitation or is it something in my specs?
[2012-10-01 21:43:17 -0400] jtimberman: dougireton: Ah, I believe that might be a limitation of chefspec.

[2012-10-01 21:44:50 -0400] jtimberman: i'm going to step away now before my inability to perform common brain functions causes myself more confusion. or someone else confusion.
[2012-10-01 21:57:46 -0400] leifmadsen: so I'm back to trying to track down what is calling this 'diff' function incorrectly in the file resource. I'm wondering if anyone has a suggestion how I can get chef to maybe spit out more data in the stacktrace about what called the function?
[2012-10-01 21:57:59 -0400] leifmadsen: or maybe I can just raise an exception in the code, output more data than would normally?
[2012-10-01 21:58:13 -0400] leifmadsen: I'd just be running this on a dev box where I am reproducing the issue
[2012-10-01 21:58:28 -0400] leifmadsen: so adding a 'raise' in the function would be ok with me for this case :)
