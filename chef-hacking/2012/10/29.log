[2012-10-29 18:06:45 -0400] miah: hoover_damm: ya. i have a vagrant up with the Chef 11 demo.. would like to test on updated releases. especially since we are building a test infrastructure and i want to mirror hosted chef as much as possible.
[2012-10-29 18:21:20 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, yep yep... i was working on the webui and kinda gaveup
[2012-10-29 18:21:54 -0400] miah: i used the webui for ~3 days after _first_ setting up chef.. never used it again.
[2012-10-29 18:28:26 -0400] hoover_damm: it's not me
[2012-10-29 18:28:27 -0400] hoover_damm: it's others
[2012-10-29 18:57:25 -0400] atomic-penguin: somebody was talking about that at summit, prettying up the webui
[2012-10-29 18:57:37 -0400] atomic-penguin: who uses the webui
[2012-10-29 18:57:58 -0400] leifmadsen: I've used it to look stuff up sometimes, but I just find it unnecessary in most cases
[2012-10-29 19:30:13 -0400] hoover_damm: lots of folks use the webui for stuff
[2012-10-29 19:30:30 -0400] hoover_damm: if you don't use the webui it's because it's a) slow as molasses b) doesn't give you what you want fast enough
[2012-10-29 19:30:40 -0400] hoover_damm: the fact that you've worked around to using knife is excellent
[2012-10-29 19:31:16 -0400] hoover_damm: and if you load your data from chef-repo is it still useful? yeah ... consider it a feedback loop
[2012-10-29 19:31:22 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm sure knife will get that data as well in chef 11
[2012-10-29 19:45:15 -0400] leifmadsen: hoover_damm: web interface seems to work fine, I've just not found a particular need for it since I use knife
