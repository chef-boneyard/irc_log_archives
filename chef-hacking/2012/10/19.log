[2012-10-19 15:52:54 -0400] jtimberman: And resume banter of Colonials.
[2012-10-19 15:52:57 -0400] jtimberman: ;)
[2012-10-19 16:10:44 -0400] thom: hells to the yeah

[2012-10-19 16:11:01 -0400] thom: I like the cut of your jib, old chap
[2012-10-19 16:12:35 -0400] c_t: I was all set to at least swing up 'round Seattle Monday night and see who was at the Pike Pub
[2012-10-19 16:12:42 -0400] c_t: ... but there's a fucking debate that night
[2012-10-19 16:21:07 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: I received my ballot today.
[2012-10-19 16:21:15 -0400] jtimberman: I plan to cast my vote and mail it before I leave for Seattle ;)
[2012-10-19 16:26:45 -0400] c_t: huzzah
[2012-10-19 16:27:00 -0400] c_t: (whoever you happen to be voting for)
[2012-10-19 16:27:56 -0400] c_t: This particular cycle's been less stressful than many others, since the servers have been running pretty smoothly
[2012-10-19 16:28:07 -0400] c_t: but I'm still feeling eager for it to be over
[2012-10-19 16:36:43 -0400] hoover_damm: c_t, you work with the voting system?
[2012-10-19 16:37:20 -0400] c_t: Nicht so
[2012-10-19 16:37:36 -0400] c_t: but I work for a site devoted to national US politics
[2012-10-19 16:37:57 -0400] c_t: so election season is my busy time
[2012-10-19 16:38:05 -0400] c_t: and presidential years particularly so
[2012-10-19 16:40:29 -0400] c_t: so the day before the Chef Summit is the last presidential debate, and then the days of it are just getting awfully close
[2012-10-19 16:40:49 -0400] c_t: and then I'll be out of commission most of Friday at the neurologist (which I'm quite thrilled about)
[2012-10-19 16:40:59 -0400] c_t: so sadly I couldn't make Chef Summit work this year
[2012-10-19 16:41:08 -0400] hoover_damm: :(
[2012-10-19 16:41:09 -0400] hoover_damm: too bad
[2012-10-19 16:41:12 -0400] hoover_damm: would have been nice
[2012-10-19 16:42:09 -0400] c_t: you going to be there?
[2012-10-19 16:42:37 -0400] c_t: on the plus side, I'll have ever more scaling stories (both with and without chef)
[2012-10-19 16:42:49 -0400] hoover_damm: :) I plan on it
[2012-10-19 16:42:59 -0400] hoover_damm: I have absolutely no expectations this year except it'll be fun
[2012-10-19 16:43:05 -0400] hoover_damm: which is the appropriate expectation
[2012-10-19 16:43:32 -0400] c_t: I'm going to try and come up Tuesday evening and find where all the Chef people are at at least
[2012-10-19 16:45:51 -0400] c_t: I'm not that far away at least
[2012-10-19 16:50:35 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah i live in seattle
[2012-10-19 16:50:42 -0400] hoover_damm: and as my client is going to the summit
[2012-10-19 16:50:46 -0400] hoover_damm: flying a few folks down
[2012-10-19 16:50:52 -0400] hoover_damm: should be straight forward
[2012-10-19 16:51:17 -0400] c_t: I'm in Tacoma
[2012-10-19 16:51:21 -0400] c_t: so easily jauntable
[2012-10-19 16:51:35 -0400] c_t: is there a schedule of events somewhere yet?
[2012-10-19 16:53:25 -0400] hoover_damm: remember the summit is hosted by the attendee's
[2012-10-19 16:53:29 -0400] hoover_damm: there is no event list
[2012-10-19 16:53:31 -0400] hoover_damm: or schedule
[2012-10-19 16:53:48 -0400] c_t: I meant for Tuesday evening
[2012-10-19 16:53:49 -0400] hoover_damm: basically come, we'll prolly create a board with all the topics
[2012-10-19 16:53:53 -0400] hoover_damm: and let people go from there
[2012-10-19 16:54:03 -0400] hoover_damm: so by tuesday evening you can find pictures prolly of it
[2012-10-19 16:54:10 -0400] hoover_damm: and when you swing by check it out
[2012-10-19 16:54:19 -0400] c_t: fair enough
[2012-10-19 16:54:23 -0400] c_t: I'm sure I'll get it figured otu
[2012-10-19 16:54:40 -0400] hoover_damm: basically it's an unconference
[2012-10-19 16:54:49 -0400] hoover_damm: if they stay true to the style (i hope they do)
[2012-10-19 16:54:58 -0400] hoover_damm: all signs look good from what I read
[2012-10-19 16:55:37 -0400] c_t: had a lovely time last year
[2012-10-19 16:55:46 -0400] c_t: bummed I can't go to the whole thing this time around
[2012-10-19 16:56:19 -0400] hoover_damm: indeed
