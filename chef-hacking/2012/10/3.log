[2012-10-03 01:11:11 -0400] bemu: I've noticed a few times recently that search results contain results which it shouldn't on Hosted Chef. Has anyone else reported this issue?
[2012-10-03 01:11:38 -0400] bemu: I should have asked in the main channel.
[2012-10-03 01:48:37 -0400] fujin: yo hackers
[2012-10-03 01:48:45 -0400] fujin: i'm tracking an incorrect search result issue for a client; anyone here experiencing anything weird on hosted chef?
[2012-10-03 01:48:54 -0400] fujin: hopefully they've not asked i nhere before me :p
[2012-10-03 01:52:27 -0400] bemu: I just did :P
[2012-10-03 01:53:42 -0400] fujin: fucker
[2012-10-03 01:53:48 -0400] fujin: SRSLY THO&UGH
[2012-10-03 01:54:15 -0400] bemu: Did you even search Jira before asking here?
[2012-10-03 01:54:21 -0400] bemu: jeeeeeeez.
[2012-10-03 01:58:25 -0400] hoover_damm: fujin, so runit, systemd, s6?
[2012-10-03 01:58:39 -0400] hoover_damm: is there an escape?
[2012-10-03 02:01:42 -0400] fujin: hoover_damm: I don't understand the question
[2012-10-03 02:01:54 -0400] fujin: hoover_damm: I'd imagine, the answer is 'yes'
[2012-10-03 02:02:03 -0400] fujin: I'm quite fond of s6
[2012-10-03 02:02:09 -0400] fujin: systemds new capabilities related to cgroups are top notch!
[2012-10-03 02:02:14 -0400] fujin: It even supports low level udev functionality now
[2012-10-03 02:02:23 -0400] fujin: I understand many distros are moving towards systemd/cgroups style.
[2012-10-03 02:02:34 -0400] fujin: openRC has always *kind* of been like that but suffered from terrible adoption.
[2012-10-03 02:02:36 -0400] hoover_damm: right
[2012-10-03 02:02:47 -0400] hoover_damm: problem with systemd and ubuntu for me is replacing init
[2012-10-03 02:02:51 -0400] fujin: systemd/cgroups could really help people forget about tracking double-forked daemons in Upstart and bullshit like that.
[2012-10-03 02:03:05 -0400] hoover_damm: s6 seems appealing but i haven't spent enough time in it
[2012-10-03 02:03:10 -0400] fujin: I did some experimentation a while back with statically compiled s6 process supervision trees w/ LXC.
[2012-10-03 02:03:21 -0400] fujin: (s6 as #1)
[2012-10-03 02:03:35 -0400] fujin: I'd been meaning to build a linux system from scratch-ish with s6 as Init, so, that served that purpose
[2012-10-03 02:03:52 -0400] fujin: Plus you don't really have to worry about the troubles a regular Init system has to face with like, hardware and whatnot in an LXC env.
[2012-10-03 02:04:02 -0400] fujin: Much simpler to prototype
[2012-10-03 02:05:36 -0400] fujin: hoover_damm: s6 is clunky, oddly documented, strange command line parameters
[2012-10-03 02:05:39 -0400] fujin: hoover_damm: has its own unique set of troubles
[2012-10-03 02:05:49 -0400] fujin: the benefit for me was that I could have a statically compiled init replacement
[2012-10-03 02:06:06 -0400] fujin: sounds like some hardout gentoo honda racer shit LOL
[2012-10-03 02:06:54 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah it does
[2012-10-03 02:20:02 -0400] kisoku: hrm
[2012-10-03 02:20:34 -0400] kisoku: is there any way to have stuff that is thrown into attributes/*.rb show up as automatic attributes ?
[2012-10-03 02:21:00 -0400] kisoku: trying adam's suggestion of using attributes files instead of custom ohai plugins
[2012-10-03 02:22:09 -0400] kisoku: whoever had the genius idea of starting runit with upstart on ubuntu in the runit cookbook needs to be flayed :-P

[2012-10-03 02:25:55 -0400] hoover_damm: it's been awhile since i updated our runit cookbook... it's under upstart now?
[2012-10-03 02:36:13 -0400] kisoku: yeah runsvdir is started by upstart :-/
[2012-10-03 02:36:37 -0400] kisoku: I hate have three different ways to do init on one box :-P
[2012-10-03 02:41:57 -0400] fujin: kisoku: can you just use something like automatic['foo'] = "bar" in the attribute dsl?
[2012-10-03 02:42:42 -0400] fujin: kisoku: https://gist.github.com/6cfd8787ebba39703e17
[2012-10-03 02:43:29 -0400] kisoku: there is no automatic in that scope
[2012-10-03 02:43:37 -0400] kisoku: but there is automatic_attr
[2012-10-03 02:43:45 -0400] kisoku: but I am not sure it's cool to do this
[2012-10-03 02:44:02 -0400] kisoku: essentially I am scraping a bunch of info from a running postgresql server
[2012-10-03 02:44:21 -0400] kisoku: don't want to use default[] for obvious reasons
[2012-10-03 02:44:56 -0400] fujin: kisoku: 'there is no automatic in that scope' ??
[2012-10-03 02:45:03 -0400] fujin: kisoku: i just showed it to you working
[2012-10-03 02:45:05 -0400] kisoku: hrm. well that's what pry is telling me
[2012-10-03 02:45:12 -0400] kisoku: maybe pry lies
[2012-10-03 02:45:21 -0400] fujin: kisoku: nginx uses an ohai plugin to load in data from nginx
[2012-10-03 02:45:25 -0400] fujin: kisoku: nginx cookbook (opscode)
[2012-10-03 02:45:28 -0400] kisoku: yeah
[2012-10-03 02:45:31 -0400] fujin: uses automatic attrs from that
[2012-10-03 02:45:37 -0400] fujin: but the shit is half broken and doesn't fucking work anyway
[2012-10-03 02:45:41 -0400] kisoku: yes

[2012-10-03 02:45:51 -0400] fujin: so yeah, don't do that.
[2012-10-03 02:45:55 -0400] kisoku: there's problems with using ohai plugins
[2012-10-03 02:46:10 -0400] kisoku: namely, you don't have access to attributes set by the cookbook
[2012-10-03 02:46:12 -0400] fujin: I think what I was specifically seeing is the automatic attrs were never actually changing
[2012-10-03 02:46:25 -0400] fujin: even though they were supposed to be dynamically constructed
[2012-10-03 02:46:29 -0400] fujin: i really dunno though
[2012-10-03 02:46:56 -0400] fujin: well, ohai plugins aren't supposed to know about cookbooks, sot hat seems legit to me

[2012-10-03 02:48:37 -0400] fujin: need to get in there and beat that shit up
[2012-10-03 03:00:34 -0400] kisoku: heh
[2012-10-03 03:00:43 -0400] kisoku: automatic is definitely not useable
[2012-10-03 03:00:55 -0400] kisoku: feature request time
[2012-10-03 04:25:05 -0400] kisoku: can you use not_if AND only_if in a resource ?
