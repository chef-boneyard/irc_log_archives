[2012-10-23 22:26:56 -0400] superbaloo: may i ask a question about erchef ?
[2012-10-23 22:27:11 -0400] superbaloo: it looks like deeply tied with s3 to store cookbooks
[2012-10-23 22:27:30 -0400] superbaloo: is this intended ? or am i reading the code in a bad way ?
[2012-10-23 22:27:49 -0400] hoover_damm: superbaloo, if you don't get an answer hit up the mailing lists
[2012-10-23 22:28:07 -0400] hoover_damm: superbaloo, as the opscode summit today is on (and going) people who can answer this maybe in a talk
[2012-10-23 22:29:13 -0400] superbaloo: i'll do this
[2012-10-23 22:29:29 -0400] superbaloo: chef-dev  ?
[2012-10-23 22:31:26 -0400] superbaloo: i'll assume it's chef-dev

[2012-10-23 22:38:10 -0400] github-bawt: [ohai/master] Remove cruft file - danielsdeleo
[2012-10-23 22:41:16 -0400] ssd7: superbaloo: It uses the s3 API and ships with an s3 compatible service called bookshelf
[2012-10-23 22:41:45 -0400] ssd7: superbaloo: So, you could theoretically point it at s3 (haven't tried it) but it will never actually talk to s3 in the default config
[2012-10-23 22:41:53 -0400] ssd7: it will talk to bookshelf
[2012-10-23 22:42:14 -0400] ssd7: The goal was to decrease the diff between Hosted Chef and Open Souce chef
[2012-10-23 22:42:39 -0400] btm: ssd7: I notice that bookshelf isn't open yet. I wonder what that schedule is.
[2012-10-23 22:42:44 -0400] renchap: any plans to be able to  replace solr with elasticsearch ? :D
[2012-10-23 22:43:16 -0400] ssd7: renchap: Not from opscode afaik, but I know there were community members working on something like that
[2012-10-23 22:43:32 -0400] ssd7: btm: Interesting, it is in the Chef 11 preview build I think.
[2012-10-23 22:43:32 -0400] renchap: would be so great
[2012-10-23 22:43:42 -0400] renchap: especially for HA :)
[2012-10-23 22:48:07 -0400] superbaloo: ssd7: \o/
[2012-10-23 22:48:18 -0400] superbaloo: didn't saw the bookshelf service
[2012-10-23 22:49:15 -0400] superbaloo: ssd7: yes it is in the chef preview
[2012-10-23 22:49:27 -0400] superbaloo: but in a compiled version :p
[2012-10-23 22:52:20 -0400] superbaloo: and ... look like bookshelf stores files on disk
[2012-10-23 22:54:51 -0400] superbaloo: ssd7: this is pretty good news
[2012-10-23 22:55:00 -0400] superbaloo: thanks for info
[2012-10-23 22:55:23 -0400] ssd7: superbaloo: No problem!  Haven't played with bookshelf itself much, but haven't run into many problems yet.
[2012-10-23 22:56:25 -0400] superbaloo: the only problem i see, is if you want like two bookshelfs for redundancy
[2012-10-23 22:56:43 -0400] superbaloo: then it may be easier to switch to s3 tehre
[2012-10-23 22:56:46 -0400] superbaloo: there
[2012-10-23 22:58:15 -0400] ssd7: superbaloo: Yeah, currently most of the redundancy solutions I have seen/used are around just replicating at the disk (drbd and such)
[2012-10-23 22:59:34 -0400] superbaloo: we'll see
[2012-10-23 22:59:36 -0400] superbaloo: later
[2012-10-23 23:21:21 -0400] btm: superbaloo: https://github.com/opscode/bookshelf is open now.
[2012-10-23 23:21:53 -0400] ssd7: btm: NICE
