[2012-10-21 01:12:45 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, you seriously need ci wrapped around that so it's just post-commit hooks
[2012-10-21 01:13:01 -0400] hoover_damm: I wish it was as easy as a travisci passing icon
[2012-10-21 01:16:54 -0400] fujin: Slick
[2012-10-21 01:21:31 -0400] hoover_damm: kinda want to get back to that
[2012-10-21 01:23:01 -0400] hoover_damm: you now, it's time to /j #chef-summit
[2012-10-21 01:29:23 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damm: yeah we had jenkins jobs but they disappeared
[2012-10-21 01:30:25 -0400] jtimberman: like, dunno why they're not in the jenkins UI
[2012-10-21 01:30:31 -0400] jtimberman: havent had a chance to rebuild that
[2012-10-21 01:30:53 -0400] jtimberman: but yeah these will go into our ci
[2012-10-21 01:30:58 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, jenkins to drive vmware?
[2012-10-21 01:31:11 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, how many boxes did you panic with that? lol
[2012-10-21 01:31:13 -0400] hoover_damm: err virtualbox
[2012-10-21 01:31:21 -0400] jtimberman: none?
[2012-10-21 01:31:27 -0400] jtimberman: its on linux man
[2012-10-21 01:31:30 -0400] jtimberman: :D
[2012-10-21 01:31:33 -0400] hoover_damm: that's at least the main complaint I see from OS X users
[2012-10-21 01:31:37 -0400] jtimberman: yeah
[2012-10-21 01:31:41 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm guessing linux is awesome in that regard
[2012-10-21 01:31:48 -0400] jtimberman: until virtualbox 4.1.22
[2012-10-21 01:31:52 -0400] hoover_damm: rofl
[2012-10-21 01:31:52 -0400] jtimberman: which fixed the os x kernel panic
[2012-10-21 01:32:04 -0400] hoover_damm: oh phew :) I was thinking until 4.1.22 when it breaks ubuntu
[2012-10-21 01:32:07 -0400] jtimberman: i haven't had one yet, i used to have them ~50% of the time.
[2012-10-21 01:32:36 -0400] jtimberman: heh, http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KITCHEN-5
[2012-10-21 01:32:48 -0400] jtimberman: we have an internal openstack
[2012-10-21 01:33:16 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm not a big virtualization fan so the whole emulating ec2 thing bores me
[2012-10-21 01:33:36 -0400] hoover_damm: for you I can totally see the business value
[2012-10-21 01:33:44 -0400] jtimberman: its all about the ephemeral test nodes
[2012-10-21 01:34:04 -0400] hoover_damm: got openstack hooked up to test kitchen then?
[2012-10-21 01:34:43 -0400] jtimberman: not yet
[2012-10-21 01:34:48 -0400] jtimberman: you'll see that ticket is reopened :)
[2012-10-21 01:41:25 -0400] hoover_damm: looks like you got a pull for it too

[2012-10-21 01:41:38 -0400] hoover_damm: prolly should be easy to make that an ec2 runner as well
