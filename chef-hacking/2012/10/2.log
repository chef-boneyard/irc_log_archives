[2012-10-02 06:51:26 -0400] bemu: hey btm
[2012-10-02 06:52:39 -0400] bemu: Trying to clean up a bug in knife.rb related to http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3439
[2012-10-02 06:52:49 -0400] bemu: and either I'm missing something, or this is really silly. :)
[2012-10-02 06:52:56 -0400] bemu: I'll wait to do more work before talking to you.
[2012-10-02 06:53:18 -0400] bemu: But there is definitely a bug in chef-10.14.4.rc.0 relating to it.
[2012-10-02 07:12:52 -0400] bemu: Specifically, -a doesn't override knife.rb configuration effectively.
[2012-10-02 07:35:38 -0400] bemu: guh
[2012-10-02 07:35:50 -0400] bemu: I just realized I sent that to the entire channel, sorry guys.

[2012-10-02 17:56:26 -0400] c_t: Oh, and did you stop and see the giant talking Paul Bunyan?
[2012-10-02 19:06:13 -0400] fnichol: hey chefs, test-kitchen question: how would i exclude a platform & version from a test kitchen run. i.e. i support ubuntu 12.04 but not 10.04?
[2012-10-02 19:08:01 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol: exclude :platform => "ubuntu-10.04", :configuration => "myconfig"
[2012-10-02 19:08:05 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol: does that work?
[2012-10-02 19:09:05 -0400] jtimberman: looking at the code, i don't think that works.
[2012-10-02 19:09:19 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol: but you should be able to do kitchen test --platform ubuntu-12.04
[2012-10-02 19:09:24 -0400] jtimberman: if you have test-kitchen 0.6.0 :)
[2012-10-02 19:09:36 -0400] jtimberman: because i totally just did that :D
[2012-10-02 19:18:37 -0400] fnichol: jtimberman: kk, i forgot i could just target one for now
[2012-10-02 19:19:25 -0400] fnichol: jtimberman: my first guess was `exclude :platform => "ubuntu", :platform_version => "10.04"`, but that isn't implemented. think it's useful?
[2012-10-02 19:20:22 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol: a ticket in KITCHEN would be good :)
[2012-10-02 19:21:20 -0400] fnichol: yep, thought so :)
