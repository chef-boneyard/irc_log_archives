[2012-05-25 15:51:45 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] Add requirements section to README - Bryan McLellan
[2012-05-25 16:39:54 -0400] thbishop: btm: around?
[2012-05-25 16:46:19 -0400] btm: thbishop: yo
[2012-05-25 16:50:03 -0400] thbishop: btm: perhaps i'm missing it, but there doesn't appear to be an omnibus rhel 6 rpm for 0.10.10 in the opscode s3 bucket.
[2012-05-25 16:52:37 -0400] hoover_damm: they're still building the omnibus images for 0.10.10
[2012-05-25 16:52:55 -0400] hoover_damm: I hope btm will send an email out once hey are all build (if they are not already)
[2012-05-25 16:53:06 -0400] hoover_damm: s/hey/they
[2012-05-25 16:53:13 -0400] hoover_damm: ^^ thbishop
[2012-05-25 16:53:28 -0400] thbishop: hoover_damm: ah, ok.  thanks.
[2012-05-25 16:59:54 -0400] btm: thbishop: yeah, I started building them but then got distracted by a request to use the new system, but it turned out not to be ready and chefconf happened.
[2012-05-25 17:00:48 -0400] btm: thbishop: I'm building 10.10 omnibus using the old clojure system right now.
[2012-05-25 17:01:49 -0400] hoover_damm: as I have to stamp out some 0.10.10 omnibus builds for a client
[2012-05-25 17:11:05 -0400] thbishop: btm: cool, no worries
[2012-05-25 19:03:41 -0400] btm: thbishop: rhel omnibus images should all be up now.
[2012-05-25 19:03:58 -0400] btm: thbishop: I'm still building a couple more so you'll have to grab them directly.
[2012-05-25 21:40:10 -0400] thbishop: btm: awesome, thanks
