[2012-05-01 00:02:19 -0400] btm: wow d8422a4ebe8935a111b1a26372ca5cb0fc7e8ac1 broke everything in knife. :(
[2012-05-01 00:04:08 -0400] jtimberman: and *perhaps* chef-client.
[2012-05-01 00:05:10 -0400] hoover_damn: no rspec to test this?
[2012-05-01 00:05:35 -0400] btm: hoover_damn: unit tests all pass.
[2012-05-01 00:05:46 -0400] btm: hoover_damn: need more integration tests, that work is coming.
[2012-05-01 00:06:07 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, failing scenario's and passing scneario's always make the world go around

[2012-05-01 00:26:49 -0400] btm: Shhhhhh.
[2012-05-01 00:29:05 -0400] c_t: :-O
[2012-05-01 00:36:52 -0400] hoover_damn: huh
[2012-05-01 00:36:54 -0400] hoover_damn: oh yeah
[2012-05-01 00:37:14 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, thanks for a flashback to when I was working on chef 0.8 :)
[2012-05-01 00:37:26 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, I remember hacking around to get yajl in sanely and having tons of fun
[2012-05-01 18:17:00 -0400] btm: hoover_damn: were you able to figure out why your cloud data was garbage?
[2012-05-01 18:17:31 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, nope, lemme do that in a few
[2012-05-01 18:17:56 -0400] btm: hoover_damn: cool. I can cut a beta gem today or tomorow if we can resolve known regressions.
[2012-05-01 18:26:58 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, is the hint file meant to take prio over the mac / kernel detection?
[2012-05-01 18:27:13 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, because the whole hint file detection has broken the rackspace's own ability to work
[2012-05-01 18:27:24 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, lame hack is to return true on the mac address test...
[2012-05-01 18:27:30 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, but uhm without the hint file that's lame

[2012-05-01 18:33:39 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, network and all the regular ohai stuff looks right again
[2012-05-01 18:33:55 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, cloud plugin is still broken as described, I will open a ticket about that later today
[2012-05-01 18:35:33 -0400] hoover_damn: nah i take that back

[2012-05-01 18:40:12 -0400] github-bawt: [ohai/master] OHAI-348: spec: platform should be "suse" even if lsb says "suse linux" - Martin Vidner
[2012-05-01 18:40:12 -0400] github-bawt: [ohai/master] OHAI-348: platform: check :lsb only after specific distros. - Martin Vidner

[2012-05-01 18:40:52 -0400] btm: hoover_damn: thanks, I'll try to repro in a couple hours after lunch.
[2012-05-01 18:41:08 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, yeah if I can dig into the root cause of it (can't atm) I will
[2012-05-01 18:55:57 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, hrm
[2012-05-01 18:55:58 -0400] hoover_damn: chef > node[:network][:interfaces] => #<Chef::Node::Attribute @normal={...}, @current_normal={}, @default={...}, @current_default={}, @override={...}, @current_override={}, @automatic={...}, @current_automatic={}, @current_nesting_level=[:network, :interfaces], @auto_vivifiy_on_read=false, @set_unless_value_present=false, @set_type=nil, @has_been_read=false>
[2012-05-01 18:56:24 -0400] hoover_damn: but node[:network][:interfaces] seems bust
[2012-05-01 19:11:36 -0400] joewilliams: hoover_damn: recall the weird hashing and connection refused issue i think we talked about a while back?
[2012-05-01 19:11:40 -0400] joewilliams: its back
[2012-05-01 19:12:17 -0400] joewilliams: found out you can actually see it in the chef webui too
[2012-05-01 19:13:53 -0400] hoover_damn: joewilliams, gnarly
[2012-05-01 19:14:09 -0400] hoover_damn: joewilliams, any luck finding a debug at least on it?
[2012-05-01 19:15:16 -0400] joewilliams: not yet, ive added some tracing so far it seems that the underlying net/http exception is "end of file reached"
[2012-05-01 19:17:03 -0400] hoover_damn: right makes me think couchdb is crashing on you
[2012-05-01 19:17:21 -0400] hoover_damn: and the erlang supervisor recovers it
[2012-05-01 19:17:45 -0400] hoover_damn: R130B3 should work but it's kind of old
[2012-05-01 19:17:53 -0400] hoover_damn: and CouchDB 0.10 isn't horrible, but isn't great
[2012-05-01 19:18:47 -0400] joewilliams: hoover_damn: fwiw http://img.skitch.com/20120501-c9qe651khsrahwxjh73s9a7rpe.png
[2012-05-01 19:20:36 -0400] joewilliams: also the hash matches whats in the doc, https://img.skitch.com/20120501-tfdm4e4ri12et22yj7ctu99a9m.png
[2012-05-01 19:21:22 -0400] hoover_damn: hrm, yeah i understand that's stored in couchdb
[2012-05-01 19:21:33 -0400] hoover_damn: platform uses s3, private uses couchdb
[2012-05-01 19:26:30 -0400] joewilliams: yeah if something is crashing inside couch its not obvious in the logs, i turned on debug logging
[2012-05-01 19:28:33 -0400] hoover_damn: yep and you've replicated your database over by now i bet or tried to repair it
[2012-05-01 19:28:46 -0400] hoover_damn: nothing in the chef-server-api regarding it?
[2012-05-01 19:28:53 -0400] hoover_damn: I know the rescues in chef-server-api might be blind in this
[2012-05-01 19:28:59 -0400] hoover_damn: so you might need to add
[2012-05-01 19:39:40 -0400] joewilliams: chef server debug logging didnt help but finding the doc in couch did
[2012-05-01 19:40:21 -0400] joewilliams: "2012-01-17T18:02:53+00:00" is the create time for the chef::checksum doc which is months older than the file itself, it was updated yesterday
[2012-05-01 19:41:53 -0400] joewilliams: i bet for some reason on upload the checksum never got regenerated or soemthign so the original is still being referenced everywhere but now its 404ing or something
[2012-05-01 19:51:56 -0400] joewilliams: welp that doesnt seem right either as the md5 of the file locally matches what is in couch
[2012-05-01 19:51:58 -0400] joewilliams: hrm
[2012-05-01 19:53:04 -0400] joewilliams: uploading it again definitely fixes it
[2012-05-01 19:53:14 -0400] joewilliams: odd indeed
[2012-05-01 19:54:35 -0400] joewilliams: i should say changing the md5 of the file (add white space) and uploading again works

[2012-05-01 23:07:44 -0400] josephholsten: where should I drop this ticket? chef-server::rubygems-install recipe doesn't work because gecode cb installs ubuntu's libgeocode-dev 3.7 instead of opscode's 3.5, so chef-server-api.gem doesn't pass config checks to build native extensions
[2012-05-01 23:10:11 -0400] btm: josephholsten: file in the cook project on tickets.opscode.com aginst the chef-server component.

[2012-05-01 23:10:54 -0400] laurent\: or is it related to the cloud thing ?
[2012-05-01 23:11:08 -0400] josephholsten: getting chef-server-api working with 3.7 would be awesome too, but i guess there's always erlang.
