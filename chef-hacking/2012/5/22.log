[2012-05-22 00:42:18 -0400] imeyer: sup hax0rs
[2012-05-22 00:48:08 -0400] c_t: not much
[2012-05-22 00:48:14 -0400] c_t: haxing
[2012-05-22 00:55:29 -0400] imeyer: i'm thinking about haxing.. but not much is happening
[2012-05-22 01:01:36 -0400] c_t: actually, I'm going to have to make some ungrateful children dinner in a few
[2012-05-22 01:03:01 -0400] imeyer: haha
[2012-05-22 01:03:12 -0400] imeyer: hax the childrens
[2012-05-22 01:04:05 -0400] c_t: that's the kind of shit that gets you in the paper for the *wrong* reason
[2012-05-22 01:06:40 -0400] imeyer: i meant like, hack them to make them grateful. rewrite teh brainz
[2012-05-22 01:06:52 -0400] imeyer: or rewire which is what i wanted to say
[2012-05-22 02:37:25 -0400] hoover_damm: imeyer, hack on some nodejs?
[2012-05-22 02:37:53 -0400] hoover_damm: it's too bad you can't really leverage the jvm for different languages in chef
[2012-05-22 02:38:02 -0400] hoover_damm: there's jvm bytecode for jruby, for jython, for clojure
[2012-05-22 02:38:30 -0400] hoover_damm: clojure_block "something in clojure" do
[2012-05-22 02:39:03 -0400] hoover_damm: dunno if the jvm would allow that to really work, but could be interesting
[2012-05-22 02:52:36 -0400] imeyer: i'm not a nodejs kinda person :/
[2012-05-22 02:55:53 -0400] imeyer: ONE OF US
[2012-05-22 03:04:36 -0400] imeyer: kallistec: ^^
[2012-05-22 13:25:09 -0400] roidrage_: i'm confused about the chef_handler cookbook. does the resource it provides copy a custom handler to the right place?
[2012-05-22 13:28:58 -0400] roidrage: ah, found it. it's a bit weird, but okay ;)
[2012-05-22 13:44:36 -0400] roidrage: jtimberman: are handlers also run when the compile phase failed? seems like the chef_handler provider needs to be run first to make sure these kinds of errors are tracked too, no?
[2012-05-22 13:51:57 -0400] yfeldblum: roidrage, success handlers are run after a successful convergence; exception handlers are run after a failed convergence; failure is defined by an exception being raised and unhandled during the compilation or during the convergence
[2012-05-22 13:52:16 -0400] roidrage: ah shame really
[2012-05-22 13:52:22 -0400] roidrage: so those errors never really pop up anywhere?
[2012-05-22 13:52:33 -0400] roidrage: from the chef perspective it makes sense, just curious how people handle that
[2012-05-22 13:54:10 -0400] yfeldblum: huh?
[2012-05-22 13:54:50 -0400] roidrage: well, if the compilation fails, how do you notice?
[2012-05-22 13:56:03 -0400] yfeldblum: you can have an exception handler, but you may have to include it before compilation starts or at the very beginning of compilation
[2012-05-22 13:56:21 -0400] roidrage: so i'd have to explicitly run_action(:enable), right?
[2012-05-22 13:57:18 -0400] roidrage: that works for me :)
[2012-05-22 13:58:53 -0400] yfeldblum: or you can set it up in /etc/chef/client.rb
[2012-05-22 13:58:54 -0400] yfeldblum: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Exception+and+Report+Handlers#ExceptionandReportHandlers-IntheChefconfig%28client.rb%29file
[2012-05-22 14:31:30 -0400] jtimberman: well more accurately, "notification handlers" are run at the end of the chef client run. report handlers always get run, and exception handlers only run if there was an unhandled exception
[2012-05-22 14:32:08 -0400] jtimberman: for the report/exception handlers i use, i put them in client.rb rather than using the chef_handler cookbook.
[2012-05-22 14:32:37 -0400] ssd7: If you are running an exception handler then isn't the exception...handled ;)
[2012-05-22 14:32:54 -0400] jtimberman: ssd7: :P
[2012-05-22 14:33:08 -0400] jtimberman: through the normal ruby exception handling means, a la begin/rescue
[2012-05-22 15:08:09 -0400] imeyer: HAX
[2012-05-22 15:08:11 -0400] imeyer: HAX HAX HAX
[2012-05-22 15:22:34 -0400] imeyer: hi jtimberpond
[2012-05-22 15:35:41 -0400] roidrage: is there an existing cookbook to handle updates to the client.rb? kinda looks like a hen-egg-problem
[2012-05-22 15:40:45 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, chef-client?
[2012-05-22 15:40:58 -0400] roidrage: helpful, thanks
[2012-05-22 15:41:00 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, outside of like chef-client to enforce the default and keep it running
[2012-05-22 15:41:03 -0400] hoover_damm: you are right
[2012-05-22 15:41:04 -0400] hoover_damm: hen-egg-problem
[2012-05-22 15:41:11 -0400] roidrage: ;)
[2012-05-22 15:41:23 -0400] hoover_damm: you bootstrap with 1, chef-client writes with another
[2012-05-22 15:41:28 -0400] hoover_damm: both have to be in line or else you slap yourself
[2012-05-22 15:41:30 -0400] roidrage: which is why i do like the cookbook approach for handlers, though it does look a bit hacky from the code
[2012-05-22 15:41:39 -0400] roidrage: chef-client --facepalm
[2012-05-22 15:41:48 -0400] hoover_damm: indeed
[2012-05-22 15:43:16 -0400] hoover_damm: collaboration is a key problem of the internet lately.  Too many people lack the ability to collaborate with similar projects
[2012-05-22 15:43:19 -0400] hoover_damm: or like projects
[2012-05-22 15:44:33 -0400] roidrage: dude, crucially hates nginx, don't use it!
[2012-05-22 15:44:36 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/scobal/seyren vs Tattle
[2012-05-22 15:44:49 -0400] hoover_damm: crucially doesn't hate nginx.
[2012-05-22 15:45:01 -0400] hoover_damm: He just hates on event based programming without a full notion of scaling
[2012-05-22 15:45:21 -0400] hoover_damm: scaling is hard especailly when libc is part of your blocker
[2012-05-22 15:45:23 -0400] roidrage: so i've been using the opscode platform and full chef for a while now and it's pretty swell
[2012-05-22 15:45:45 -0400] hoover_damm: powerdns author blogged about this the other day ... http://bert-hubert.blogspot.com/2012/05/random-points-of-contention.html
[2012-05-22 15:45:47 -0400] roidrage: i'm still pondering how to solve the gap between developers wanting to push stuff out to deploy immediately and the chef-client way of polling
[2012-05-22 15:45:53 -0400] hoover_damm: how usage of random() can cause contention vs random_r()
[2012-05-22 15:46:04 -0400] hoover_damm: there's a whole list of functions in glibc that can do that
[2012-05-22 15:47:53 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, rundeck or more 0mq push?
[2012-05-22 15:48:20 -0400] hoover_damm: the desire to have chef-client polled via rabbit or such has been around for a long time
[2012-05-22 15:48:27 -0400] hoover_damm: and a few implementations even
[2012-05-22 15:48:51 -0400] roidrage: haha, well i've built a chef-client like that ;)
[2012-05-22 15:48:57 -0400] roidrage: both ways have their merit imho
[2012-05-22 15:48:58 -0400] hoover_damm: right
[2012-05-22 15:49:16 -0400] roidrage: but i'm curious about that gap could be closed in general without having to resort to building yet another custom solution
[2012-05-22 15:49:18 -0400] hoover_damm: Rundeck likely is the easiest implementation except i haven't seen any good rundeck server cookbooks
[2012-05-22 15:49:42 -0400] hoover_damm: to setup authentication and everything
[2012-05-22 16:09:57 -0400] hoover_damm: interesting, gpg signing of git commit messages
[2012-05-22 16:10:01 -0400] hoover_damm: bout time
[2012-05-22 16:19:18 -0400] roidrage: well, for handling the exceptions works but it doesn't catch problems reading the attributes file it seems :/
[2012-05-22 16:19:23 -0400] roidrage: gonna have to look into that
[2012-05-22 16:33:05 -0400] hoover_damm: :(
[2012-05-22 16:35:48 -0400] yfeldblum: roidrage, even handlers listed in /etc/chef/client.rb?
[2012-05-22 16:36:06 -0400] roidrage: nope, activated via cookbook
[2012-05-22 16:36:19 -0400] roidrage: client.rb leaves the unsolved hen-egg-problem
[2012-05-22 16:37:02 -0400] yfeldblum: roidrage, client.rb is done via bootstrap, which you can customize
[2012-05-22 16:37:17 -0400] roidrage: yeah, but that starts to defeat the purpose slowly but surely, don't you think?
[2012-05-22 16:37:43 -0400] yfeldblum: no, configuring chef itself is different from chef configuring everything else on the system
[2012-05-22 16:37:53 -0400] yfeldblum: also you can bootstrap chef-client with chef-solo if you want
[2012-05-22 16:37:59 -0400] roidrage: is it? does it have to be?
[2012-05-22 16:38:06 -0400] roidrage: it's still a hen-egg-problem ;)
[2012-05-22 16:38:14 -0400] roidrage: it's a possible solution but it's not a great one to be honest
[2012-05-22 16:39:38 -0400] yfeldblum: roidrage, not really, it's just that you've locked yourself into a circular dependency chain; you realize it's broken and that it's broken because of the circularity of it, so i'm just pointing that out :P
[2012-05-22 16:39:51 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, is it possible to just modify the bootstrap so you don't drop client.rb? and then let your chef run supply it
[2012-05-22 16:40:04 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, I say that because you don't need client.rb to have a chef-client talk to the server
[2012-05-22 16:40:28 -0400] hoover_damm: chef-client -S http://api.opscode.com/organizations/foobar -l info -E whatever
[2012-05-22 16:40:47 -0400] hoover_damm: then have your client write client.rb the way you want, no more hen-egg
[2012-05-22 16:40:52 -0400] hoover_damm: written once
[2012-05-22 16:42:42 -0400] roidrage: yeah, sounds more reasonable. either way, it's all sort of a bolt-on
[2012-05-22 16:43:01 -0400] roidrage: using bootstrap for this leaves the question: how do i get the handler on all my existing boxes? do i re-bootstrap them?
[2012-05-22 16:43:15 -0400] roidrage: and that's more of a rethorical question because obv. i'd have to :)
[2012-05-22 16:43:30 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-05-22 18:32:41 -0400] jtimberman: imeyer: ima stab you with a spork
[2012-05-22 18:33:15 -0400] lnxchk: sounds kinky
