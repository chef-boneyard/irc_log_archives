[2012-05-10 15:58:43 -0400] laurent\: Morgen ? :) it's 6pm
[2012-05-10 16:00:35 -0400] c_t: in the one true time zone, it is 9:00am
[2012-05-10 16:01:14 -0400] laurent\: that's germany time zone isn't it ? :-)
[2012-05-10 16:01:26 -0400] c_t: iuhhuh, I'm in Pacific

[2012-05-10 16:01:40 -0400] c_t: all other time zones are but pale reflections
[2012-05-10 16:56:41 -0400] btm: c_t: UTC is the one true time zone dude.
[2012-05-10 16:57:32 -0400] btm: c_t: for starters, PST easily succombs to the daylight savings time disease which is under the fickle control of the U.S. government.
[2012-05-10 16:58:32 -0400] c_t: DST is so stupid
[2012-05-10 16:59:12 -0400] c_t: maybe it's not so dumb further south, but I'm far enough north that in the summer, with DST the sun goes down after 10pm in the summer
[2012-05-10 16:59:30 -0400] c_t: part of the year, it isn't really really dark (for astronomical purposes) until after midnight
[2012-05-10 16:59:42 -0400] c_t: in that situation, I think plenty of daylight is available
[2012-05-10 17:01:14 -0400] btm: I will never forgive the Bush administration for all those hours I spent repairing a Microsoft Exchange installation due to them moving DST around a few years ago.
[2012-05-10 17:02:56 -0400] c_t: ooof
[2012-05-10 17:03:20 -0400] yfeldblum: yep, utc always, every time, for canonical datetimes
[2012-05-10 18:02:46 -0400] atomic-penguin: what is the practice for running something like bundle within a recipe, if one is using chef-full packages, add /opt/opscode/embedded/bin to PATH in the recipe?
[2012-05-10 18:03:46 -0400] atomic-penguin: ...or template out the .bashrc/.profile to modify the application user's PATH?
[2012-05-10 18:09:19 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, if you're using chef-full, then you shouldn't use chef's ruby for bundling other applications - instead, you should install a system ruby or perhaps a virtualized ruby with rvm or rbenv, and bundle the other applications against the system or virtualized ruby
[2012-05-10 18:12:01 -0400] atomic-penguin: yfeldblum, why not just use the ruby that comes with chef?
[2012-05-10 18:12:48 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, because the entire point of chef-full shipping with its own ruby is that that ruby belongs to chef and only to chef, and will not pollute the rest of the system
[2012-05-10 18:13:30 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, chef-full is for those who want a completely self-contained and walled-off chef, with its dependencies also included within the wall
[2012-05-10 18:14:46 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, and by wall, i mean "nothing gets in; nothing gets out"
[2012-05-10 18:15:09 -0400] atomic-penguin: yfeldblum, so i should use something like the ruby cookbook for managing that
[2012-05-10 18:16:08 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, not familiar with the ruby cookbook per se, but certainly
[2012-05-10 18:16:38 -0400] atomic-penguin: yfeldblum, although, I would assume, if you are calling the gem_package resource to use rubies for recipe code, you would want that to gem it into the chef-full environment
[2012-05-10 18:16:40 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, not necessarily required though - e.g. on debianoid you can `package "ruby-full"` or something
[2012-05-10 18:17:35 -0400] atomic-penguin: yfeldblum, ...otherwise it would be difficult for chef to 'require' such a gem
[2012-05-10 18:17:45 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, yes, and in this case it's either-or: either you want that gem installed for chef and for chef alone, and for no other applications anywhere else on the system; or you want that gem installed for some other application, but you won't be allowed to require it from chef
[2012-05-10 18:18:17 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, you can always chef_gem "abcd" and also gem_package "abcd", installing it once into chef's ruby and once into the system ruby
[2012-05-10 18:18:49 -0400] atomic-penguin: yfeldblum, didn't even realize there was a chef_gem resource
[2012-05-10 18:18:53 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, it's new
[2012-05-10 18:19:11 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, and it's designed for use with chef-full
[2012-05-10 18:22:26 -0400] atomic-penguin: I see, its a 10.10 feature
[2012-05-10 18:24:18 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, if you're not running 0.10.10, you can just steal the code: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/resource/chef_gem.rb
[2012-05-10 18:24:42 -0400] atomic-penguin: yfeldblum, http://ckbk.it/chef_gem
[2012-05-10 18:25:58 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, yep
[2012-05-10 18:26:49 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, you'll have to add a role setting default_attributes(:gem_binary => "/usr/bin/gem") or something
[2012-05-10 18:38:40 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, hope that helps
[2012-05-10 18:39:15 -0400] atomic-penguin: ofc the ruby package list is broken on centos 6
[2012-05-10 18:39:25 -0400] atomic-penguin: ...in the cb

[2012-05-10 19:09:20 -0400] ampledata: or has anyone else developed a gem-based chef_handler
[2012-05-10 19:12:15 -0400] yfeldblum: ampledata, feel free to ask your question anyway
[2012-05-10 19:12:18 -0400] ampledata: actually where's msf
[2012-05-10 19:12:43 -0400] ampledata: probably asleep, japan is like 9000 hours different
[2012-05-10 19:13:03 -0400] ampledata: all of the gem docs set the source to 'chef/handler/xxx'
[2012-05-10 19:14:26 -0400] ampledata: but i get this error when i load the chef_handler resource LoadError: no such file to load -- chef/handler/xxx
[2012-05-10 19:14:33 -0400] ampledata: albeit the gem is installed
[2012-05-10 19:14:42 -0400] ampledata: so i think we're either all copying the wrong example
[2012-05-10 19:14:44 -0400] ampledata: or i'm stupid

[2012-05-10 19:18:14 -0400] yfeldblum: ampledata, solo or client?
[2012-05-10 19:18:19 -0400] ampledata: client
[2012-05-10 19:18:43 -0400] yfeldblum: normal bootstrap (system ruby & system rubygems) or isolated bootstrap (using chef-full)?
[2012-05-10 19:19:13 -0400] ampledata: former
