[2012-05-21 04:06:20 -0400] c_t: gah
[2012-05-21 04:06:50 -0400] c_t: when up keys attach
[2012-05-21 04:06:53 -0400] c_t: attack, even
[2012-05-21 11:19:49 -0400] renchap: jtimberman: can  you confirm that it is ok for you : http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3136 ?
[2012-05-21 15:20:20 -0400] jtimberman: renchap: fine with me, it'll be picked up in a code review meeting sometime this week
[2012-05-21 15:20:32 -0400] renchap: ok thanks
[2012-05-21 15:21:28 -0400] jtimberman: cheers!
[2012-05-21 16:25:38 -0400] c_t: ohai, chef hackers
[2012-05-21 16:26:08 -0400] c_t: jtimberman: sent up some perl cookbook changes over the weekend
[2012-05-21 16:31:47 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, it now just uninstalls perl, right?
[2012-05-21 16:32:02 -0400] c_t: alas, no
[2012-05-21 16:33:01 -0400] c_t: but it does make it so it doesn't blow up on OS X
[2012-05-21 16:36:11 -0400] hoover_damm: perl is still a valid language
[2012-05-21 16:36:19 -0400] hoover_damm: and you cannot uninstall perl if you run debian/ubuntu
[2012-05-21 16:36:29 -0400] hoover_damm: doing so makes your distro 100% worthless
[2012-05-21 16:47:13 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: saw your tweetledee
[2012-05-21 16:47:25 -0400] c_t: sweet
[2012-05-21 16:47:41 -0400] c_t: it was in the middle of the night, so it would be perfectly understandable to miss it
[2012-05-21 16:47:50 -0400] jtimberman: ... because debian's packaging uses a lot of perl.
[2012-05-21 16:48:04 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: i was playing Diablo 3.
[2012-05-21 16:48:14 -0400] hoover_damm: and you came up for breath?
[2012-05-21 16:48:16 -0400] c_t: even more understandable to miss it then
[2012-05-21 16:48:54 -0400] hoover_damm: I keep getting lost in Kingdoms of Amalur
[2012-05-21 16:48:54 -0400] c_t: along with finally making a chef cookbook for chef
[2012-05-21 16:48:59 -0400] c_t: the programming language
[2012-05-21 16:49:26 -0400] hoover_damm: although I guess I beat that game
[2012-05-21 16:49:30 -0400] hoover_damm: I stopped earning XP
[2012-05-21 16:50:34 -0400] c_t: while there's not a cookbook for Diablo yet, I did this over the weekend too
[2012-05-21 16:50:45 -0400] c_t: https://github.com/ctdk/dwarf_fortress
[2012-05-21 16:51:25 -0400] hoover_damm: I ended up killing a whole town last night for boredom
[2012-05-21 16:52:15 -0400] c_t: At last, the scourge of productivity will be slain
[2012-05-21 17:29:04 -0400] c_t: two dumb chef questions
[2012-05-21 17:29:39 -0400] c_t: one, is there an easy way to see what bitness the client has, and two is there something even more general than platform_family?
[2012-05-21 17:29:57 -0400] c_t: like "linux", encompassing the various platform_families
[2012-05-21 18:13:17 -0400] lusis: node.platform, node.platform_family, node.kernel.machine
[2012-05-21 18:13:41 -0400] lusis: node.os as well
[2012-05-21 18:14:12 -0400] lusis: just run ohai through less and see if anything looks like it's useful ;)
[2012-05-21 18:14:12 -0400] c_t: I knew about the node platform ones, but wasn't sure about the more general case
[2012-05-21 18:15:26 -0400] c_t: I wonder how many chef installations are actually running 32 bit
[2012-05-21 18:20:53 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: probably a lot. m1.small instances in ec2 are 32 bit until about a month ago
[2012-05-21 18:21:03 -0400] jtimberman: and then you have to launch w/ a 64 bit machine iamge.
[2012-05-21 18:21:18 -0400] jtimberman: lusis: node['platform'] etc, embrace the []
[2012-05-21 18:21:38 -0400] lusis: jtimberman: no
[2012-05-21 18:21:42 -0400] lusis: dot all the things
[2012-05-21 18:21:49 -0400] lusis: I embrace my chains
[2012-05-21 18:21:51 -0400] lusis: ;)
[2012-05-21 18:22:06 -0400] lusis: I also still cat pipe grep
[2012-05-21 18:25:01 -0400] ampledata: i'm adding bracket syntax to my styleguide
[2012-05-21 18:25:07 -0400] ampledata: if u want dot syntax use java
[2012-05-21 18:25:44 -0400] lusis: REmind me to hit you next time I see you ;)
[2012-05-21 18:26:00 -0400] lusis: Totally missed you last week. Missed most of the conference =(
[2012-05-21 18:26:17 -0400] lusis: either in my room talking to customers or in between sessions meeting with customers
[2012-05-21 18:26:21 -0400] c_t: jtimberman: fair enough
[2012-05-21 18:28:22 -0400] jtimberman: lusis: but you were at the bar track right?
[2012-05-21 18:28:33 -0400] lusis: ONE OF US
[2012-05-21 18:28:35 -0400] lusis: ;)
[2012-05-21 18:28:46 -0400] lnxchk: LOL
[2012-05-21 18:33:57 -0400] imeyer: ONE OF US
[2012-05-21 18:34:45 -0400] c_t: Gabba gabba hey
[2012-05-21 18:35:20 -0400] imeyer: yo jtimberlake why aren't you on im
[2012-05-21 18:35:23 -0400] imeyer: jtimberman
[2012-05-21 18:35:54 -0400] c_t: he's busy bringing hairy back
[2012-05-21 18:36:12 -0400] imeyer: lol
[2012-05-21 18:36:32 -0400] lnxchk: ....
[2012-05-21 18:36:54 -0400] imeyer: thank god for itunes match
[2012-05-21 18:37:29 -0400] lnxchk: did you get something good? i'm sick of this pacha podcast, and the new pryda isn't out until tomorrow
[2012-05-21 18:39:03 -0400] c_t: I've been listening to Boris Godunov lately
[2012-05-21 18:39:06 -0400] c_t: it's pretty good
[2012-05-21 18:39:16 -0400] c_t: ooh, and Wagner's birthday's tomoroww
[2012-05-21 18:39:25 -0400] c_t: o_O
[2012-05-21 18:39:30 -0400] c_t: "tomorrow"
[2012-05-21 18:39:43 -0400] c_t: which means... I'll then listen to all thirteen of his operas in a row
[2012-05-21 18:39:47 -0400] c_t: takes a while
[2012-05-21 18:39:54 -0400] lnxchk: good grief yes
[2012-05-21 18:40:41 -0400] c_t: this even includes the three early ones that are rather obscure and rarely performed
[2012-05-21 18:40:50 -0400] imeyer: lnxchk: i dunno how much you like more of the classic house stuff.. but "Burning (Round Table Knights Remix)"
[2012-05-21 18:40:55 -0400] c_t: Rienzi fits on a mere 4 CDs
[2012-05-21 18:41:32 -0400] c_t: has some good parts, but there's a ballet in Act II that goes on and on and on for about half an hour
[2012-05-21 18:41:43 -0400] imeyer: is the fire i've been listening to recently
[2012-05-21 18:42:08 -0400] c_t: Boris Godunov has some remarkably high levels of majesty though
[2012-05-21 18:42:30 -0400] c_t: and there's a part of it that's a strong contender for the most metal thing I've ever heard
[2012-05-21 18:42:38 -0400] c_t: it sounds like the Melvins decided to make an opera
[2012-05-21 18:43:36 -0400] imeyer: i am so pissed i missed the melvins last month

[2012-05-21 21:13:58 -0400] hoover_damm: ... please pardon this flamebait i'm about to link... I just wanted to share http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/naterockhold/matriu-as-lightweight-and-open-source-it-automatio
[2012-05-21 21:17:24 -0400] yfeldblum: ummmm
[2012-05-21 21:17:41 -0400] yfeldblum: "This greatly reduces the usage of system resources"
[2012-05-21 21:19:02 -0400] yfeldblum: i'm not sure about that as a long-term strategy
[2012-05-21 21:19:35 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, did you watch the video?
[2012-05-21 21:20:15 -0400] hoover_damm: basically this is kickstarter for something that could have easily been a github repo with a README
[2012-05-21 21:20:35 -0400] hoover_damm: so I wouldn't put much thought into it
[2012-05-21 21:21:46 -0400] yfeldblum: ya
[2012-05-21 21:22:18 -0400] holoway: I mean, god bless that guy
[2012-05-21 21:22:37 -0400] hoover_damm: I wish him luck, I won't be giving him my $$
[2012-05-21 21:22:37 -0400] holoway: we busted our asses to pay ourselves while we built the first parts of Chef
[2012-05-21 21:22:51 -0400] holoway: if he can get it done without having to do that, and can just kickstarter it, more power to him
[2012-05-21 21:23:00 -0400] hoover_damm: right
[2012-05-21 21:23:12 -0400] holoway: cause bootstrapping is f-ing hard :)
[2012-05-21 21:23:24 -0400] hoover_damm: we're not even discussing that
[2012-05-21 21:23:30 -0400] hoover_damm: but I guess it leads into it
[2012-05-21 21:23:35 -0400] mattray: holoway: you been hanging out in the South lately? "god bless that guy" sounds pretty close to "bless your heart"
[2012-05-21 21:23:52 -0400] hoover_damm: holoway, basically my point was it should have been a github repo with a smidgeon of code before the Kickstarter
[2012-05-21 21:23:57 -0400] yfeldblum: chef = tight abstractions, building blocks, elegant dsl, idempotency, failure tolerance, and distributed-friendly - these are the things we value, not chef's lightness on resources
[2012-05-21 21:24:05 -0400] hoover_damm: otherwise with the kickstarter page and video i'm just going to go back to chef
[2012-05-21 21:24:16 -0400] hoover_damm: and wait
[2012-05-21 21:24:47 -0400] c_t: isn't "bless your heart" what Southerners say when most people would say "Die in a fire"?
[2012-05-21 21:24:53 -0400] mattray: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bless+your+heart
[2012-05-21 21:25:11 -0400] c_t: woohoo
[2012-05-21 21:25:23 -0400] c_t: now with Debian support: https://github.com/ctdk/dwarf_fortress
[2012-05-21 21:25:39 -0400] StormSilver: Hehe.
[2012-05-21 21:25:41 -0400] mattray: c_t: you really want me to have no productivity?
[2012-05-21 21:25:57 -0400] StormSilver: For some reason, being built on node.js automatically means it is lightweight.
[2012-05-21 21:26:00 -0400] c_t: The scourge of productivity will be vanquished
[2012-05-21 21:26:00 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, nodephp lately?
[2012-05-21 21:26:12 -0400] yfeldblum: StormSilver, that's correct
[2012-05-21 21:26:14 -0400] hoover_damm: yes http://nodephp.org
[2012-05-21 21:26:27 -0400] hoover_damm: nodejs in EVERYTHING!
[2012-05-21 21:27:38 -0400] yfeldblum: holy ... why would anyone want to write something with both php's medusa syntax and nodejs's callback hell?
[2012-05-21 21:28:00 -0400] StormSilver: I can't tell if nodephp is a joke or not??
[2012-05-21 21:29:19 -0400] hoover_damm: it's not a joke
[2012-05-21 21:29:30 -0400] StormSilver: I... don't know what to say to that.
[2012-05-21 21:29:58 -0400] hoover_damm: as tenderlove puts it... when people ask why? he says why not?
[2012-05-21 21:30:00 -0400] c_t: StormSilver: I think you're reacting about the same way I did when I came across mod_rexx for apache
[2012-05-21 21:31:13 -0400] StormSilver: At least HTML9 is a funny joke
[2012-05-21 21:31:51 -0400] StormSilver: This is just terrifying.
[2012-05-21 21:32:51 -0400] c_t: mod_rexx was kinda frightening, to be honst
[2012-05-21 21:32:53 -0400] c_t: honest
[2012-05-21 21:32:56 -0400] StormSilver: c_t: Yeah, that just doesn't make any sense
[2012-05-21 21:33:00 -0400] c_t: I suppose someone out there must have needed it
[2012-05-21 21:33:29 -0400] hoover_damm: nodephp is just the same reaction as coffeescript or clojurescript
[2012-05-21 21:33:29 -0400] hoover_damm: to me
[2012-05-21 21:33:45 -0400] hoover_damm: you shouldn't take much more out of it then that
[2012-05-21 21:34:51 -0400] StormSilver: I mean, if it's a pet project just to see if you can do it, then that's one thing.
[2012-05-21 21:35:59 -0400] hoover_damm: StormSilver, there is only one thing i'm sure of.  PHP People are nutty
[2012-05-21 21:36:15 -0400] hoover_damm: after EY picked up orchestra
[2012-05-21 21:36:26 -0400] c_t: I always thought PHP sounded like the sort of thing your mother would worry about
[2012-05-21 21:36:32 -0400] hoover_damm: and actually meeting them, seeing how people who drive php work and operate
[2012-05-21 21:36:44 -0400] c_t: "Oh I dunno, I heard bad things about that PHP stuff..."
[2012-05-21 21:36:51 -0400] StormSilver: Hehe
[2012-05-21 21:36:52 -0400] hoover_damm: basically reaffirms my problem with people 'finishing'
[2012-05-21 21:37:10 -0400] hoover_damm: people often start something and try to refactor and fix it before they have finished their first draft
[2012-05-21 21:37:18 -0400] StormSilver: I thought the weird toolbox analogy was really good for PHP: http://www.flickr.com/photos/raindrift/7095238893/in/set-72157629492908038/
[2012-05-21 21:37:27 -0400] hoover_damm: you cannot fix a moving piece of code
[2012-05-21 21:37:48 -0400] hoover_damm: find your finishing point, then you can ponder that
[2012-05-21 21:38:22 -0400] hoover_damm: maybe i'm right, maybe i'm wrong
[2012-05-21 21:42:16 -0400] mattray: StormSilver: I will find a way to use that in a slideshow
[2012-05-21 21:42:30 -0400] StormSilver: mattray: :D
[2012-05-21 21:43:27 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, chef fork in php yet? :)
[2012-05-21 21:43:43 -0400] mattray: somewhere someone was working on PHP bindings
[2012-05-21 21:43:52 -0400] mattray: like a PHP version of Spice
[2012-05-21 21:50:20 -0400] yfeldblum: of course you'll want a php client library against the chef-server-api
[2012-05-21 21:50:51 -0400] yfeldblum: because you might have a large php application and you want to extend it to show nodes grouped by role membership or whatever
[2012-05-21 21:51:15 -0400] yfeldblum: or you're providing a way to define applications via a gui that get backed by chef data bag items
[2012-05-21 21:51:18 -0400] yfeldblum: or whatever
[2012-05-21 21:51:26 -0400] yfeldblum: but ... php + nodejs?
[2012-05-21 21:51:46 -0400] hoover_damm: I see people linking v8 in their rails apps
[2012-05-21 21:51:56 -0400] hoover_damm: overcaring?
[2012-05-21 21:52:33 -0400] hoover_damm: javascript is filtering into every language wether you like it or not
[2012-05-21 21:52:52 -0400] hoover_damm: how it filters in, depends on the person doing it
[2012-05-21 21:53:17 -0400] hoover_damm: nodephp could be a simple way of delivering nodejs performance with the ease of php style programming
[2012-05-21 21:53:31 -0400] hoover_damm: is it wrong? or is it just solving a problem?
[2012-05-21 21:55:30 -0400] yfeldblum: yes, linking v8 so they can serve coffeescript source, compiled to javascript for the client; or to compile the coffeescript source to javascript in a build step, and have that delivered to the client without loading libv8 at runtime
[2012-05-21 22:01:15 -0400] yfeldblum: the coffeescript compiler is written in javascript
[2012-05-21 22:02:34 -0400] yfeldblum: also this is only the people who can't rely on having nodejs or any other javascript runtime (jscore, wsh, etc) already installed and available and need to package up a javascript runtime with the app
