[2012-05-09 02:32:18 -0400] jtimberman: bah, atomic-penguin left.
[2012-05-09 02:32:22 -0400] jtimberman: *hours* ago i imagine
[2012-05-09 14:11:14 -0400] StormSilver: jtimberman: Do you know if it's intentional that the wordpress cookbook generates a new DB password every time chef runs?
[2012-05-09 14:55:06 -0400] hoover_damn: if you have to ask that question you should be filing a bug
[2012-05-09 15:04:50 -0400] jtimberman: StormSilver: shouldn't be doing that if you're using chef-client/server, should have that in an attribute for the node.
[2012-05-09 15:05:15 -0400] StormSilver: jtimberman: It's doing node.set = secure_password instead of node.set_unless
[2012-05-09 15:06:09 -0400] StormSilver: jtimberman: Seemed a tad fishy to me, but I thought "Hey, it's PHP and it's Wordpress, maybe that's a security feature"
[2012-05-09 15:06:46 -0400] jtimberman: oh that might be a bug then, i see mysql::server does set_unless
[2012-05-09 15:07:05 -0400] jtimberman: can you open a ticket?
[2012-05-09 15:07:05 -0400] StormSilver: That was the first thing I looked at too :)
[2012-05-09 15:07:06 -0400] jtimberman: :D
[2012-05-09 15:07:08 -0400] StormSilver: Will do
[2012-05-09 15:07:11 -0400] jtimberman: thanks sir
[2012-05-09 15:07:25 -0400] jtimberman: but the workshop for chefconf is going to be awesome :)
[2012-05-09 15:07:30 -0400] StormSilver: Woo!
[2012-05-09 15:07:35 -0400] StormSilver: Too bad my company won't pay for me to go.
[2012-05-09 15:08:15 -0400] StormSilver: I was even like "Look! I get half off! I am cool!" but they said "JUSTIFY YOUR EXPENSE"
[2012-05-09 15:09:17 -0400] jtimberman: it's going to be the most awesome thing.
[2012-05-09 15:09:30 -0400] StormSilver: Yeah, just rub salt in that wound.
[2012-05-09 15:16:14 -0400] jtimberman: no thats the justification
[2012-05-09 15:16:23 -0400] StormSilver: Oh! Well.
[2012-05-09 15:16:34 -0400] StormSilver: I didn't try that. i r dumb
[2012-05-09 15:18:32 -0400] jtimberman: hehehehe
[2012-05-09 15:18:45 -0400] jtimberman: thats what i told my company ;)
[2012-05-09 15:19:07 -0400] StormSilver: jtimberman: Yeah, I can see how it would have been really difficult to convince them to let you go :P
[2012-05-09 15:19:23 -0400] jtimberman: :D
[2012-05-09 15:36:05 -0400] atomic-penguin: I used that node.set_unless and the sshkey gem to save ssh public keys to a node for an application.  Thought it was a really clever use of attribs.
[2012-05-09 18:27:22 -0400] c_t: holy hell, there's a CLI for Time Machine
