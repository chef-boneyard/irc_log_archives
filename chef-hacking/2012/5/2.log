[2012-05-02 01:23:48 -0400] msf: run_context is totally available

[2012-05-02 15:23:10 -0400] hoover_damn: but at least I'll never have to worry about ohai not having cloud again

[2012-05-02 15:36:27 -0400] hoover_damn: yeap i'm filing a ticket to fix the whole ipv6 thing
[2012-05-02 15:36:48 -0400] StormSilver: I think laurent\ has code in OHAI-347 to fix it?
[2012-05-02 15:36:56 -0400] hoover_damn: as OHAI-347 is to fix ipv6 access
[2012-05-02 15:37:01 -0400] hoover_damn: this is a regression of laurent's patches
[2012-05-02 15:37:02 -0400] StormSilver: Ah
[2012-05-02 15:37:10 -0400] hoover_damn: different ticket
[2012-05-02 15:38:20 -0400] hoover_damn: just gave me a slight hiccup which made me go look at a ticket to triple check it wasn't a dupe
[2012-05-02 15:39:16 -0400] StormSilver: Yeah, I feel the same
[2012-05-02 15:41:18 -0400] hoover_damn: I need to stop doing that as it's an additional context switch
[2012-05-02 15:41:22 -0400] hoover_damn: when I was right the first time
[2012-05-02 16:29:49 -0400] laurent\: i'm already working on fixing OHAI-347 + adding correct support to ipv6
[2012-05-02 16:29:56 -0400] laurent\: as stated in OHAI-347 comments
[2012-05-02 16:30:11 -0400] hoover_damn: it's still a separate ticket
[2012-05-02 16:30:26 -0400] laurent\: and no, it's not one of my regression
[2012-05-02 16:30:32 -0400] hoover_damn: your issue is fixing ipv6
[2012-05-02 16:30:36 -0400] hoover_damn: my issue is the other
[2012-05-02 16:30:42 -0400] laurent\: just read the ticket description
[2012-05-02 16:31:01 -0400] hoover_damn: I've read it 4x, no
[2012-05-02 16:31:10 -0400] hoover_damn: I tried my best, it didn't look right, filed a ticket, done.
[2012-05-02 16:32:38 -0400] hoover_damn: still a second ticket
[2012-05-02 16:32:39 -0400] hoover_damn: thanks
[2012-05-02 16:32:55 -0400] laurent\: it has been reopened because of the regression it introduced
[2012-05-02 16:33:08 -0400] laurent\: anyway, not a big deal
[2012-05-02 16:33:23 -0400] hoover_damn: then you should have opened a second ticket for the regression
[2012-05-02 16:33:34 -0400] laurent\: probably
[2012-05-02 16:33:38 -0400] hoover_damn: I'm a bitch when it comes to tickets and how I think they should be run
[2012-05-02 16:33:45 -0400] hoover_damn: so you should be thankful I don't work for Opscode and help btm

[2012-05-02 23:23:17 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, seriously you sould have made 2 bootstraps for 12.04 then
[2012-05-02 23:23:33 -0400] hoover_damn: btm, remember 12.04 has both 1.9 and 1.8, so only giving 1 option will make a lot of people sigh
[2012-05-02 23:23:41 -0400] hoover_damn: specially when 1.8 should be out the door
[2012-05-02 23:23:42 -0400] hoover_damn: and dead
[2012-05-02 23:25:09 -0400] hoover_damn: and to just give 1.9.x when there's still some stragglers on 1.8 would be just equally as bad imo
[2012-05-02 23:25:15 -0400] hoover_damn: so you'd have to give two bootstraps heh
[2012-05-02 23:25:54 -0400] hoover_damn: beyond what I said
[2012-05-02 23:29:00 -0400] btm: there should be a billion bootstraps. really, I don't want any now that we default to the chef-full bootstrap.
[2012-05-02 23:29:34 -0400] btm: but we're talking about the most bang for the bootstrap here, so we slipped it in.
[2012-05-02 23:30:01 -0400] btm: Also, nobody wrote a more flexible bootstrap.
[2012-05-02 23:32:24 -0400] hoover_damn: how do you make it more flexible?

[2012-05-02 23:32:59 -0400] hoover_damn: fork knife and rewrite it in clojure
[2012-05-02 23:33:03 -0400] hoover_damn: and then submit it back as a pull request?
[2012-05-02 23:33:04 -0400] btm: haha
