[2012-05-12 01:11:09 -0400] laurent\: it 3:10am, i'm off to bed, have a nice week-end and a nice chefconf ! :)
[2012-05-12 01:15:31 -0400] btm: I'll be around all weekend waiting in a hotel for ChefConf to get here.
[2012-05-12 01:19:00 -0400] btm: So it's not really a friday.
[2012-05-12 17:22:41 -0400] jtimberman: ptrstr_, appears that this line is it:     cache_options({ :path => platform_specific_path("/etc/chef/cache/checksums"), :skip_expires => true })
[2012-05-12 17:22:47 -0400] jtimberman: in Chef::Config
[2012-05-12 17:32:58 -0400] jtimberman: CHEF-3106

[2012-05-12 17:38:24 -0400] github-bawt: [knife-ec2/master] chef-full is new default - mattray
[2012-05-12 17:38:24 -0400] github-bawt: [knife-ec2/master] Merge pull request #45 from mattray/KNIFE_EC2-56 - Steven Danna
[2012-05-12 17:58:49 -0400] ptrstr_: jtimberman: that works for me but should it really be hardcoded independent of file_cache_path?
[2012-05-12 22:01:46 -0400] jtimberman: ptrstr_: yes, as that is also the location where knife cookbook test caches checksums of files it has already checked syntax for, so it doesn't re-check unless they've changed
