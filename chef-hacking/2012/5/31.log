[2012-05-31 00:31:19 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm not sure if it's still a beta, I use the Jabber interface on Hipchat alot

[2012-05-31 09:15:40 -0400] achied: hi everyone
[2012-05-31 09:15:59 -0400] achied: i'm learning about chef source code
[2012-05-31 09:17:36 -0400] achied: and i have a question about chef-expander
[2012-05-31 09:18:41 -0400] achied: subscribers to the rabbit queues has a limit
[2012-05-31 09:18:52 -0400] achied: one subscriptor for one queue
[2012-05-31 09:20:08 -0400] achied: it's possible increment this limit for integration purposes?
[2012-05-31 15:23:17 -0400] hoover_damm: ah what a beautiful day... when you put a space in your search query
[2012-05-31 15:23:25 -0400] hoover_damm: and it takes you two moments to realize you just added the space back

[2012-05-31 17:01:42 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] Release Chef RC 10.12.0.rc.1 - Bryan McLellan
[2012-05-31 19:19:49 -0400] renchap: btm: is it possible to merge https://github.com/opscode/chef/pull/303 before release ?
[2012-05-31 19:29:06 -0400] btm: renchap: probably because we don't even know how it did anything previously, so it shouldn't be able to cause a regression.

[2012-05-31 23:54:01 -0400] c_t: Performed a little experiment
[2012-05-31 23:54:14 -0400] c_t: you can, in fact, happily run chef on Linux on s/390
[2012-05-31 23:54:45 -0400] ampledata: nice
[2012-05-31 23:54:57 -0400] ampledata: we always cross-compile splunk to s/390
[2012-05-31 23:55:50 -0400] c_t: have to install from gems though
[2012-05-31 23:56:30 -0400] c_t: chef for z/OS would be crazy awesome sauce, although I dunno how it would get done
