[2012-12-07 00:05:43 -0500] alop: should be merged before 1/1/2013, as it pertains to ntp and leapseconds
[2012-12-07 00:07:00 -0500] jtimberman: alop: we're going to have a "marathon" (3 hour) cook code review meeting tomorrow, as long as the ticket is "Fix provided", we'll likely get to it.
[2012-12-07 00:07:15 -0500] alop: sweet
[2012-12-07 00:07:23 -0500] alop: it is "Fix Provided"

[2012-12-07 03:22:40 -0500] ohlol: why would an lwrp's resource defaults not get set?
[2012-12-07 16:33:56 -0500] fnichol: hey chefs, i have a couple of questions re: the chef-full.erb bootstrap template (https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/bootstrap/chef-full.erb)
[2012-12-07 16:35:23 -0500] fnichol: in particular: the script tries to use wget, then curl but what if neither exists? perhaps we're missing and else case? even if that prints an error ("wget or curl required") and exits non zero to kill the bootstrap
[2012-12-07 16:37:08 -0500] fnichol: and the other: could we pipe the key-cat'ing statement through sed and directly to its destination file rather than the additional temp file with awk? was there a reason for this, like supporting a specific platform?
[2012-12-07 17:17:25 -0500] teukka: fnichol: https://github.com/opscode/chef/pull/429 and https://github.com/opscode/chef/pull/427
[2012-12-07 17:18:19 -0500] teukka: both reviewed but not committed
[2012-12-07 17:24:53 -0500] fnichol: ha, I just made very similar updates to another bootstrap-like template. also means i'm not crazy, thanks!
[2012-12-07 17:27:47 -0500] teukka: 429 (CHEF-3514) is also a security fix so I would like to see it merged on some point
