[2012-09-24 16:07:41 -0400] miketheman: I'm sure there are people here using the opscode 'users' cookbook, right?
[2012-09-24 16:08:01 -0400] miketheman: if you are, do your json databag objects for users require the use of a uid?
[2012-09-24 16:17:39 -0400] jtimberman: miketheman: uid is required
[2012-09-24 16:18:33 -0400] jtimberman: miketheman: line 75 in users/providers/manage.rb
[2012-09-24 16:18:40 -0400] miketheman: jtimberman: so adding a new user to a list of users requires a manual lookup step for the next available uid?
[2012-09-24 16:19:19 -0400] jtimberman: Yes.
[2012-09-24 16:19:38 -0400] jtimberman: Or, you could process the data from the server in a knife exec or similar :)
[2012-09-24 16:20:36 -0400] miketheman: yech. oh well.
[2012-09-24 16:21:10 -0400] jtimberman: well, like, its good to not have overlapping userids, and make sure they are the same across all systems right
[2012-09-24 16:23:40 -0400] miketheman: so: overlapping is not possible, right?
[2012-09-24 16:24:27 -0400] miketheman: and same across all systems: still haven't found a good reasoning for this besides NFS/samba
[2012-09-24 16:25:05 -0400] jtimberman: thats a general "good practice" from the "Days of Yore"(tm)
[2012-09-24 16:25:48 -0400] miketheman: indeed. but forcing a user to find the next available unused uid seems a little annoying right now
[2012-09-24 16:26:04 -0400] c_t: so, potentially dumb question
[2012-09-24 16:27:03 -0400] miketheman: jtimberman: not SOO annoying, but this: `grep -hR uid data_bags/users/ | cut -f2 -d":" | sort`
[2012-09-24 16:27:07 -0400] c_t: if one, say, has a heavyweight resource and provider that was being worked on inside of chef itself, would it work well enough to extract it and put it into a cookbook with some sort of null default recipe to let other cookbooks be able to use it?
[2012-09-24 16:27:17 -0400] jtimberman: miketheman: rather than letting the system do it autoincrementing from the UID_MIN in login.defs?
[2012-09-24 16:28:10 -0400] miketheman: jtimberman: sure. I can definitely see the benefit, but the cost is "I need to remember this other thing too".
[2012-09-24 16:28:36 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: you mean like... https://github.com/coderanger/heartbeat/blob/eae58f2b400a4a5264984fe885224733e0bcf509/providers/null.rb https://github.com/coderanger/heartbeat/blob/eae58f2b400a4a5264984fe885224733e0bcf509/libraries/default.rb#L69
[2012-09-24 16:29:33 -0400] c_t: perhaps
[2012-09-24 16:29:54 -0400] c_t: I suppose the other option is to just finally finish the 2nd half of it, but I am, as they say, kind of busy
