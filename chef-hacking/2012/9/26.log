[2012-09-26 00:57:54 -0400] jtimberman: fujin!
[2012-09-26 01:09:35 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: Hail!
[2012-09-26 01:09:38 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: how goes it?
[2012-09-26 01:22:15 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: good, hacking some gdash :)
[2012-09-26 01:22:29 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, why gdash?
[2012-09-26 01:22:33 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damm: why not?
[2012-09-26 01:22:37 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, has anyone introduced you to descartes?
[2012-09-26 01:22:41 -0400] jtimberman: no
[2012-09-26 01:22:47 -0400] jtimberman: specifically, gdash cookbook
[2012-09-26 01:22:48 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, if your going to go that far... you should step left onto descartes
[2012-09-26 01:22:53 -0400] hoover_damm: ahh
[2012-09-26 01:22:57 -0400] jtimberman: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/descartes
[2012-09-26 01:22:57 -0400] hoover_damm: fork fujins?
[2012-09-26 01:22:59 -0400] hoover_damm: hack on it?
[2012-09-26 01:23:01 -0400] jtimberman: sme's
[2012-09-26 01:23:07 -0400] jtimberman: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/gdash
[2012-09-26 01:23:27 -0400] hoover_damm: still heavywater
[2012-09-26 01:23:29 -0400] jtimberman: hack time later, book time with my boy.
[2012-09-26 01:34:47 -0400] fujin: we've some modifications planned for gdash I think, try to bring the performance level up
[2012-09-26 01:34:54 -0400] fujin: shit balks with like 100+ dashboards
[2012-09-26 01:37:30 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] PrajaktaPurohit pushed 1 new commit to reporting_with_summary_only: http://git.io/kzoB9g

[2012-09-26 04:33:54 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: yeah like, i'm using graphite for my two linux systems at home :)
[2012-09-26 04:33:58 -0400] jtimberman: not a lot of crazy
[2012-09-26 05:01:50 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: it's nice for that kind of stuff
[2012-09-26 05:01:55 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: did you see our gdash graph generator stuff?
[2012-09-26 05:02:04 -0400] fujin: gdash_dashboard and gdash_component LWRPs I think.
[2012-09-26 05:02:55 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: yeah
[2012-09-26 05:02:57 -0400] jtimberman: lovely
[2012-09-26 05:03:38 -0400] fujin: brillo :D
[2012-09-26 05:04:15 -0400] jtimberman: i'm gonna has pull requests. i see both cookbooks are apache license, want CLA?
[2012-09-26 05:04:39 -0400] jtimberman: also, i see you're using node attributes with method chaining, and i won't judge ;)
[2012-09-26 05:07:32 -0400] fujin: I just think they haven't been updated yet with t-k and fc compliance
[2012-09-26 05:07:44 -0400] fujin: we have an internal effort underway to move all of the cookbooks to hw-cookbooks account
[2012-09-26 05:07:45 -0400] jtimberman: no worries :)
[2012-09-26 05:07:49 -0400] fujin: adding t-k and fc compliance in the process
[2012-09-26 05:07:58 -0400] jtimberman: i posted some infos!
[2012-09-26 05:08:02 -0400] fujin: no CLA required :D

[2012-09-26 05:08:32 -0400] jtimberman: that reflects reality of what i'm doing for contributions
[2012-09-26 05:09:31 -0400] jtimberman: sudo chef-client -l fatal -F doc: my favorite.
[2012-09-26 05:11:55 -0400] jtimberman: also, holy shit do i love the diff output on updated files
[2012-09-26 05:29:28 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: yeah, -Fdoc is f'n awesome.
[2012-09-26 05:32:29 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: mad props to kallistec
[2012-09-26 05:32:38 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: you're going to chef summit, YES?
[2012-09-26 05:44:29 -0400] fujin: ya
[2012-09-26 05:44:41 -0400] fujin: got my shiney ass new business mastercard
[2012-09-26 05:44:53 -0400] fujin: just in time to buy expensive airline tickets :D
[2012-09-26 06:22:23 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: https://github.com/heavywater/chef-graphite/pull/18
[2012-09-26 06:22:34 -0400] jtimberman: and now i see there's several other pull requests and issues.
[2012-09-26 06:22:38 -0400] jtimberman: :-|
[2012-09-26 06:24:23 -0400] jtimberman: though my attribute for the port, node['graphite']['listen_port'] is used in gdash :)
[2012-09-26 06:26:08 -0400] fujin: thx! I'll takea  look.
[2012-09-26 06:26:27 -0400] jtimberman: there's a couple PR's with the base dir type attribute, and the port attribute.
[2012-09-26 06:26:59 -0400] fujin: artifacts of open sourcing work I guess ;(
[2012-09-26 06:27:17 -0400] fujin: I need to stop doing work today, but will take a look at that tomorrow
[2012-09-26 06:27:45 -0400] jtimberman: no worries
[2012-09-26 06:27:57 -0400] jtimberman: i'll have a gdash PR soon too
[2012-09-26 06:28:02 -0400] fujin: w00t
[2012-09-26 06:28:18 -0400] jtimberman: amusingly, foodcritic doesn't find node.method.chaining.attributes
[2012-09-26 06:28:22 -0400] jtimberman: just symbols instead of string.
[2012-09-26 06:28:40 -0400] jtimberman: but the method chaining use is the most surprising to new users :)
[2012-09-26 06:29:06 -0400] jtimberman: like, if you have an attribute with a dash in the name set as a string say in the cookbook attributes, but then try and use it with a dash in the method name of course doesn't work
[2012-09-26 06:31:41 -0400] jtimberman: anyway, sleep nao
[2012-09-26 06:32:32 -0400] fujin: heavy water has always consistently used method chaining
[2012-09-26 06:32:36 -0400] fujin: before foodcritic even existed
[2012-09-26 06:32:49 -0400] fujin: and before you guys were saying symbols were worse than strings for accessing 'em
[2012-09-26 06:32:55 -0400] fujin: haha, but I get it. not a big deal
[2012-09-26 06:33:02 -0400] fujin: we're working on switchign them all to the consistent new FC style
[2012-09-26 14:54:15 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, what's this? https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/encrypted_data_bag_item.rb#L134
[2012-09-26 14:57:42 -0400] github-bawt: [knife-hp] mattray pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/uxfD4w
[2012-09-26 14:57:42 -0400] github-bawt: [knife-hp/master] Merge branch '0.2.0' - mattray
[2012-09-26 14:57:42 -0400] github-bawt: [knife-hp/master] added Adam as an author before pushing to Rubygems - mattray
[2012-09-26 16:25:32 -0400] jtimberman: yfeldblum: my internets decided to disconnect. what about that encrypted data bag line?
[2012-09-26 16:26:00 -0400] jtimberman: i don't know much about the openssl library or the methods therein
[2012-09-26 16:26:29 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, that line doesn't seem like the right thing to do
[2012-09-26 16:28:48 -0400] jtimberman: yfeldblum: i'm not finding that method in the rdoc for openssl::cipher
[2012-09-26 16:28:54 -0400] jtimberman: so i'm not sure at all.
[2012-09-26 16:29:06 -0400] c_t: what does that line do?
[2012-09-26 16:29:06 -0400] jtimberman: is there a different, or better approach?
[2012-09-26 16:29:26 -0400] jtimberman: can you open a ticket, and post on the chef-dev list for wider discussion?
[2012-09-26 16:30:01 -0400] jtimberman: apparently, http://apidock.com/ruby/v1_9_2_180/OpenSSL/Cipher/pkcs5_keyivgen
[2012-09-26 16:35:51 -0400] c_t: hmm
[2012-09-26 16:36:25 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, is there any restriction on encrypted-data-bag-item keys?
[2012-09-26 16:36:39 -0400] jtimberman: yfeldblum: like, what they can be? I don't think so?
[2012-09-26 16:36:47 -0400] jtimberman: you can use a phrase or a key file, iirc.
[2012-09-26 16:37:02 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, it derives an encryption key and message IV deterministically from the "original" key
[2012-09-26 16:37:03 -0400] c_t: hell, in the tests the key is something like "abc123secret"
[2012-09-26 16:38:51 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, so instead of having a different IV per encrypted message, you've got one IV for all messages
[2012-09-26 16:41:20 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, which means that, for all messages sharing the first prefix blocks of cleartext, the first n blocks of ciphertext will be shared, where n is the number of shared prefix blocks of the cleartexts
[2012-09-26 16:42:38 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, so if you're encrypting two strings that happen to be the same, normally what you want to happen is that the ciphertexts will be different (even though the cleartexts happen to be the same) so that anybody looking only at the ciphertexts has got no indication about what's in the cleartexts apart from a rough guess at length
[2012-09-26 16:43:01 -0400] c_t: yfeldblum: I've been slowly but surely working on some chef encryption stuff
[2012-09-26 16:43:10 -0400] c_t: https://github.com/dailykos/chef/blob/CHEF-3050/chef/lib/chef/encryption.rb
[2012-09-26 16:43:15 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, and the function of the IV is to provide that individuation
[2012-09-26 16:43:31 -0400] c_t: ^^ not inspired, but it does move the encryption functions out to their own thing
[2012-09-26 16:45:20 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, hmm i don't quite see a need to extract the particular algorithms used by encrypted-data-bag-items out and call it "Chef::Encryption" because chef uses encryption in other ways and it's definitely not the same algorithms
[2012-09-26 16:46:02 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, rather, chef could use crypto in other ways
[2012-09-26 16:47:51 -0400] c_t: yfeldblum: I was using the same functions in another resource/provider set
[2012-09-26 16:48:00 -0400] c_t: for encrypted cookbook files
[2012-09-26 16:48:14 -0400] c_t: lack of time has been an issue with finishing encrypted remote files though
[2012-09-26 16:48:26 -0400] c_t: but I've been using encryped cookbook files for a while
[2012-09-26 16:48:49 -0400] c_t: (in fact, long enough that it's making me a little concerned that the chef branch I have it in and using is getting too old)
[2012-09-26 16:48:49 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, i don't think encrypted cookbook files are a good thing
[2012-09-26 16:49:17 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, i think cookbooks should be source, and if it's encrypted then it's not source, so it shouldn't be in a cookbook
[2012-09-26 16:49:38 -0400] c_t: hmm
[2012-09-26 16:49:41 -0400] c_t: how would you do it?
[2012-09-26 16:50:04 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3480
[2012-09-26 16:50:24 -0400] c_t: (my particular case was a Config.pm file we wanted out of git)
[2012-09-26 16:51:26 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, is that a config file for a perl application?
[2012-09-26 16:51:57 -0400] c_t: yup
[2012-09-26 16:52:13 -0400] c_t: so I encrypted it and stuck in in chef
[2012-09-26 16:52:23 -0400] c_t: so when it deploys to production or staging it decrypts and sticks in in
[2012-09-26 16:52:35 -0400] c_t: while the non-sensitive Config.pm is there for dev and such
[2012-09-26 16:52:53 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, i might assemble it from data with a template, and sensitive bits of the data that go into the template may be encrypted
[2012-09-26 16:53:13 -0400] c_t: hmm
[2012-09-26 16:53:32 -0400] c_t: that might be a better way around it, yes
[2012-09-26 16:53:33 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, and the encrypted data could come from an encrypted data-bag item, or it could come from encrypted node attributes
[2012-09-26 16:53:39 -0400] c_t: it's, ahem, a sort of ugly file
[2012-09-26 16:53:55 -0400] c_t: The transition from perl to rails continues
[2012-09-26 16:56:04 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, or the 12factor style: i might ship the config.pm with the app itself (not with a cookbook), and have the config.pm read env vars, and drop a start script that exports the env vars and then execs the app, and instead of running the app directly, run the start script
[2012-09-26 16:57:19 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, so if it's db connection info, for example, have a config.pm that reads the env var "DATABASE_URL", and always boot the app with that env var exported by means of always booting the app with a start script that exports DATABASE_URL first
[2012-09-26 16:58:08 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, and then you can stick an encrypted version of the db url into the node data or a data-bag item, and decrypt it in a recipe when writing out the start script
[2012-09-26 16:58:26 -0400] c_t: yeah, it's stuff like db connection info, recaptcha keys, etc
[2012-09-26 16:58:52 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, `export DATABASE_URL='postgres://db.com/db_name' ; exec /path/to/app`
[2012-09-26 16:59:11 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, http://www.12factor.net/config
[2012-09-26 16:59:41 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, because you asked me: "how would you do it?" :D
[2012-09-26 17:01:43 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, obviously in that case, the config.pm that ships with the app will have to look in the env vars for DATABASE_URL and then parse it (unless it can somehow use it directly), and if that env var isn't found then the config.pm can assume it's a local dev environment and the database is on localhost etc
[2012-09-26 17:03:10 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, and if there's some way to tell that this is the non-dev environment (like APP_ENVIRONMENT=production or whatever you want to do), then the config.pm can detect that state and then can die if the DATABASE_URL isn't also found in the env vars
[2012-09-26 17:05:02 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, basically the app gets to say: "these are the env vars that are my public interface and env vars are the only way to configure me", and your cookbook obeys that public interface and sets the right env vars, and the env vars can even just be read out straight from node attributes or a data-bag item
[2012-09-26 17:05:52 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, more specifically the cookbook obeys the application's public interface by dropping a start script that exports the right env vars
[2012-09-26 17:06:32 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, and again whatever bits you want of the node data or data-bag-item data can be encrypted
[2012-09-26 17:18:35 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, also the whole of http://www.12factor.net/ might be interesting reading :D
[2012-09-26 17:30:04 -0400] c_t: should probably still extract that stuff anyway, in case anyone else is interested
[2012-09-26 17:31:33 -0400] c_t: now if those achromatic objective lenses I ordered would get here, I'd be totally set
[2012-09-26 17:32:00 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, i wouldn't - they're too specific to the use case
[2012-09-26 17:32:17 -0400] c_t: indeed
[2012-09-26 17:32:26 -0400] c_t: and I am, of course, rather short on time at the moment
[2012-09-26 17:32:31 -0400] c_t: yay election season
[2012-09-26 17:33:38 -0400] yfeldblum: this is my candidate: http://tinyurl.com/8bvkdzx
[2012-09-26 17:34:31 -0400] c_t: I can get behind that
