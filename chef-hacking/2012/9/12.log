[2012-09-12 15:42:39 -0400] autif: btm: awesome! thanks - I did not write any tests - the article said that Opscode will test - Is that expectation valid or am I expected to write some tests?
[2012-09-12 15:45:04 -0400] btm: autif: we usually require unit tests for regressions or new features, because tests are important. check out the chef/spec/unit directory.
