[2012-09-03 00:00:13 -0400] yfeldblum_: hoover_damm, i'm all for it, so long as, for each feature F in question, benefits_F > costs_F
[2012-09-03 00:07:37 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum_, I think you overestimate your important
[2012-09-03 00:07:42 -0400] hoover_damm: importance*
[2012-09-03 00:09:04 -0400] yfeldblum_: hoover_damm, i'm not quite sure how this conversation switched topics so completely so quickly
[2012-09-03 00:12:36 -0400] z: yfeldblum_ has been making perfectly rational comments which are in no way personal to him, his employer or situation? How exactly did we get to questioning his importance?
[2012-09-03 02:40:47 -0400] hoover_damm: z, there is no need to defend yfeldblum.  It's just without the proper factual statements and the background in CPU Engineering to understand it; most statements here would be amatuer at best.
[2012-09-03 02:41:08 -0400] hoover_damm: more likely they will be incorrect and badly founded
[2012-09-03 02:41:29 -0400] hoover_damm: z, people will always underestimate CPU Optimization, where as I likely will overestimate.
[2012-09-03 02:43:14 -0400] hoover_damm: z, and as I have had the pleasure of actually speaking with some engineers with CPU Engineering background... they are eager :)
[2012-09-03 02:50:31 -0400] z: hoover_damm: considering you have little to no understanding of people here, I find your assumptions about someones relative qualifications or inexperience to be mildly amusing
[2012-09-03 02:50:48 -0400] z: hoover_damm: but hey, its the Internet, and you love to jump to conclusions so have at it ;)
[2012-09-03 02:54:35 -0400] hoover_damm: z, I would say the same about you.
[2012-09-03 02:55:07 -0400] hoover_damm: z, your assumptions about me are incorrect and I've pretty much written you off as a troll and don't value your opinion.
[2012-09-03 02:55:51 -0400] hoover_damm: It's okay most of my life i've had people tell me they are smarter than me and push me out of the way and fail.  I have to come in and save the day
[2012-09-03 02:56:10 -0400] hoover_damm: I clearly have a target that says pick on me, and people like to.  you do, jtimberman does, others do
[2012-09-03 02:56:19 -0400] hoover_damm: I personally wish you'd stop picking on me
[2012-09-03 02:56:27 -0400] hoover_damm: but that's not how bullies (trolls) work
[2012-09-03 02:57:48 -0400] hoover_damm: and yes I am serious, I lost out on an opportunity to meet the President because I let another student bully me out of my first prize at the Science Fair (National one too)
[2012-09-03 02:57:59 -0400] hoover_damm: so really, stop picking on my wounds will you?
[2012-09-03 02:58:00 -0400] hoover_damm: thanks
[2012-09-03 03:23:48 -0400] jtimberman: Wow uh.
[2012-09-03 03:23:56 -0400] jtimberman: I'm not sure what to make of this.
