[2012-09-28 00:11:54 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/RESOURCE-UPDATING-10] Removed node as argument from run_failed method in parent classes, as the child classes were reimplementing it with a different sig. - tylercloke
[2012-09-28 11:14:33 -0400] leifmadsen: so this is where you've been hiding :)

[2012-09-28 14:15:07 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/10-stable] Bump version for development - Bryan McLellan
[2012-09-28 15:46:38 -0400] leifmadsen: doh, ran into a conversion error after a chef run
[2012-09-28 15:46:41 -0400] leifmadsen: Encoding::UndefinedConversionError: "\xC2"
[2012-09-28 15:46:56 -0400] mattray: leifmadsen: 10.14.2?
[2012-09-28 15:47:03 -0400] leifmadsen: .4
[2012-09-28 15:47:48 -0400] leifmadsen: happens at the very end of the chef run, so need to track down what it doesn't like I guess
[2012-09-28 15:49:33 -0400] leifmadsen: huh, appears to only have happened on the first run not the 2nd or 3rd (first included minitest-handler, 2nd did not, 3rd added it back)
[2012-09-28 15:49:42 -0400] leifmadsen: lets see if I can reproduce
[2012-09-28 16:56:54 -0400] jtimberman: leifmadsen: hey, did you see i merged the TK and mysql stuff?
[2012-09-28 16:56:57 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-09-28 16:57:05 -0400] leifmadsen: jtimberman: I totally did!!!
[2012-09-28 16:57:10 -0400] jtimberman: leifmadsen: sorry it took so long.
[2012-09-28 16:57:19 -0400] leifmadsen: not a problem, just happen it got done :)
[2012-09-28 16:57:21 -0400] leifmadsen: it wasn't really that long
[2012-09-28 16:57:22 -0400] jtimberman: :D
[2012-09-28 16:57:27 -0400] leifmadsen: once I made a pull request :D
[2012-09-28 16:57:30 -0400] jtimberman: hah
[2012-09-28 16:57:33 -0400] jtimberman: and set the ticket to resolved.
[2012-09-28 16:57:38 -0400] jtimberman: though we have a number of tickets that need love.
[2012-09-28 16:57:41 -0400] leifmadsen: indeed which was pretty close
[2012-09-28 16:57:54 -0400] leifmadsen: I'm almost dangerous enough to start looking at things and fixing
[2012-09-28 16:57:57 -0400] jtimberman: but we dont have any tickets in COOK that are resolved that haven't been updated before August at least.
[2012-09-28 16:58:07 -0400] jtimberman: Cool.
[2012-09-28 16:58:09 -0400] leifmadsen: I should get into some bug triage mode then
[2012-09-28 16:58:14 -0400] jtimberman: I'm building new baseboxes with Bento for 10.14.4
[2012-09-28 16:58:18 -0400] leifmadsen: I did it for a few years with Asterisk
[2012-09-28 16:58:34 -0400] leifmadsen: I just cleaned up some of my own baseboxes with veewee the last 2 days
[2012-09-28 16:58:47 -0400] leifmadsen: I'm testing 10.14.4 more thoroughly today too
[2012-09-28 16:58:56 -0400] leifmadsen: only ran into 1 issue so far which is weird
[2012-09-28 16:59:07 -0400] c_t: how many issues that weren't weird?
[2012-09-28 16:59:20 -0400] leifmadsen: I run into non-weird issues all the time :)
[2012-09-28 16:59:29 -0400] leifmadsen: "why is that typo there?!"
[2012-09-28 17:00:18 -0400] leifmadsen: Encoding::UndefinedConversionError: "\xC2"  <-- happens at the end of the first run when minitest-handler and my recipe are enabled. Run twice, doesn't happen. Run just my recipe it doesn't happen. Run my recipe then minitest-handler on 2nd run, doesn't happen.
[2012-09-28 17:00:23 -0400] leifmadsen: confusing to say the least
[2012-09-28 17:02:39 -0400] jtimberman: wow weird :)
[2012-09-28 17:02:52 -0400] leifmadsen: nice :)
[2012-09-28 19:29:34 -0400] laurent\: leifmadsen: does it happen when if you use ruby 1.8 :)
[2012-09-28 19:29:36 -0400] laurent\: ?
[2012-09-28 19:29:55 -0400] laurent\: i've encountered a similar issue with ruby1.9 here
[2012-09-28 19:29:59 -0400] leifmadsen: ah
[2012-09-28 19:30:03 -0400] leifmadsen: ya, ruby 1.9 here as well
[2012-09-28 19:30:14 -0400] leifmadsen: if I knew what was causing it I could work around it at least :)
[2012-09-28 19:30:24 -0400] leifmadsen: might be because it's in vagrant too... sometimes that causes oddities I've found
[2012-09-28 19:41:22 -0400] leifmadsen: wow, I'm a weird issue magnet today

[2012-09-28 19:41:28 -0400] github-bawt: [omnibus-chef/master] Add a note about building Chef with this repository - Bryan McLellan
[2012-09-28 19:42:17 -0400] leifmadsen: wrong number of arguments (2 for 1) with file resource when testing /etc/ssh/sshd_config in minitest spec with the same line, as /etc/ssh/ssh_config
[2012-09-28 19:42:36 -0400] leifmadsen: if I remove the character "d" from the line, it works, add it in, it fails
[2012-09-28 19:42:40 -0400] leifmadsen: and the file exists in both cases
[2012-09-28 19:45:10 -0400] leifmadsen: oh well THAT is interesting
[2012-09-28 19:45:46 -0400] leifmadsen: the spec test is technically failing since the mode is not the same as what I've defined, but why it is getting 2 args in that case....
[2012-09-28 19:45:55 -0400] leifmadsen: has to be a bug in minitest-chef-spec
