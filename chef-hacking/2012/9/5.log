[2012-09-05 11:21:58 -0400] nico: results of my yesterday's questions : https://twitter.com/____nico/status/243265524279177216
[2012-09-05 14:55:29 -0400] rshade98: Morning Guys, SSD told me to send this over here to see what you guys thought..
[2012-09-05 14:55:43 -0400] rshade98: https://github.com/rshade/chef/commit/2b7b9a55ffaa1de2a2a302bb5c5a44aec3f969a4
[2012-09-05 15:36:21 -0400] kallistec: rshade98: is there a ticket on tickets.opscode.com ?
[2012-09-05 15:48:56 -0400] rshade98: kallistec, I am not sure.
[2012-09-05 15:49:26 -0400] rshade98: do I need to file one? I just got tired of the error so I threw in a few checks. needless to say I fatfinger a lot
[2012-09-05 15:49:58 -0400] kallistec: rshade98: the best way to go is to take a quick look to see if there's already a ticket, and if not, file one
[2012-09-05 15:55:43 -0400] yfeldblum_: rshade98, you might consider using local variables and Pathname: http://pastie.org/private/ruheqwqtetcqjew8opa
[2012-09-05 16:10:26 -0400] kallistec: rshade98: also, there is already code somewhere that parses recipe names, it would be better to reuse that than repeat it
[2012-09-05 16:28:53 -0400] rshade98: yfeldblum, wouldn't using Pathname, require a "require"?
[2012-09-05 16:29:39 -0400] rshade98: I do like the local variables idea, thanks man, I will do that
[2012-09-05 16:29:41 -0400] yfeldblum_: rshade98, yes, unless it's already required; e.g., it's already required in Rails and in Chef, so you don't need to require it in your Rails apps or in your recipes
[2012-09-05 16:30:03 -0400] rshade98: cool I will see if it works locally
[2012-09-05 16:30:06 -0400] rshade98: thanks
[2012-09-05 16:30:55 -0400] rshade98: btw looks like I will need to submit a ticket
[2012-09-05 16:31:08 -0400] rshade98: I will do that as soon as the code is ready and tested
[2012-09-05 16:39:56 -0400] rshade98: Exception: NoMethodError: undefined method `Pathname' for #<Chef::Cookbook::Metadata:0x7f0d04da5aa8>
[2012-09-05 16:41:56 -0400] yfeldblum_: rshade98, heh well then `require "pathname"`
[2012-09-05 16:44:16 -0400] rshade98: it didn't like that exists also. I am going to do some hacking on it :)
[2012-09-05 16:44:31 -0400] rshade98: thanks for the help we should have a rocking patch
[2012-09-05 16:45:26 -0400] yfeldblum_: rshade98, try Pathname#exist? and you can also use the methods Pathname#file? and Pathname#readable? in there
[2012-09-05 17:02:17 -0400] rshade98: is a good ticket description: Knife should validate recipes exist before compiling metadata.json
[2012-09-05 17:12:01 -0400] c_t: Holy shit
[2012-09-05 17:12:10 -0400] c_t: you can *drive* to the top of Pike's Peak?

[2012-09-05 17:18:28 -0400] rshade98: is there a pull request rules page somewhere
[2012-09-05 17:18:39 -0400] rshade98: I have created the ticket: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3415, and code
[2012-09-05 17:19:18 -0400] c_t: jtimberman: have you lived in CO for a long time?
[2012-09-05 17:29:13 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: uh, I don't know. There's a lot of 14k peaks
[2012-09-05 17:29:42 -0400] c_t: my grandmother bought back into her family's house in Green Mountain Falls
[2012-09-05 17:30:00 -0400] c_t: which along with Pike's Peak is in a "yellow" zone according to the Dark Sky Map
[2012-09-05 17:30:40 -0400] c_t: now, being ~7000 feet up would make it darker, and being 14,000 feet would be fucking amazing, but finding a mountain that you could drive to the top of that's even darker would be amazing

[2012-09-05 17:32:47 -0400] hoover_damm: not a full list

[2012-09-05 20:30:41 -0400] cwj: i am thinking about adding mosh (mobile-shell) support to the knife ssh subcommand. before i embark on this, does anyone know of a project that does this already?
