[2012-09-18 15:32:43 -0400] KarlHungus: ignoring the technical challenges, does it make sense to support platform conditional depends in a cookbooks metadata?
[2012-09-18 15:42:04 -0400] yfeldblum: KarlHungus, no
[2012-09-18 15:53:51 -0400] jtimberman: KarlHungus: more valuable i think would be having a stricter enforcement of the "supports" for platforms in metadata.
[2012-09-18 16:01:33 -0400] KarlHungus: jtimberman: i see what you mean
[2012-09-18 16:01:37 -0400] KarlHungus: that makes sense.
[2012-09-18 16:02:30 -0400] KarlHungus: it feels dirty having a node pull down and cache cookbooks that will never be run because of the node's platform
[2012-09-18 16:02:42 -0400] KarlHungus: i can see using supports to solve this in a more elegant way
[2012-09-18 16:13:28 -0400] jtimberman: yeah, but it downloads those cookbooks once and they're usually small :)
[2012-09-18 16:13:42 -0400] jtimberman: I mean, I get the point of not having more code shipped around than required.
[2012-09-18 16:15:03 -0400] jtimberman: I believe there are tickets about this topic in CHEF jira

[2012-09-18 16:39:34 -0400] KarlHungus: jtimberman: yeah. i was just speculating while some vagrants spun up :P
[2012-09-18 16:40:14 -0400] KarlHungus: i think you could simply not download cookbooks that dont explicitly support the platform to get the same effect with much less pain

[2012-09-18 18:34:14 -0400] StormSilver: Haven't set up chef-server since 0.8.8. You've come a long way, baby.
