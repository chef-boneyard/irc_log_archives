[2012-02-17 08:43:00 -0500] renchap: seems a lot overkill :D
[2012-02-17 08:45:00 -0500] fujin: yeah, I dunno
[2012-02-17 08:45:00 -0500] fujin: maybe ohai could use it for other stuff (I don't know if it talks to many external services like the ec2 metadata api)
[2012-02-17 08:46:00 -0500] renchap: i would prefer if ohai does not mess with the network
[2012-02-17 08:46:00 -0500] renchap: its supposed to be local (for me)
[2012-02-17 08:48:00 -0500] fujin: lol
[2012-02-17 08:48:00 -0500] fujin: that doesn't make sense.
[2012-02-17 08:49:00 -0500] fujin: eh, it's an option anyway, will see what anyone else comes up with
[2012-02-17 08:49:00 -0500] fujin: I don't think everyone wants to have their ohai time increased by 2s
[2012-02-17 11:13:00 -0500] laurent\: as long as the plugin is not activated by default i don't mind :)
[2012-02-17 11:14:00 -0500] laurent\: but agreed it's a bit overkill. what about maintaining that as an external ohai plugin ?
[2012-02-17 17:50:00 -0500] ampledata: just submitted another talk idea: "Enough Ruby to be Dangerous"
[2012-02-17 17:52:00 -0500] c_t: reminds me, I need to get off my ass & submit one
[2012-02-17 17:54:00 -0500] ampledata: last day
[2012-02-17 17:57:00 -0500] c_t: indeed
[2012-02-17 17:57:00 -0500] c_t: thus the "getting off my ass" comment
[2012-02-17 17:58:00 -0500] ampledata: you could do one of those new age sessions on how to motivate yourself to write a session for a tech conference
[2012-02-17 18:00:00 -0500] cwj: so meta
[2012-02-17 18:06:00 -0500] c_t: at least Chef Conf's not in Santa Clara
[2012-02-17 18:07:00 -0500] ampledata: i mean come on though
[2012-02-17 18:07:00 -0500] ampledata: burlingame?
[2012-02-17 18:07:00 -0500] c_t: at least there you can catch the shuttle to SFO and catch BART into the city
[2012-02-17 18:07:00 -0500] ampledata: caltrain has a station down there too
[2012-02-17 18:07:00 -0500] ampledata: but yeah, granted
[2012-02-17 18:07:00 -0500] ampledata: yeah i don't look forward to getting drunk in burlingame
[2012-02-17 18:15:00 -0500] jtimberman: There's places to get drunk in Burlingame?
[2012-02-17 18:15:00 -0500] ampledata: HELL YEAH
[2012-02-17 18:15:00 -0500] ampledata: BENNIGANS
[2012-02-17 18:15:00 -0500] ampledata: we'll meet some office temps
[2012-02-17 18:16:00 -0500] jtimberman: Bennigans? I thought they went out of business.
[2012-02-17 18:16:00 -0500] ampledata: and maybe some people from finance!
[2012-02-17 18:16:00 -0500] jtimberman: All the Colorado locations closed.
[2012-02-17 18:16:00 -0500] c_t: not saying Burlingame's great
[2012-02-17 18:16:00 -0500] c_t: just that it's not quite as sucky as Santa Clara
[2012-02-17 18:16:00 -0500] c_t: in that you can at least have a vague hope of getting out of htere
[2012-02-17 18:16:00 -0500] ampledata: c_t++
[2012-02-17 18:16:00 -0500] jtimberman: i think it was more cost effective for people traveling since its so near SFO
[2012-02-17 18:17:00 -0500] jtimberman: and a less pricey venue than say, hotels or centers in SF
[2012-02-17 18:17:00 -0500] c_t: Santa Clara always leads to getting trapped
[2012-02-17 18:17:00 -0500] ampledata: speaking of which
[2012-02-17 18:17:00 -0500] jtimberman: c_t: Sprawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwl
[2012-02-17 18:17:00 -0500] c_t: there's that one Korean place about 20 minutes away
[2012-02-17 18:17:00 -0500] jtimberman: Palo Alto is as bad
[2012-02-17 18:17:00 -0500] ampledata: our yearly kick off conference was at the intercontinental in sf this week
[2012-02-17 18:17:00 -0500] c_t: jtimberman: it's so sprawly, across the street is a quarter mile away!
[2012-02-17 18:17:00 -0500] ampledata: and guess who was also staying there obama
[2012-02-17 18:17:00 -0500] jtimberman: c_t: Yes.
[2012-02-17 18:18:00 -0500] ampledata: hella secret service
[2012-02-17 18:18:00 -0500] c_t: I was so thrilled when the Chef Summit was in Seattle
[2012-02-17 18:18:00 -0500] jtimberman: :)
[2012-02-17 18:18:00 -0500] c_t: "Holy shit! A tech thing in Seattle, and not some godforsaken part but actually a reasonable location!"
[2012-02-17 18:18:00 -0500] jtimberman: That location was convenient.
[2012-02-17 18:18:00 -0500] c_t: well
[2012-02-17 18:18:00 -0500] jtimberman: for US
[2012-02-17 18:18:00 -0500] c_t: tech thing in Seattle I'd care to go to
[2012-02-17 18:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: Denver is pretty awful.
[2012-02-17 18:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: Sprawlolool
[2012-02-17 18:19:00 -0500] ampledata: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/chef.gemspec#L25
[2012-02-17 18:19:00 -0500] c_t: jtimberman: it was reasonably convenient for me too, although I decided to stay up there anyway
[2012-02-17 18:19:00 -0500] ampledata: i think 1.6.1 are broken
[2012-02-17 18:19:00 -0500] c_t: Tacoma's just *that* much too far away
[2012-02-17 18:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: ampledata: I hate that gem.
[2012-02-17 18:19:00 -0500] ampledata: god i do too
[2012-02-17 18:20:00 -0500] jtimberman: I totally know why puppet vendored json-pure and renamed it pson
[2012-02-17 18:20:00 -0500] jtimberman: because that gem is a nightmare
[2012-02-17 18:20:00 -0500] ampledata: haha that's funny because i did that too
[2012-02-17 18:20:00 -0500] jtimberman: (plus, not having C extensions is good)
[2012-02-17 18:20:00 -0500] ampledata: i wrote a patch to just make ruby think json-pure was json
[2012-02-17 18:20:00 -0500] c_t: wat?
[2012-02-17 18:20:00 -0500] jtimberman: lol
[2012-02-17 18:20:00 -0500] jtimberman: thats kind of mean. :)
[2012-02-17 18:20:00 -0500] c_t: I always considered the ease of C extensions in ruby to be a plus
[2012-02-17 18:20:00 -0500] jtimberman: sure
[2012-02-17 18:20:00 -0500] jtimberman: they're faster
[2012-02-17 18:20:00 -0500] jtimberman: but
[2012-02-17 18:20:00 -0500] jtimberman: you have to compile them.
[2012-02-17 18:21:00 -0500] c_t: I mean, I haven't actually had the *need* to do it, but it's nice to have around
[2012-02-17 18:21:00 -0500] jtimberman: people with neckbeards don't like compilers.
[2012-02-17 18:21:00 -0500] c_t: as opposed to the black art that is XS
[2012-02-17 18:21:00 -0500] c_t: that shit is cray cray
[2012-02-17 18:22:00 -0500] ampledata: perlz
[2012-02-17 18:22:00 -0500] c_t: heh, neckbears
[2012-02-17 18:22:00 -0500] jtimberman: ooh.
[2012-02-17 18:23:00 -0500] c_t: http://df.magmawiki.com/images/3/3e/Comic_df5.png
[2012-02-17 18:23:00 -0500] c_t: ^^ still makes me giggle
[2012-02-17 18:29:00 -0500] ampledata: ok yeah something's fishy with the json gem on my box
[2012-02-17 18:29:00 -0500] ampledata: talking to self
[2012-02-17 18:30:00 -0500] jtimberman: you monkey patched ruby
[2012-02-17 18:30:00 -0500] jtimberman: so... :)
[2012-02-17 18:36:00 -0500] ampledata: ooh it's a knife issue
[2012-02-17 18:36:00 -0500] ampledata: fun
[2012-02-17 18:36:00 -0500] ampledata: ok somewhere between knife 0.10.4 and 0.10.6 the -Fj output format broke for me
[2012-02-17 18:39:00 -0500] ampledata: jt are release notes usually always on the blog?
[2012-02-17 18:43:00 -0500] ampledata: oh got it
[2012-02-17 18:43:00 -0500] hoover_damm: jtimberman, git + org-mode TODO list?
[2012-02-17 18:43:00 -0500] ampledata: -l
[2012-02-17 18:47:00 -0500] ampledata: CHEF-2431 :(
[2012-02-17 19:00:00 -0500] ampledata: i understand why you'd want to only show normal in the default output format
[2012-02-17 19:00:00 -0500] ampledata: unfortunately that changes existing behavior
[2012-02-17 21:18:00 -0500] joewilliams: anyone using environments to manage multiple sites, datacenters, etc
[2012-02-17 21:22:00 -0500] hoover_damm: with encrypted databags that could be pretty neat
[2012-02-17 21:22:00 -0500] cwj: seems totally reasonable, whats the hangup?
[2012-02-17 21:24:00 -0500] joewilliams: no hang up just curious
[2012-02-17 21:25:00 -0500] cwj: i intended to do that at my last job
[2012-02-17 21:25:00 -0500] cwj: but thankfully i got a new one so i didnt have to worry about it
[2012-02-17 21:26:00 -0500] cwj: they were building a Security as a Service product which initially had N planned sites, then needed N*2 sites, now probably needs N^2 sites
[2012-02-17 21:30:00 -0500] cwj: i think they are still using chef 0.9 though
[2012-02-17 21:30:00 -0500] cwj: poor kids
[2012-02-17 21:34:00 -0500] joewilliams: anyone actually using environments on multiple sites in prod? would love to hear thoughts, upsides, pitfalls, etc
[2012-02-17 22:07:00 -0500] fujin: joewilliams: darrin and I do for all of our clients. :)
[2012-02-17 22:08:00 -0500] fujin: my primary pain point is around managing versions of cookbooks  and locking them into the environment file, but I understand there are some tools to automate this these days
[2012-02-17 22:08:00 -0500] fujin: works alright, we can have different versions of stuff promoted across different environments
[2012-02-17 22:08:00 -0500] fujin: with a little bit of hacking you can have shared run lists or common run lists
[2012-02-17 22:08:00 -0500] fujin: (like, array#concat, dup, etc.)
[2012-02-17 22:09:00 -0500] fujin: w/ env_run_lists I mean
[2012-02-17 22:10:00 -0500] hoover_damm: fujin, btw do you do invoices w/ emacs? (org-mode) any tips or is it all in your emacs repo?
[2012-02-17 22:11:00 -0500] fujin: no i use xero for invoicing
[2012-02-17 22:11:00 -0500] fujin: and reconciliation
[2012-02-17 22:11:00 -0500] fujin: i use org mode for time tracking for some stuff, but when I work with Darrin we use Harvest app
[2012-02-17 22:12:00 -0500] fujin: http://www.getharvest.com/
[2012-02-17 22:12:00 -0500] fujin: i think he might invoice based off that data (don't know)
[2012-02-17 22:12:00 -0500] fujin: DarrinEden:  ?
[2012-02-17 22:12:00 -0500] fujin: hoover_damm: I personally use xero. I don't know if it does time tracking, might do, but the overall accounting experience with xero is pretty great
[2012-02-17 22:13:00 -0500] fujin: It's pretty easy to make an org mode table and then generate a clock table based on the timers
[2012-02-17 22:13:00 -0500] fujin: I think it's
[2012-02-17 22:13:00 -0500] fujin: C-u C-c C-x C-r
[2012-02-17 22:13:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yeah that's what i am doing
[2012-02-17 22:13:00 -0500] fujin: to generate timetable based off just a structure
[2012-02-17 22:13:00 -0500] hoover_damm: with a little love from latex it's not too bad
[2012-02-17 22:14:00 -0500] fujin: http://orgmode.org/manual/The-clock-table.html#The-clock-table
[2012-02-17 22:14:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I was just wondering if you had anything more concrete then I hacked up
[2012-02-17 22:14:00 -0500] fujin: i didn't even bother with latex tbh, had just been exporting it to html/pdf if necessary
[2012-02-17 22:20:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yeah I found some halfway lame os X app I was going to use
[2012-02-17 22:21:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I would rather stuck with org-mode but it's best for time keeping / todo
[2012-02-17 22:22:00 -0500] hoover_damm: harvest looks decent, and I looked at Xero... looks a bit more then I need
