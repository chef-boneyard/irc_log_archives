[2012-02-21 16:36:00 -0500] chefnewbie: I have written a recipe which installs a package and starts up the listener. The listener accepts inputs during startup using switches. I can't figure out how to pass those inputs to it via the Chef recipe/cookbook. Any help would be appreciated.
[2012-02-21 16:36:00 -0500] thom: chefnewbie: you really want #chef for any kind of useful conversation :)
[2012-02-21 16:37:00 -0500] chefnewbie: the listener is started like: service mylistener start --username newbie --password --newbie
[2012-02-21 16:37:00 -0500] chefnewbie: Oh ok
[2012-02-21 16:37:00 -0500] chefnewbie: I will try that room, thanks.

[2012-02-21 23:48:00 -0500] fujin: not to give us extra information about solving it.
[2012-02-21 23:48:00 -0500] fujin: like turn your fucking brain on
