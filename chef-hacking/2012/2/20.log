[2012-02-20 16:50:00 -0500] renchap: jtimberman: do you still work on debian chef packages ?
[2012-02-20 16:51:00 -0500] jtimberman: renchap: no
[2012-02-20 16:51:00 -0500] jtimberman: renchap: btm has been maintaining our apt repo
[2012-02-20 16:52:00 -0500] renchap: k
[2012-02-20 16:52:00 -0500] renchap: we will submit a patch
[2012-02-20 16:52:00 -0500] renchap: you cant use the sysloglogger with the provider init file
[2012-02-20 16:52:00 -0500] renchap: *provided
[2012-02-20 16:52:00 -0500] renchap: because it always add -L option, and it override the logger that you set in client.rb
[2012-02-20 18:13:00 -0500] jtimberman: renchap: there was a pull request for the cookbook to do syslog as the logger
[2012-02-20 18:14:00 -0500] jtimberman: fyi: https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/pull/341/files
[2012-02-20 18:15:00 -0500] renchap: this will not work
[2012-02-20 18:15:00 -0500] renchap: works when chef is launched without -L
[2012-02-20 18:15:00 -0500] renchap: but the debian init script always adds a -L
[2012-02-20 18:16:00 -0500] renchap: which overrides log_location
[2012-02-20 18:16:00 -0500] jtimberman: sure
[2012-02-20 18:16:00 -0500] renchap: so you only get the 2 first messages (chef starting) in syslog, and then they are in /var/log/chef
[2012-02-20 18:16:00 -0500] jtimberman: just another idea on the config file for it :)
[2012-02-20 18:17:00 -0500] renchap: we have exactly this in the config file in fact :)
