[2012-02-25 22:52:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so is it me or does omnibus contain a crapton of stuff?
[2012-02-25 22:52:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and doesn't it include ruby 1.9.3? or was I crazy?
[2012-02-25 22:54:00 -0500] jtimberman: hoover_damm: it does contain a crapton of stuff - everything required above libc.
[2012-02-25 22:55:00 -0500] jtimberman: hoover_damm: and its ruby 1.9.2-p180 at the current release iirc.
[2012-02-25 22:55:00 -0500] hoover_damm: jtimberman, hrm, think anyone would care if I forked it and made a ruby 1.9.3 pull?
[2012-02-25 22:55:00 -0500] hoover_damm: dunno why i'm even asking it's on github of course I can
[2012-02-25 22:56:00 -0500] jtimberman: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2871
[2012-02-25 22:58:00 -0500] hoover_damm: no one assigned heh
[2012-02-25 22:59:00 -0500] hoover_damm: feels weird only messing with it half the time lately, and with actually using a modern version
[2012-02-25 22:59:00 -0500] hoover_damm: feels weird to not staying modern on most bits
[2012-02-25 23:00:00 -0500] hoover_damm: anywho it's just a ticket for a contract i'm on... so i'll gladly spend the time working up 1.9.3 + modern rubygems
