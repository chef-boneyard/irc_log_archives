[2012-02-10 14:26:00 -0500] lusis: You think opscode legal would pitch a fit if I had that t-shirt made?
[2012-02-10 14:27:00 -0500] renchap: you will end like kim dotcom
[2012-02-10 14:27:00 -0500] lusis: oh hell
[2012-02-10 14:28:00 -0500] lusis: I should shoot Jesse an email heh
[2012-02-10 14:31:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: lusis, I missed it, link?
[2012-02-10 14:31:00 -0500] lusis: http://www.customink.com/designs/lusis/tdw0-000n-duus/twt
[2012-02-10 14:32:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: That is awesome
[2012-02-10 14:32:00 -0500] thom: dude, totally print that shit up
[2012-02-10 14:32:00 -0500] lusis: heh
[2012-02-10 14:32:00 -0500] lusis: Nathan said he'd have me one in time for ChefConf
[2012-02-10 14:34:00 -0500] lusis: done
[2012-02-10 14:34:00 -0500] lusis: thom: are you coming to chefconf?
[2012-02-10 14:34:00 -0500] renchap: btw
[2012-02-10 14:35:00 -0500] renchap: any opscode guys in paris in the next months ?
[2012-02-10 14:35:00 -0500] renchap: i have something for you that i cant send by mail
[2012-02-10 14:35:00 -0500] thom: lusis: if i get talks accepted, yeah
[2012-02-10 14:35:00 -0500] thom: if not, likely not
[2012-02-10 14:35:00 -0500] thom: well, likely it depends
[2012-02-10 14:35:00 -0500] thom: :)
[2012-02-10 14:35:00 -0500] lusis: heh
[2012-02-10 14:36:00 -0500] thom: it'd turn into a toss up between chef and velocity
[2012-02-10 14:36:00 -0500] BryanWB_: stupid question, if your talk gets accepted, do u get any financial assistance to attend? i assume not
[2012-02-10 14:36:00 -0500] renchap: (something that you can drink)
[2012-02-10 14:36:00 -0500] BryanWB_: or u don't have to pay the admission fee?
[2012-02-10 14:36:00 -0500] lusis: I think the later
[2012-02-10 14:37:00 -0500] BryanWB_: renchap, missed u at fosdem! would have been cool to meet u
[2012-02-10 14:37:00 -0500] thom: i'd hope you didn't have to pay admission :)
[2012-02-10 14:37:00 -0500] lusis: you don't have to pay admission
[2012-02-10 14:37:00 -0500] BryanWB_: thom, as i thought
[2012-02-10 14:37:00 -0500] lusis: cause it's pretty damn expensive ;)
[2012-02-10 14:37:00 -0500] renchap: BryanWB_: i had other things to do this weekend
[2012-02-10 14:37:00 -0500] renchap: and totally forgot to plan for fosdem
[2012-02-10 14:37:00 -0500] renchap: did you saw my coworker ?
[2012-02-10 14:38:00 -0500] BryanWB_: renchap, yup, met nico
[2012-02-10 14:38:00 -0500] BryanWB_: nice guy
[2012-02-10 14:38:00 -0500] renchap: yup
[2012-02-10 14:38:00 -0500] renchap: he is now on the right side
[2012-02-10 14:38:00 -0500] renchap: he worked with puppet before ;)
[2012-02-10 14:38:00 -0500] BryanWB_: renchap, we all have scars ;)
[2012-02-10 14:38:00 -0500] renchap: :D
[2012-02-10 14:39:00 -0500] renchap: a long time ago I... I... I wrote some PHP
[2012-02-10 14:39:00 -0500] BryanWB_: renchap, u r forgiven
[2012-02-10 14:39:00 -0500] renchap: \o/
[2012-02-10 14:40:00 -0500] BryanWB_: lusis, did u work w/ tomcat at your old gig? did u ever install it on centos via the jpackage yum repository?
[2012-02-10 14:41:00 -0500] lusis: stay very far away from jpackage
[2012-02-10 14:41:00 -0500] lusis: it's not worth it
[2012-02-10 14:41:00 -0500] renchap: :D
[2012-02-10 14:41:00 -0500] lusis: use fpm and spin you own tomcat if you need to
[2012-02-10 14:41:00 -0500] lusis: jpackage is a clusterfuck
[2012-02-10 14:41:00 -0500] BryanWB_: lusis, i do stay away, i wonder if any seriously uses it
[2012-02-10 14:41:00 -0500] lusis: not smart people do, yes
[2012-02-10 14:42:00 -0500] BryanWB_: lusis, um, i wrote java_ark lwrp for it, feedback most welcome   https://github.com/bryanwb/cookbooks/blob/master/java/README.md  see the examples section
[2012-02-10 14:43:00 -0500] lusis: BryanWB_: no offense intended. I just seriously have avoided jpackage forever after it blew up systems years ago
[2012-02-10 14:43:00 -0500] BryanWB_: lusis, esp. when i am using for the java, tomcat, jboss, and jetty cookboos
[2012-02-10 14:43:00 -0500] BryanWB_: lusis, i am not offended, i don't like it either
[2012-02-10 14:44:00 -0500] lusis: then again I have a pretty opinionated layout for java toolchain stuff
[2012-02-10 14:44:00 -0500] lusis: I've carried it with me for a long time and it seems to work
[2012-02-10 14:44:00 -0500] lusis: oh wow
[2012-02-10 14:45:00 -0500] lusis: your cookbook uses the same layout I do
[2012-02-10 14:45:00 -0500] thom: "opinionated layout" => /dev/null ?
[2012-02-10 14:45:00 -0500] lusis: heh
[2012-02-10 14:45:00 -0500] lusis: nope
[2012-02-10 14:45:00 -0500] lusis: that java_ark lwrp pretty much captures it
[2012-02-10 14:45:00 -0500] BryanWB_: lusis, kewl, anything missing pls let me know
[2012-02-10 14:45:00 -0500] lusis: except I've always uses /usr/local/<foo>/current
[2012-02-10 14:45:00 -0500] lusis: for my symlink
[2012-02-10 14:45:00 -0500] lusis: instead of default
[2012-02-10 14:46:00 -0500] BryanWB_: lusis, well, i am trying to be close to the distros which use  "default" and "default-java"
[2012-02-10 14:46:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: Isn't there a tomcat in epel?
[2012-02-10 14:46:00 -0500] BryanWB_: atomic-penguin, not a tomcat7 iirc, either way, they packages are always too old to satisfy my developers
[2012-02-10 14:46:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: BryanWB_, gotcha
[2012-02-10 14:47:00 -0500] lusis: the one thing the java ecosystem gets pretty good is "self-contained"
[2012-02-10 14:47:00 -0500] lusis: that layout is a good example
[2012-02-10 14:48:00 -0500] lusis: I don't NEED to do anything else. Just blow up the tarball, add bindir to path
[2012-02-10 14:57:00 -0500] BryanWB_: lusis, i don't add bindir to path as it would be difficult to that per user
[2012-02-10 14:58:00 -0500] BryanWB_: lusis, i just symlink the cmds that are passed to the   bin_cmds   attribute
[2012-02-10 14:59:00 -0500] BryanWB_: is there a better way?
[2012-02-10 15:01:00 -0500] BryanWB_: also missing the lwrp is a way to pass a list of mirror sites to download the tarball from rather than just 1
[2012-02-10 15:03:00 -0500] lusis: I usually dump a java.sh in /etc/profile.d
[2012-02-10 15:04:00 -0500] lusis: that sets JAVA_HOME, M2_HOME all the other shit and adds path entries
[2012-02-10 15:05:00 -0500] BryanWB_: lusis, hmm, i have never used profile.d, frankly unaware of its existence until now
[2012-02-10 15:05:00 -0500] BryanWB_: lusis, is it on EL and debian?
[2012-02-10 15:06:00 -0500] lusis: RHEL/CentOS for sure
[2012-02-10 15:06:00 -0500] lusis: and I'm pretty sure it's on ubuntu
[2012-02-10 15:06:00 -0500] lusis: might even be a standard
[2012-02-10 15:06:00 -0500] lusis: "standard"
[2012-02-10 15:06:00 -0500] BryanWB_: i wonder if putting it in /etc/default on debian and /etc/sysconfig  for EL would have the same effect
[2012-02-10 15:06:00 -0500] BryanWB_: what a ball of shit string ;)
[2012-02-10 15:08:00 -0500] lusis: the phrase you are looking for is "FSS"
[2012-02-10 15:08:00 -0500] lusis: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJQU22Ttpwc
[2012-02-10 15:08:00 -0500] jtimberman: yeah i have this great idea
[2012-02-10 15:08:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: lusis, I do the same, template out a java profile script
[2012-02-10 15:09:00 -0500] jtimberman: lets put configuration for a service in a script sourced by the init system
[2012-02-10 15:09:00 -0500] jtimberman: rather than in the app / service config files itself.
[2012-02-10 15:09:00 -0500] jtimberman: and boom, /etc/{sysconfig,default} is born!
[2012-02-10 15:09:00 -0500] lusis: heh
[2012-02-10 15:09:00 -0500] jtimberman: nevermind that isn't portable to other init/service management systems.
[2012-02-10 15:10:00 -0500] thom: it should all be in xml
[2012-02-10 15:10:00 -0500] jtimberman: thom: diaf :(
[2012-02-10 15:10:00 -0500] thom: :D
[2012-02-10 15:10:00 -0500] jtimberman: also, <3
[2012-02-10 15:10:00 -0500] thom: *hugs*
[2012-02-10 15:11:00 -0500] jtimberman: aw shucks
[2012-02-10 15:11:00 -0500] jtimberman: hugs for all!
[2012-02-10 15:11:00 -0500] BryanWB_: +1 for xml
[2012-02-10 15:11:00 -0500] thom: lusis: do you think enstratus' mascot would be amenable to me stealing him/her for ever? :)
[2012-02-10 15:11:00 -0500] thom: do want dog of enormousness
[2012-02-10 15:11:00 -0500] lusis: that dog is pretty beautiful yeah?
[2012-02-10 15:12:00 -0500] thom: so gorgeous
[2012-02-10 15:13:00 -0500] BryanWB_: jtimberman, can u recommend a better way than dropping stuff off in default|sysconfig|profile.d ?
[2012-02-10 15:16:00 -0500] jtimberman: se runit :)
[2012-02-10 15:16:00 -0500] ranjibd: BryanWB_,  most probably rhel will use systemd in future .... do we really want to develop sys-v style init scripts ?
[2012-02-10 15:16:00 -0500] ranjibd: +1 for runit
[2012-02-10 15:16:00 -0500] BryanWB_: ranjibd, i am stuck w w/ rhel 5 for a while
[2012-02-10 15:16:00 -0500] jtimberman: hehehehe
[2012-02-10 15:16:00 -0500] thom: systemd is probably the right answer
[2012-02-10 15:16:00 -0500] jtimberman: BryanWB_: we are *all* suck with rhel 5 for awhile.
[2012-02-10 15:16:00 -0500] BryanWB_: and no packages for runit on rhel 6 afaict
[2012-02-10 15:17:00 -0500] BryanWB_: jtimberman, correct :) at least 4+ years
[2012-02-10 15:17:00 -0500] jtimberman: which is mental
[2012-02-10 15:17:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: I feel sorry for the people stuck on RHEL4
[2012-02-10 15:17:00 -0500] jtimberman: atomic-penguin: they chose their fate
[2012-02-10 15:17:00 -0500] BryanWB_: yeah, im just happy to be free of rhel4 and rhel3
[2012-02-10 15:17:00 -0500] jtimberman: at least rhel3 had lvm
[2012-02-10 15:17:00 -0500] thom: RHEL*; but anyway
[2012-02-10 15:18:00 -0500] jtimberman: because fuck rhelas2.1 right up the ass
[2012-02-10 15:18:00 -0500] jtimberman: first rhelas2.1 systems i had were attached to a managed SAN
[2012-02-10 15:18:00 -0500] lusis: hah
[2012-02-10 15:18:00 -0500] jtimberman: storage team allocated space in 8G LUNs
[2012-02-10 15:18:00 -0500] BryanWB_: ranjibd, but is there any way to be forward compatible w/ systemd?
[2012-02-10 15:18:00 -0500] jtimberman: 2x HBA on the SAN and 2x HBA on the servers == 4 devices per LUN
[2012-02-10 15:18:00 -0500] lusis: jtimberman: I should tell you my TSM + DS4300 horror stories with 2.1AS
[2012-02-10 15:18:00 -0500] lusis: being an ex-IBM'er you'll appreciate it
[2012-02-10 15:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: fuck the DS4000 series devices.
[2012-02-10 15:19:00 -0500] BryanWB_: if systemd ends being a stable and worthy replacement
[2012-02-10 15:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: i hate that hardware.
[2012-02-10 15:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: so many months of my life wasted trying to manage that crap
[2012-02-10 15:19:00 -0500] lusis: jtimberman: I knew I liked you
[2012-02-10 15:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: then when i switched from linux to aix
[2012-02-10 15:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: it was like HOLY SHIT THIS STUFF JUST FUCKING WORKS
[2012-02-10 15:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: lusis: you don't need to, I have that horror story too.
[2012-02-10 15:20:00 -0500] jtimberman: pkgadd ibm.ds4300.whatever; cfgmgr; lvm it up
[2012-02-10 15:20:00 -0500] lusis: yah
[2012-02-10 15:20:00 -0500] lusis: I still love AIX for the most part
[2012-02-10 15:20:00 -0500] ranjibd: BryanWB_, systemd do understand and compatible with sys-v style init scripts though.. but in general init scripts tooling are evolving rapidly .. upstart/runit etc etc
[2012-02-10 15:20:00 -0500] lusis: though HPUX is still my first love
[2012-02-10 15:20:00 -0500] lusis: for better or worse ;)
[2012-02-10 15:20:00 -0500] jtimberman: thom BryanWB_: isn't systemd the one that jordansissel was on about not having any tests for its 17k lines of code?
[2012-02-10 15:20:00 -0500] BryanWB_: jtimberman, yup
[2012-02-10 15:20:00 -0500] BryanWB_: which is why i am little skeptical
[2012-02-10 15:20:00 -0500] jtimberman: that doesn't instill confidence.
[2012-02-10 15:21:00 -0500] BryanWB_: i will believe systemd when it is proven, not just promoted
[2012-02-10 15:21:00 -0500] jtimberman: i mean, i don't know how many LOC are in runit or how many tests :)
[2012-02-10 15:21:00 -0500] jtimberman: but runit is proven.
[2012-02-10 15:21:00 -0500] yfeldblum: they're just using your production as their CI
[2012-02-10 15:21:00 -0500] lusis: I've totally swallowed the runit pill
[2012-02-10 15:22:00 -0500] jtimberman: lusis: instead of the bluepill?
[2012-02-10 15:22:00 -0500] lusis: .
[2012-02-10 15:22:00 -0500] jtimberman: booyah
[2012-02-10 15:23:00 -0500] lusis: I get this image of you as Vector in Despicable Me right now
[2012-02-10 15:23:00 -0500] lusis: "OH YEAH"
[2012-02-10 15:23:00 -0500] lusis: "SQUID LAUNCHER!"
[2012-02-10 15:23:00 -0500] lusis: if you haven't seen Despicable Me, shame on you
[2012-02-10 15:24:00 -0500] jtimberman: i have
[2012-02-10 15:36:00 -0500] BryanWB_: the big question is, should the java cookbook dropoff a file in /etc/{default|sysconfig|profile.d}/java w/ JAVA_HOME and adds JAVA_HOME/bin to PATH?
[2012-02-10 15:36:00 -0500] jtimberman: no
[2012-02-10 15:37:00 -0500] jtimberman: apps that need that should drop it off for the service(s) they manage in their own cookbook
[2012-02-10 15:38:00 -0500] BryanWB_: jtimberman, u mean , they find java_home by looking up  node['java']['java_home'] as they currently do
[2012-02-10 15:38:00 -0500] BryanWB_: and then put it in their own config files
[2012-02-10 15:41:00 -0500] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, yeah that would be a better approach; or they could drop off wrapper scripts
[2012-02-10 15:42:00 -0500] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, well that's how my tomcat and jboss ckbks currently pick up java_home
[2012-02-10 16:58:00 -0500] lusis: profile.d is acceptable imho
[2012-02-10 17:51:00 -0500] ranjibd: BryanWB_, any thoughts on jexec ?
[2012-02-10 17:52:00 -0500] BryanWB_: ranjibd, umm none, not familiar w/ it
[2012-02-10 18:09:00 -0500] BryanWB_: sounds bad
[2012-02-10 18:12:00 -0500] joewilliams: anyone seen /nodes/NODENAME requests hang indefinitely?

[2012-02-10 20:55:00 -0500] jtimberman: version dependencies are why we can't have nice things
[2012-02-10 20:55:00 -0500] jtimberman: anywhere.
[2012-02-10 20:55:00 -0500] renchap: i dont know how to fix that
