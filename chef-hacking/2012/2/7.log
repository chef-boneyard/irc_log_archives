[2012-02-07 19:21:00 -0500] ampledata: coderanger: can I bug you about a problem w/ the supervisor cookbook?
[2012-02-07 19:48:00 -0500] ampledata: coderanger: https://github.com/coderanger/chef-supervisor/commit/b641000c8559adb1c2724a9befb282755b5d7ff6#commitcomment-942480
[2012-02-07 21:12:00 -0500] coderanger: Hmm, now I have to remember if there was a reason that was needed
[2012-02-07 21:13:00 -0500] coderanger: I think it us just to match the semantics of other service resources
[2012-02-07 21:13:00 -0500] coderanger: after :enable or :disable runs, the effect should be there
[2012-02-07 21:13:00 -0500] coderanger: So probably just need some guards on it instead
[2012-02-07 22:51:00 -0500] ampledata: coderanger: it looks like eliminating :immediately isn't a sure-fire solution, i'm currently wrapping 'supervisorctl update' in a not_if to check if supervisord is running
[2012-02-07 22:52:00 -0500] coderanger: That seems like the right way for now
[2012-02-07 22:52:00 -0500] coderanger: The better long-term solution is to implement a supervisord client in ruby itself and just check if someone is on the socket, etc
[2012-02-07 22:52:00 -0500] coderanger: But that didn't look simple when I tried before :D
[2012-02-07 22:53:00 -0500] ampledata: https://github.com/schmurfy/ruby-supervisor
[2012-02-07 22:53:00 -0500] coderanger: You know, it probably should have occurred to me to check that
[2012-02-07 22:53:00 -0500] coderanger: derppppp
[2012-02-07 22:53:00 -0500] ampledata: I'M USING THE INTERNET!
[2012-02-07 22:54:00 -0500] ampledata: i'll roll my ghetto solution for now and see if can can't shim this into the cookbook later
[2012-02-07 22:54:00 -0500] ampledata: s/can can't/can't/;
[2012-02-07 22:54:00 -0500] coderanger: Sounds good :)
[2012-02-07 22:54:00 -0500] ampledata: thanks
[2012-02-07 22:55:00 -0500] coderanger: Actually, that gem was posted several weeks after my cookbook
[2012-02-07 22:55:00 -0500] coderanger: Now I feel less bad
[2012-02-07 22:55:00 -0500] laurent\: "a bounty program", how would you reformulate that ?
[2012-02-07 22:55:00 -0500] ampledata: rephrase?
[2012-02-07 22:56:00 -0500] laurent\: (i don't really undestand the meaning)
[2012-02-07 22:56:00 -0500] laurent\: yep rephrase
[2012-02-07 22:56:00 -0500] ampledata: like a bug bounty?
[2012-02-07 22:56:00 -0500] laurent\: it the bounty word i don't get :)
[2012-02-07 22:56:00 -0500] laurent\: it's
[2012-02-07 22:56:00 -0500] ampledata: oh, you win a reward for finding bugs?
[2012-02-07 22:56:00 -0500] coderanger: laurent\: The 10km idea is to pay people to fix chef bugs that don't work for opscode
[2012-02-07 22:56:00 -0500] ampledata: we usually call them test-a-thons
[2012-02-07 22:57:00 -0500] coderanger: bounty for fix, not for find
[2012-02-07 22:57:00 -0500] ampledata: holy shit i'd be rich
[2012-02-07 22:57:00 -0500] ampledata: oh fix
[2012-02-07 22:57:00 -0500] ampledata: haha
[2012-02-07 22:57:00 -0500] laurent\: oh ok
[2012-02-07 22:57:00 -0500] laurent\: make sense :) i can do that !:-)
[2012-02-07 22:57:00 -0500] coderanger: Usually the only bugs you get paid to find are security :P
[2012-02-07 22:57:00 -0500] ampledata: did i miss some announcement?
[2012-02-07 22:57:00 -0500] coderanger: No, just an idea that btm has been batting around
[2012-02-07 22:58:00 -0500] ampledata: a test bounty would be cool too
[2012-02-07 22:58:00 -0500] ampledata: e.g. for every test you add to the suite, ...
[2012-02-07 22:59:00 -0500] coderanger: No specific plans exist, and great care would have to be taken to not devalue existing and future FOSS contributors
[2012-02-07 23:00:00 -0500] ampledata: i really hope i can do a track on testing
[2012-02-07 23:01:00 -0500] ampledata: github drinkup on thursday, btw
[2012-02-07 23:01:00 -0500] laurent\: anyway, thanks guys for the rephrasing and examples
[2012-02-07 23:06:00 -0500] fujin: gimme money
[2012-02-07 23:18:00 -0500] laurent\: want euros ? :)
[2012-02-07 23:19:00 -0500] fujin: aight
[2012-02-07 23:41:00 -0500] ampledata: i'll take euros until greece implodes
[2012-02-07 23:42:00 -0500] ampledata: i'd
[2012-02-07 23:55:00 -0500] cwj: "until" implies a condition that has not yet been met
[2012-02-07 23:55:00 -0500] ampledata: finishes
[2012-02-07 23:56:00 -0500] cwj: ah :)
