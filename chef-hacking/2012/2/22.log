[2012-02-22 19:02:00 -0500] hoover_damm: how's life?
[2012-02-22 19:03:00 -0500] c_t: he's taken a vow of silence
[2012-02-22 19:04:00 -0500] c_t: all he can do is '/me' stuff
[2012-02-22 19:08:00 -0500] roidrage: he did say "ya"
[2012-02-22 20:09:00 -0500] holoway: hehehe
[2012-02-22 20:09:00 -0500] holoway: I've been crazy busy with customers
[2012-02-22 20:09:00 -0500] holoway: it's a high class problem, but it does limit ones IRC interactions
[2012-02-22 20:09:00 -0500] holoway: :)
[2012-02-22 20:34:00 -0500] jtimberman: i'm in a room with customers right now and i'm on irc, c'mon!
[2012-02-22 20:34:00 -0500] jtimberman: (okay, its lunch break time)
[2012-02-22 20:53:00 -0500] roidrage: jtimberman: do you have growl or sound notifications on by any chance?
[2012-02-22 20:56:00 -0500] c_t: ooh, or maybe a talking IRC client
[2012-02-22 20:58:00 -0500] btm: "Could you please turn your IRC phone down in our meeting?"
[2012-02-22 21:58:00 -0500] jtimberman: This IRC is via a Tmux / SSH connection.
[2012-02-22 21:58:00 -0500] jtimberman: And I disabled growl and muted my laptop during the class.
[2012-02-22 22:12:00 -0500] c_t: I use irssi + screen because I'm cool like that
[2012-02-22 22:13:00 -0500] c_t: also, because I haven't gotten around to looking into tmux
[2012-02-22 22:20:00 -0500] cwj: i usealice.org because its cool like that
[2012-02-22 22:22:00 -0500] c_t: but cwj
[2012-02-22 22:22:00 -0500] c_t: Alice Doesn't IRC Here Anymore
[2012-02-22 22:23:00 -0500] cwj: all she does is irc
[2012-02-22 22:27:00 -0500] fujin: whats usealice like compared to irccloud
[2012-02-22 22:40:00 -0500] cwj: i never used irccloud so i cant really say
[2012-02-22 22:41:00 -0500] cwj: my friend is the author of alice, you can check it out on github at https://github.com/leedo/alice
[2012-02-22 22:41:00 -0500] cwj: usealice is the hosted version, it has some features not present in that version
[2012-02-22 22:41:00 -0500] cwj: i wrote a cookbook for deploying the free version, but havent touched it in a while
[2012-02-22 22:41:00 -0500] cwj: https://github.com/cwjohnston/chef-alice
[2012-02-22 22:55:00 -0500] fujin: interesting
