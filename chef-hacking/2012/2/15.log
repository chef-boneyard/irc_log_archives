[2012-02-15 11:28:00 -0500] theozaurus1: Can anyone spot why this isn't working for expanding attributes? https://gist.github.com/1835138
[2012-02-15 14:29:00 -0500] jtimberman: hoover_damm: i don't like tcl at all.
[2012-02-15 14:30:00 -0500] jtimberman: hoover_damm: i also converted half a TCL GUI app to python gtk
[2012-02-15 14:34:00 -0500] renchap: why is the dep on net-ssh ~2.1.3 ?
[2012-02-15 14:34:00 -0500] renchap: freebsd bumped net-ssh to 2.2.0 and it breaks the chef port
[2012-02-15 14:53:00 -0500] yfeldblum: relying on platform packages for chef's gems dependencies seems broken ...
[2012-02-15 15:23:00 -0500] jtimberman: yfeldblum: its part of being in ports
[2012-02-15 15:23:00 -0500] jtimberman: yfeldblum: its not a gem there, its a port :)
[2012-02-15 15:23:00 -0500] renchap: iam advised to mark the port as broken
[2012-02-15 15:24:00 -0500] renchap: until the next release of chef that fixes it
[2012-02-15 15:27:00 -0500] jtimberman:   s.add_dependency "net-ssh", "~> 2.2.2"
[2012-02-15 15:27:00 -0500] jtimberman:   s.add_dependency "net-ssh-multi", "~> 1.1.0"
[2012-02-15 15:27:00 -0500] jtimberman: looks like its fixed in master.
[2012-02-15 15:27:00 -0500] jtimberman: so it will go in chef 0.10.10
[2012-02-15 15:27:00 -0500] renchap: cant wait
[2012-02-15 15:27:00 -0500] jtimberman: can the port not deploy from master? :)
[2012-02-15 15:28:00 -0500] jtimberman: I use this in my Gemfile: gem "chef", "~> 0.10.8", :git => "git://github.com/opscode/chef.git", :ref => "c50926374e1f1bf331667c4239e5e11aa11a084c"
[2012-02-15 15:29:00 -0500] jtimberman: for vagrant
[2012-02-15 15:29:00 -0500] jtimberman: though i don't know what version the json rubygem port is in freebsd, this might be an issue:  s.add_dependency "json", ">= 1.4.4", "<= 1.6.1"
[2012-02-15 15:30:00 -0500] jtimberman: gotta run
[2012-02-15 15:30:00 -0500] yfeldblum: wrapping packages in packages seems like such a broken model
[2012-02-15 15:30:00 -0500] renchap: 1.6.5
[2012-02-15 15:30:00 -0500] renchap: but there is a json146 port :)
[2012-02-15 15:31:00 -0500] renchap: really.
[2012-02-15 15:31:00 -0500] jtimberman: there was a ticket for that
[2012-02-15 15:31:00 -0500] jtimberman: renchap: can you create a ticket that we should bump the version?
[2012-02-15 15:31:00 -0500] renchap: version of json ?
[2012-02-15 15:31:00 -0500] jtimberman: (the real solution though is to get off that stupid json gem :( )
[2012-02-15 15:31:00 -0500] jtimberman: renchap: 1.6.5 is the latest.
[2012-02-15 15:31:00 -0500] jtimberman: currently.
[2012-02-15 15:31:00 -0500] renchap: you dont
[2012-02-15 15:31:00 -0500] renchap: you need to switch to yajl
[2012-02-15 15:32:00 -0500] renchap: ohai already switched
[2012-02-15 15:32:00 -0500] jtimberman: mixlib-json (0.1.0)
[2012-02-15 15:32:00 -0500] jtimberman: i think the plan was to use that
[2012-02-15 15:32:00 -0500] renchap: well
[2012-02-15 15:32:00 -0500] renchap: systemu is a problem too
[2012-02-15 15:32:00 -0500] renchap: there is a mixlib for that !
[2012-02-15 15:32:00 -0500] jtimberman: mixlib-shellout is part of moving off systemu
[2012-02-15 15:32:00 -0500] renchap: soon in your mixlib store
[2012-02-15 15:32:00 -0500] jtimberman: which i heartily endorse :)
[2012-02-15 15:33:00 -0500] jtimberman: mixlib-shellout (1.0.0.rc.1 ruby x86-mingw32, 1.0.0.rc.0 ruby x86-mingw32)
[2012-02-15 15:33:00 -0500] jtimberman: there's a significant amount of work to switch everything to mixlib-shellout, because it requires changing most of chef's providers, and all ohai's plugins.
[2012-02-15 15:34:00 -0500] jtimberman: anyway, really do need to go.
[2012-02-15 15:34:00 -0500] renchap: are there plans for chef 0.11 already ? and a big overview ?
[2012-02-15 16:13:00 -0500] github-bawt: [chef] btm pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/X-pdow
[2012-02-15 16:13:00 -0500] github-bawt: [chef/master] CHEF-2880: Revert "CHEF-597 Chef::Provider::Service::Debian to use invoke-rc.d" - Bryan McLellan
[2012-02-15 16:28:00 -0500] laurent\: that's a hell of commit
[2012-02-15 16:29:00 -0500] laurent\: you could have just changed the default provider
[2012-02-15 16:30:00 -0500] laurent\: nope, everything is reverted
[2012-02-15 17:17:00 -0500] jtimberman: renchap: there are plans, but nothing really announced or posted that i'm aware of.
[2012-02-15 17:17:00 -0500] jtimberman: maybe a wiki page or two n the feature requests and proposals page but i haven't visited that in a while
[2012-02-15 17:21:00 -0500] laurent\: btm: ;-)
[2012-02-15 19:25:00 -0500] kallistec: HEY PEOPLE TEST THE OHAI RC
[2012-02-15 19:30:00 -0500] kallistec: don't make me shame you
[2012-02-15 19:33:00 -0500] laurent\: 0.6.12.rc.1 ?
[2012-02-15 19:34:00 -0500] kallistec: laurent\: yes please
[2012-02-15 19:35:00 -0500] kallistec: especially networking
[2012-02-15 19:36:00 -0500] laurent\: ok, deploying it right now
[2012-02-15 19:36:00 -0500] kallistec: TYVM
[2012-02-15 19:53:00 -0500] laurent\: looking at the source, but counters/network is empty here
[2012-02-15 19:54:00 -0500] laurent\: oh i guess it's because ohai assumes ip is recent enough to have the -s option to ip link
[2012-02-15 19:55:00 -0500] laurent\: which is not true here
[2012-02-15 19:56:00 -0500] laurent\: so that will be a regression for a lot of people i think
[2012-02-15 20:01:00 -0500] laurent\: just updated iproute to 20120105, it doesn't have to -s option to ip link either
[2012-02-15 20:01:00 -0500] laurent\: s/to/the/
[2012-02-15 20:01:00 -0500] laurent\: oops bad regexp, s/have to/have the/
[2012-02-15 20:10:00 -0500] laurent\: kallistec: 've reopened http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/OHAI-325
[2012-02-15 20:10:00 -0500] kallistec: laurent\: cool, thanks for testing
[2012-02-15 21:44:00 -0500] github-bawt: [omnibus] btm pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/DOZ2vA
[2012-02-15 21:44:00 -0500] github-bawt: [omnibus/master] Add special case of OSX to setup.sh - Steven Danna
[2012-02-15 21:44:00 -0500] github-bawt: [omnibus/master] Merge branch 'CHEF-2746' - Bryan McLellan
[2012-02-15 21:48:00 -0500] jtimberman: would github push notifications for the cookbooks be useful here?
[2012-02-15 21:48:00 -0500] jtimberman: or would that be too much github-bawt spam?
[2012-02-15 21:49:00 -0500] btm: laurent\: what os/release are you on?
[2012-02-15 21:53:00 -0500] yfeldblum: jtimberman, see if people complain ... but how would you work that with multiple cookbook repos?
[2012-02-15 21:54:00 -0500] jtimberman: yfeldblum: well thats the consideration, in setting up each of the split up repos, have each one send a notification here.
[2012-02-15 21:54:00 -0500] jtimberman: most of the cookbooks aren't going to be updated very frequently.
[2012-02-15 21:55:00 -0500] btm: laurent\: does 'ip -s link' work for you?
[2012-02-15 22:40:00 -0500] laurent\: btm: debian/ubuntu, yes ip -s link does work
[2012-02-15 22:41:00 -0500] laurent\: haven't thought of that, it's just a typo in the end
[2012-02-15 22:57:00 -0500] btm: laurent\: I was wondering if maybe it the option code got better in later releases of iproute2, such as whatever ctennis was developing on with Arch, and allowed options in any order.
[2012-02-15 22:57:00 -0500] btm: in any case, I don't have time to write a regression test today for it.
[2012-02-15 23:07:00 -0500] laurent\: btm: archlinux provides iproute2 3.2 (aka 20120105), i've tried it on debian/sid: the stats options has to be before the object (object is link in that case)
[2012-02-15 23:07:00 -0500] laurent\: must be a typo
[2012-02-15 23:07:00 -0500] laurent\: ctennis: ping ? :)
[2012-02-15 23:52:00 -0500] ctennis: laurent\: hi, sorry, I'm just catching up
[2012-02-15 23:52:00 -0500] ctennis: glad someone got a chance to test for regression :)
