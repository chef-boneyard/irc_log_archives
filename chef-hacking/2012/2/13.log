[2012-02-13 19:55:00 -0500] hoover_damm: wow
[2012-02-13 19:55:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so it appears that GitHub releases their own version of ohai
[2012-02-13 19:55:00 -0500] hoover_damm: for GitHub Enterprise
[2012-02-13 19:55:00 -0500] hoover_damm: well it's prolly just plugins
[2012-02-13 19:56:00 -0500] hoover_damm: neat, just some plugins and an ohai wrapper
[2012-02-13 19:59:00 -0500] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, the code appears to be here: https://github.com/benburkert/enterprise-ohai

[2012-02-13 20:25:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, rubygems didn't show the repo
[2012-02-13 20:26:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, I knew ben did it.. as it was clearly ben's code
[2012-02-13 20:28:00 -0500] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, sorry, wasn't intended to be directed at you ... just posting the github url for anyone else who wants to take a look, so they don't have to go hunt for it
[2012-02-13 20:29:00 -0500] hoover_damm: ahh
[2012-02-13 21:12:00 -0500] fujin: so
[2012-02-13 21:12:00 -0500] fujin: encrypted data bags suck
[2012-02-13 21:12:00 -0500] fujin: mostly because of preshared key distribution (and having to manage that!)
[2012-02-13 21:12:00 -0500] fujin: woudl it be possible to have an encryption system that uses the pki infrastructure of chef itself ?
[2012-02-13 21:13:00 -0500] Mithrandir: possible?  Sure.
[2012-02-13 21:13:00 -0500] Mithrandir: it'd mean having the chef server have access to the data, though
[2012-02-13 21:14:00 -0500] ampledata: I HAD BEER FOR LUNCH
[2012-02-13 21:14:00 -0500] ampledata: also company wide meetings are retarded
[2012-02-13 21:16:00 -0500] ampledata: fujin what's your talk about
[2012-02-13 21:17:00 -0500] fujin: so far I'm thinking about a workshop w/ Pennyworth
[2012-02-13 21:17:00 -0500] fujin: bring you rapp and I'll show you how to kick it
[2012-02-13 21:17:00 -0500] fujin: kind of deal
[2012-02-13 21:17:00 -0500] fujin: Still thinking, got 90~ days or whatever to plan
[2012-02-13 21:17:00 -0500] yfeldblum: fujin, i'm not quite sure what encrypted data bags are for ... the key use case for encrypted data bags seems to be to protect your secrets from observation or manipulation by opscode ... but opscode can just inject code into your cookbooks to upload your secrets to them ...
[2012-02-13 21:18:00 -0500] fujin: they seem like a total false sense of security
[2012-02-13 21:18:00 -0500] fujin: gotta store unencrypted contents + encryption key in a shared location
[2012-02-13 21:18:00 -0500] fujin: then you gotat store the encryption key on EACH SYSTEM ? to access the encrypted contents
[2012-02-13 21:18:00 -0500] fujin: thats just dumb
[2012-02-13 21:18:00 -0500] yfeldblum: fujin, there is the bit about some clients not given certain keys, but then you get some complex key management to deal with for which you need a configuration management system
[2012-02-13 21:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: yfeldblum: digitally signing node run lists would be much better.
[2012-02-13 21:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: well
[2012-02-13 21:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: would help
[2012-02-13 21:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: I use encrypted data bags so when I check them into my private github repo, github doesn't have them :)
[2012-02-13 21:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: protecting them from opscode would be completely silly :)
[2012-02-13 21:20:00 -0500] jtimberman: yfeldblum: we don't have the private keys, so we can modify cookbooks.
[2012-02-13 21:20:00 -0500] c_t: until mattray's reign of terror begins, anyway
[2012-02-13 21:21:00 -0500] jtimberman: yfeldblum: on hosted chef, cookbook contents are stored in private S3 buckets as checksum filenames.
[2012-02-13 21:21:00 -0500] jtimberman: if we modified a cookbook over the wire, the checksum would change and chef would barf
[2012-02-13 21:22:00 -0500] fujin: jtimberman: thoughts re: encrypted databags?
[2012-02-13 21:23:00 -0500] yfeldblum: jtimberman, so, protecting your data bag items from github, and from each other on the ops team?
[2012-02-13 21:24:00 -0500] yfeldblum: jtimberman, does hosted have per-data-bag ACLs?
[2012-02-13 21:24:00 -0500] fujin: yes it does
[2012-02-13 21:24:00 -0500] fujin: always has (IIRC)
[2012-02-13 21:24:00 -0500] jtimberman: yfeldblum: That is what *I* do for my personal stuff :)
[2012-02-13 21:24:00 -0500] fujin: you can't manage acls with an api so it's basically f'n useless
[2012-02-13 21:24:00 -0500] fujin: no humans allowed
[2012-02-13 21:24:00 -0500] jtimberman: our developers and operations folks do something else.
[2012-02-13 21:25:00 -0500] jtimberman: yfeldblum: yes, and i believe it goes to the specific items for acls
[2012-02-13 21:33:00 -0500] yfeldblum: hmm ... in general, i'm just not a fan of data bag items being in git
[2012-02-13 21:36:00 -0500] yfeldblum: jtimberman, but couldn't the chef-server admin rewrite the cookbooks and give them new checksums without the chef-client being able to detect?
[2012-02-13 22:05:00 -0500] fujin: yfeldblum: i guess the chef server could reupload a cookbook, sure
[2012-02-13 22:06:00 -0500] fujin: so I'm going to build an encrypted data bag secret distribution thingy around S3 & IAM
[2012-02-13 22:06:00 -0500] fujin: or, t hat's the plan, at least :)
[2012-02-13 22:08:00 -0500] yfeldblum: fujin, sounds pretty complicated ... what's the need?
[2012-02-13 22:09:00 -0500] fujin: i don't want to build a key management system for databag encryption keys? :)
[2012-02-13 22:09:00 -0500] fujin: i can use iam + access to an object in a bucket
[2012-02-13 22:11:00 -0500] hoover_damm: +1
[2012-02-13 22:11:00 -0500] hoover_damm: IAM is awesome
[2012-02-13 22:11:00 -0500] hoover_damm: use it more
[2012-02-13 22:14:00 -0500] fujin: what does everyone else use for securely distributing and rotating encrypted databag secrets to humans and machines ?
[2012-02-13 22:54:00 -0500] jtimberman: fujin: ssh
[2012-02-13 22:54:00 -0500] jtimberman: :P
[2012-02-13 22:54:00 -0500] jtimberman: wherein another key is required.
[2012-02-13 22:54:00 -0500] fujin: so it's a big joke eh? lol
[2012-02-13 22:56:00 -0500] jtimberman: no
[2012-02-13 23:27:00 -0500] ssd7: fujin: I've seen some good ideas about distributing, not as many about rotating.  Re distributing, I've seen a few scripts floating around that use the client pem's to encrypt the secrets.  That's harder to do on the platform becuase precreating clients lead to lots of button-clicking.
[2012-02-13 23:30:00 -0500] github-bawt: [chef] danielsdeleo pushed 3 new commits to resource-reporting: http://git.io/e4EkOg
[2012-02-13 23:30:00 -0500] github-bawt: [chef/resource-reporting] resources can declare valid status values and have a status field - Daniel DeLeo
[2012-02-13 23:30:00 -0500] github-bawt: [chef/resource-reporting] store the currently executing action on the provider - Daniel DeLeo
[2012-02-13 23:30:00 -0500] github-bawt: [chef/resource-reporting] cowboy a ton of changes for resource auditing - Daniel DeLeo
[2012-02-13 23:32:00 -0500] fujin: heh
[2012-02-13 23:32:00 -0500] fujin: yeah I don't want to be precreating them, but having something that used the existing PKI infrastructure would be pretty awesome.
[2012-02-13 23:33:00 -0500] fujin: for distributing, I think I'm going to *try* a smart .chef/knife.rb that fetches the key from s3 (using IAM user credentials)
[2012-02-13 23:33:00 -0500] fujin: and a cookbook that makes sure the encrypted data bag on disk is the latest by fetching the latest from s3 as well, using IAM credentials for systems or something.
[2012-02-13 23:34:00 -0500] fujin: or a generic iam key fetcher user or something like that. :D
[2012-02-13 23:34:00 -0500] kallistec: fujin: I think we were always planning to do that eventually, but the truly paranoid will note that opscode briefly has a copy of the clients' private keys
[2012-02-13 23:35:00 -0500] fujin: I wish I was more paranoid about it
[2012-02-13 23:35:00 -0500] fujin: most of me really does not give a flying fuck
[2012-02-13 23:35:00 -0500] kallistec: so out of band keys are required for tin foil hat level paranoia
[2012-02-13 23:35:00 -0500] fujin: guess that is what I am solving for now =_=
[2012-02-13 23:38:00 -0500] kallistec: fujin: if you're willing to put in a bit of time, you can probably hack it out without too much trouble
[2012-02-13 23:39:00 -0500] kallistec: GET URL/clients/NAME
[2012-02-13 23:39:00 -0500] kallistec: then for hosted chef, you grab the cert from result["certificate"]
[2012-02-13 23:41:00 -0500] fujin: that's a private key eh?
[2012-02-13 23:41:00 -0500] kallistec: nope, certificate, so it's the public key that's signed by opscode
[2012-02-13 23:42:00 -0500] kallistec: fujin: https://gist.github.com/e74014bd70032d9f19a5
[2012-02-13 23:45:00 -0500] fujin: ooh
[2012-02-13 23:50:00 -0500] kallistec: then you can probably just read up from mixlib-authn to find the right methods to do the encryption
