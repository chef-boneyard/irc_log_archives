[2012-08-17 13:43:33 -0400] roidrage: did anything weird happen to hosted chef on august 12th?
[2012-08-17 13:46:31 -0400] roidrage: all of our chef clients got stuck on that day :/
[2012-08-17 14:01:43 -0400] geekbri: Yeah the hosted service went down
[2012-08-17 14:01:53 -0400] geekbri: I had the same issue, I just issued them all a service chef-client restart and that seemed to fix it
[2012-08-17 14:11:03 -0400] roidrage: :( no tweet, no post-mortem, sad panda

[2012-08-17 14:35:53 -0400] roidrage: okay, i'd appreciate a bit more visibility of this kind of stuff, but i'll be sure to look on all the pages in the future :)
[2012-08-17 14:39:41 -0400] btm: roidrage: I'll put a ticket in for folks to consider how to do so.
[2012-08-17 14:39:55 -0400] roidrage: thanks! much appreciated

[2012-08-17 16:21:24 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] Merge branch '10-stable' - Bryan McLellan
[2012-08-17 17:32:47 -0400] btm: bemu: do you use hadoop with chef?
[2012-08-17 17:33:10 -0400] bemu: Not really.
[2012-08-17 17:33:29 -0400] bemu: All of our hadoop stuff is on EMR+spot instances currently.
[2012-08-17 17:33:54 -0400] bemu: We are seriously eyeing building out our own cluster for it though.
[2012-08-17 17:33:59 -0400] bemu: Why do you ask?
[2012-08-17 17:35:00 -0400] btm: bemu: some people were asking for any advice and you were the first one that came to mind.
[2012-08-17 17:35:31 -0400] bemu: stuff we manage with chef: python, tornado, django, redis, memcache, mongo, postgres, scribe, thrift, haproxy, nginx, nagios, ganglia, statsd, graphite, collectd, postfix, primarily.
[2012-08-17 17:40:44 -0400] geekbri: We currently manage our hadoop cluster with chef
[2012-08-17 17:41:08 -0400] geekbri: ~ 40 datanode/tasktrackers
[2012-08-17 17:57:09 -0400] btm: geekbri: do you use any particular cookbooks? any tips for someone else trying to do so?
[2012-08-17 17:57:44 -0400] geekbri: btm: I'll start this with the caveat that we started working on this about.... 8 months ago.  We basically took the opscode hadoop cookbook and made massive modifications to it
[2012-08-17 17:58:20 -0400] geekbri: We also had a bad experience with the infochimps stuff.  We steer clear of their stuff
[2012-08-17 17:58:27 -0400] geekbri: Although like I said, that was 8 months ago
[2012-08-17 17:58:32 -0400] geekbri: Maybe the state of their stuff is better now
[2012-08-17 17:59:18 -0400] btm: geekbri: and when are you releasing your work? ;)
[2012-08-17 18:00:15 -0400] geekbri: btm: Ah wish I could tel you when :).  I'm actually not pleased with the state of our hadoop cookbook (Works great, but 1. is very specific for us 2. was written before I was as deep in chef as I am now).  At some point I plan to totally rewrite it, that will get released :)
[2012-08-17 18:00:29 -0400] geekbri: unfortunately that is way off on the road map given our current resources vs work load :)
[2012-08-17 18:00:39 -0400] geekbri: I am perfectly happy to answer any of your questions whenever Im around though
[2012-08-17 18:04:37 -0400] geekbri: However if your company is in the boston area and would like to hire me to only write open source software, shoot me an email :D
[2012-08-17 18:05:28 -0400] btm: geekbri: I work for Opscode. Although I live in Downeast Maine. :)
[2012-08-17 18:05:39 -0400] btm: geekbri: I'll pass along your name as the hadoop/chef expert. ;)
[2012-08-17 18:06:01 -0400] geekbri: Expert, I'm flattered.. However that is a strong word :)
[2012-08-17 19:26:14 -0400] hoover_damm: geekbri, tbh we need more people who have a grasp of what they're doing writing more generic cookbooks and releasing them
[2012-08-17 19:26:39 -0400] geekbri: If I was getting paid for that sorta thing that would be sexy cakes
[2012-08-17 19:26:40 -0400] hoover_damm: geekbri, because as you know we first solve our problem at hand.  To open source a cookbook usually means pulling parts out
[2012-08-17 19:26:50 -0400] geekbri: Yeah.
[2012-08-17 19:26:51 -0400] hoover_damm: it is sexy cakes
[2012-08-17 19:26:54 -0400] hoover_damm: I want a job like that again
[2012-08-17 19:27:13 -0400] hoover_damm: well i take that back
[2012-08-17 19:27:25 -0400] hoover_damm: it was fun, but I tend to be more polyglot now then 100% chef
[2012-08-17 19:27:31 -0400] hoover_damm: so actually staying 100% on chef 8hours a day would grind me
[2012-08-17 19:28:37 -0400] hoover_damm: as long as it's not chef 0.6 perhaps the grind is acceptable
[2012-08-17 19:28:38 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
