[2012-08-10 02:43:39 -0400] erratic: sorry if that was crude .... trying to have a sense of humor
[2012-08-10 02:43:57 -0400] erratic: I mean its kinda true lol
[2012-08-10 02:45:31 -0400] erratic: true as in true that people are like that o_O
[2012-08-10 02:47:28 -0400] hoover_damm: around that neighborhoor?
[2012-08-10 02:47:30 -0400] hoover_damm: pretty much
[2012-08-10 02:47:34 -0400] erratic: I should find something on netflix, they changed the netflix start screen on my xbox and now it prompts me about whether I want netflix for kids or regular netflix and they didn't fix any of the stuff tthats wrong with it
[2012-08-10 02:48:15 -0400] hoover_damm: remember there's enough nutjobs out there that most guys don't do too much
[2012-08-10 02:48:24 -0400] erratic: wanna talk about a really bad place, you should go to the 711 in skyway off martin luther king
[2012-08-10 02:48:47 -0400] erratic: my mom lives down the street from it
[2012-08-10 02:48:53 -0400] hoover_damm: nah
[2012-08-10 02:48:58 -0400] hoover_damm: honestly seattle streets are easy
[2012-08-10 02:49:28 -0400] hoover_damm: I grew up in Denver ... i remember when the bloods and crips were young and new
[2012-08-10 02:49:31 -0400] erratic: I didn't mind it too much, my mom would stress out though if I went to the store at night
[2012-08-10 02:49:46 -0400] hoover_damm: most of the kids up here arn't worth the effort of freaking out over
[2012-08-10 02:50:09 -0400] erratic: I got robbed one time in front of the hurricane
[2012-08-10 02:50:09 -0400] hoover_damm: but i love that 7-11 because it has some of the craziest drivers coming out of it
[2012-08-10 02:50:23 -0400] hoover_damm: and there's some crazy people there occasionally
[2012-08-10 02:50:25 -0400] hoover_damm: not so much now
[2012-08-10 02:50:38 -0400] hoover_damm: it's just like driving by ricks used to be a laugh
[2012-08-10 02:50:50 -0400] erratic: I know right xD
[2012-08-10 02:50:51 -0400] hoover_damm: now you just get to laugh at the people who go in there
[2012-08-10 02:51:01 -0400] erratic: dude I catch the bus right there every morning to work
[2012-08-10 02:51:08 -0400] hoover_damm: that's not ricks
[2012-08-10 02:51:16 -0400] hoover_damm: ricks is down lake city way
[2012-08-10 02:51:18 -0400] hoover_damm: close :)
[2012-08-10 02:51:22 -0400] erratic: oh yeah
[2012-08-10 02:51:36 -0400] hoover_damm: and that place isn't that bad
[2012-08-10 02:51:38 -0400] erratic: sorry forgot
[2012-08-10 02:51:49 -0400] hoover_damm: at least from what i've seen on the outside
[2012-08-10 02:51:58 -0400] hoover_damm: compared to ricks it looks almost pleasant from the outside
[2012-08-10 02:52:08 -0400] erratic: I used to catch the bus up by kaffeklatsch every morning, I used to live at 27th and 135th
[2012-08-10 02:52:20 -0400] hoover_damm: i know that area as I live near there
[2012-08-10 02:52:29 -0400] hoover_damm: obviously as i know the hood
[2012-08-10 02:53:19 -0400] erratic: I dont drive so the only thing I hate about it is catching the bus home
[2012-08-10 02:53:40 -0400] erratic: theres always the 41 and also the 49 and the 73 I think
[2012-08-10 02:53:50 -0400] erratic: 73 usually runs pretty late
[2012-08-10 02:54:04 -0400] erratic: honestly I miss living on the hill though
[2012-08-10 02:54:11 -0400] hoover_damm: <-- works from home
[2012-08-10 02:54:24 -0400] erratic: houses there start at like 1M ..
[2012-08-10 02:54:32 -0400] hoover_damm: i haven't worked in an office in over 3 years
[2012-08-10 02:54:39 -0400] hoover_damm: I really don't want to
[2012-08-10 02:54:39 -0400] erratic: nice
[2012-08-10 02:54:40 -0400] hoover_damm: again
[2012-08-10 02:54:58 -0400] erratic: see I was under the impression that you worked in the opscode office downtown
[2012-08-10 02:55:03 -0400] hoover_damm: it doesn't help that I get distracted hella easily and I try to solve problems
[2012-08-10 02:55:11 -0400] erratic: I did not know you worked a home
[2012-08-10 02:55:14 -0400] hoover_damm: nah I am a freelance contractor
[2012-08-10 02:55:17 -0400] hoover_damm: I don't work for Opscode
[2012-08-10 02:55:29 -0400] hoover_damm: my clients use Chef though :)
[2012-08-10 02:55:42 -0400] erratic: huh I could've swore it was you
[2012-08-10 02:55:56 -0400] hoover_damm: you've likely never met me unless it was around the neighborhood
[2012-08-10 02:56:13 -0400] hoover_damm: I am antisocial and I feel like there is no reason for anyone to meet me
[2012-08-10 02:56:23 -0400] erratic: I am too
[2012-08-10 02:56:29 -0400] erratic: I rarely want to meet people
[2012-08-10 02:56:33 -0400] hoover_damm: I don't do meetups
[2012-08-10 02:56:38 -0400] hoover_damm: the term devops makes me laugh
[2012-08-10 02:56:44 -0400] erratic: like the past couple of weeks I've just stayed at home
[2012-08-10 02:56:50 -0400] hoover_damm: i'll either call myself god
[2012-08-10 02:56:55 -0400] hoover_damm: or an operations engineer
[2012-08-10 02:56:58 -0400] hoover_damm: you can pick
[2012-08-10 02:57:04 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-08-10 02:57:05 -0400] erratic: :)
[2012-08-10 02:57:16 -0400] hoover_damm: remember everyone is god
[2012-08-10 02:57:18 -0400] erratic: yeah basically like I dont like working at places where I don't have any leverage
[2012-08-10 02:57:29 -0400] erratic: and where my face is just another face
[2012-08-10 02:57:48 -0400] hoover_damm: the truth is my leverage
[2012-08-10 02:57:59 -0400] hoover_damm: I would rather educate people with the hard facts of life
[2012-08-10 02:58:09 -0400] hoover_damm: and show them what is tangible and real and they can affect
[2012-08-10 02:59:02 -0400] erratic: I guess I'm pretty lucky to have the job experience I have
[2012-08-10 02:59:10 -0400] erratic: I haven't ever worked for google or microsoft or amazon
[2012-08-10 02:59:27 -0400] erratic: I don't have formal education, or any debts
[2012-08-10 02:59:52 -0400] hoover_damm: neither
[2012-08-10 02:59:53 -0400] erratic: I just happen to dedicate a lot of time to learning and building stuff
[2012-08-10 02:59:56 -0400] hoover_damm: hard knocks
[2012-08-10 02:59:58 -0400] hoover_damm: 110%
[2012-08-10 03:00:54 -0400] erratic: I finally got around to figuring out and using vagrant
[2012-08-10 03:01:02 -0400] erratic: its not too bad
[2012-08-10 03:01:15 -0400] erratic: there's issues but I've worked through them mostly
[2012-08-10 03:02:57 -0400] erratic: the fact that I can destroy and build out my entire environment including chef server, with solo, and have all of the other vms provision from that chef server is pretty damn cool
[2012-08-10 03:03:17 -0400] erratic: it was a little bit of work and staying focused
[2012-08-10 03:03:41 -0400] erratic: have you used it at all?
[2012-08-10 05:11:08 -0400] hoover_damm: nah
[2012-08-10 05:11:50 -0400] hoover_damm: I have an dislikeof virtualization in most flavors
[2012-08-10 05:11:54 -0400] hoover_damm: lame hypervisors
[2012-08-10 05:12:03 -0400] hoover_damm: unneccesary complexity
[2012-08-10 05:14:22 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, silly virtual memory
[2012-08-10 05:15:19 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, allow me to update the hypervisor microprocessor's firmware
[2012-08-10 05:15:24 -0400] hoover_damm: and maybe I can accept that sadism
[2012-08-10 05:15:57 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, basically virtualization is not a pattern I like to use.  It is counter productive and only add's to my work load in the long run.
[2012-08-10 05:16:23 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, I value my time differently however then most.
[2012-08-10 05:16:46 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, I don't see the point in making my cookbooks work both on el5 and on vagrant el5...
[2012-08-10 05:17:12 -0400] hoover_damm: i've seen people muddle through hacking their cookbooks so they can test it in vagrant and on ec2... and it's like doh wasn't that what chef was about? not having to create unneccesary complexity
[2012-08-10 05:18:01 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, ... no ... it's so you can wrap up the complexity behind a simple interface
[2012-08-10 05:19:16 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, here's my problem... I have to write a server that reads the mac address of the incoming interface and generate a preseed for that machine
[2012-08-10 05:19:39 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, let's start automating metal
[2012-08-10 05:19:53 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, stop with this waste of time and let's deal with real problems
[2012-08-10 05:20:19 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, feel free to automate metal; i'd rather let someone else do that for me
[2012-08-10 05:20:31 -0400] hoover_damm: and see that's the problem
[2012-08-10 05:21:03 -0400] hoover_damm: I remember automating metal back in 2010 and thinking to myself why are all theese goons wasting their time with this crap when they could be working with this stuff?
[2012-08-10 05:21:12 -0400] hoover_damm: and making the real hard stuff a real easy day?
[2012-08-10 05:21:50 -0400] hoover_damm: I can see people codign a webserver so they can do curl localhost:8080/?interfaces&target=eth0&action=add&ipaddress=10.1.1.1
[2012-08-10 05:22:08 -0400] hoover_damm: just because they can't open up a text file and edit /etc/network/interfaces
[2012-08-10 05:22:32 -0400] hoover_damm: these problems were here yesterday, there will be here tomorrow
[2012-08-10 05:23:17 -0400] hoover_damm: I really need to find irc.metalhosters.net where people actually know how to work with servers
[2012-08-10 05:23:21 -0400] hoover_damm: and not with apis
[2012-08-10 05:24:21 -0400] hoover_damm: we could have servers with apis if people had worked towards it
[2012-08-10 05:24:29 -0400] hoover_damm: instead they worked the other direction
[2012-08-10 05:25:21 -0400] yfeldblum: which is?
[2012-08-10 05:25:41 -0400] hoover_damm: stop spoonfeeding yourself and look around you
