[2012-08-01 17:12:57 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, chef is what makes our jobs easier and provides us enough time so we can wipe our buttocks in the day
[2012-08-01 17:13:00 -0400] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-08-01 17:13:11 -0400] roidrage: i wish, man!
[2012-08-01 17:13:21 -0400] roidrage: lots of code to write and customers to take care of in the mean time :)
[2012-08-01 17:13:26 -0400] hoover_damm: well I wish that I could automate our aptana bios's
[2012-08-01 17:13:28 -0400] hoover_damm: with chef
[2012-08-01 17:13:38 -0400] hoover_damm: i blame ami on that
[2012-08-01 17:13:52 -0400] hoover_damm: or supermicro
[2012-08-01 17:21:27 -0400] roidrage: haha, well, the setup step for new servers i also need to automate. it's an odd rescue system but it can be scripted :)
[2012-08-01 17:21:33 -0400] roidrage: hey, at least they're effing cheap :)
[2012-08-01 17:22:44 -0400] hoover_damm: we're pxe here
[2012-08-01 17:23:01 -0400] hoover_damm: our provider gives us multiple uplinks and full control
[2012-08-01 17:23:05 -0400] hoover_damm: ssh access into the console
[2012-08-01 17:23:12 -0400] hoover_damm: and we're saving over half the cost of amazon at the same time
[2012-08-01 17:29:03 -0400] roidrage: haha, my boxes are 83 EUR/month :)
[2012-08-01 17:30:35 -0400] roidrage: i like it that way, i like my continuous integration farm cheap :)
[2012-08-01 17:43:58 -0400] hoover_damm: oh we're paying about 200$ for a 4-core box with 8gigs of ram and 1tb of ram
[2012-08-01 17:44:01 -0400] hoover_damm: USD
[2012-08-01 17:44:05 -0400] hoover_damm: err 1tb of disk space sorry
[2012-08-01 17:44:48 -0400] roidrage: haha, 1tb ram would be awesome
[2012-08-01 17:45:01 -0400] roidrage: we have 16GB and a 240GB SSD included :)
[2012-08-01 17:45:47 -0400] roidrage: i'm not sure how i would enjoy hosting a site that needs to always be available on them, but they're pretty awesome to serve as our continuous integration farm
[2012-08-01 17:53:06 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, oh my graphite servers there are 4 and 8-disk 240GB OCZ Deneva 2's
[2012-08-01 17:53:14 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, i'm almost to 1million metrics
[2012-08-01 17:53:14 -0400] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-08-01 17:53:32 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, basically just custom supermicro servers as we want
[2012-08-01 17:53:44 -0400] roidrage: you so crazy!
[2012-08-01 17:53:46 -0400] hoover_damm: metal via api
[2012-08-01 17:53:50 -0400] roidrage: you're such a show-off too ;)
[2012-08-01 17:54:12 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, it's not me trying to show off, it's me trying to say that this honestly costs me 1/2 then what I used to host half of this on Amazon
[2012-08-01 17:54:24 -0400] roidrage: oh fo sure!
[2012-08-01 17:54:31 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, and there's a better way where you can actually be on the right side :)
[2012-08-01 17:54:45 -0400] hoover_damm: we replaced about 100k of ec2 infrastructure for less then 35k
[2012-08-01 17:59:01 -0400] roidrage: noice
[2012-08-01 18:02:13 -0400] hoover_damm: yep, something to be said to be paying > 100k to ec2 for hosting
[2012-08-01 18:02:30 -0400] hoover_damm: then again I got to look at what EY used to pay per month for EC2 for all their customers
[2012-08-01 18:02:34 -0400] hoover_damm: obviously mum is the word
[2012-08-01 18:02:35 -0400] hoover_damm: but wow
[2012-08-01 18:08:04 -0400] geekbri: There is no blanket answer for what host you should be using.  I think what you use for hosting is really strongly dependent on your requirements.
[2012-08-01 18:08:46 -0400] roidrage: yes
[2012-08-01 18:08:58 -0400] roidrage: all for it. we still host stuff on ec2 by way of heroku
[2012-08-01 18:08:59 -0400] roidrage: and it's fine
[2012-08-01 18:18:38 -0400] hoover_damm: People are willing to create technical debt with their hosting situation for various reason(s).  Instant satisfaction and being able to prop up some kind of basic infra is more or less why it wins
[2012-08-01 18:18:59 -0400] hoover_damm: you can create an account and and have the callback authorization done and have instances spun up in under 30minutes easily
[2012-08-01 18:19:40 -0400] hoover_damm: There's a great deal of NoOps or (we don't want to hire someone to manage it) and then that responsibility bleeds over to developers who will create the debt easily because they are trying to solve the problem
[2012-08-01 18:20:31 -0400] hoover_damm: and if your going to take people off of the cloud you need them to know how to manage your stuff off the cloud
[2012-08-01 18:20:45 -0400] hoover_damm: It was hard to find people to manage networks 4 years ago
[2012-08-01 18:20:51 -0400] hoover_damm: it's gotta be a lot harder now
[2012-08-01 18:21:07 -0400] hoover_damm: so to have someone step in and take over that whole part and manage it for you is a pleasure
[2012-08-01 18:21:48 -0400] hoover_damm: however it's technical debt
[2012-08-01 18:21:50 -0400] hoover_damm: just like anythiing else
[2012-08-01 18:21:59 -0400] hoover_damm: (or can be coined that way easily)
[2012-08-01 18:22:36 -0400] hoover_damm: it's a decision due to either lack of time, spending, etc etc you take a shorcut that can lead you to a harder scaling plan if murphy pops out and says gotcha!
[2012-08-01 18:23:28 -0400] hoover_damm: that technical debt hurts each organization differently because of how they build their product and scale it and try to work around limitations
[2012-08-01 18:23:42 -0400] hoover_damm: quite personal so the results are always different
[2012-08-01 18:30:09 -0400] roidrage: currently i can live with technical debt quite nicely. it gives us legroom to focus the business side
[2012-08-01 18:30:56 -0400] roidrage: well knowing that eventually we'll host all this ourselves, which is also because we'll be starting to use more "exotic" components which are hard to come by on platforms like heroku
[2012-08-01 18:34:32 -0400] hoover_damm: it's too bad that Heroku just doesn't step up and start offering more
[2012-08-01 18:34:41 -0400] hoover_damm: they're really in the position to just take the next step forward
[2012-08-01 18:34:46 -0400] hoover_damm: and add more
[2012-08-01 18:34:58 -0400] danp: like what?
[2012-08-01 18:34:59 -0400] bawt: like what is solr
[2012-08-01 18:35:37 -0400] hoover_damm: danp, well honestly now thinking about it, you'll prolly end up using the new instances that amazon released which might improve your offering alone?
[2012-08-01 18:36:02 -0400] hoover_damm: danp, I think what roidrage would love is the option of purchasing a Riak cluster and configuring it up to your Heroku app
[2012-08-01 18:36:05 -0400] hoover_damm: and such
[2012-08-01 18:36:28 -0400] hoover_damm: danp, btw hi :)
[2012-08-01 18:36:28 -0400] roidrage: i don't need riak, it's more things like zeromq or zookeeper ;)
[2012-08-01 18:36:34 -0400] danp: supz!
[2012-08-01 18:36:40 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, hosted zk?
[2012-08-01 18:36:55 -0400] hoover_damm: I bet things like 0mq would sing to danp
[2012-08-01 18:36:56 -0400] roidrage: is there such a thing?
[2012-08-01 18:37:52 -0400] hoover_damm: don't know, but I can't imagine why there can't be such a thing
[2012-08-01 18:38:35 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, https://github.com/halorgium/heroku-buildpack-zmq
[2012-08-01 18:38:44 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, looks like tim took care of zmq for you
[2012-08-01 18:39:12 -0400] hoover_damm: danp, not too much just enjoying life
[2012-08-01 18:39:23 -0400] hoover_damm: danp, all metal, tons of graphite and taking it slow
[2012-08-01 18:39:28 -0400] roidrage: problem with zmq on heroku is that it needs tcp to talk between components
[2012-08-01 18:40:14 -0400] danp: hoover_damm: cool. definitely check out tasseo and umpire if you haven't already
[2012-08-01 18:40:31 -0400] hoover_damm: danp, we're going to use umpire for sure
[2012-08-01 18:40:49 -0400] roidrage: <3 tasseo :)
[2012-08-01 18:40:59 -0400] hoover_damm: danp, i've kinda rejected the whole dashboard issue as I want people to fix the django app instead of crying about other stuff
[2012-08-01 18:41:17 -0400] hoover_damm: i've got our guys trained on it
[2012-08-01 18:41:36 -0400] hoover_damm: we tried getting them on graphiti and other stuff but it just didn't work
[2012-08-01 18:41:47 -0400] hoover_damm: prolly cuz i got em used to the django app too fast
[2012-08-01 18:41:57 -0400] hoover_damm: so when we went elsewhere it was like hey this was easier.
[2012-08-01 18:42:00 -0400] hoover_damm: let's stay
[2012-08-01 20:56:47 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, btw auto is wonky when both interfaces respond to dhcp
[2012-08-01 20:56:54 -0400] hoover_damm: on netcfg/chooseinterface=
[2012-08-01 20:57:16 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: really? I haven't had too much trouble yet
[2012-08-01 20:57:27 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, yeah it just told me the big fat ,,!!,,
[2012-08-01 20:57:53 -0400] mattray: both eth0 and eth1 are on dhcp networks. Of course, I don't turn on eth1 until after the bootstrap :/
[2012-08-01 20:59:16 -0400] hoover_damm: well I swap eth0/eth1 on the switches (vlan wise) too
[2012-08-01 20:59:20 -0400] hoover_damm: but meh
[2012-08-01 20:59:36 -0400] hoover_damm: easier to fix it in udev rules
[2012-08-01 21:00:38 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: my laziness: https://github.com/mattray/lab-repo/blob/master/cookbooks/labsetup/recipes/default.rb#L20

[2012-08-01 23:25:06 -0400] miah: i assume yes and that this is a derpy question
[2012-08-01 23:31:15 -0400] hoover_damm: you know derpy is truly the one word I could live without hearing ever again
[2012-08-01 23:31:44 -0400] hoover_damm: :/
[2012-08-01 23:32:13 -0400] miah: FINE BE THAT WAY
[2012-08-01 23:37:46 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, it was poisoned before you came on irc by an coworker that abused it heavily when I worked for EY
[2012-08-01 23:38:09 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, by the time I saw you online (as I was ignoring irc halfway) and saying it, it was already tarnished
[2012-08-01 23:39:22 -0400] sascha_d: fwiw, I love derp
[2012-08-01 23:40:49 -0400] miah: =)
[2012-08-01 23:40:56 -0400] miah: attribute :initial_state, :kind_of => [String, Array], :equal_to => %w(d f n r s u) :default => nil
[2012-08-01 23:40:59 -0400] miah: is that legal?
[2012-08-01 23:41:47 -0400] miah: and i guess respond_to lets me pass an array of other names that the attribute might be named? am i understanding that right?
[2012-08-01 23:42:55 -0400] hoover_damm: :equal_to (%w(d f n r s u) if it doesn't work
[2012-08-01 23:43:09 -0400] hoover_damm: does it not work?
[2012-08-01 23:43:12 -0400] hoover_damm: or are you ocd'ing?
[2012-08-01 23:44:04 -0400] miah: just curious if im wasting time :P
[2012-08-01 23:44:18 -0400] miah: dsl's mess with me
[2012-08-01 23:45:28 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, I view Chef as still early enough that you're overthinking it... give it 3-5 years and there will be enough courses to teach chef that focus on making cookbooks properly
[2012-08-01 23:46:00 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, but as long as it works should be the rule of thumb unless you want to be deadly accurate
[2012-08-01 23:46:17 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, there will always be someone with an opposing view to tell you to do it there way (imo)
[2012-08-01 23:46:33 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, and if you listen to everyone you'll just get drowned down in a sea of 'do it my way'
[2012-08-01 23:46:37 -0400] miah: i know
[2012-08-01 23:46:42 -0400] miah: i do things my way already
[2012-08-01 23:46:43 -0400] miah: :P
[2012-08-01 23:46:52 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, so I'm just trying to give you reinorcement saying your doing good
[2012-08-01 23:46:56 -0400] miah: ok
[2012-08-01 23:46:58 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, and don't overthink it
[2012-08-01 23:46:59 -0400] miah: thx
[2012-08-01 23:47:03 -0400] miah: ya
[2012-08-01 23:47:31 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, once you get to the point where you can throw away a cookbook and rewrite it from scratch and take half the time :)
[2012-08-01 23:47:41 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, that's when you just pat yourself on the back and keep working
[2012-08-01 23:49:16 -0400] miah: i do that already
[2012-08-01 23:49:30 -0400] miah: the points im still not great at are lwrp / providers / libraries
[2012-08-01 23:49:41 -0400] hoover_damm: the point is no one is
[2012-08-01 23:49:52 -0400] miah: i've been concentrating on writing full provider and resources as its helping reinforce what i've learned with ruby
[2012-08-01 23:50:03 -0400] miah: but i'm wasting time with nagios and a lwrp right now.. =)
[2012-08-01 23:50:06 -0400] hoover_damm: there are some that are quite good
[2012-08-01 23:50:23 -0400] hoover_damm: nagios is a tough cookie to crack
[2012-08-01 23:51:05 -0400] hoover_damm: DAMN! no build-dep
[2012-08-01 23:51:11 -0400] hoover_damm: fml fine i'll download the source
[2012-08-01 23:52:31 -0400] miah: ya
[2012-08-01 23:52:39 -0400] miah: i have all of the resources defined for hosts
