[2012-08-16 21:33:11 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: :D
[2012-08-16 21:33:17 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: the attributes for percona issue?
[2012-08-16 21:33:22 -0400] jtimberman: i was just looking at that ticket. COOK-1059 iirc.
[2012-08-16 21:33:35 -0400] c_t: jtimberman: yes
[2012-08-16 21:34:14 -0400] c_t: I'm in the process of climbing out of a deep pit filled with backlog
[2012-08-16 21:34:24 -0400] c_t: but my evenings are more free now at least
[2012-08-16 21:35:59 -0400] c_t: I think we're friends here, by and large
[2012-08-16 21:36:02 -0400] c_t: and it's IRC after all
[2012-08-16 21:36:24 -0400] c_t: So if you were curious *why* my evenings are free (and I'm sure you were), I finished my book
[2012-08-16 21:36:41 -0400] btm: c_t: was it good, were there vampires in it?
[2012-08-16 21:36:58 -0400] c_t: No vampires I'm afraid
[2012-08-16 21:37:21 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: you wrote a book?
[2012-08-16 21:37:25 -0400] c_t: I did.
[2012-08-16 21:37:29 -0400] jtimberman: cool!
[2012-08-16 21:37:31 -0400] c_t: I have an alternate Twitter account, you see
[2012-08-16 21:37:50 -0400] c_t: so a while back I felt inspired to write a book under that persona
[2012-08-16 21:37:56 -0400] c_t: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008RTTFJ8
[2012-08-16 21:38:20 -0400] c_t: The fact that I'm behind that account is kind of a secret, but I have told people
[2012-08-16 21:38:46 -0400] c_t: The main reason for the secrecy being that it's more entertaining if there's a mystery
[2012-08-16 21:40:37 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: Is this a fiction?
[2012-08-16 21:40:38 -0400] c_t: The fact that I wrote this post: http://www.seniorwhitehouseofficial.com/blog/2012/07/31/the-software-used-to-make-this-book/, however, probably gives away the fact that a real WH official probably didn't write the book
[2012-08-16 21:40:46 -0400] c_t: jtimberman: pile o' snark, mainly
[2012-08-16 21:40:53 -0400] jtimberman: Sweet.
[2012-08-16 21:40:55 -0400] jtimberman: I love snark
[2012-08-16 21:41:19 -0400] c_t: Much directed at Republicans, of course (what do you take me for?), but I give Dems a drubbing as needed as well
[2012-08-16 21:41:23 -0400] c_t: (largely for being weenies)
[2012-08-16 21:43:20 -0400] c_t: I conveniently collected excerpts up too at one point: http://www.seniorwhitehouseofficial.com/blog/2012/08/08/collecting-up-the-book-excerpts/
