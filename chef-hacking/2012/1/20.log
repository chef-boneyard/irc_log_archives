[2012-01-20 08:51:00 -0500] nico: anyone with some lwrp-fu ?
[2012-01-20 08:53:00 -0500] nico: I'd like to have some sort of instance var in a LWRP, tried @myvar in the initialize method of the resource but it does not seem to be the right way
[2012-01-20 12:09:00 -0500] laurent\: nico: the right way to do what ? where do you want to use it ?
[2012-01-20 12:09:00 -0500] laurent\: bad way could be @@class_var, but that would be very very wrong i think
[2012-01-20 12:16:00 -0500] nico: laurent\: I added a function in my provider to circumvent this, I call it instead of using a var
[2012-01-20 12:28:00 -0500] laurent\: nico: ok
[2012-01-20 12:29:00 -0500] nico: laurent\: hit a weird thing btw, a cookbook that don't get synchronized
[2012-01-20 12:30:00 -0500] nico: trying to find out what's going on
[2012-01-20 12:36:00 -0500] nico: ok, got
[2012-01-20 12:36:00 -0500] nico: upgraded chef from 0.10.0 to 0.10.8 and the error message is clearer
[2012-01-20 12:37:00 -0500] nico: explaining :
[2012-01-20 12:38:00 -0500] nico: I use a template in a provider for my "sysctl" LWRP (cookbook is 'sysctl')
[2012-01-20 12:38:00 -0500] nico: but I use this in a recipe 'tests::sysctl'
[2012-01-20 12:38:00 -0500] nico: (calling sysctl_value 'foo' do ... end )
[2012-01-20 12:39:00 -0500] nico: and chef looks for the template in the "tests" cookbook, not in the sysctl one, as excepted
[2012-01-20 12:41:00 -0500] nico: should it be considered as a bug or is there a way to specify to use the "sysctl" cookbook as the source ? knowing that templates from the sysctl cookbook are _not_ downloaded to client (probably because not used in the sysctl default recipe, which is just empty)
[2012-01-20 12:46:00 -0500] nico: expected*
[2012-01-20 15:19:00 -0500] schisamo: nico: where is the source for the sysctl cookbook?  I don't see an LWRP in either of the community cookbooks.
[2012-01-20 15:19:00 -0500] nico: I write :)
[2012-01-20 15:19:00 -0500] nico: +it
[2012-01-20 15:20:00 -0500] schisamo: aww...got it.
[2012-01-20 15:21:00 -0500] schisamo: so you probably just want to add an attribute to your LWRP that allows you to specify the cookbook and pass that value down to the template resoruce in the LWRP
[2012-01-20 15:21:00 -0500] nico: How can I specify this ?
[2012-01-20 15:21:00 -0500] schisamo: in a template resource?
[2012-01-20 15:21:00 -0500] nico: I looked at some code but found nothing that helped me
[2012-01-20 15:22:00 -0500] schisamo: or in your LWRP?
[2012-01-20 15:22:00 -0500] schisamo: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Template
[2012-01-20 15:22:00 -0500] nico: oh
[2012-01-20 15:22:00 -0500] nico: so simple :(
[2012-01-20 15:22:00 -0500] nico: sorry for the noise :/
[2012-01-20 15:25:00 -0500] schisamo: naw man...gotta learn somehow.  so a good example is jtimberman 's daemontools_service LWRP....does the same thing.  resource => http://git.io/u2RZnA , provider => http://git.io/eBnKIw
