[2012-01-04 13:01:00 -0500] nico: hey hackers
[2012-01-04 13:02:00 -0500] nico: is there a way to "overload" package ?
[2012-01-04 13:02:00 -0500] nico: I mean :
[2012-01-04 13:02:00 -0500] nico: when we install stuff with package "foo" do .... end on freebsd, we need to have proxy set for the pkgadd provider
[2012-01-04 13:03:00 -0500] nico: but I would like to have set only for this action, and unset after install is done

[2012-01-04 17:20:00 -0500] thom: it would be really nice to have OR'able dependencies in cookbooks so I'd not have to have any bloody runit cookbooks anywhere (or "recommends")
[2012-01-04 17:29:00 -0500] ssd7: thom: Yes.  I think coderanger has talked about such a feature as well.
[2012-01-04 17:30:00 -0500] coderanger: thom: Optional deps are on the list for Chef 11
[2012-01-04 17:30:00 -0500] thom: score
[2012-01-04 17:31:00 -0500] thom: the one thing i really miss from ubuntu are blueprints; it'd be a great way to communicate this kinda stuff
[2012-01-04 17:31:00 -0500] thom: also a really good way to solicit community hacking and involvement
[2012-01-04 17:37:00 -0500] yfeldblum: silly CLA requirement
[2012-01-04 19:00:00 -0500] Damm: CLA is easy
[2012-01-04 19:00:00 -0500] Damm: I don't know why anyone would think it's hard
[2012-01-04 19:01:00 -0500] jtimberman: Damm: more often than not, the issue is in getting permission from one's employer.
[2012-01-04 19:03:00 -0500] Damm: jtimberman, that should fall into a CCLA then if it requires an employers permission
[2012-01-04 19:03:00 -0500] Damm: just for clarity
[2012-01-04 19:03:00 -0500] jtimberman: some companies aren't willing to sign the ccla.
[2012-01-04 19:03:00 -0500] Damm: CLA should be just for you; CCLA should be for if your working and your company has to sign off
[2012-01-04 19:03:00 -0500] Damm: yeah it's because they don't understand how the world works
[2012-01-04 19:03:00 -0500] Damm: and they're willing to fall on themselves to prove a point
[2012-01-04 19:03:00 -0500] Damm: kinda hard to beat that no?
[2012-01-04 19:08:00 -0500] yfeldblum: general relativity is also how the world works; it's nevertheless like to be very difficult to explain general relativity to your (non-theoretical-physicist) boss
[2012-01-04 19:10:00 -0500] yfeldblum: the point being, managers will often not be writing software, and therefore will often not be aware how integrated with and dependent on free or open-source software their internal systems actually are, and how deeply free and open-source software depend, and likewise internal systems depend, for their correctness and performance on in-house contributions to those projects
[2012-01-04 19:31:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: I wanted $work to sign the CCLA...  Until $boss was finally like, I don't they're going to sign it, just do it as a personal CLA.
