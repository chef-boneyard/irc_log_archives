[2012-11-11 00:40:46 -0500] cwj: sascha_d: maybe http://rubydoc.info/gems/chef/0.10.4/Chef/REST
[2012-11-11 00:42:36 -0500] cwj: or rather https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/rest.rb
[2012-11-11 00:43:52 -0500] cwj: i guess thats where id expect to see rest-client
[2012-11-11 00:53:32 -0500] sascha_d: @cwj I assumed he meant something other than the Chef::REST client
[2012-11-11 20:41:24 -0500] kallistec: sascha_d: sorry for the late reply, but yeah I meant 'restclient' aka 'rest-client' aka 'rest_client' (early versions of the gem used all of these variations in different places
[2012-11-11 20:46:42 -0500] erikh: w/ 2
[2012-11-11 21:21:12 -0500] sascha_d: thanks @kallistec
[2012-11-11 21:22:07 -0500] sascha_d: @fnichol are you around at all? or anyone who wants to talk about chef-rvm and gemsets?
