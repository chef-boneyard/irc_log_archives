[2012-11-12 13:02:04 -0500] nacer: knife cookbook site download mysql does not propose the last version of the cookbook
[2012-11-12 15:11:04 -0500] jtimberman: nacer: 1.3.0 *is* the latest version of the cookbook.
[2012-11-12 15:11:34 -0500] jtimberman: though there are changes in the repository that need to be released :)
[2012-11-12 15:14:14 -0500] nacer: jtimberman: it's weird because on community mysql 1.3.0 is online
[2012-11-12 15:14:44 -0500] nacer: jtimberman: but for knife command it's not
[2012-11-12 15:14:58 -0500] nacer: jtimberman: perhaps api data are outdated
[2012-11-12 15:21:55 -0500] jtimberman: nacer: it pulls it directly from the database containing the latest version: https://gist.github.com/4059938
[2012-11-12 15:23:11 -0500] nacer: jtimberman: ohhhh my bad
[2012-11-12 15:23:29 -0500] nacer: jtimberman: i am ashamed
[2012-11-12 15:23:38 -0500] nacer: jtimberman: forget the "site" part :)
[2012-11-12 15:23:46 -0500] nacer: in my knife command
[2012-11-12 15:25:48 -0500] jtimberman: nacer: ahh :-)
[2012-11-12 15:26:14 -0500] jtimberman: don't be ashamed! i forget the second 'o' in cookbook all the time, myself ;).
[2012-11-12 16:26:21 -0500] nacer: Mmmm what can make a restart action from a init script fail with chef-client but work by hand
[2012-11-12 16:28:19 -0500] nacer: if my stop make a exit  chef-client can catch it and stop runnin the service mydaemin restart in the middle ?
[2012-11-12 16:28:48 -0500] nacer: my daemon is always stop, but never start
[2012-11-12 17:01:41 -0500] nacer: ok SIGHOME
[2012-11-12 18:48:19 -0500] miah: whats going on with COOK-1857?
[2012-11-12 19:07:24 -0500] jhulten: Hey all. I am looking at the application cookbook and wondering if I can extend it to use a zip file from nexus or artifactory as its deploy resource instead of svn or git. Not sure the best way to proceed.  Thought?
[2012-11-12 20:12:20 -0500] jtimberman: miah: haven't gotten to it in the review meetings yet
[2012-11-12 20:39:13 -0500] miah: jtimberman: ok. your bug is blocking me =)
[2012-11-12 20:39:14 -0500] miah: :P
[2012-11-12 20:39:30 -0500] miah: (we forked and included that fix really, but still)
[2012-11-12 22:38:54 -0500] jtimberman: miah: the lvm one ?
[2012-11-12 22:39:25 -0500] jtimberman: miah: does the fix in the pull request fix it for you?
[2012-11-12 22:39:43 -0500] miah: yes
[2012-11-12 22:39:58 -0500] miah: the callback requires that 'location' be a string, then the provider requires it to be a symbol.
[2012-11-12 22:40:07 -0500] miah: if i make it a symbol, it doesn't make it through the callback
[2012-11-12 22:40:25 -0500] miah: that patch fixes it
[2012-11-12 22:40:41 -0500] jtimberman: ok
[2012-11-12 22:41:01 -0500] miah: tanks
[2012-11-12 22:42:28 -0500] jtimberman: pretty sure the right thing is to make :kind_of => Hash into :kind_of => Mash :)
[2012-11-12 22:42:55 -0500] miah: that would work too
[2012-11-12 22:43:03 -0500] jtimberman: anyway, i'll merge this if you've confirmed its working.
[2012-11-12 22:43:05 -0500] miah: but then the callback would still need to be changed
[2012-11-12 22:43:22 -0500] miah: because allowing it to be a mash, then having a callback check to see if its a string is fail
[2012-11-12 22:43:43 -0500] miah: maybe ill look at it again when i have time
[2012-11-12 22:43:45 -0500] miah: but i dont now =)
[2012-11-12 22:44:15 -0500] jtimberman: yeah its cool
[2012-11-12 22:44:16 -0500] jtimberman: merged
[2012-11-12 22:44:32 -0500] erikh: jtimberman: thx
[2012-11-12 22:44:36 -0500] jtimberman: i'm gonna run off again
[2012-11-12 22:44:39 -0500] jtimberman: :D
[2012-11-12 22:45:27 -0500] miah: jtimberman: also, can you upload the new revision to community site?
[2012-11-12 22:45:33 -0500] miah: the tarball there is still version 0.7
[2012-11-12 22:45:37 -0500] miah: which doesn't even have the LWRP
[2012-11-12 22:45:56 -0500] miah: TANKS IN ADVANCE
[2012-11-12 22:54:07 -0500] jtimberman: miah: will tomrrow
