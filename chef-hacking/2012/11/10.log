[2012-11-10 16:11:09 -0500] github-bawt: omnibus-chef/master 04ba2da Seth Chisamore: bootstrap should always notify Erchef to restart...
[2012-11-10 17:49:25 -0500] sascha_d: I'm trying to work with http_request in order to get my devs to stop using bashblock/curl patterns; Chef is sending a content-length header with a GET request and mod_security requests that it diaf
[2012-11-10 17:49:34 -0500] sascha_d: anyone know how I can override this behavior?
[2012-11-10 17:49:52 -0500] sascha_d: I've been poking at the rest code in chef a bit but I don't really know what I'm doing
[2012-11-10 17:55:50 -0500] ssd7: sascha_d: Don't know off the top of my head, but I can poke around a bit.
[2012-11-10 17:56:25 -0500] sascha_d: I can gist you the tcpdump packet if you're curious
[2012-11-10 17:57:11 -0500] sascha_d: and I'm not sure passing a length of zero will entirely fix me as I'm sending a query_string in the url
[2012-11-10 17:57:17 -0500] sascha_d: but it works with a browser and it works with curl
[2012-11-10 17:59:41 -0500] ssd7: From what I can see in the chef source, the intention at least was to not sent content-length
[2012-11-10 18:01:41 -0500] sascha_d: oo! I got it.  At least to set the content-length to zero
[2012-11-10 18:01:51 -0500] sascha_d: my crap still no werky but that's not shocking
[2012-11-10 18:01:56 -0500] sascha_d: I guess
[2012-11-10 18:02:13 -0500] ssd7: s/sent/set/
[2012-11-10 18:03:08 -0500] sascha_d: at least I can go back to mod_security now and say HEY
[2012-11-10 18:03:25 -0500] ssd7: :D
[2012-11-10 18:03:29 -0500] sascha_d: and then I think, maybe we should all just give up and write curl bash blocks
[2012-11-10 18:03:39 -0500] sascha_d: this was not the weekend project I envisioned
[2012-11-10 18:05:49 -0500] ssd7: heh, yeah, it is interesting that you were seeing the content-length header at all for a GET request
[2012-11-10 18:16:07 -0500] sascha_d: ok
[2012-11-10 18:16:21 -0500] sascha_d: it was a combo of content-length and accept application/json
[2012-11-10 18:16:26 -0500] sascha_d: OH AND
[2012-11-10 18:16:45 -0500] sascha_d: in the http_request provider, the url is formatted to be ?message=#{message}
[2012-11-10 18:16:51 -0500] sascha_d: I had to delete the message= bits
[2012-11-10 18:17:08 -0500] sascha_d: I don't know how much of this is us and our annoying mod_security stuff
[2012-11-10 18:17:25 -0500] sascha_d: so I'm not positive it's the chef code's fault
[2012-11-10 18:18:04 -0500] sascha_d: I'm going to reinstall my chef now and see what changes I actually need to make to get stuff working
[2012-11-10 18:34:59 -0500] ssd7: sascha_d: I might be interested in seeing that dump actually.  I don't see a content-length header being sent on GET
[2012-11-10 18:35:34 -0500] sascha_d: I might have been looking at the response with that actually. I'm reviewing my work now that I've found a hack that gave me what I wanted
[2012-11-10 18:36:08 -0500] sascha_d: I think I was just trying so many different things and then managed to look at the response from the web proxy instead of the request from my laptop;
[2012-11-10 18:36:26 -0500] sascha_d: the only issues I can see right now are the message formatting and the application/json accept header
[2012-11-10 18:37:02 -0500] ssd7: I see.  Well that's good, seems like progress
[2012-11-10 18:37:19 -0500] sascha_d: :)
[2012-11-10 18:37:32 -0500] sascha_d: mod_security = security theater
[2012-11-10 18:37:41 -0500] sascha_d: welcome to the Enterprise
[2012-11-10 18:38:20 -0500] sascha_d: I think it would just be nice if we could override some of these header values instead of not allowing it
[2012-11-10 18:38:26 -0500] sascha_d: that might solve some problems
[2012-11-10 18:51:30 -0500] yfeldblum: sascha_d, the http_request resource looks extremely odd to me ... i'm not quite sure what it's for exactly, but you'll probably need a lot more control than what it gives you anyway ...
[2012-11-10 18:52:03 -0500] sascha_d: yeah.There are hundreds of curl bash blocks in our code base where our devs are fetching stuff from artifactory
[2012-11-10 18:52:13 -0500] sascha_d: I was hoping to make something pretty for them
[2012-11-10 18:52:33 -0500] yfeldblum: sascha_d, better to make http head/get requests with normal ruby, and to make http put/delete/post requests in ruby_block resources
[2012-11-10 18:53:10 -0500] yfeldblum: sascha_d, and you can provide wrapper methods in your own library around e.g. net/http (which is ruby stdlib) or your favorite http-client gem
[2012-11-10 18:53:14 -0500] sascha_d: I'd like to write a resource, but I was hoping to start with something that didn't require me to write my own connection code
[2012-11-10 18:53:31 -0500] yfeldblum: sascha_d, http requests don't seem to me to be resources
[2012-11-10 18:53:41 -0500] sascha_d: really? Because they're on the resource page
[2012-11-10 18:53:57 -0500] sascha_d: and they have resource/provider code
[2012-11-10 18:54:06 -0500] yfeldblum: sascha_d, there's an http_resource thing, sure, but it seems to me to be a very weird non-resource resource
[2012-11-10 18:54:27 -0500] sascha_d: well it's certainly a non-helpful resource for me
[2012-11-10 18:54:51 -0500] yfeldblum: sascha_d, it also seems to have limited functionality but expansive assumptions
[2012-11-10 18:54:59 -0500] sascha_d: yep
[2012-11-10 18:55:21 -0500] yfeldblum: sascha_d, best bet is show your devs how to use normal, honest, straight-up ruby ... because recipes are ruby ...
[2012-11-10 18:55:32 -0500] ssd7: yeah, I'm not sure what most people use http_request for in its current state
[2012-11-10 18:55:43 -0500] yfeldblum: sascha_d, how to use net/http directly, for example, to perform http requests
[2012-11-10 18:55:45 -0500] sascha_d: One of them was already going down that path, but 100 others have already written curl bash blocks
[2012-11-10 18:56:12 -0500] sascha_d: I'd like to get started on a resource for this stuff but it keeps ending up in our perm backlog
[2012-11-10 18:56:20 -0500] yfeldblum: sascha_d, but replacing one broken technique with another broken technique isn't helpful
[2012-11-10 18:56:31 -0500] sascha_d: I didn't say it was what I wanted
[2012-11-10 18:56:36 -0500] sascha_d: I'm saying it's what's there
[2012-11-10 18:56:45 -0500] yfeldblum: sascha_d, teaching someone to fish (use net/http) is helpful
[2012-11-10 18:56:52 -0500] sascha_d: 100's of developers
[2012-11-10 18:56:54 -0500] sascha_d: 1 of me
[2012-11-10 18:57:01 -0500] sascha_d: I'm working on it
[2012-11-10 18:57:26 -0500] sascha_d: also, ifI were just a Chef Therapist it might work better, but I'm on a tools team that does more than chef
[2012-11-10 18:57:35 -0500] sascha_d: our backlog stretches into infinity
[2012-11-10 18:58:14 -0500] sascha_d: and we have lots of legacy chef stretching back to .8 days; someone asked me the other day why we have a couple differnt chef-client cookbooks and I said, I wrote our chef-client cookbook before there WAS one
[2012-11-10 18:58:22 -0500] yfeldblum: sascha_d, you can provide simple methods in a cookbook library that accomplish things too, e.g. which use net/http under the hood, or any other http client
[2012-11-10 18:59:32 -0500] yfeldblum: sascha_d, proper abstractions help solve that problem
[2012-11-10 18:59:34 -0500] sascha_d: I'd planned to spend my weekend playing with test kitchen and instead ended up flailing at http_request. It's an imperfect world.
[2012-11-10 19:00:03 -0500] yfeldblum: sascha_d, yep, running up against the problems inherent in using the wrong tool for the job ><
[2012-11-10 19:00:56 -0500] sascha_d: and yes, there are lots of things I can do to help people with our chef; when our openstack cluster is not having massive fails from kernel bugs
[2012-11-10 19:01:13 -0500] sascha_d: or holiday prep of dev teams doesn't result in constant requests for help/work on jenkins
[2012-11-10 19:01:47 -0500] sascha_d: or we don't suddenly discover that we need more things in place to support some critical systems for holiday in two weeks
[2012-11-10 19:02:09 -0500] yfeldblum: sascha_d, yeah ...
[2012-11-10 19:03:00 -0500] sascha_d: I'd rather do chef.  All the time. It's my favorite part of my job. Someone else should do all that annoying sysadminy crap. But somehow
[2012-11-10 19:10:42 -0500] kallistec: sascha_d: chef uses restclient in a few places, it has a pretty easy interface
[2012-11-10 19:11:16 -0500] kallistec: I'd probably start there if you need a LWRP *now* to work around some issue
[2012-11-10 19:11:35 -0500] sascha_d: good to know. I think I'm going to start from scratch-ish on an artifactory resource
[2012-11-10 19:39:23 -0500] sascha_d: @kallistec do you mean this? https://rubygems.org/gems/rest-client
[2012-11-10 20:57:36 -0500] miah: sup
[2012-11-10 23:13:48 -0500] yfeldblum: sup
[2012-11-10 23:29:16 -0500] atomic-penguin: soup
