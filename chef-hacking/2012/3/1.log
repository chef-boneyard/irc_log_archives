[2012-03-01 15:45:00 -0500] roidrage: jtimberman: thanks for http://jtimberman.posterous.com/debianubuntu-package-for-ruby-192-with-fpm
[2012-03-01 15:45:00 -0500] roidrage: currently helping me a lot ;)
[2012-03-01 15:48:00 -0500] renchap: 1.9.2 is so old
[2012-03-01 15:50:00 -0500] roidrage: well, the version isn't what matters, but thanks for pointing it out
[2012-03-01 15:50:00 -0500] renchap: in fact, chef + freebsd + 1.9.2 causes segfaults :)
[2012-03-01 15:52:00 -0500] nico: I second renchap, lots of problems with 1.9.2
[2012-03-01 15:52:00 -0500] roidrage: why are you guys so hung up on that version?
[2012-03-01 15:52:00 -0500] roidrage: i just want to bundle ruby
[2012-03-01 15:58:00 -0500] roidrage: and while i may have issues, i've been running it in production just fine, serving rails and other ruby apps
[2012-03-01 15:59:00 -0500] renchap: i was just pointing out that 1.9.2 caused us problems with chef
[2012-03-01 15:59:00 -0500] renchap: and that is you were building your own ruby packages, you should use 1.9.3
[2012-03-01 15:59:00 -0500] roidrage: did you look at the link?
[2012-03-01 16:00:00 -0500] roidrage: did you realize it uses 1.9.3? ;)
[2012-03-01 16:00:00 -0500] hoover_damm: if you need omnibus with 1.9.3
[2012-03-01 16:00:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I can point you to a repo
[2012-03-01 16:01:00 -0500] roidrage: okay then
[2012-03-01 16:01:00 -0500] renchap: it uses 1.9.3-p0, which has a security bug !
[2012-03-01 16:01:00 -0500] roidrage: oh noes!
[2012-03-01 16:02:00 -0500] renchap: the hackerz are in your servar!
[2012-03-01 16:02:00 -0500] roidrage: i think renchap must consider me a total n00b
[2012-03-01 16:02:00 -0500] roidrage: thanks! ;)
[2012-03-01 16:02:00 -0500] renchap: i think that i need to sleep :(
[2012-03-01 16:03:00 -0500] roidrage: <3 fpm
[2012-03-01 16:03:00 -0500] renchap: agreed
[2012-03-01 16:03:00 -0500] roidrage: and wouldn't you know it, i apckaged 1.9.3-p125
[2012-03-01 16:04:00 -0500] roidrage: you happy now?
[2012-03-01 16:04:00 -0500] renchap: very
[2012-03-01 16:05:00 -0500] roidrage: silly renchap
[2012-03-01 16:05:00 -0500] renchap: you dont even imagine
[2012-03-01 16:05:00 -0500] renchap: AND
[2012-03-01 16:06:00 -0500] renchap: iam french
[2012-03-01 16:06:00 -0500] roidrage: that explains a lot
[2012-03-01 16:25:00 -0500] jtimberman: roidrage: cool... the posterous blog is old and busted and you should use the housepub.org one :)
[2012-03-01 16:26:00 -0500] jtimberman: roidrage: but its cool, i don't plan to take the posterous stuff down...
[2012-03-01 16:27:00 -0500] hoover_damm: https://github.com/damm/omnibus/tree/CHEF-2871
[2012-03-01 16:27:00 -0500] hoover_damm: 1.9.3-p125 + libyaml
[2012-03-01 16:27:00 -0500] hoover_damm: on omnibus
[2012-03-01 16:29:00 -0500] roidrage: jtimberman: housepub down for me?
[2012-03-01 16:30:00 -0500] jtimberman: roidrage: http://jtimberman.housepub.org/
[2012-03-01 16:30:00 -0500] jtimberman: i hope its not down ever, since its on github pages :)
[2012-03-01 16:30:00 -0500] roidrage: ah
[2012-03-01 16:30:00 -0500] jtimberman: many humble apologies for not making that more clear.
[2012-03-01 16:30:00 -0500] jtimberman: :)
[2012-03-01 16:30:00 -0500] hoover_damm: it's just slow sometimes
[2012-03-01 16:30:00 -0500] hoover_damm: blame github not jtimberman now
[2012-03-01 16:30:00 -0500] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-03-01 16:31:00 -0500] jtimberman: :D
[2012-03-01 16:31:00 -0500] jtimberman: yeah i'm not going to optimise that shit
[2012-03-01 16:31:00 -0500] jtimberman: :D
[2012-03-01 16:41:00 -0500] roidrage: why does rvm hate the environment so much?
[2012-03-01 16:43:00 -0500] cwj: try rbenv?
[2012-03-01 16:50:00 -0500] roidrage: this had rvm on a server
[2012-03-01 16:50:00 -0500] roidrage: which i hate more than anything else ;)
[2012-03-01 16:50:00 -0500] roidrage: i'm using rbenv on my dev machine
[2012-03-01 16:50:00 -0500] roidrage: and replace ruby on the server with a deb package ;)
[2012-03-01 17:43:00 -0500] c_t: for the love of god
[2012-03-01 17:43:00 -0500] c_t: way too much news lately
[2012-03-01 17:50:00 -0500] hoover_damm: that felt soo good to rvm implode
[2012-03-01 17:50:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I love nuking rvm
[2012-03-01 19:08:00 -0500] mattray: hoover_damm: rbenv?
[2012-03-01 19:09:00 -0500] mattray: I cannot get osx to symlink llvm-gcc-4.2
[2012-03-01 19:09:00 -0500] mattray: which means I can't get osx to build ruby for rbenv
[2012-03-01 19:13:00 -0500] mattray: even copy doesn't work.
[2012-03-01 19:14:00 -0500] mattray: well, the perms where still 700 after the cp, 755 now
[2012-03-01 19:15:00 -0500] mattray:  /usr/llvm-gcc-4.2/bin/gcc-4.2 is 755
[2012-03-01 19:15:00 -0500] mattray: and if I symlink it, it turns back into 700
[2012-03-01 19:36:00 -0500] hoover_damm: mattray, nah just brew
[2012-03-01 19:37:00 -0500] hoover_damm: the whole multiple ruby game is ... boring
[2012-03-01 19:37:00 -0500] hoover_damm: tiresome
[2012-03-01 19:37:00 -0500] hoover_damm: gruling
[2012-03-01 19:37:00 -0500] mattray: now my brew is hosed
[2012-03-01 19:37:00 -0500] cwj: here smell this rag
[2012-03-01 19:38:00 -0500] hoover_damm: how'd you hose brew? or how can we help you unhose it?
[2012-03-01 19:39:00 -0500] mattray: I was trying to reinstall it
[2012-03-01 19:40:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so reinstall it again?
[2012-03-01 19:40:00 -0500] mattray: yeah, that's where I am now
[2012-03-01 19:41:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I mean short of bin/brew you can nuke /usr/local/Library
[2012-03-01 19:42:00 -0500] mattray: for some reason homebrew won't build
[2012-03-01 19:42:00 -0500] mattray: which makes me think my system ruby is hosed
[2012-03-01 19:47:00 -0500] github-bawt: [chef] jkeiser pushed 1 new commit to win32_functional_tests: http://git.io/H6CEEQ
[2012-03-01 19:47:00 -0500] github-bawt: [chef/win32_functional_tests] Better test descriptions, remove some cruft - John Keiser
[2012-03-01 19:57:00 -0500] hoover_damm: :(
[2012-03-01 20:21:00 -0500] mattray: homebrew resurrected from timemachine :-\
[2012-03-01 20:28:00 -0500] c_t: I suppose the sensible thing would be to remove macports & fink, but I'm not entirely sure there aren't things I need lurking there
[2012-03-01 20:29:00 -0500] mattray: so now I'm back to rbenv insists it can't build because I don't have gcc
[2012-03-01 20:30:00 -0500] mattray: or, better, "a suitable gcc"
[2012-03-01 20:31:00 -0500] c_t: is its path weird?
[2012-03-01 20:31:00 -0500] mattray:  /usr/bin/gcc weird?
[2012-03-01 20:31:00 -0500] c_t: it doesn't seem weird to me, no
[2012-03-01 20:31:00 -0500] c_t: just wondering if it's not looking there maybe
[2012-03-01 20:31:00 -0500] c_t: (for some ungodly reason)
[2012-03-01 20:32:00 -0500] hoover_damm: is it possible to load data bags in an attribute file?
[2012-03-01 20:52:00 -0500] mattray: nothing like patching ruby-build to get stuff done
[2012-03-01 21:56:00 -0500] c_t: holoway: I saw Maiden when they came to the Tacoma Dome in 2000
[2012-03-01 21:56:00 -0500] c_t: it was fucking *AWESOME*
[2012-03-01 21:57:00 -0500] c_t: I wore a mullet wig to the show too
[2012-03-01 22:00:00 -0500] c_t: a black one, even
[2012-03-01 22:01:00 -0500] c_t: didn't exactly go with the red sideburns, but still
[2012-03-01 22:07:00 -0500] hoover_damm: hrm
[2012-03-01 22:07:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so am I doing the impossible?
[2012-03-01 22:12:00 -0500] hoover_damm: https://gist.github.com/f650503c7eb3ca705884
[2012-03-01 22:12:00 -0500] hoover_damm: or shall I ask this in #chef instead?
