[2012-03-14 15:32:00 -0400] laurent\: btm: i haven't reopened OHAI-325 but i've provided a proof of concept, can you look at the comments and tell me what you reckon please ?
[2012-03-14 15:33:00 -0400] laurent\: i don't that should be addressed in a new ticket, the ipaddress selection is wrong when using iproute2
[2012-03-14 15:33:00 -0400] laurent\: i don't think*
[2012-03-14 16:53:00 -0400] btm: laurent\: Chef 0.10.10 is probably a month or two behind whenever we get this Ohai out. (it has commits that depend on some changes in here)
[2012-03-14 17:07:00 -0400] roidrage: when is chef 1.0 due?
[2012-03-14 17:07:00 -0400] roidrage: ;)
[2012-03-14 17:12:00 -0400] btm: roidrage: Chef 11.0.0 is due 2nd half of the year. :)
[2012-03-14 17:13:00 -0400] roidrage: 11.0.0?
[2012-03-14 17:16:00 -0400] lusis: 9000.11
[2012-03-14 17:19:00 -0400] roidrage: just crazy, almost three years since i first touched chef, and it's still not at 1.0 ;)
[2012-03-14 17:26:00 -0400] roidrage: oh how time flies

[2012-03-14 18:21:00 -0400] ampledata: oh man
[2012-03-14 18:21:00 -0400] ampledata: jt: GOOD JOB
[2012-03-14 18:23:00 -0400] atomic-penguin: jtimberman, so do we have to fork 200 cookbooks, or is there a way to do this with git submodules?
[2012-03-14 18:26:00 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, are you using 200 cookbooks?
[2012-03-14 18:27:00 -0400] yfeldblum: roidrage, gmail.
[2012-03-14 18:27:00 -0400] atomic-penguin: yfeldblum, I often refer to the cookbooks/master branch as a coding reference.  Its quite handy to be able to git grep the whole codebase
[2012-03-14 18:28:00 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, you can certainly script that
[2012-03-14 18:28:00 -0400] roidrage: gmail? wut?
[2012-03-14 18:28:00 -0400] jtimberman: atomic-penguin: I haven't written up anything yet.
[2012-03-14 18:29:00 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, script something that clones/pulls everything from github.com/opscode-cookbooks into a directory
[2012-03-14 18:30:00 -0400] jtimberman: the github API provides a lot of awesome.
[2012-03-14 18:32:00 -0400] roidrage: i'm still confused by gmail
[2012-03-14 18:32:00 -0400] roidrage: Y U GMAIL!
[2012-03-14 18:34:00 -0400] StormSilver: jtimberman: YOU provide a lot of awesome...
[2012-03-14 18:34:00 -0400] roidrage: i think yfeldblum will forever leave me in the dark about gmail :)
[2012-03-14 18:35:00 -0400] yfeldblum: roidrage, gmail was "beta" for a while
[2012-03-14 18:35:00 -0400] roidrage: ah
[2012-03-14 18:35:00 -0400] roidrage: sure, that doesn't mean chef still has to be below 1.0 though
[2012-03-14 18:37:00 -0400] yfeldblum: maybe chef isn't ready for 1.0 yet because it's missing <insert-missing-feature-here>?
[2012-03-14 18:37:00 -0400] StormSilver: yfeldblum: Man I can't believe that feature hasn't been made yet
[2012-03-14 18:38:00 -0400] roidrage: i've been waiting for that feature for almost three years
[2012-03-14 18:38:00 -0400] roidrage: it's time
[2012-03-14 18:38:00 -0400] roidrage: btm: ship it!
[2012-03-14 18:38:00 -0400] roidrage: ;)
