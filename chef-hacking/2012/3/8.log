[2012-03-08 15:58:00 -0500] btm: renchap: kallistec is probably the expert on the solr schema. afaik he has done most of the work interfacing with it.
[2012-03-08 15:59:00 -0500] renchap: too bad i cant go to chefcon
[2012-03-08 15:59:00 -0500] renchap: to talk about it
[2012-03-08 15:59:00 -0500] renchap: but, really, our lead dev helped me debug this, and he is quite horrified :)
[2012-03-08 16:00:00 -0500] renchap: at least we found  the problem, and now search returns the correct number of nodes
[2012-03-08 16:00:00 -0500] btm: renchap: I really need someone we can hire on a contract to work on CHEF-2346. You're encouraged to recommend someone. :)
[2012-03-08 16:01:00 -0500] renchap: you mean, to switch away from solr to elasticsearch ?
[2012-03-08 16:01:00 -0500] renchap: we may be ready to fund this :D
[2012-03-08 16:05:00 -0500] btm: renchap: I'm not well enough informed to make a design decision there. I thought Andrea Campi's refactoring for CloudFoundry in CHEF-2650 might have been of help there but it looks like it is just to use an external solr service. We've talked in the past about how we have shot ourselves in the foot a little bit by exposing the solr search syntax but I believe we have been building an API layer there with the chef-expander work that kallistec did.
[2012-03-08 16:06:00 -0500] renchap: i dont say the contraty
[2012-03-08 16:06:00 -0500] renchap: but the solr schema, with all attributes in a big text field, is very unelegant
[2012-03-08 16:06:00 -0500] renchap: + solr is really behind elasticsearch regarding easiness, replication, clustering, ...
[2012-03-08 16:06:00 -0500] btm: If you have a proposal in mind you should definitely email it to the chef-dev list. If there's something you have in mind involving a business relationship you can email me directly at btm@opscode.com.
[2012-03-08 16:07:00 -0500] btm: We're all supportive of digging ourselves out of that hole a bit but we don't have internal resources to do so in the near future.
[2012-03-08 16:08:00 -0500] renchap: the main problem that i have is that we contribute a patch to switch to elasticsearch, or something else, it will not be accepted, because it have a lot of implications on your side (hosted chef & such)
[2012-03-08 16:08:00 -0500] renchap: imo it must come from opscode to be really implemented
[2012-03-08 16:09:00 -0500] renchap: i will try to find time to look at the thing with our ES expert, and write a proposal
[2012-03-08 16:19:00 -0500] btm: renchap: search should ideally be an API layer. If it is done well it could be an option next to solr and not require replacing it. If you write something up we can definitely float it into Opscode Engineering and discuss what problems it would solve for them.
[2012-03-08 16:19:00 -0500] renchap: i was thinking of that
[2012-03-08 16:19:00 -0500] renchap: abstract the search engine
[2012-03-08 16:20:00 -0500] renchap: the biggest problem would be the wildcards in the field names
[2012-03-08 16:32:00 -0500] btm: kallistec would have a lot to add I'm sure.
[2012-03-08 16:32:00 -0500] renchap: well, i think that we could find a datamodel for ES that would work
[2012-03-08 16:33:00 -0500] renchap: and it should probably be used for solr too, as both use lucene
[2012-03-08 17:23:00 -0500] renchap: well, syntax depends of chef, not the engine
[2012-03-08 17:23:00 -0500] renchap: because chef parses this syntax, and translate it to the proper engine syntax
[2012-03-08 17:24:00 -0500] Mithrandir: I thought it was passed through pretty verbatim?
[2012-03-08 17:24:00 -0500] renchap: nope
[2012-03-08 17:24:00 -0500] renchap: there is now a treetop parser
[2012-03-08 17:24:00 -0500] renchap: https://github.com/opscode/chef/tree/master/chef/lib/chef/solr_query
[2012-03-08 17:25:00 -0500] Mithrandir: look at who's been paying attention lately. :-)
[2012-03-08 17:25:00 -0500] Mithrandir: but that's great.
[2012-03-08 17:26:00 -0500] renchap: i think that i have a nice ES schema that would work
[2012-03-08 17:26:00 -0500] renchap: and be muuuch cleaner
[2012-03-08 17:34:00 -0500] mattray: Mithrandir: wasn't someone looking at replacing Solr with ElasticSearch?
[2012-03-08 17:34:00 -0500] github-bawt: [chef] btm pushed 4 new commits to master: http://git.io/ZHmF9g
[2012-03-08 17:34:00 -0500] github-bawt: [chef/master] Allow for the path to the chef client called by knife bootstrap to be specified in options or in a different part of the path than /usr/bin - Rob Di Marco
[2012-03-08 17:34:00 -0500] github-bawt: [chef/master] CHEF-2715: use the path to find chef-client not env, since we can - Bryan McLellan
[2012-03-08 17:34:00 -0500] github-bawt: [chef/master] CHEF-2715: Add and update tests for specifying alternate chef-client location - Bryan McLellan
[2012-03-08 17:35:00 -0500] btm: hoover_damm: --&
[2012-03-08 17:35:00 -0500] btm: er, --^
[2012-03-08 17:36:00 -0500] mattray: btm: are we thinking we'll support multiple chef-client installations?
[2012-03-08 17:36:00 -0500] mattray: yay split-brain?
[2012-03-08 17:37:00 -0500] btm: mattray: I'm not sure what you mean, are you referring to the discussion of supporting more than one search backend?
[2012-03-08 17:38:00 -0500] mattray: btm: for those patches, wondering if by supporting alternate chef-client locations we'd enable the ability to have more than 1 chef-client on a box?
[2012-03-08 17:38:00 -0500] mattray: so /etc/chef and /etc/chef2?
[2012-03-08 17:39:00 -0500] mattray: that came up in a discussion yesterday, letting Crowbar manage the hardware and then handing off the box to Chef to manage from there
[2012-03-08 17:40:00 -0500] hoover_damm: btm, awesome!
[2012-03-08 17:40:00 -0500] hoover_damm: btm, thank you!
[2012-03-08 17:40:00 -0500] hoover_damm: mattray, rubygems now installs gems in /usr/local/bin
[2012-03-08 17:41:00 -0500] hoover_damm: mattray, so if you have a default rubygems install that drops chef in /usr/local/bin instead of /usr/bin... the knife ec2 server create / bootstrap fails
[2012-03-08 17:41:00 -0500] hoover_damm: as there was no way to supply an alternate path
[2012-03-08 17:41:00 -0500] hoover_damm: i'm actually shocked that you guys had this, as Omnibus was installing in a different path
[2012-03-08 17:41:00 -0500] hoover_damm: which meant you always had to symlink /opt/opscode/bin/chef-client to /usr/bin/chef-client
[2012-03-08 17:41:00 -0500] hoover_damm: which to me feels INCREDIBLY DIRTY
[2012-03-08 17:42:00 -0500] hoover_damm: i'm not a huge fan of the 'which' or env chef-client but it works
[2012-03-08 17:42:00 -0500] hoover_damm: i'd rather we just bash -c source /etc/profile and let bash do the magic
[2012-03-08 17:42:00 -0500] mattray: hoover_damm: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2578
[2012-03-08 17:42:00 -0500] hoover_damm: 2715 actually
[2012-03-08 17:42:00 -0500] hoover_damm: oh that's omnibus
[2012-03-08 17:42:00 -0500] hoover_damm: mattray, you have omnibus tickets poluting chef?
[2012-03-08 17:42:00 -0500] hoover_damm: eww
[2012-03-08 17:43:00 -0500] hoover_damm: btm should fix that
[2012-03-08 17:43:00 -0500] mattray: hoover_damm: omnibus is open source too.
[2012-03-08 17:43:00 -0500] hoover_damm: mattray, my brain has omnibus as a separate project from chef
[2012-03-08 17:43:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so poluting the tickets just to me is incredibly nasty
[2012-03-08 17:44:00 -0500] btm: mattray: I haven't seen that feature discussed, I don't know what would be missing to make it work. I think the only blocker would be the ability to specify and alternate config file during bootstrap.
[2012-03-08 17:44:00 -0500] hoover_damm: that's me
[2012-03-08 17:44:00 -0500] hoover_damm: not anyone else
[2012-03-08 17:44:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so you don't have to agree
[2012-03-08 17:44:00 -0500] btm: hoover_damm: there's "omnibus" core, and there is chef being packaged in omnibus. we include the latter in the chef project just as we do bugs against the debian packages.
[2012-03-08 17:44:00 -0500] hoover_damm: btm, it's my opinion don't sweat it
[2012-03-08 17:45:00 -0500] btm: hoover_damm: I was just telling you how it is and expecting you to live with it. ;)
[2012-03-08 17:50:00 -0500] hoover_damm: btm, don't expect me to smile
[2012-03-08 17:50:00 -0500] hoover_damm: but I won't say anything more
[2012-03-08 17:50:00 -0500] hoover_damm: as it's just a personal thing and there's no need to say more
[2012-03-08 17:52:00 -0500] btm: hah, alright dude. we'll fix those bugs ourselves so you don't have to see them.
[2012-03-08 18:00:00 -0500] hoover_damm: well you said you wern't doing omnibus anymore?
[2012-03-08 18:00:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and you were going to replace it?
[2012-03-08 18:11:00 -0500] btm: hoover_damm: omnibus is still a definite go, we've have rewritten the omnibus project itself in ruby and engineering is currently building all the 'steps' in and testing it.
[2012-03-08 18:17:00 -0500] hoover_damm: ahh dumping clojure?
[2012-03-08 18:17:00 -0500] hoover_damm: heh omnibus is almost a distro
[2012-03-08 18:18:00 -0500] hoover_damm: well my branch works for me, I look forward to omnibus being easier
[2012-03-08 18:19:00 -0500] hoover_damm: makes ey's resin .. small and easy LOL
[2012-03-08 18:22:00 -0500] laurent\: btm: could you keep the invokercd provider in 0.10.10 please ?  :) (was CHEF-2880)
[2012-03-08 18:44:00 -0500] btm: laurent\: yeah I think we agreed we should keep and not use it as a default provider for anything.
[2012-03-08 18:51:00 -0500] hoover_damm: sigh
[2012-03-08 18:51:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I wonder if fog knows about the new types yet
[2012-03-08 18:51:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I so want to boot a m1.medium
[2012-03-08 18:54:00 -0500] cwj: pretty sure fog gets a list of instance sizes from the api
[2012-03-08 18:54:00 -0500] hoover_damm: doubt it
[2012-03-08 18:54:00 -0500] cwj: i just used knife to set up two m1.medius
[2012-03-08 18:54:00 -0500] hoover_damm: cwj, you'd be horrified
[2012-03-08 18:54:00 -0500] hoover_damm: cwj, a lot of people were hardcoding the sizes
[2012-03-08 18:54:00 -0500] hoover_damm: anywho your likely right, it should work as I think Geemus had a bug open regarding that 6months ago
[2012-03-08 18:54:00 -0500] hoover_damm: to make fog more compatable with eucalytpus
[2012-03-08 18:55:00 -0500] hoover_damm: or was it openstack?
[2012-03-08 18:55:00 -0500] hoover_damm: anywho if he did it hazzah :) less hardcoding please
[2012-03-08 18:55:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I hate having to fork a gem to update fog to just to have oregon
[2012-03-08 18:55:00 -0500] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-03-08 18:59:00 -0500] jtimberman: i just launched an m1.small 64 bit instance using the oneiric AMI
[2012-03-08 19:14:00 -0500] c_t: "xenophilic xenops" or somesuch probably
[2012-03-08 20:34:00 -0500] hoover_damm: c_t, scary
[2012-03-08 20:34:00 -0500] hoover_damm: c_t, that could be the new meme
[2012-03-08 20:34:00 -0500] hoover_damm: xenops
[2012-03-08 20:37:00 -0500] fujin: xubuntu ?
[2012-03-08 20:37:00 -0500] fujin: lol
[2012-03-08 20:37:00 -0500] fujin: oh you mean the distro relesae name got it
[2012-03-08 20:37:00 -0500] fujin: version
[2012-03-08 20:52:00 -0500] iafonov: btm, hi - regarding CHEF-1700 (Service provider for mac os x) - are you running tests on my branch or on rebased against master?
[2012-03-08 20:54:00 -0500] iafonov: I don't have chef development environment now - I think I will setup one again in a few days and take a look into issues. I think this is one of the downsides of `merge windows` management process - I have completely forgot what I was doing and how it should work:)
[2012-03-08 22:27:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so 4hours later
[2012-03-08 22:27:00 -0500] hoover_damm: new graphite cookbook made
[2012-03-08 22:28:00 -0500] hoover_damm: why doesn't pip support user? if I can create a virtualenv as a user
[2012-03-08 22:28:00 -0500] hoover_damm: it makes sense to have pip install as that user
[2012-03-08 22:31:00 -0500] hoover_damm: https://github.com/damm/graphite
[2012-03-08 22:31:00 -0500] hoover_damm: hate it if you want
[2012-03-08 23:04:00 -0500] fujin: nice man, was there some problems with our one ?
[2012-03-08 23:04:00 -0500] fujin: we have it running at a few clients and I hadn't noticed anything problematic
[2012-03-08 23:07:00 -0500] hoover_damm: fujin, main reason is you had a not_if that pointed to an egg
[2012-03-08 23:07:00 -0500] hoover_damm: fujin, it was actually our basis
[2012-03-08 23:07:00 -0500] hoover_damm: it was the only graphite recipe that wasn't a full load of crap
[2012-03-08 23:08:00 -0500] fujin: so why not patch & pull request lol
[2012-03-08 23:08:00 -0500] fujin: it's non-opscode, we accept contributions all the time, especially if they are good
[2012-03-08 23:08:00 -0500] fujin: fragmentation :(
[2012-03-08 23:14:00 -0500] hoover_damm: agreed
[2012-03-08 23:14:00 -0500] hoover_damm: but you didn't go far enough
[2012-03-08 23:14:00 -0500] hoover_damm: i wanted virtualenv
[2012-03-08 23:14:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and virtualenv isn't fully functional in chef imo
[2012-03-08 23:14:00 -0500] hoover_damm: (pip provider doesn't accept a user knob)
[2012-03-08 23:15:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so i'm making a virtualenv as graphite, and then tossing in pip
[2012-03-08 23:15:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and having to chwon in the aftermath
[2012-03-08 23:15:00 -0500] hoover_damm: all of them use apache, I wanted gunicorn
[2012-03-08 23:16:00 -0500] hoover_damm: most of the cookbooks I create likely won't be appealing to most users
[2012-03-08 23:16:00 -0500] hoover_damm: imo
[2012-03-08 23:18:00 -0500] fujin: cool
[2012-03-08 23:20:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yesterday we threw together a custom god cookbook that was very simple
[2012-03-08 23:20:00 -0500] hoover_damm: contract goals are not really open source goals even
[2012-03-08 23:21:00 -0500] hoover_damm: it's just as outside of the heavywater graphite cookbook... they all suck
[2012-03-08 23:21:00 -0500] hoover_damm: we had fun
[2012-03-08 23:42:00 -0500] fujin: what sucks ?
[2012-03-08 23:42:00 -0500] fujin: that doesn't really make sense
[2012-03-08 23:42:00 -0500] fujin: so you'd rather just write new stuff instead of contributing to other peoples?
[2012-03-08 23:42:00 -0500] fujin: namespaces on the community site makes it more effective i suppose
[2012-03-08 23:44:00 -0500] hoover_damm: if you take a look at the cookbook I uploaded, it has several features yours lacks
[2012-03-08 23:44:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and your right I can contribute back.  But i'm teaching and mentoring someone
[2012-03-08 23:44:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so part of my contract goals are to teach chef
[2012-03-08 23:45:00 -0500] hoover_damm: It's not about not contributing back, it's about a unfinished recipe I pushed out there for someone else... and mentioned in here in error (thinking someone might need a simple graphite cookbook)
[2012-03-08 23:45:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I was wrong
[2012-03-08 23:59:00 -0500] fujin: doesn't it seem like teaching them about the standard community contribution practices are worth doing?
