[2012-03-07 12:04:00 -0500] laurent\: ip l s lxcbr0 name lxc@br:0.test
[2012-03-07 12:05:00 -0500] laurent\: neither the kernel nor iproute seems to complain with lxc@br:0.test
[2012-03-07 12:06:00 -0500] laurent\: ntpd[8858]: lxc@br:0.test: getting interface flags: No such device
[2012-03-07 12:06:00 -0500] laurent\: but ntpd does
[2012-03-07 12:06:00 -0500] laurent\: lunch time, i'll try to find some reference to the iface name syntax
[2012-03-07 15:19:00 -0500] hoover_damm: btm, what's the status on https://github.com/opscode/chef/pull/182 http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2715
[2012-03-07 15:19:00 -0500] hoover_damm: btm, i'm having to fork the chef gem for my client to provide them a working bootstrap as that issue isn't resolved
[2012-03-07 15:33:00 -0500] btm: hoover_damm: replied on ticket
[2012-03-07 15:38:00 -0500] hoover_damm: cool thanks!
[2012-03-07 15:38:00 -0500] hoover_damm: btm, sorry just had to fork the chef repo to provide a working fix
[2012-03-07 15:38:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so I was just annoyed :)
[2012-03-07 15:38:00 -0500] btm: hoover_damm: no worries. I just haven't gotten around to Chef. Maybe I need to stop thinking about merging being tied to releasing and do more regular merge cycles.
[2012-03-07 15:42:00 -0500] thom: btm: i think that would make life easier for those of us playing along at home
[2012-03-07 15:44:00 -0500] btm: thom: alright. I've got a meeting with skeptomai in a half hour. I'll talk to him about it.
[2012-03-07 15:44:00 -0500] thom: +1
[2012-03-07 15:45:00 -0500] thom: thanks dude
[2012-03-07 15:51:00 -0500] laurent\: dev_valid_name defined here http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=blob;f=net/core/dev.c#l851
[2012-03-07 15:55:00 -0500] btm: hrm. so. no spaces, forward slashes, nulls. I'm being slow parsing the requirement around . + ..
[2012-03-07 15:56:00 -0500] laurent\: yep no space, i think that the hint to use to parse ip link
[2012-03-07 15:58:00 -0500] btm: its lame that @ is allowed since ip link uses that.
[2012-03-07 15:59:00 -0500] laurent\: and for the vlan parsing, the vlan tag is always numerical, i guess we have to add another check
[2012-03-07 16:00:00 -0500] laurent\: in case of a vlan it will always be dev.tag@dev
[2012-03-07 16:01:00 -0500] btm: laurent\: you can name the interface anything though, even if it is a vlan interface. see my 'foo' interface example that is vlan 14 on veth0 that I posted on OHAI-325
[2012-03-07 16:01:00 -0500] laurent\: if the iface is named blah@blu.5 then it's not a vlan, it's a stupidly named iface :)
[2012-03-07 16:01:00 -0500] btm: laurent\: the question is where we draw the line around stupidly named interfaces =)
[2012-03-07 16:02:00 -0500] laurent\: if it's blah.5@blah it's either a vlan or a stupidly name iface :)
[2012-03-07 16:02:00 -0500] laurent\: if it's a vlan then blah iface should exist
[2012-03-07 16:02:00 -0500] Mithrandir: it's always an interface.
[2012-03-07 16:02:00 -0500] laurent\: (guess that's a must)
[2012-03-07 16:03:00 -0500] btm: we can reliably get vlan information from 'ip -d link' without parsing the interface name.
[2012-03-07 16:04:00 -0500] laurent\: btm, yep true
[2012-03-07 16:04:00 -0500] laurent\: vlan id #{tag}, i've missed this one
[2012-03-07 16:06:00 -0500] laurent\: perfect, that's even better. that makes the check a bit more complex but that's no dirty hack :)
[2012-03-07 16:06:00 -0500] btm: I don't know how to get that information reliably from ifconfig now that I can create interfaces named whatever I want with iproute2. in either case, vlan id is a new feature and I'm solving it isn't my goal right now. I want to make this regex lack regressions and ship.
[2012-03-07 16:07:00 -0500] laurent\: yeah i know
[2012-03-07 16:10:00 -0500] laurent\: i'd add the vlan attributes while we're at it, it's not a big deal to add now ;-)
[2012-03-07 16:12:00 -0500] btm: the way ctennis wrote this test it expects to get the same information from iproute and ifconfig so I've been reluctant to add iproute only features, but that is the direction that the kernel is headed so pffffffft, I should grow up.
[2012-03-07 16:12:00 -0500] ctennis: sorry for the hassle on all of this laurent\ and btm
[2012-03-07 16:12:00 -0500] ctennis: I was trying to make as drop-in replacement as possible
[2012-03-07 16:14:00 -0500] laurent\: ctennis: no worries :)
[2012-03-07 16:15:00 -0500] laurent\: i've been the lazy one in that story, i haven't proposed any fix :)
[2012-03-07 16:16:00 -0500] btm: ctennis: no problem. we're improving overall here. the vlan stuff is a good point, we will have access to more information with iproute.
[2012-03-07 16:23:00 -0500] laurent\: hey have you thought of the old ip aliasing thing for ifconfig ? ;-)
[2012-03-07 16:23:00 -0500] laurent\: checking right now :)
[2012-03-07 16:24:00 -0500] laurent\: ok with ifconfig
[2012-03-07 16:25:00 -0500] laurent\: and obviously not ok with iproute2 because of the regex
[2012-03-07 16:25:00 -0500] laurent\: adding the new use case to the ticket
[2012-03-07 16:42:00 -0500] laurent\: test case (not use case) :)
[2012-03-07 19:17:00 -0500] jespada: jtimberman, should I assign this( http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1069) to me, fork the repo update it and issue a pull request , update the ticket and close as solved ?
[2012-03-07 19:41:00 -0500] jtimberman: jespada: don't close, 'resolve'
[2012-03-07 19:41:00 -0500] jespada: jtimberman, oh you 'r right sorry
[2012-03-07 19:41:00 -0500] jespada: ok will do
[2012-03-07 19:43:00 -0500] jtimberman: thanks :D
[2012-03-07 19:55:00 -0500] jespada: Done :)
[2012-03-07 20:02:00 -0500] jtimberman: thank you!
