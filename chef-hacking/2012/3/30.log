[2012-03-30 00:21:36 -0400] hoover_damm: holoway, btw where is that code hosted at again on github?
[2012-03-30 00:21:39 -0400] hoover_damm: I was curious
[2012-03-30 05:42:13 -0400] Mithrandir: holoway: can we just take two of them away?  I and all other users will hate it in the short term, but like it in the long term, I think
[2012-03-30 07:07:23 -0400] jtimberman: Mithrandir: well, as pointed out in an unrelated thing, the problem with the two :hash 'hash'/"hash" reference implementations is guessing which one the author used first.
[2012-03-30 07:07:53 -0400] jtimberman: personally i prefer the hash notation with either :symbol or "string" keys, and I don't care for the method attribute use.
[2012-03-30 07:07:57 -0400] Mithrandir: jtimberman: yes, so I think we should only allow one.  Reject keys that are either not strings or not symbols.
[2012-03-30 07:08:08 -0400] Mithrandir: and the method invocations should go, IMO
[2012-03-30 07:09:55 -0400] jtimberman: well the problem wrt symbol vs string is that symbols are surprising to nonrubyists and strings surprising to rubyists ;)
[2012-03-30 07:10:55 -0400] Mithrandir: allowing both and having them randonly mutate into each other, except when they don't is confusing to everybody
[2012-03-30 07:11:55 -0400] jtimberman: "strings" is my preference and vote because of consistency with JSON
[2012-03-30 07:12:07 -0400] jtimberman: the memory benefits of symbols might win out though.
[2012-03-30 07:12:21 -0400] Mithrandir: strings can also include chars that symbols can't
[2012-03-30 07:12:24 -0400] Mithrandir: iirc?
[2012-03-30 07:12:53 -0400] jtimberman: you can have :"things-that-arent-in-symbols"
[2012-03-30 07:13:08 -0400] jtimberman: if you want
[2012-03-30 07:16:33 -0400] Mithrandir: since that's not confusing at all? :-)
[2012-03-30 07:18:42 -0400] jtimberman: hehehe
[2012-03-30 14:29:15 -0400] hoover_damm: sigh this is annoying, having to fork the opscode nginx cookbook
[2012-03-30 14:29:18 -0400] hoover_damm: to remove runit
[2012-03-30 14:29:40 -0400] hoover_damm: I wish nginx was working right for me so I didn't have to fork it... but sv stop / sv int nginx isn't stopping it timely
[2012-03-30 14:29:45 -0400] hoover_damm: so obviously restarting it is foiled
[2012-03-30 14:39:52 -0400] hoover_damm: oh dammit, thank god for reading the recipe and realizing I didn't read far enough to configure init mode
[2012-03-30 14:40:00 -0400] hoover_damm: moment
[2012-03-30 15:49:11 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damm: :)
[2012-03-30 15:49:21 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damm: i think jamie winsor added that awhile back
[2012-03-30 15:49:43 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, well I tried to use it... but it's a redhat config file
[2012-03-30 15:49:44 -0400] hoover_damm: so I failed
[2012-03-30 15:49:57 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, I ended up having to bring in our ubuntu init.d all yakked up
[2012-03-30 18:29:37 -0400] hoover_damm: good god, i'm getting to re-use a chef cookbook I wrote 2 years ago
[2012-03-30 18:29:40 -0400] hoover_damm: how fantastic
[2012-03-30 18:29:51 -0400] hoover_damm: i mean that's utterly hilarius and cool
[2012-03-30 21:06:08 -0400] btm: anyone had a problem with instance_methods and a new gem with Chef?
[2012-03-30 21:18:05 -0400] btm: rspec 2.9.0 :(
[2012-03-30 21:18:42 -0400] btm: I wish that 1) ruby libraries didn't always break and 2) it wasn't so hard to find the broken ones.
[2012-03-30 21:21:19 -0400] btm: maybe I'm just cantankerous.
[2012-03-30 21:22:38 -0400] hoover_damm: just the rage from updating a random gem and finding half your world broken
[2012-03-30 21:39:57 -0400] btm: yeah. I spent half my day figuring out why rspec tests were failing.
[2012-03-30 21:40:36 -0400] btm: what I really need is to put my gemsets on dropbox so they work on all my systems. Which is a funny/sad thing to say.
[2012-03-30 21:41:08 -0400] hoover_damm: or just use bundler completely
[2012-03-30 21:41:15 -0400] hoover_damm: bundler should provide a fully working gemset
[2012-03-30 21:41:17 -0400] hoover_damm: *twitch*
[2012-03-30 21:42:12 -0400] hoover_damm: I really don't know, I was doing fairly good towards the end @ EY with rvm and multiple gemsets and things not busting and using bundler
[2012-03-30 21:42:17 -0400] hoover_damm: bundle --local always
[2012-03-30 21:42:30 -0400] hoover_damm: sometimes I had to rvm implode
[2012-03-30 21:42:33 -0400] hoover_damm: but I guess I was lucky
