[2012-03-23 15:29:00 -0400] btm: 1,196 downloads of the 0.6.12 gem today. I guess now it gets tested....
[2012-03-23 15:32:00 -0400] kallistec: btm: except for the two weeks you've been writing tests for the most obtuse use cases
[2012-03-23 15:33:00 -0400] kallistec: read: ^5
[2012-03-23 15:33:00 -0400] jtimberman: lulz
[2012-03-23 15:39:00 -0400] btm: kallistec: hahaha but someone could rename their interface eth0@my_moms_house:basement!
[2012-03-23 15:39:00 -0400] btm: I've seen some reports of node[:ec2] dropping out more frequently and node[:default_gateway] is broken on OpenVZ.
[2012-03-23 15:39:00 -0400] btm: I'm hoping it can all wait for some work to get done on Chef 0.10.10
[2012-03-23 15:40:00 -0400] btm: I'm still building the omnibus releases. I can't wait for the new build cluster at Opscode.
[2012-03-23 15:43:00 -0400] jtimberman: btm: <3
[2012-03-23 15:46:00 -0400] kallistec: would be sweet if we had agentless node feature
[2012-03-23 15:46:00 -0400] kallistec: so you could manage the build machine that can't have chef on it... with chef
[2012-03-23 15:47:00 -0400] kallistec: did we even touch the ec2 detection code in this release, btw?
[2012-03-23 15:52:00 -0400] kallistec: yeah, if you do `git diff 0.6.10...0.6.12 lib/ohai/plugins/ec2.rb` there's no functional change
[2012-03-23 15:53:00 -0400] kallistec: just ppl getting twitchy with ec2 not being 100% reliable
[2012-03-23 15:55:00 -0400] jamesturnbull: holoway: hey - like metarepo - cool idea
[2012-03-23 16:14:00 -0400] jtimberman: kallistec: ec2 itself being unreliable, or our support of it in ohai?
[2012-03-23 16:19:00 -0400] c_t: jtimberman: is something wrong with libfreetype6?
[2012-03-23 16:19:00 -0400] kallistec: jtimberman: one causes the other :P
[2012-03-23 16:25:00 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: dunno when i logged in my motd said "one update, one is a security update"
[2012-03-23 16:26:00 -0400] jtimberman: kallistec: ha! fair enough
[2012-03-23 16:26:00 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: i don't know why my server got that library installed though.
[2012-03-23 16:26:00 -0400] jtimberman: i mean, its clearly a dependency from something i installed
[2012-03-23 16:27:00 -0400] c_t: jtimberman: ah, I was concerned that maybe there was some mysterious libfreetype vulnerability or something
[2012-03-23 16:27:00 -0400] c_t: ATTENTION: YOUR COMPUTER IS BROADCASTING FONTS. WITH THIS INFORMATION, HACKERS COULD TAKE OVER YOUR COMPUTER!
[2012-03-23 16:31:00 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: oh maybe there is
[2012-03-23 16:31:00 -0400] c_t: well
[2012-03-23 16:31:00 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: I'm reasonably safe from such things.
[2012-03-23 16:31:00 -0400] c_t: I meant "reasonably dire" vulnerability
[2012-03-23 17:11:00 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, heh... how long can it take? I mean I did lein run ... walked away and 30minutes later it was done
[2012-03-23 17:11:00 -0400] hoover_damm: just a fire and forget task
[2012-03-23 17:11:00 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, :( sorry to hear about the regressions
[2012-03-23 17:25:00 -0400] btm: hoover_damm: I have to do it against a dozen systems and I cant run more than two at a time right now.
[2012-03-23 17:26:00 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, that's just a crapton of instances
[2012-03-23 17:26:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and a bit of a pain
[2012-03-23 17:26:00 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, too bad you don't have chroots for all the ubuntu's on a few boxes
[2012-03-23 17:26:00 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, then you could at least automate the builds easily on build boxes
[2012-03-23 17:26:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but having to build debs for all the countless versions of ubuntu
[2012-03-23 17:26:00 -0400] hoover_damm: has got be a bit annoying
[2012-03-23 17:31:00 -0400] c_t: too much derp on the internets today
[2012-03-23 17:34:00 -0400] hoover_damm: totally
[2012-03-23 17:34:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it's a friday
[2012-03-23 17:34:00 -0400] hoover_damm: derp the day off
[2012-03-23 17:54:00 -0400] btm: We only build on two versions of ubuntu, and two architectures there. I think major glibc changes trigger us to make another build.
[2012-03-23 18:45:00 -0400] atomic-penguin: glibc compatibility is a pain in the arse
[2012-03-23 18:46:00 -0400] ampledata: as compared to unicode you mean?
[2012-03-23 18:46:00 -0400] ampledata: ;)
[2012-03-23 18:47:00 -0400] atomic-penguin: when someone ships some dynamically linked enterprisey app that depends on some archaic shared object from redhat7 or EL3, it makes me cry inside
[2012-03-23 18:50:00 -0400] atomic-penguin: unicode has never made me homicidal on the other hand
[2012-03-23 18:56:00 -0400] btm: atomic-penguin: hah. yeah. thats why omnibus builds everything it can and vendors it.
[2012-03-23 18:58:00 -0400] atomic-penguin: I ran into the same problem trying to make a fat chef installer first time around
[2012-03-23 18:58:00 -0400] atomic-penguin: pre-omnibus
[2012-03-23 19:01:00 -0400] c_t: unicode has made me homicidal on occasion
[2012-03-23 19:05:00 -0400] jtimberman: atomic-penguin: checkpoint firewall management?
[2012-03-23 19:05:00 -0400] jtimberman: (rh7)
[2012-03-23 19:06:00 -0400] atomic-penguin: jtimberman, no why, do they have a redhat7 library required for that?
[2012-03-23 19:08:00 -0400] jtimberman: atomic-penguin: dunno.
[2012-03-23 19:08:00 -0400] jtimberman: atomic-penguin: i just remember earning battle scars and having email / conference call fights over RH7.3 because of checkpoint's requirement for it.
[2012-03-23 19:08:00 -0400] jtimberman: i think it was a kernel module
[2012-03-23 19:09:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it was
[2012-03-23 19:09:00 -0400] hoover_damm: shortly afterwards checkpoint moved to it's own linux distro
[2012-03-23 19:09:00 -0400] hoover_damm: due to the scars they got from that
[2012-03-23 19:09:00 -0400] atomic-penguin: Isn't checkpoint based on iptables?
[2012-03-23 19:09:00 -0400] hoover_damm: no
[2012-03-23 19:09:00 -0400] atomic-penguin: I must be thinking of the other firewall that Rusty Russel worked on
[2012-03-23 19:09:00 -0400] jtimberman: it was ipfwadm
[2012-03-23 19:12:00 -0400] atomic-penguin: Maybe that was watchguard
