[2012-03-16 12:52:00 -0400] roidrage: brace yourselves, i'm about to use knife
[2012-03-16 14:07:00 -0400] hoover_damm: good
[2012-03-16 14:15:00 -0400] roidrage: well, we'll just see about that
[2012-03-16 14:26:00 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, there's a whole world around you once you realize you don't have to just use oldchef with chef-solo :)
[2012-03-16 14:26:00 -0400] hoover_damm: that yu can pick apart and throw away
[2012-03-16 14:26:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and just enjoy
[2012-03-16 14:26:00 -0400] hoover_damm: s/yu/you
[2012-03-16 14:27:00 -0400] roidrage: fuck oldchef
[2012-03-16 14:27:00 -0400] roidrage: sorry ;)
[2012-03-16 14:27:00 -0400] roidrage: i know the advantages of not using chef-solo just like that. having a good infrastructure for orchestrating in a cluster is so much better
[2012-03-16 14:27:00 -0400] roidrage: don't have to tell me that, i've built my own chef server back in the day ;)
[2012-03-16 14:30:00 -0400] roidrage: if i could make a wish...
[2012-03-16 14:32:00 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, I only mention oldchef for the knee jerk reaction that even I still do.
[2012-03-16 14:32:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it makes me say the same damn thing
[2012-03-16 14:32:00 -0400] roidrage: i just wish chef had a nicer user interface :/
[2012-03-16 14:33:00 -0400] hoover_damm: just don't ask for the twitter bootstrap
[2012-03-16 14:33:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but yeah I do wish they rewrote the webui in webnoir
[2012-03-16 14:33:00 -0400] hoover_damm: would be much more fun to hack on as well
[2012-03-16 14:34:00 -0400] roidrage: i don't think the framework matters, it's the user interface that does
[2012-03-16 14:34:00 -0400] hoover_damm: oh I know... I just want more reasons to learn clojure
[2012-03-16 14:34:00 -0400] roidrage: heh
[2012-03-16 14:36:00 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: we have folks working on making the hosted/private chef webui better :)
[2012-03-16 14:36:00 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, how's merb treating you guys?
[2012-03-16 14:36:00 -0400] hoover_damm: ;)
[2012-03-16 14:37:00 -0400] roidrage: i'd appreciate that, the UI is really bugging me, i gotta say
[2012-03-16 14:37:00 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damm: i don't do anything with merb.
[2012-03-16 14:37:00 -0400] jtimberman: so i don't know
[2012-03-16 14:37:00 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, you should code a merb app
[2012-03-16 14:37:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it'll give you a new appreciation of rails
[2012-03-16 14:37:00 -0400] jtimberman: why
[2012-03-16 14:37:00 -0400] jtimberman: i have never coded a rails app
[2012-03-16 14:37:00 -0400] jtimberman: so i would have no basis for comparison
[2012-03-16 14:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: if nothing else, it'll give you the same frowny face as your end-users have when they try and hack the ui
[2012-03-16 14:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and seeing eye to eye with your end-users... can always lead to goodness
[2012-03-16 14:39:00 -0400] jtimberman: i mean, that sucks for contributors.
[2012-03-16 14:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it's 2012
[2012-03-16 14:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: that's all i'm going to say
[2012-03-16 14:39:00 -0400] jtimberman: but we're also going to rewrite the chef server API in erlang.
[2012-03-16 14:39:00 -0400] jtimberman: so it will be totally different in that regard
[2012-03-16 14:39:00 -0400] jtimberman: and i have no idea what the webui will do at that point
[2012-03-16 14:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I thought it was going to be in $insertrandomlanguage()
[2012-03-16 14:40:00 -0400] hoover_damm: could be erlang as well
[2012-03-16 14:40:00 -0400] hoover_damm: who says erlang doesn't do good web sites?
[2012-03-16 14:40:00 -0400] hoover_damm: no one
[2012-03-16 14:41:00 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, all I can say is once the erlang stuff is enough for open source... i'd love it if opscode opened it up so the community could help you guys out
[2012-03-16 14:41:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and it helps us out in the end too
[2012-03-16 14:41:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so it's a win win :)
[2012-03-16 15:26:00 -0400] btm: I really hope Ohai 0.6.12 is ready now.
[2012-03-16 15:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, well ohai finally see's all my ip's at home... so that's a first
[2012-03-16 15:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so that will give you my +1
[2012-03-16 16:05:00 -0400] hoover_damm: sigh
[2012-03-16 16:05:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i think there's only 1 reason why the ipad 3 is appealing
[2012-03-16 16:05:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and it's the worst reason ever
[2012-03-16 16:05:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I can read crap better
[2012-03-16 16:05:00 -0400] btm: hoover_damm: There's three of them now? :)
[2012-03-16 16:05:00 -0400] hoover_damm: looking at the new resolution
[2012-03-16 16:05:00 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, yeah released today
[2012-03-16 16:14:00 -0400] jtimberman: the compelling reason to get one for me is that i have the original ipad
[2012-03-16 16:15:00 -0400] roidrage: that's a compelling reason?
[2012-03-16 16:15:00 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: right, so, i don't have the new one :)
[2012-03-16 16:15:00 -0400] cwj: another compelling reason: cool things are awesome
[2012-03-16 16:15:00 -0400] roidrage: me neither
[2012-03-16 16:15:00 -0400] roidrage: my daughter hasn't complained about the resolution on the ipad 1 yet
[2012-03-16 16:15:00 -0400] hoover_damm: having a better screen to read would be nice
[2012-03-16 16:15:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I own a touchpad, so I know the difference
[2012-03-16 16:16:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I do a lot of my reading on the touchpad, and other crap on my ipad
[2012-03-16 16:16:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it's not bad to read the ipad
[2012-03-16 16:16:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but the touchpad's fonts are crisper on the eyes I guess
[2012-03-16 16:18:00 -0400] roidrage: i've a kindle for reading, love that thing
[2012-03-16 16:18:00 -0400] roidrage: since i got it never erally touched the ipad, so now it's my daughter's
[2012-03-16 16:18:00 -0400] roidrage: glad i didn't pay for it back in the day
[2012-03-16 16:22:00 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, it's not a bad device... 
[2012-03-16 16:23:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I just don't have 5 bills to drop on it right now really
[2012-03-16 16:23:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I mean I could, but i'd put myself in a bad situation financially later
[2012-03-16 16:23:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so I won't
[2012-03-16 16:24:00 -0400] roidrage: yeah, just saying, i don't have much reason to cough up 500 bucks right now
[2012-03-16 16:29:00 -0400] c_t: I'm still content enough with my old-skool iPad
[2012-03-16 16:29:00 -0400] c_t: dunno if I'd get another when it ends up blowing up or not
[2012-03-16 16:30:00 -0400] c_t: I've read books on it occasionally, but other than that I use it for browsing Wikipedia or somesuch before I go to sleep or playing Angry Birds
[2012-03-16 16:40:00 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, once I get paid from a contract I'll have the cash to do it likely
[2012-03-16 16:41:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i'll likely give my old ipad to my grandkids
[2012-03-16 16:41:00 -0400] hoover_damm: just so it's not a waste
