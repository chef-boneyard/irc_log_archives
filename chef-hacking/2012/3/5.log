[2012-03-05 10:01:00 -0500] spheromak: ?
[2012-03-05 10:27:00 -0500] fujin: i am glad you understood
[2012-03-05 10:27:00 -0500] fujin: i was pretty drunk when i replied
[2012-03-05 10:28:00 -0500] fujin: i actually replied off list, and he contacted me
[2012-03-05 10:28:00 -0500] fujin: man, that was some wtfbbq shit
[2012-03-05 10:28:00 -0500] fujin: i can't actually believe someone a) issued an assignment to deploy apache w/ chef
[2012-03-05 10:28:00 -0500] fujin: and b) the student thought it would be cool to get someone to produce something akin to a 'design plan' on the mailing list
[2012-03-05 10:29:00 -0500] fujin: sounds like a really dodgy consultancy firm or something whacko
[2012-03-05 10:43:00 -0500] spheromak: lol
[2012-03-05 10:44:00 -0500] spheromak: i think its cool if it was for a class. teching practical shit ;)
[2012-03-05 10:47:00 -0500] fujin: yeah I mean I asked him
[2012-03-05 10:47:00 -0500] fujin: is this for a class or whatever
[2012-03-05 10:47:00 -0500] fujin: but like no response
[2012-03-05 10:47:00 -0500] fujin: the follow up duplicate post to chef-dev I'm just like ???
[2012-03-05 10:53:00 -0500] spheromak: yea for sure
[2012-03-05 14:43:00 -0500] jtimberman: wat
[2012-03-05 14:43:00 -0500] jtimberman: we deploy apache in the chef fundamentals class.
[2012-03-05 17:51:00 -0500] holoway: lusis: pingles
[2012-03-05 17:51:00 -0500] DarrinEden: hi holoway
[2012-03-05 17:51:00 -0500] holoway: hola DarrinEden :)
[2012-03-05 17:52:00 -0500] DarrinEden: are you in Seattle today?
[2012-03-05 17:52:00 -0500] holoway: yes
[2012-03-05 17:52:00 -0500] DarrinEden: dunno 'bout you but this seems like the heart of the grey season in cascadia
[2012-03-05 17:52:00 -0500] holoway: yes
[2012-03-05 17:52:00 -0500] DarrinEden: i'm ready for some sun!
[2012-03-05 17:53:00 -0500] holoway: yesterday was like a mini-spring day
[2012-03-05 17:53:00 -0500] DarrinEden: ...in three months. :-)
[2012-03-05 17:53:00 -0500] holoway: and today seattle reminded me that this was a lie
[2012-03-05 17:53:00 -0500] DarrinEden: heh
[2012-03-05 17:53:00 -0500] holoway: so, talking about the bigger issue than the specifics of a partial run list execution
[2012-03-05 17:53:00 -0500] DarrinEden: right
[2012-03-05 17:54:00 -0500] holoway: what you need is conditional movement from current to desired state
[2012-03-05 17:54:00 -0500] holoway: paired with much more dynamic intervals
[2012-03-05 17:54:00 -0500] c_t: it's been exceptionally dreary for ages
[2012-03-05 17:54:00 -0500] c_t: even for WA
[2012-03-05 17:54:00 -0500] DarrinEden: holoway: please expand
[2012-03-05 17:55:00 -0500] DarrinEden: so we're imaging in terms of a state machine?
[2012-03-05 17:55:00 -0500] holoway: DarrinEden: yes
[2012-03-05 17:55:00 -0500] DarrinEden: is it fair to bring in the concept of a dependency graph at this point?
[2012-03-05 17:57:00 -0500] DarrinEden: if i ask a certain collection of resources (recipe) to run are we able to (simply) compute any dependent resources (or recipes)?
[2012-03-05 17:57:00 -0500] holoway: you could - there are some changes you could make to the way you specify things that make it even easier
[2012-03-05 17:57:00 -0500] holoway: an example would be having the target for a partial be a role that properly states the dependencies
[2012-03-05 17:57:00 -0500] holoway: and bob is your metaphorical uncle
[2012-03-05 17:58:00 -0500] holoway: but that's the less hard part to me
[2012-03-05 17:58:00 -0500] DarrinEden: what's the hard part?
[2012-03-05 17:58:00 -0500] holoway: the hard part is knowing whether it's safe to change
[2012-03-05 17:58:00 -0500] DarrinEden: "safe"?
[2012-03-05 17:59:00 -0500] holoway: imagine you have a data center full of systems, and you can only upgrade one rack at a time
[2012-03-05 17:59:00 -0500] holoway: how do you specify that
[2012-03-05 17:59:00 -0500] holoway: I haz ideas
[2012-03-05 17:59:00 -0500] DarrinEden: do we have that notion today?
[2012-03-05 17:59:00 -0500] holoway: you can model that notion today
[2012-03-05 17:59:00 -0500] DarrinEden: are we back to orchestration?
[2012-03-05 18:00:00 -0500] holoway: we are back to orchestration, and we're back to the bones of the conversation we had a surge
[2012-03-05 18:00:00 -0500] holoway: ok, I'm walking off to coffee
[2012-03-05 18:00:00 -0500] DarrinEden: ok. i am oriented
[2012-03-05 18:36:00 -0500] hoover_damm: c_t, tell me about it
[2012-03-05 18:36:00 -0500] hoover_damm: c_t, it's actually made me want a trip to sunny california
[2012-03-05 18:41:00 -0500] c_t: hoover_damm: I just want some goddamned telescope time
[2012-03-05 19:17:00 -0500] hoover_damm: c_t, last night was a beautiful telescope night
[2012-03-05 19:17:00 -0500] hoover_damm: at least in my area
[2012-03-05 19:17:00 -0500] c_t: cloudy down here
[2012-03-05 19:17:00 -0500] hoover_damm: but it's been goddamn gray
[2012-03-05 19:17:00 -0500] hoover_damm: a lot
[2012-03-05 19:17:00 -0500] c_t: the moon's lurking around right now anyway
[2012-03-05 19:28:00 -0500] hoover_damm: https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/blob/master/application/examples/data_bags/apps/rails_app.json
[2012-03-05 19:28:00 -0500] hoover_damm: meh
[2012-03-05 19:29:00 -0500] hoover_damm: this may be the tipping point of this contact from fun to wow we gotta re-do
[2012-03-05 19:29:00 -0500] c_t: how we scrumming, anyway?
[2012-03-05 19:30:00 -0500] c_t: sigh
[2012-03-05 19:30:00 -0500] c_t: that, my friends, is a wrong window
[2012-03-05 19:30:00 -0500] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-03-05 19:30:00 -0500] hoover_damm: no worries
[2012-03-05 19:30:00 -0500] c_t: now to enter my password
[2012-03-05 19:30:00 -0500] c_t: t0ps3kr1t
[2012-03-05 19:30:00 -0500] fujin: Hello Team
[2012-03-05 19:30:00 -0500] fujin: please do the needful
[2012-03-05 19:31:00 -0500] hoover_damm: buttcheese
[2012-03-05 19:31:00 -0500] hoover_damm: that's my password
[2012-03-05 19:32:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yes please do my data bags for me
[2012-03-05 19:32:00 -0500] hoover_damm: fujin, you'll see more in time
[2012-03-05 19:33:00 -0500] hoover_damm: just laugh and smile
[2012-03-05 19:35:00 -0500] hoover_damm: man gentoo's dated on rrdtool
[2012-03-05 19:35:00 -0500] hoover_damm: them slackers
[2012-03-05 21:34:00 -0500] fujin: anyone seen the gem-package provider refuse to install a newer version of the package?
[2012-03-05 21:34:00 -0500] fujin: seems to silently fail
[2012-03-05 21:35:00 -0500] fujin: this just seeems weird
[2012-03-05 21:53:00 -0500] hoover_damm: is it the provider? or gem?
[2012-03-05 21:53:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I've seen 'gem' do that behavior exactly
[2012-03-05 21:53:00 -0500] fujin: it was a stray override
[2012-03-05 21:54:00 -0500] fujin: left in a role, role on disk was outdated
[2012-03-05 22:00:00 -0500] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, what would you have to redo?
[2012-03-05 22:01:00 -0500] hoover_damm: ahh
[2012-03-05 22:01:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, a bit
[2012-03-05 22:01:00 -0500] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, why?
[2012-03-05 22:02:00 -0500] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, and is that related somehow to opscode's `application` cookbook?
[2012-03-05 22:06:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, just a different path taken on the application cookbook... they cargo culted it
[2012-03-05 22:06:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and thus there's no databag configuration file or anything like :apps
[2012-03-05 22:07:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I discussed it with them and their basic response was unless it add's something large, why bother?
[2012-03-05 22:17:00 -0500] jtimberman: Hmm?
[2012-03-05 22:17:00 -0500] jtimberman: my ears were burning.
[2012-03-05 22:17:00 -0500] yfeldblum: ?
[2012-03-05 22:18:00 -0500] jtimberman: What is this about the application cookbook?
[2012-03-05 22:19:00 -0500] yfeldblum: jtimberman, do it better
[2012-03-05 22:20:00 -0500] yfeldblum: jtimberman, don't know
[2012-03-05 22:21:00 -0500] hoover_damm: nah this is just one of those where you can follow the opscode pattern, or throw it out and bear the fate of owning part of the code on your own
[2012-03-05 22:21:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and not using opscode's pretty ideas
[2012-03-05 22:23:00 -0500] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, i did the second one
[2012-03-05 22:23:00 -0500] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, it's really not so bad
[2012-03-05 22:23:00 -0500] hoover_damm: no it's really not
[2012-03-05 22:24:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I had to spruce up a few items here and there but overall I am happy
[2012-03-05 22:24:00 -0500] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, especially when you have applications that don't fit the opscode `application` cookbook's constrained vision
[2012-03-05 22:27:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-03-05 22:30:00 -0500] yfeldblum: jtimberman, be more opinionated about deploy_to: it belongs in the node attributes and not in the databag item ... any rails app that has to be deployed to some given dir deserves to be sent back to the devs with a scalding scolding, not deployed :P
[2012-03-05 22:31:00 -0500] jtimberman: yfeldblum: a la just make it go to say, /srv/app_name
[2012-03-05 22:32:00 -0500] yfeldblum: default["application"]["deploy"]["base_dir"] = "/srv/apps"
[2012-03-05 22:33:00 -0500] yfeldblum: revision_deploy node["application"]["deploy"]["base_dir"] + current_app.name.downcase.gsub(/\W/, "")
[2012-03-05 22:34:00 -0500] yfeldblum: the data bags should describe applications, not the servers on which applications are deployed
[2012-03-05 22:35:00 -0500] yfeldblum: also postgresql & other db's & backend services, environment variables as configuration, multiple processes per application
[2012-03-05 22:38:00 -0500] yfeldblum: chef_environment =/= RACK_ENV
[2012-03-05 22:38:00 -0500] yfeldblum: :P
[2012-03-05 22:39:00 -0500] yfeldblum: great to learn from though - analyzing the opscode application cookbook is one of the first things i did to learn chef
[2012-03-05 23:06:00 -0500] ssd7: I think it depends on your background and learning style.  I see a lot of people fo try to go right to the application cookbook when learning chef.  It ends up being pretty daunting for many.
[2012-03-05 23:18:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yeah my problem is I like it go to in /data
[2012-03-05 23:18:00 -0500] hoover_damm: others go into other spots
[2012-03-05 23:18:00 -0500] hoover_damm: like /usr/apps
[2012-03-05 23:18:00 -0500] hoover_damm: it's a cornacopia of options
[2012-03-05 23:58:00 -0500] jtimberman: i think this LWRP unit I'm wrapping up is going to be pretty awesome
[2012-03-05 23:58:00 -0500] jtimberman: (which will be in chef-fundamentals, though as an optional unit)
