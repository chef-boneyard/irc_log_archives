[2012-03-13 15:22:00 -0400] btm: laurent\: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/OHAI-325 the ip aliasing situation is hard. If a user was expecting 'eth0:0' to be its own interface before in ohai, the address will now be listed under eth0 with iproute2. this makes more sense, but isn't backwards compatible. We hit the old road block of not being able to have pointers in JSON.
[2012-03-13 15:23:00 -0400] btm: Maybe we should generate the information twice, as a backward compatible hack. leave it where it is, but generate a subinterface from it.
[2012-03-13 15:53:00 -0400] hoover_damm: is there a reason knife is hardcoded to info?
[2012-03-13 15:54:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and I mean knife's server create mechanism
[2012-03-13 15:55:00 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/knife/configure_client.rb#L37
[2012-03-13 15:55:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it seems incredibly short minded to assume info and stdout for a logfile
[2012-03-13 15:55:00 -0400] btm: hoover_damm: the only thing that comes to mind is that knife used to use the same log levels as chef via Mixlib::Log, but it went to using -V for simplicity.
[2012-03-13 15:55:00 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, I think the original question came out wrong
[2012-03-13 15:55:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I didn't really mean knife
[2012-03-13 15:55:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I meant the bootstrap's client.rb actually
[2012-03-13 15:56:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I just had to modify the local chef gem to force this client into a debug mode
[2012-03-13 15:56:00 -0400] hoover_damm: to find out why it's being an idiot
[2012-03-13 15:56:00 -0400] btm: hoover_damm: ah, I think that's just a product of growth of that function.
[2012-03-13 15:56:00 -0400] hoover_damm: that i'm trying to track down
[2012-03-13 15:56:00 -0400] hoover_damm: suddenly nginx is always starting in the service provider
[2012-03-13 15:56:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and it's breaking notifications
[2012-03-13 15:57:00 -0400] hoover_damm: cuz it's always trying to start :|
[2012-03-13 15:57:00 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, *nod*
[2012-03-13 15:57:00 -0400] hoover_damm: that's what I gathered too
[2012-03-13 15:57:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but I wanted to ask as it bothered me enough
