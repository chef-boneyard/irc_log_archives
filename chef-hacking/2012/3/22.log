[2012-03-22 11:01:00 -0400] roidrage: oh chef, y u hang when the command is done executing? :(
[2012-03-22 11:22:00 -0400] roidrage: for the lulz: https://img.skitch.com/20120322-wp8pyrtweiw8htbrs4cj76exf.png
[2012-03-22 11:33:00 -0400] Mithrandir: nom
[2012-03-22 11:33:00 -0400] Mithrandir: meeeemory
[2012-03-22 11:33:00 -0400] roidrage: MOAR!
[2012-03-22 11:34:00 -0400] Mithrandir: well, you got a few more GB, so..
[2012-03-22 12:43:00 -0400] roidrage: tamed the chef-client memory beast
[2012-03-22 13:32:00 -0400] Cope: by rewriting it in Go?
[2012-03-22 14:24:00 -0400] hoover_damm: rofl memory beast?
[2012-03-22 14:25:00 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, how big?
[2012-03-22 14:25:00 -0400] roidrage: an interesting experience to have chef kill my box like that :)
[2012-03-22 14:25:00 -0400] hoover_damm: because chef-client doesn't bloat unless you suddenly need to allocate a bunch of blocks of memory
[2012-03-22 14:25:00 -0400] hoover_damm: for like loading a 500meg file into memory
[2012-03-22 14:25:00 -0400] roidrage: yup, wget of a 3.2GB file that didn't run attached to a terminal, instead the output was just piped to stderr :)
[2012-03-22 14:26:00 -0400] hoover_damm: DOOOH
[2012-03-22 14:26:00 -0400] hoover_damm: that's good
[2012-03-22 14:26:00 -0400] hoover_damm: you should file a ticket upon something on the lines of 'stderr should not OOM my box'
[2012-03-22 14:26:00 -0400] roidrage: heh, yeah
[2012-03-22 14:27:00 -0400] roidrage: was kinda fun watching that
[2012-03-22 14:27:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it should really prune those buckets from memory and shove them to disk
[2012-03-22 14:27:00 -0400] hoover_damm: or something
[2012-03-22 14:27:00 -0400] roidrage: one tick in top: 200megs more memory
[2012-03-22 14:27:00 -0400] hoover_damm: because for those of us who actually want logging
[2012-03-22 14:27:00 -0400] hoover_damm: we dont' want our logging to oom us
[2012-03-22 14:28:00 -0400] roidrage: oom all the things!
[2012-03-22 14:29:00 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, I just track it, try to remember it... and then share it so others can learn
[2012-03-22 14:29:00 -0400] roidrage: remember what?
[2012-03-22 14:29:00 -0400] hoover_damm: just like before passenger 3.0.9 all the processes were oom-proof
[2012-03-22 14:29:00 -0400] hoover_damm: how many people know that off the top of their head?
[2012-03-22 14:30:00 -0400] hoover_damm: nothing like having passenger leak and take down your box
[2012-03-22 14:30:00 -0400] roidrage: haha, passenger
[2012-03-22 14:30:00 -0400] roidrage: i lol'd
[2012-03-22 14:30:00 -0400] hoover_damm: LOL
[2012-03-22 14:30:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i just moved my client to unicorn
[2012-03-22 14:30:00 -0400] hoover_damm: they had a few issues with passenger that without getting sued I coudln't address
[2012-03-22 14:30:00 -0400] hoover_damm: they require patches I no longer have access to, and are not public
[2012-03-22 14:31:00 -0400] roidrage: heh
[2012-03-22 14:31:00 -0400] roidrage: should've taken them all with you :)
[2012-03-22 14:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: there was this tasty patch that Kirk wrote
[2012-03-22 14:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: basically the backlog is hardcoded to 1024... shocker, it aligns it with max.soconn
[2012-03-22 14:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so anyone with 502's deploying to passenger because it takes 5days to start
[2012-03-22 14:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: would want this tasty patch
[2012-03-22 14:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: if nothing else you can setup a backlog long enough to not serve 502's while it's reloading your app
[2012-03-22 14:32:00 -0400] hoover_damm: wouldn't it be swank if you could actually pre-warm the passenger pools with maintenance.html loaded?
[2012-03-22 14:32:00 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-03-22 14:33:00 -0400] roidrage: bah, maintenance pages on deployments?
[2012-03-22 14:33:00 -0400] roidrage: no thanks
[2012-03-22 14:33:00 -0400] hoover_damm: srsly
[2012-03-22 14:33:00 -0400] hoover_damm: that's so 2008
[2012-03-22 14:34:00 -0400] roidrage: phew, starting to automate all the things. i'm glad i don't have to take care of the chef server infra though :)
[2012-03-22 14:42:00 -0400] hoover_damm: feels good to automate EVERYTHING? doesn't it?
[2012-03-22 14:42:00 -0400] roidrage: it always does
[2012-03-22 14:42:00 -0400] roidrage: can't say that feeling is particularly new ;)
[2012-03-22 14:42:00 -0400] roidrage: it's just done in a different way this time
[2012-03-22 14:43:00 -0400] roidrage: and with lots more memory required :)
[2012-03-22 14:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: nope
[2012-03-22 14:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it's just coming back to it
[2012-03-22 14:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: for me
[2012-03-22 14:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: when I joined EY I kinda stopped automating everything
[2012-03-22 14:48:00 -0400] roidrage: never stop automating, bro
[2012-03-22 14:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: truly
[2012-03-22 14:48:00 -0400] bigfleet_: fav roidrage
[2012-03-22 14:51:00 -0400] StormSilver: tru
[2012-03-22 14:53:00 -0400] StormSilver: roidrage: Hey, I wanted to learn about NoSQL. Do you know any books that I could read? What I really need is... I dunno, like a handbook or something.
[2012-03-22 14:53:00 -0400] roidrage: StormSilver: http://pragprog.com/book/rwdata/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks
[2012-03-22 14:53:00 -0400] StormSilver: Hrmph
[2012-03-22 14:54:00 -0400] StormSilver: I had actually forgotten about that one, but it wasn't the point of my troll.
[2012-03-22 14:54:00 -0400] roidrage: nosql handbook is on hold for now, a task that's too big for my little brain i'm afraid
[2012-03-22 14:54:00 -0400] StormSilver: Ah. I hadn't heard.
[2012-03-22 14:55:00 -0400] roidrage: because it's not official :)
[2012-03-22 14:55:00 -0400] StormSilver: Man, I was mad looking forward to it too.
[2012-03-22 14:55:00 -0400] StormSilver: Fair 'nough.
[2012-03-22 14:55:00 -0400] roidrage: there's going to be another book, one on redis, though
[2012-03-22 14:55:00 -0400] roidrage: it's just the two of them i know best
[2012-03-22 14:55:00 -0400] roidrage: riak and redis, good team
[2012-03-22 14:56:00 -0400] roidrage: so yeah, sorry about that :)
[2012-03-22 14:56:00 -0400] roidrage: but breaking the too big task down into smaller ones works much better for me
[2012-03-22 14:56:00 -0400] StormSilver: roidrage: Hey, no worries. It's good to make the cut if it's killing you to keep working on it.
[2012-03-22 14:56:00 -0400] StormSilver: roidrage: Mos def.
[2012-03-22 14:57:00 -0400] StormSilver: I need to play with redis. I guess sidekiq is starting to make a splash.
[2012-03-22 15:06:00 -0400] hoover_damm: the nosql handbook
[2012-03-22 15:06:00 -0400] hoover_damm: is good too

[2012-03-22 19:26:00 -0400] github-bawt: [omnibus/master] Bump chef-full to 0.10.8-3 to include Ohai 0.6.12 - Bryan McLellan
[2012-03-22 19:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: :( wish omnibus was 1.9.3 already 
[2012-03-22 20:32:00 -0400] hoover_damm: question everyone, do you use the node attribute directly in templates and why? 
[2012-03-22 20:32:00 -0400] ampledata: i do not
[2012-03-22 20:32:00 -0400] hoover_damm: is variables deprecated?
[2012-03-22 20:32:00 -0400] ampledata: where did u hear that
[2012-03-22 20:32:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I see people use <%= node a ton
[2012-03-22 20:33:00 -0400] hoover_damm: even opscode cookbooks use it
[2012-03-22 20:33:00 -0400] ampledata: i've seen a counterexample by jt i think
[2012-03-22 20:33:00 -0400] ampledata: let me find url
[2012-03-22 20:33:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I always do variables
[2012-03-22 20:33:00 -0400] ampledata: @node vs passed in variables in templates?
[2012-03-22 20:33:00 -0400] ampledata: Not resolved, some contend that @node should never be used as it's dangerous and has potential for side-effects
[2012-03-22 20:33:00 -0400] ampledata: Passed in variables are a way for the cookbook author to define an api into the template
[2012-03-22 20:33:00 -0400] hoover_damm: (now I do)
[2012-03-22 20:33:00 -0400] ampledata: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cookbook+Style-Guide+Outline
[2012-03-22 20:34:00 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah i brought that up
[2012-03-22 20:34:00 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-03-22 20:34:00 -0400] hoover_damm: gooo figure
[2012-03-22 20:34:00 -0400] ampledata: i like the second point there
[2012-03-22 20:34:00 -0400] hoover_damm: gosh I will keep teaching to use variables
[2012-03-22 20:35:00 -0400] ampledata: i've always wanted to lint our erb templates
[2012-03-22 20:35:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I thought it was a bad practice so i've been teaching that it is to my clients
[2012-03-22 20:35:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but they keep asking why the opscode cookbooks do this crap
[2012-03-22 20:35:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so I asked
[2012-03-22 20:35:00 -0400] hoover_damm: :(
[2012-03-22 20:35:00 -0400] ampledata: opscode cookbooks do a not of questionable stuff
[2012-03-22 20:35:00 -0400] ampledata: er
[2012-03-22 20:35:00 -0400] ampledata: a LOT
[2012-03-22 20:35:00 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-03-22 20:35:00 -0400] ampledata: of
[2012-03-22 20:35:00 -0400] ampledata: questionable
[2012-03-22 20:35:00 -0400] hoover_damm: A TON
[2012-03-22 20:35:00 -0400] hoover_damm: often bad examples now
[2012-03-22 20:36:00 -0400] ampledata: the students have become the masters
[2012-03-22 20:36:00 -0400] ampledata: well fwiw, i started working on a cookbook style guide
[2012-03-22 20:36:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but examples are examples
[2012-03-22 20:36:00 -0400] ampledata: https://github.com/ampledata/cookbook-style-guide
[2012-03-22 20:36:00 -0400] hoover_damm: you can take em however you want
[2012-03-22 20:36:00 -0400] ampledata: it's a work in progress, and it doesn't integrate everything from that wikipage or from foodcritic yet
[2012-03-22 20:36:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but it explains when I tried to tell people to not use libraries to create functions in templates
[2012-03-22 20:36:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I got backlash previously
[2012-03-22 20:37:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I do teach the practice of using libraries to monkeypatch
[2012-03-22 20:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I'm no master, I just found a pattern I like.
[2012-03-22 20:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and I like to teach it
[2012-03-22 20:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and really opscode is just trying to keep creating cookbooks and keep going with the ubuntu/debian cookbooks
[2012-03-22 20:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: we should be thankful we get squat for free
[2012-03-22 20:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: instead of bitching kids
[2012-03-22 20:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-03-22 20:42:00 -0400] mattray: I'm pretty sure we'd take cleanup patches from foodcritic
[2012-03-22 20:43:00 -0400] mattray: jtimberman has trouble scaling
[2012-03-22 20:43:00 -0400] mattray: ;)
[2012-03-22 20:46:00 -0400] jtimberman: yeah so
[2012-03-22 20:46:00 -0400] jtimberman: contributions welcome for sure.
[2012-03-22 20:46:00 -0400] jtimberman: using the node in templates is perfectly cromulent :P
[2012-03-22 20:47:00 -0400] jtimberman: variables is not deprecated.
[2012-03-22 20:47:00 -0400] jtimberman: totally use that
[2012-03-22 20:47:00 -0400] jtimberman: monkeypatching is poor form :P
[2012-03-22 20:47:00 -0400] jtimberman: i worked with a client that monkeypatched out the Processing... messages that came up in 0.10.
[2012-03-22 20:48:00 -0400] jtimberman: i couldn't figure out why they weren't having output I was used to
[2012-03-22 20:49:00 -0400] holoway: hoover_damm: the opscode cookbooks are a great history lesson in evolution
[2012-03-22 20:49:00 -0400] holoway: lots of them started out as HJK's puppet manifests way back in the day
[2012-03-22 20:49:00 -0400] holoway: their source history is literally a history of chef evolution
[2012-03-22 20:53:00 -0400] hoover_damm: holoway, they are
[2012-03-22 20:53:00 -0400] hoover_damm: holoway, and as I said in the end, I really am thankful for what we do have.
[2012-03-22 20:53:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it's not your job to deliver top notch dry coookbooks for us to use
[2012-03-22 20:53:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it'd be kick ass
[2012-03-22 20:53:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but .
[2012-03-22 20:57:00 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, monkeypatching is proper form actually
[2012-03-22 20:58:00 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, the problem is when there was monkeypatching done, errors happen and people are unaware of said monkeypatch and what it could do and if it's the cause of the problem
[2012-03-22 20:58:00 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, that's not a problem with monkeypatching but more of information fo the act you are doing and what you are taking on to 'own'
[2012-03-22 21:03:00 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damm: actually, delivering top notch cookbooks *is* my job. i'm wrapping up some loose ends in other areas.
[2012-03-22 21:05:00 -0400] jtimberman: monkeypatching core classes should be considered a burnable offense. :)
[2012-03-22 21:05:00 -0400] jtimberman: like, if you're monkeypatching String
[2012-03-22 21:05:00 -0400] jtimberman: especially if the modiification is to existing methods
[2012-03-22 21:08:00 -0400] hoover_damm: no you monkeypatch Chef::Provider::Gem
[2012-03-22 21:08:00 -0400] hoover_damm: or insert a function into node
[2012-03-22 21:08:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I don't monkeypatch string in Chef... that seems just damned silly
[2012-03-22 21:08:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it's okay I had fun with a jenkins cookbook earlier today... 
[2012-03-22 21:09:00 -0400] hoover_damm: ended up having to create another cookbook from scratch because there was no damned good jenkins cookbook out there... all horrible incorrect patterns with major critical pattern flaws with flipping frogs
[2012-03-22 21:09:00 -0400] hoover_damm: j/k
[2012-03-22 21:09:00 -0400] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-03-22 21:10:00 -0400] hoover_damm: tomorrow will be just booting up a few jenkins slaves for happinyess
[2012-03-22 21:10:00 -0400] hoover_damm: blah wow what hell was that word? happinyess? 
[2012-03-22 21:11:00 -0400] hoover_damm: no
[2012-03-22 21:11:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I meant to type happyness
[2012-03-22 21:11:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but my fingers slipped
[2012-03-22 21:11:00 -0400] c_t: oh, "happiness" is the word you were trying to type
[2012-03-22 21:11:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and as you type 80+ wpm a key slipping can be tragic
[2012-03-22 21:11:00 -0400] c_t: it's not quite the right word for this, I mean
[2012-03-22 21:11:00 -0400] c_t: not quite sure if "happiness" is quite the right word
[2012-03-22 21:12:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it is to me
[2012-03-22 21:12:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it makes me happy, fills me with glea
[2012-03-22 21:12:00 -0400] c_t: this is the joy that comes from finding out you in all likelihood just have spinal nerve damage
[2012-03-22 21:13:00 -0400] c_t: (relatively minor)
[2012-03-22 21:13:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it's likely most people by the age of 35 have some kind of spinal damage, brain damage
