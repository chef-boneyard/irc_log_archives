[2012-03-09 14:07:00 -0500] jespada: Guys, now that chef use `ip` instead of `ifconfig` is this doc : http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Ifconfig  still  valid ?
[2012-03-09 14:07:00 -0500] jespada: Guys, now that chef use `ip` instead of `ifconfig` is this doc : http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Ifconfig  still  valid ? < I can take a look at source code too
[2012-03-09 14:28:00 -0500] laurent\: jespada: sure it's still valid, ohai is just going to use ip instead of ifconfig when iproute2 is installed
[2012-03-09 14:29:00 -0500] laurent\: would make sense if there were a iproute2 resource now :)
[2012-03-09 14:34:00 -0500] jespada: laurent\, oh ohai.. was the one who changed ip over ifconfig.. but i was wandering if the change will also happen on the ifconfig provider.. since ifconfig is kinda unmaintained , plus `ip` can have access to other kernel stuff
[2012-03-09 14:36:00 -0500] jespada: I think I write some where on my chef-todo.org  trying rewrite it whit ip command
[2012-03-09 14:37:00 -0500] jtimberman: i think there was a ticket for adding an iproute2 provider
[2012-03-09 14:38:00 -0500] jespada: jtimberman, :)  will take look
[2012-03-09 18:15:00 -0500] hoover_damm: fwiw I added logs.likens.us for google to crawl
[2012-03-09 18:15:00 -0500] hoover_damm: stupid webmaster tools make things more fun then a shotgun to the face
[2012-03-09 18:15:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and i'm not really positive that will start the index as no one is querying for it yet
[2012-03-09 18:16:00 -0500] hoover_damm: but at least I can see crawl errors and crap now
[2012-03-09 18:34:00 -0500] btm: hoover_damm: cool. community.opscode.com is getting some IRC log type features. they're written but only deployed in preprod so far.
[2012-03-09 18:37:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yeah i'm aware
[2012-03-09 18:37:00 -0500] hoover_damm: coderanger has mentioned it already
[2012-03-09 18:37:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I really didn't set out 2 years ago + to log #chef and #chef-hacking forever
[2012-03-09 18:37:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and I don't mind logging it forever really now
[2012-03-09 18:38:00 -0500] hoover_damm: (provided I stop getting banned)
[2012-03-09 19:07:00 -0500] btm: stupid unstable server...
[2012-03-09 19:07:00 -0500] btm: hoover_damm: we appreciate all your contributions.
[2012-03-09 19:10:00 -0500] hoover_damm: btm, I appreciate everything Opsode does to  make my day to day job easier.
[2012-03-09 19:10:00 -0500] hoover_damm: btm, so everything I do is in a selfish act to  make my job easier and better.
[2012-03-09 19:11:00 -0500] hoover_damm: if it happens to work for another
[2012-03-09 19:11:00 -0500] hoover_damm: awesome!
