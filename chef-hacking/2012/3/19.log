[2012-03-19 15:05:00 -0400] roidrage: knife bootstrap all the things!
[2012-03-19 15:07:00 -0400] roidrage: zomg, it worked!
[2012-03-19 15:19:00 -0400] roidrage: man, feels like forever since i've looked at chef server last ;)
[2012-03-19 15:26:00 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: :-D
[2012-03-19 15:26:00 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: yeah the first time i did knife ec2 server create it was magic
[2012-03-19 15:26:00 -0400] roidrage: expect dumb knife questions soon
[2012-03-19 15:26:00 -0400] roidrage: thankfully i'm not using ec2
[2012-03-19 15:26:00 -0400] jtimberman: hehehe
[2012-03-19 15:26:00 -0400] roidrage: i built that magic myself a while ago ;)
[2012-03-19 15:27:00 -0400] roidrage: first stupid question: how do i trigger a chef run using knife?
[2012-03-19 15:34:00 -0400] roidrage: okay ;)
[2012-03-19 15:38:00 -0400] roidrage: ah, knife ssh, got it
[2012-03-19 15:40:00 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: if you're running the chef client as a daemon, you can send it SIGUSR1 and it will wake up.
[2012-03-19 15:41:00 -0400] jtimberman: e.g., with runit: sv 1 chef-client
[2012-03-19 15:41:00 -0400] roidrage: i'm setting that up next
[2012-03-19 15:41:00 -0400] roidrage: baby steps :)
[2012-03-19 15:42:00 -0400] roidrage: after which i will ramble on about documentation ;)
[2012-03-19 15:42:00 -0400] paulmooring: roidrage: you could always just use knife ssh
[2012-03-19 15:42:00 -0400] roidrage: yeah, i'm not too sure about that
[2012-03-19 15:43:00 -0400] roidrage: but i may have to
[2012-03-19 15:44:00 -0400] paulmooring: there's not much of an alternative, Chef doesn't really push anything from the server clients check in when chef-client is run
[2012-03-19 15:44:00 -0400] paulmooring: so you need an external protocl (ssh) to force something to happen on clients
[2012-03-19 15:44:00 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: By documentation do you mean Chef's?
[2012-03-19 15:44:00 -0400] roidrage: yes
[2012-03-19 15:44:00 -0400] jtimberman: Actionable feedback is the best.
[2012-03-19 15:45:00 -0400] roidrage: first thing for the knife search help: it's much more helpful to have real search examples, not ones that involve field:{X TO Y}
[2012-03-19 15:46:00 -0400] roidrage: i do know that just complaining is pointless ;)
[2012-03-19 15:46:00 -0400] roidrage: just interesting to walka round with knife after all this time :)
[2012-03-19 15:48:00 -0400] roidrage: what i do wish the most (and i know it's happening eventually ;) is a good UI for chef server and/or hosted chef
[2012-03-19 15:50:00 -0400] roidrage: but i'm going to through hosted chef at the travis platform anyway :)
[2012-03-19 15:58:00 -0400] paulmooring: roidrage: the documentation does need some clean up, but if you're still looking for search examples/details http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Knife+Built+In+Subcommands#KnifeBuiltInSubcommands-Search
[2012-03-19 15:59:00 -0400] roidrage: yeah, i'm aware of the wiki
[2012-03-19 15:59:00 -0400] roidrage: but i like having my doco on the command line ;)
[2012-03-19 16:00:00 -0400] paulmooring: ah, I understand so you would put more examples under 'knife help search' rather than needing to pull up a wiki page
[2012-03-19 16:01:00 -0400] roidrage: yes
[2012-03-19 16:02:00 -0400] roidrage: that's the doco i was refering to, sorry if that wasn't clear
[2012-03-19 16:02:00 -0400] paulmooring: thanks for the input, I'm trying to clean up the wiki right now, so I'm curious as to where others look first for information
[2012-03-19 16:11:00 -0400] roidrage: does knife add new cookbooks to a git repo in the master branch?
[2012-03-19 16:23:00 -0400] paulmooring: roidrage: yes it does
[2012-03-19 16:23:00 -0400] roidrage: hrm
[2012-03-19 16:23:00 -0400] paulmooring: it also creates a chef-vendor-$cookbook branch
[2012-03-19 16:23:00 -0400] roidrage: not sure how i feel about that especially when i'm working on a different branch
[2012-03-19 16:24:00 -0400] paulmooring: roidrage: you can use 'knife cookbook site download' (as opposed to 'knife cookbook site install') to download the cookbook, but not do the install/git stuff if you want
[2012-03-19 16:24:00 -0400] roidrage: ah, nice, cheers
[2012-03-19 16:25:00 -0400] paulmooring: roidrage: you'll git a tarball in your pwd
[2012-03-19 16:25:00 -0400] paulmooring: s/git/get/
[2012-03-19 16:25:00 -0400] roidrage: ah, cool
[2012-03-19 16:25:00 -0400] paulmooring: I have git on my brain right now :)
[2012-03-19 16:25:00 -0400] roidrage: calls for a plugin that does something in between
[2012-03-19 16:28:00 -0400] roidrage: but it's nice, you get fluent quickly with knife ;)
[2012-03-19 16:43:00 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: you can specify which branch to merge / integrate with when running knife cookbook site instal
[2012-03-19 16:44:00 -0400] jtimberman: install
[2012-03-19 16:44:00 -0400] roidrage: oh look at that, that's nice too
[2012-03-19 18:39:00 -0400] roidrage: think knife and i will get along great
[2012-03-19 19:44:00 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, feels good doesn't it?
[2012-03-19 19:44:00 -0400] roidrage: well
[2012-03-19 19:44:00 -0400] roidrage: it feels okay
[2012-03-19 19:44:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it's different
[2012-03-19 19:44:00 -0400] hoover_damm: don't forget librarian
[2012-03-19 19:45:00 -0400] roidrage: well, it's different from how EY uses chef ;)
[2012-03-19 19:45:00 -0400] hoover_damm: :) it's what you want to make of it.
[2012-03-19 19:45:00 -0400] roidrage: which is all wrong
[2012-03-19 19:45:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I have no care for EY
[2012-03-19 19:45:00 -0400] roidrage: of course not
[2012-03-19 19:45:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so please don't put me and EY in the same sentance again
[2012-03-19 19:45:00 -0400] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-03-19 19:45:00 -0400] roidrage: okay
[2012-03-19 19:45:00 -0400] hoover_damm: that was a interesting learning point in my career
[2012-03-19 19:45:00 -0400] hoover_damm: now i'm back to using chef and having fun
[2012-03-19 19:45:00 -0400] roidrage: good on ya
[2012-03-19 19:46:00 -0400] hoover_damm: no more staying back in 2008 for no valid reason
[2012-03-19 19:46:00 -0400] jtimberman: 2008 was a great year if you weren't the economy
[2012-03-19 19:47:00 -0400] mattray: 2008 was the prime of RHEL 5
[2012-03-19 19:47:00 -0400] mattray: note that people are still using it :(
[2012-03-19 19:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: basically, I joined EY to escape a bad company... and that was a bad decision
[2012-03-19 19:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I learned a lot
[2012-03-19 19:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: which was good
[2012-03-19 19:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: now to move on
[2012-03-19 19:54:00 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, funny coincidence people still use ey
[2012-03-19 19:56:00 -0400] bigfleet: hoover_damm: What's next for Team Damm?
[2012-03-19 19:56:00 -0400] hoover_damm: bigfleet, oh I'm actually working for a client in NY currently (part time)
[2012-03-19 19:57:00 -0400] hoover_damm: bigfleet, and working with a friend for another part time contract
[2012-03-19 19:57:00 -0400] bigfleet: Very cool-- are you thinking more client work is in your future?
[2012-03-19 19:57:00 -0400] hoover_damm: between the two it's a good 30hours a week
[2012-03-19 19:57:00 -0400] hoover_damm: honestly, I'm pretty bitter about corporate life
[2012-03-19 19:57:00 -0400] bigfleet: LOL, how could that have happened
[2012-03-19 19:57:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I'm tired of the startup lies
[2012-03-19 19:58:00 -0400] hoover_damm: after beind pounded in my head for decades all the lies about how they'll do this and that
[2012-03-19 19:58:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I'm going back to my cynical ways and not trusting anyone except a few
[2012-03-19 19:58:00 -0400] bigfleet: Tough world out there
[2012-03-19 19:58:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it was a fun ride at EY towards the end being their 'Chef Manager' and release manager
[2012-03-19 19:59:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and being able to try and update EYCloud
[2012-03-19 19:59:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but terribly dramatic and rough
[2012-03-19 19:59:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and unneccesarily
[2012-03-19 19:59:00 -0400] bigfleet: "fun"
[2012-03-19 19:59:00 -0400] hoover_damm: if you know the secret codeword you can get thin on eycloud
[2012-03-19 20:00:00 -0400] hoover_damm: they never made it official because they didn't want to polute the stack
[2012-03-19 20:00:00 -0400] bigfleet: Introduce more to support when it's maybe a little thin as it is
[2012-03-19 20:00:00 -0400] hoover_damm: lol ronin features:enable ..
[2012-03-19 20:00:00 -0400] bigfleet: Yeah, I remember
[2012-03-19 20:01:00 -0400] hoover_damm: the people I loved :)
[2012-03-19 20:01:00 -0400] bigfleet: Quite a thing, that gig.
[2012-03-19 20:03:00 -0400] bigfleet: The reason I asked about client work-- as an ex-freelancer, opportunities come my way from time to time, wanted to know if you wanted a chance to look at them.
[2012-03-19 20:03:00 -0400] hoover_damm: if it's chefy stuff sure... I'm kinda enjoying mentoring atm
[2012-03-19 20:03:00 -0400] hoover_damm: that's actually what one of my gigs is, it's not just working but it's mentoring their staff
[2012-03-19 20:03:00 -0400] bigfleet: Oh man, stick with it
[2012-03-19 20:03:00 -0400] bigfleet: Perfect for you
[2012-03-19 20:04:00 -0400] hoover_damm: just basic learning but at the same time it's just like sharing good ideas as we go on through the day
[2012-03-19 20:04:00 -0400] hoover_damm: 100% remote w/ skype
[2012-03-19 20:04:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so its +1 for me for now
[2012-03-19 20:04:00 -0400] hoover_damm: just tmux and emacs
[2012-03-19 20:04:00 -0400] bigfleet: That's great to hear
[2012-03-19 20:04:00 -0400] hoover_damm: documenting in markup or org-mode
[2012-03-19 20:05:00 -0400] ampledata: what's the deal with ey, do they hemorrhage people?
[2012-03-19 20:05:00 -0400] ampledata: i've met so many ex-ey's
[2012-03-19 20:05:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I thought it was incredibly lame, and to have coworkers who run <insert notepad> heckle you for running emacs
[2012-03-19 20:05:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it's like oi when did you get stupid?
[2012-03-19 20:05:00 -0400] hoover_damm: that was another great thing about leaving EY, the browser wars
[2012-03-19 20:05:00 -0400] bigfleet: I foresee an improvement in happiness of about 20x.  :-)
[2012-03-19 20:06:00 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, ey hemmorrages people like a gaping wound
[2012-03-19 20:06:00 -0400] bigfleet: It's time someone did an EY alumni twitter list
[2012-03-19 20:06:00 -0400] hoover_damm: when they opened their office in portland the had such a bad name
[2012-03-19 20:06:00 -0400] hoover_damm: they had a real rough time hiring
[2012-03-19 20:06:00 -0400] bigfleet: I am absolutely sure it would be dozens, it might be closer to 100
[2012-03-19 20:06:00 -0400] ampledata: oh really
[2012-03-19 20:06:00 -0400] jtimberman: everyone heckles everyone else who doesn't use their same editor.
[2012-03-19 20:06:00 -0400] ampledata: i've never worked with them myself
[2012-03-19 20:06:00 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, it's childish
[2012-03-19 20:07:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and petty
[2012-03-19 20:07:00 -0400] ampledata: jt uses wordpad i bet
[2012-03-19 20:07:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and to do among coworkers is /WRONG/
[2012-03-19 20:07:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it's wrong in irc
[2012-03-19 20:07:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it's hella wrong on the job
[2012-03-19 20:07:00 -0400] bigfleet: The corporate leadership at EY is solving a different problem than the engineering problems their staff cares about
[2012-03-19 20:08:00 -0400] jtimberman: if you are most productive in notepad, rock it.
[2012-03-19 20:08:00 -0400] bigfleet: That introduces an incredible amount of tension for the engineering staff
[2012-03-19 20:08:00 -0400] hoover_damm: for me it started with the noops stuff from John
[2012-03-19 20:08:00 -0400] hoover_damm: as I consider my heritage to be a sysadmin more of a systems engineer now
[2012-03-19 20:08:00 -0400] mattray: I heckle jtimberman for using emacs different from me
[2012-03-19 20:09:00 -0400] hoover_damm: It broke my heart to see the company I work for saying that
[2012-03-19 20:09:00 -0400] jtimberman: mattray: totally
[2012-03-19 20:09:00 -0400] jtimberman: mattray: schisamo did
[2012-03-19 20:09:00 -0400] jtimberman: "zomg you're not using el-get!"
[2012-03-19 20:09:00 -0400] jtimberman: ....
[2012-03-19 20:09:00 -0400] mattray: lol
[2012-03-19 20:10:00 -0400] hoover_damm: why not?
[2012-03-19 20:10:00 -0400] hoover_damm: j/k
[2012-03-19 20:10:00 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah that's actually become a question on my interviews that likely comes out wrong
[2012-03-19 20:11:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but I am tired of being the black sheep for running emacs
[2012-03-19 20:11:00 -0400] hoover_damm: when the black sheep should be the nano/textmate users
[2012-03-19 20:11:00 -0400] ampledata: nanon != texmate
[2012-03-19 20:11:00 -0400] ampledata: er
[2012-03-19 20:11:00 -0400] ampledata: nano
[2012-03-19 20:11:00 -0400] paulmooring: I just flat out refuse to work with non-vim users to avoid these conversations
[2012-03-19 20:11:00 -0400] hoover_damm: ever pair with nano over tmux and skype?
[2012-03-19 20:11:00 -0400] ampledata: n/m my argument is invalid i can't type
[2012-03-19 20:11:00 -0400] hoover_damm: the horror
[2012-03-19 20:12:00 -0400] hoover_damm: that's all I can say
[2012-03-19 20:12:00 -0400] hoover_damm: especially as an emacs user with xon/xoff enabled
[2012-03-19 20:12:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I was useless
[2012-03-19 20:12:00 -0400] jtimberman: yeah like. Jim Weirich uses Emacs. Whats up, Rubyists.
[2012-03-19 20:12:00 -0400] jtimberman: ampledata: its easy to make macros in emacs to type for you ;)
[2012-03-19 20:13:00 -0400] ampledata: new rule: discussing editor debates eventually leads to an editor debate
[2012-03-19 20:13:00 -0400] jtimberman: metadebates
[2012-03-19 20:13:00 -0400] ampledata: speaking of which
[2012-03-19 20:24:00 -0400] atomic-penguin: M-x tetrix

[2012-03-19 20:48:00 -0400] ampledata: hey we're hiring python people in SF or BA, in case anyone knows anyone
[2012-03-19 22:15:00 -0400] ash__: hi guys - what's the correct way to retrieve node attributes from a knife script? http://pastebin.com/CeMbmuaC?
[2012-03-19 22:15:00 -0400] ash__: http://pastebin.com/CeMbmuaC rather
[2012-03-19 22:19:00 -0400] hoover_damm: Is this really neccesary? 
[2012-03-19 22:19:00 -0400] hoover_damm: %w{redis}.collect do |gem|
[2012-03-19 22:19:00 -0400] hoover_damm:   gem_package gem do
[2012-03-19 22:19:00 -0400] hoover_damm:     gem_binary("gem")

[2012-03-19 22:19:00 -0400] hoover_damm: end
[2012-03-19 22:19:00 -0400] hoover_damm: your installing 1 gem, and yet you wrapped it in %w why?
[2012-03-19 22:20:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and no one has to answer
[2012-03-19 22:20:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm not expecting one
[2012-03-19 22:28:00 -0400] ampledata: i could see that making sense if you're trying to create an array of the result of gem_package
[2012-03-19 22:29:00 -0400] ampledata: results = ['redis'].collect{|g| gem_package(g) }
[2012-03-19 22:29:00 -0400] ampledata: although i don't know what gem_package actually returns?
[2012-03-19 23:21:00 -0400] hoover_damm: tiz a resource
[2012-03-19 23:30:00 -0400] laurent\: it guess it's simply because he/she thought there would/could be more that one gem package to install in this recipe
[2012-03-19 23:31:00 -0400] laurent\: s/it/I/
