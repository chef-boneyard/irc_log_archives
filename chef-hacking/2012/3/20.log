[2012-03-20 09:16:00 -0400] Anand: hello there
[2012-03-20 09:16:00 -0400] Anand: i am new in opscode chef
[2012-03-20 09:16:00 -0400] Anand: can anybody help me
[2012-03-20 09:16:00 -0400] Anand: ??
[2012-03-20 09:17:00 -0400] Anand: hello
[2012-03-20 09:17:00 -0400] laurent\: the #chef channel might be a better place to ask, most of the guys are sleeping here :)
[2012-03-20 09:18:00 -0400] Anand: i have configure one node in organizatoin
[2012-03-20 09:18:00 -0400] Anand: on EC2
[2012-03-20 09:18:00 -0400] Anand: now what to do
[2012-03-20 09:18:00 -0400] Anand: ??
[2012-03-20 09:18:00 -0400] Anand: how to use chef for that node
[2012-03-20 09:18:00 -0400] Anand: ??
[2012-03-20 09:19:00 -0400] laurent\: have you looked at http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Fast+Start+Guide ?
[2012-03-20 09:20:00 -0400] Anand: yes..but get confused
[2012-03-20 09:20:00 -0400] Anand: i m on win7
[2012-03-20 09:20:00 -0400] Anand: and had installed the package that they provide
[2012-03-20 09:20:00 -0400] Anand: also installed the gem chef as i have ruby installed
[2012-03-20 09:20:00 -0400] Anand: on my machine
[2012-03-20 09:23:00 -0400] laurent\: sorry i'm a bit busy at the moment, you'll find more chef users on the #chef channel
[2012-03-20 09:24:00 -0400] Anand: hey laurent forget all...can u just tell me one simple scenario to manage instance?
[2012-03-20 09:26:00 -0400] Anand: or some link to refer where i can understand chef easily
[2012-03-20 09:26:00 -0400] Anand: ?
[2012-03-20 09:26:00 -0400] roidrage: Anand: it doesn't get much faster than this for ec2: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/EC2+Bootstrap+Fast+Start+Guide
[2012-03-20 09:27:00 -0400] roidrage: read this for a general introduction: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Basics
[2012-03-20 09:28:00 -0400] Anand: thanks laurent and roidrage..
[2012-03-20 14:24:00 -0400] Anand: hey guys having problem of ssh
[2012-03-20 14:25:00 -0400] Anand: i have created an instance on EC2 using knife but at bootstraping stge it is asking for password
[2012-03-20 14:25:00 -0400] laurent\: Anand: told you => #chef, it's a bit more lively over there :)
[2012-03-20 14:29:00 -0400] Anand: laurent : ok..but u r more lively here..
[2012-03-20 14:29:00 -0400] Anand: :-D
[2012-03-20 19:09:00 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, is there a reason why knife-rackspace hasn't been updated in awhile? 
[2012-03-20 19:09:00 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, (roughly 30days) and can we lift the fog dependency on it to just go for whatever is current?
[2012-03-20 19:09:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it really sucks to debug rackspace issues with old fog gems
[2012-03-20 19:09:00 -0400] hoover_damm: :|
[2012-03-20 20:12:00 -0400] fujin: yo
[2012-03-20 20:16:00 -0400] roidrage: sup
[2012-03-20 20:16:00 -0400] fujin: fuck all
[2012-03-20 20:17:00 -0400] fujin: revitalizing some of our workflow this week. dropped skype for voice & group chat, moved to grove.io for hosted IRC & mumble for call/group voice
[2012-03-20 20:17:00 -0400] fujin: killing drobpox for git + sparkleshare too
[2012-03-20 20:18:00 -0400] roidrage: hope grove works out for you
[2012-03-20 20:18:00 -0400] roidrage: we had mysterious netsplits with it, and lots of them
[2012-03-20 20:18:00 -0400] roidrage: we eventually moved to campfire
[2012-03-20 20:18:00 -0400] fujin: i doubt it will, but I am not really phased about running my own IRC server
[2012-03-20 20:18:00 -0400] fujin: probably end up on the same boxen as the Mumble node.
[2012-03-20 20:19:00 -0400] fujin: s/my own/our own/
[2012-03-20 20:19:00 -0400] roidrage: yeah, i wouldn't want to do that either ;)
[2012-03-20 20:19:00 -0400] roidrage: it just wasn't a great experience
[2012-03-20 20:20:00 -0400] fujin: really? I've been running irc servers for more than 15 years
[2012-03-20 20:20:00 -0400] fujin: never really had much drama with it
[2012-03-20 20:20:00 -0400] fujin: depending on the ircd, of course ;)
[2012-03-20 20:20:00 -0400] roidrage: i mean using grove wasn't a great experience
[2012-03-20 20:20:00 -0400] fujin: oh. word
[2012-03-20 20:20:00 -0400] roidrage: for irc, i never was too much into that ;)
[2012-03-20 20:21:00 -0400] roidrage: always preferred campfire for group/team chats
[2012-03-20 20:21:00 -0400] c_t: I still haven't really figured out why campfire's supposed to be better than IRC
[2012-03-20 20:23:00 -0400] fujin: ugh, horrible experience. we have a bunch of clients using it. I totes prefer IRC, which is why we're using it for internal :)
[2012-03-20 20:23:00 -0400] roidrage: to each his own
[2012-03-20 20:24:00 -0400] fujin: whaddya like, audio and text snippets and stuff?
[2012-03-20 20:24:00 -0400] fujin: definitely more useful for hubot lolz
[2012-03-20 20:24:00 -0400] roidrage: haha
[2012-03-20 20:24:00 -0400] roidrage: the snippets alone make it pretty useful
[2012-03-20 20:24:00 -0400] roidrage: plus attachments
[2012-03-20 20:24:00 -0400] roidrage: we had hubot on grove too
[2012-03-20 20:24:00 -0400] fujin: yeah, I have hubot on grove as well. and it does have images in the webui
[2012-03-20 20:24:00 -0400] roidrage: yup
[2012-03-20 20:24:00 -0400] fujin: but no images or any of that shit on my motherfucking ERC
[2012-03-20 20:25:00 -0400] roidrage: should use linkinus, that embeds images ;)
[2012-03-20 20:26:00 -0400] fujin: I don't run OSX
[2012-03-20 20:27:00 -0400] roidrage: aw, shame
[2012-03-20 20:27:00 -0400] fujin: I definitely disagree, but yeah
[2012-03-20 20:27:00 -0400] roidrage: haha
[2012-03-20 20:28:00 -0400] roidrage: just sayin, you could have embedded images in irc
[2012-03-20 20:28:00 -0400] fujin: I don't *want* embedded images in irc
[2012-03-20 20:29:00 -0400] fujin: roidrage: what were you seeing when the netsplits happened on grove?
[2012-03-20 20:29:00 -0400] fujin: like some clients can't see others? i had a hubot disconnect over night and not reconnect until I restarted it
[2012-03-20 20:29:00 -0400] fujin: just assumed it to be a shitty node problem
[2012-03-20 20:30:00 -0400] roidrage: it wsa some people not being able to see what others wrote
[2012-03-20 20:30:00 -0400] fujin: oh gnarly
[2012-03-20 20:30:00 -0400] hoover_damm: huh
[2012-03-20 20:30:00 -0400] fujin: like full on timesync drift
[2012-03-20 20:30:00 -0400] hoover_damm: why can't irc be irc?
[2012-03-20 20:30:00 -0400] roidrage: so you couldn't actually be sure if people could read what you were typing and the other way around
[2012-03-20 20:30:00 -0400] roidrage: it got pretty annoying
[2012-03-20 20:30:00 -0400] fujin: yeah, that would be a deal breaker f'sho
[2012-03-20 20:30:00 -0400] roidrage: maybe they fixed it, but it threw us off
[2012-03-20 20:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: gosh i'm so glad my client picked to host their own irc server
[2012-03-20 20:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: instead of sign up for grove
[2012-03-20 20:32:00 -0400] hoover_damm: their webui sounded weird... but that issue has to be damned annoying
[2012-03-20 20:32:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and it would tripup the novie user hard
[2012-03-20 20:33:00 -0400] fujin: what ircd did you guys go with?
[2012-03-20 20:33:00 -0400] fujin: trying to think which one I'd pick for extensibility
[2012-03-20 20:34:00 -0400] fujin: Sonian developed a cool one while I was there that is fully encrypted, written in clojure
[2012-03-20 20:34:00 -0400] fujin: https://github.com/danlarkin/subrosa
[2012-03-20 20:34:00 -0400] fujin: iirc
[2012-03-20 20:34:00 -0400] fujin: composable o_O
[2012-03-20 20:36:00 -0400] hoover_damm: lemme ask
[2012-03-20 20:36:00 -0400] hoover_damm: inspircd
[2012-03-20 20:36:00 -0400] fujin: cool
[2012-03-20 20:36:00 -0400] fujin: if i had to pick one based off familiarity, i'd go with UnrealIRCd or Hybrid/Ratbox
[2012-03-20 20:36:00 -0400] fujin: been so long though ;)
[2012-03-20 20:37:00 -0400] roidrage: i actually liked their web ui ;)
[2012-03-20 20:37:00 -0400] fujin: yeah the ui is campfirey
[2012-03-20 20:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: campfire got pretty unstable for me towards the end @ ey
[2012-03-20 20:53:00 -0400] jtimberman: hipchat!
[2012-03-20 20:55:00 -0400] roidrage: lol
[2012-03-20 21:04:00 -0400] roidrage: is there a flag in node that i can use to determine if solo is running or not?
[2012-03-20 21:05:00 -0400] fujin: Chef::Config[solo
[2012-03-20 21:05:00 -0400] fujin: ugh fucked that up
[2012-03-20 21:05:00 -0400] roidrage: heh
[2012-03-20 21:05:00 -0400] fujin: Config[:solo]
[2012-03-20 21:08:00 -0400] roidrage: that works, cheers!
[2012-03-20 21:09:00 -0400] hoover_damm: hipchat has a xmpp backend
[2012-03-20 21:09:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so you can do hipchat air ugly or just ichat
[2012-03-20 21:12:00 -0400] roidrage: admit it, you prefer hipchat air ugly
[2012-03-20 21:21:00 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, I only admit that your mother smells like elderberries
[2012-03-20 21:21:00 -0400] roidrage: that's nice
[2012-03-20 21:22:00 -0400] hoover_damm: that wonderful rosey nice
[2012-03-20 21:22:00 -0400] hoover_damm: smell
[2012-03-20 21:22:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I actualy like elderberries so I didn't mean any ill
[2012-03-20 21:22:00 -0400] hoover_damm: pardon if you read any
[2012-03-20 21:22:00 -0400] roidrage: so you like my mother?
[2012-03-20 21:22:00 -0400] hoover_damm: roidrage, I don't do air apps.  They break in multi-screen hardcore
[2012-03-20 21:22:00 -0400] roidrage: heh, yeah
[2012-03-20 21:23:00 -0400] roidrage: i hate that stuff, every service relying on air has lost to me
[2012-03-20 21:23:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so i'm being mindful of my investment
[2012-03-20 21:23:00 -0400] hoover_damm: as 2.25k for monitors is an investment
[2012-03-20 21:24:00 -0400] roidrage: i feel so humble with my 24" display
[2012-03-20 21:24:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i stepped up to 27" and i've used ips
[2012-03-20 21:24:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and i want ips .. soo
[2012-03-20 21:24:00 -0400] hoover_damm: :/
[2012-03-20 21:24:00 -0400] hoover_damm: my wallet sucks it out
[2012-03-20 21:24:00 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-03-20 21:24:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I got so much debt to payback too
[2012-03-20 21:25:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so my monitors are a bit off
[2012-03-20 21:25:00 -0400] roidrage: those screens are too big for my eyes to wonder over
[2012-03-20 21:25:00 -0400] roidrage: plus, a full screen terminal looks ridiculous on them ;)
[2012-03-20 21:25:00 -0400] hoover_damm: only you
[2012-03-20 21:25:00 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: I'm reading this on a full screen terminal on a 27" monitor.
[2012-03-20 21:25:00 -0400] jtimberman: its cool.
[2012-03-20 21:25:00 -0400] roidrage: show-off
[2012-03-20 21:26:00 -0400] jtimberman: but its in tmux, so splitterific.
[2012-03-20 21:26:00 -0400] roidrage: yeah, with tmux, it's cool
[2012-03-20 21:26:00 -0400] roidrage: glad i re-newed my vowls with tmux
[2012-03-20 21:28:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i bought the tmux book just to read it
[2012-03-20 21:28:00 -0400] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-03-20 21:28:00 -0400] roidrage: it's a great book
[2012-03-20 21:28:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i love their silly idea on how to do multi-user tmux pairing sessions
[2012-03-20 21:29:00 -0400] hoover_damm: totally works
[2012-03-20 21:29:00 -0400] roidrage: i actually remembered a lot of stuff in it, but it's been a great refresher for me
[2012-03-20 21:29:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but LOL
[2012-03-20 21:33:00 -0400] roidrage: need to think of a convenient way to trigger chef-client from the command line and watch the remote log
[2012-03-20 21:33:00 -0400] roidrage: too many manual steps :)
[2012-03-20 21:34:00 -0400] hoover_damm: lein new dashboard
[2012-03-20 21:34:00 -0400] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-03-20 21:34:00 -0400] hoover_damm: go code
[2012-03-20 21:35:00 -0400] roidrage: huh?
[2012-03-20 21:36:00 -0400] hoover_damm: :( yes that was lame
[2012-03-20 21:38:00 -0400] roidrage: (+ roidrage chef)
[2012-03-20 21:40:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but you can make a dashbboard in noir or enhance what jaime started on aether
[2012-03-20 21:40:00 -0400] hoover_damm: (fearoffish)
[2012-03-20 21:40:00 -0400] hoover_damm: aether is likely what most ex-ey customers will use as  you'll just want a basic dashboard
[2012-03-20 21:41:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and it won't let you run chef or view your logs, but you can see and click to ssh and :) code more that  you need easily
[2012-03-20 21:41:00 -0400] roidrage: i actually want to do that from the comfort of my command line
[2012-03-20 21:43:00 -0400] hoover_damm: knife ssh node name:web1 -x ubuntu "sudo su -c "/bin/bash --login 'chef-client'""
[2012-03-20 21:43:00 -0400] hoover_damm: hrm, wow can that suck a little less?
[2012-03-20 21:43:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i hate that about ubuntu on ec2
[2012-03-20 21:43:00 -0400] roidrage: thankfully i'm not on ec2 ;)
[2012-03-20 21:43:00 -0400] hoover_damm: rackspace gives me root... but canocial thought it'd be cute
[2012-03-20 21:43:00 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah ec2 sucks
[2012-03-20 21:43:00 -0400] roidrage: i'm on real servers, bitch!
[2012-03-20 21:44:00 -0400] hoover_damm: scaling on ec2 is like scaling on a toaster oven with a 5.25" floppy raided over a 9600 baud modem
[2012-03-20 21:45:00 -0400] roidrage: i'm sure eventually you'll get eth1 for extra money
[2012-03-20 21:45:00 -0400] roidrage: i mean my servers comes with ssds ;)
[2012-03-20 21:45:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i really don't see ec2 getting better to scale on until they move EBS off of eth0
[2012-03-20 21:45:00 -0400] roidrage: even comes with EBS: Extremely Bitchin' SSDs
[2012-03-20 21:45:00 -0400] hoover_damm: meh their ssd's make my sas disks look good
[2012-03-20 21:46:00 -0400] hoover_damm: oh good
[2012-03-20 21:46:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i hope to land a client soon that does hardware
[2012-03-20 21:46:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i miss hardware
[2012-03-20 21:46:00 -0400] roidrage: i actually don't miss it, but it's nice to have, because we run virtualization on it :)
[2012-03-20 21:46:00 -0400] roidrage: gonna hook it up to lxc eventually
[2012-03-20 21:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: right
[2012-03-20 21:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: gotta lxc it
[2012-03-20 21:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: lxc + no hypervisor with ssd's should make several good different mongo instances
[2012-03-20 21:47:00 -0400] roidrage: haha
[2012-03-20 21:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: doubt there's enough profit to run a business like that
[2012-03-20 21:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: you'd spend more times putting out customers fires because mongo sucks so badly
[2012-03-20 21:48:00 -0400] roidrage: yeah, that's why we got ssds and that's why we're going for lxc, that way virtualized continuous integration runs get full benefits
[2012-03-20 21:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I mean they even f'ed up _id
[2012-03-20 21:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but i've always said that.
[2012-03-20 21:49:00 -0400] roidrage: heh
[2012-03-20 21:49:00 -0400] hoover_damm: you look at sequences and then look at autoincrement and you look at how _id is generated on mongodb
[2012-03-20 21:49:00 -0400] roidrage: meh, i stoped caring about it, you know
[2012-03-20 21:49:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and you'd pick mongodb why? your stupid?
[2012-03-20 21:49:00 -0400] hoover_damm: or you stopped caring
[2012-03-20 21:49:00 -0400] hoover_damm: right, more people stop caring
[2012-03-20 21:49:00 -0400] hoover_damm: new people come up with no clue
[2012-03-20 21:49:00 -0400] roidrage: people coming to travis ci want to run mongodb, so meh
[2012-03-20 21:50:00 -0400] hoover_damm: travis ci is on heroku no?
[2012-03-20 21:50:00 -0400] roidrage: the services are running on heroku
[2012-03-20 21:50:00 -0400] hoover_damm: right
[2012-03-20 21:50:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm not shocked, ruby users want what they want
[2012-03-20 21:51:00 -0400] roidrage: yeah
[2012-03-20 21:51:00 -0400] hoover_damm: travis ci will have to run riak and cassandra and voldy soon enough
[2012-03-20 21:51:00 -0400] roidrage: travis runs riak
[2012-03-20 21:51:00 -0400] roidrage: and redis, and couchdb ;)
[2012-03-20 21:51:00 -0400] hoover_damm: crazy
[2012-03-20 21:53:00 -0400] btm: hoover_damm: we've sucked at the knife-plugins. i took lead on them a few months back but I haven't developed a release schedule yet. I've got something starting in another week to start putting fuel on them.
[2012-03-20 21:54:00 -0400] roidrage: so maybe a knife-plugin would help me having something simple to run chef client on a machine and tail the log. hrm
[2012-03-20 21:55:00 -0400] roidrage: gotta look into that
[2012-03-20 21:55:00 -0400] fujin: heh, noticed 0.10.9 bootstrap defaults to chef-full.. awesome!
[2012-03-20 21:55:00 -0400] fujin: had been meaning to try it so the convenience factor++
[2012-03-20 21:56:00 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, :( heh we kinda don't mind one offing it as we're using our chef servers as a utility instance
[2012-03-20 21:56:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so we were just cloning and unfucking the gemspecs and installing :)
[2012-03-20 21:56:00 -0400] hoover_damm: updated fog gives us greater visibility into when rackspace is being lame
[2012-03-20 22:25:00 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: around
[2012-03-20 22:27:00 -0400] fujin: anyone using chef-full? do you install another ruby VM for services to use?
[2012-03-20 22:27:00 -0400] fujin: or just piggyback the opscode embedded one?
[2012-03-20 22:32:00 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: don't piggyback
[2012-03-20 22:32:00 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: deploy a ruby you want for the apps you need to deploy
[2012-03-20 22:41:00 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: as was my expectation
[2012-03-20 22:42:00 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: thanks for confirming
[2012-03-20 23:11:00 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: so.. gem_package on all of these cookbooks will still use the built in chef-full interpreter
[2012-03-20 23:11:00 -0400] fujin: have to hack them all to be hardcoded?
[2012-03-20 23:12:00 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: yeah.. there's a change for chef 0.10.10
[2012-03-20 23:12:00 -0400] jtimberman: adds chef_gem
[2012-03-20 23:12:00 -0400] jtimberman: for installing gems for chef to use
[2012-03-20 23:12:00 -0400] jtimberman: then gem_package will by default attempt to use the ruby interpreter in the $PATH
[2012-03-20 23:13:00 -0400] jtimberman: this is why omnibus chef-full is still "beta" - it will be officially released when we have chef 0.10.10 out the door.
[2012-03-20 23:13:00 -0400] jtimberman: course all our cookbooks need to be updated to use chef_gem when that happens :)
[2012-03-20 23:14:00 -0400] fujin: argh
[2012-03-20 23:14:00 -0400] fujin: I see
[2012-03-20 23:19:00 -0400] fujin: ugh. build essential needs to all be at compile time
[2012-03-20 23:23:00 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: any word in 10.10 timeline? would love to start using this properly
[2012-03-20 23:23:00 -0400] fujin: may backport stuff into a gem cookbook or something
[2012-03-20 23:28:00 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: btm has the word, if any
[2012-03-20 23:28:00 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: put build-essential in the bootstrap template :D
[2012-03-20 23:29:00 -0400] jtimberman: or in your provisioning
[2012-03-20 23:29:00 -0400] fujin:  yeah, sure
[2012-03-20 23:30:00 -0400] fujin: my just pull down chef-full and modify it a little
[2012-03-20 23:30:00 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: that's kind of lame, makes chef-full platform specific
[2012-03-20 23:31:00 -0400] fujin: just going to do that for now
[2012-03-20 23:32:00 -0400] hoover_damm: fujin, our bootstrap is fairly straight forward
[2012-03-20 23:32:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I can share it if you'd like
[2012-03-20 23:33:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I was a complete ass and made it debian specific (as it's an ubuntu bootstrap) but it's just easy to pull out the bits
[2012-03-20 23:33:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so it's likely not worth sharing
[2012-03-20 23:33:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it's all in how we handle if [ ! -f /path/to/chef-client ] ; then
[2012-03-20 23:35:00 -0400] fujin: I just added a few if exists apt-get
[2012-03-20 23:36:00 -0400] fujin: well one
[2012-03-20 23:36:00 -0400] fujin: and then if ! exists make
[2012-03-20 23:41:00 -0400] ampledata: coderanger are you going to merge in those chef 0.10 changes to pychef?
[2012-03-20 23:41:00 -0400] coderanger: ampledata: when I get a chance, yes
[2012-03-20 23:41:00 -0400] ampledata: ok cool
[2012-03-20 23:41:00 -0400] coderanger: ampledata: brain is still in post-pycon overload
[2012-03-20 23:42:00 -0400] ampledata: yeah that was fun
[2012-03-20 23:42:00 -0400] coderanger: reminds me, I have more paperwork for the PSF to go fill out and scan, wooooo
[2012-03-20 23:46:00 -0400] hoover_damm: fujin, ugh lame
[2012-03-20 23:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: fujin, mine is apt-get install -y build-essential wget -O /tmp/$filename $url && dpkg -i /tmp/$filename
[2012-03-20 23:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm:   echo "PATH=/opt/opscode/bin:$PATH:/opt/opscode/embedded/bin" > /etc/profile.d/omnibus.sh && chmod +x /etc/profile.d/omnibus.sh && source /etc/profile.d/omnibus.sh
[2012-03-20 23:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and that's it
[2012-03-20 23:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I honestly love how much faster booting an instance is with omnibus
[2012-03-20 23:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it makes you painfully aware of how stupid it is to install build-essential, ruby, rubygems, then chef... then bootstrap, then apt-get update again, then install crap
[2012-03-20 23:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: sucks
[2012-03-20 23:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: bad patter
[2012-03-20 23:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: pattern* that needs to hurt less
[2012-03-20 23:49:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and moving to omnibus was sweeet
[2012-03-20 23:49:00 -0400] hoover_damm: because it was like okay, we just need to re-bootstrap production with omnibus
[2012-03-20 23:49:00 -0400] hoover_damm: orly? yes rly
[2012-03-20 23:49:00 -0400] hoover_damm: win!
[2012-03-20 23:49:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and it was fast!
[2012-03-20 23:54:00 -0400] hoover_damm: btw I might be running chef on a few adserver boxes and installing collectd for you
[2012-03-20 23:54:00 -0400] hoover_damm: doing it on proxy-5 atm
