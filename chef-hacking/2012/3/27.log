[2012-03-27 15:47:23 -0400] fractaloop: Has anyone been able to successfully run the cucumber features?
[2012-03-27 15:47:43 -0400] btm: I did around the last Chef release.
[2012-03-27 15:48:00 -0400] btm: They're hefty so I slack too often and don't run them.
[2012-03-27 15:51:08 -0400] fractaloop: How did you get chef-solr going for rake dev:features? There is no solr-home.tar.gz or solr-jetty.tar.gz
[2012-03-27 15:54:14 -0400] btm: 'rake tar_solr' should create those now.
[2012-03-27 15:54:37 -0400] btm: fractaloop: see http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2553 for the background on that.
[2012-03-27 15:55:49 -0400] fractaloop: Oh thanks
[2012-03-27 17:41:03 -0400] holoway: it liiiiiiives
[2012-03-27 17:43:48 -0400] hoover_damm: who let holoway out of the closet?
[2012-03-27 17:45:33 -0400] holoway: :)
[2012-03-27 17:45:44 -0400] holoway: I like writing infrastructure code
[2012-03-27 17:45:48 -0400] holoway: that is fun
[2012-03-27 17:46:25 -0400] c_t: <@holoway> I also wear hair shirts, and flog myself every morning before breakfast.
[2012-03-27 17:46:41 -0400] holoway: c_t: It's been years since I wore the hair shirt
[2012-03-27 17:46:49 -0400] holoway: the flogging continues until morale improves, though
[2012-03-27 17:47:55 -0400] hoover_damm: what happens when they start to like the flogging?
[2012-03-27 17:48:24 -0400] c_t: I think the breaking wheel gets rolled out
[2012-03-27 17:48:26 -0400] holoway: hoover_damm: things get :(
[2012-03-27 17:48:47 -0400] holoway: building demonstrations of continous infrastructure without a central co-ordinator
[2012-03-27 17:49:04 -0400] holoway: it's neato
[2012-03-27 17:49:28 -0400] holoway: hard to tell if it's because, in skeptomai's words, I'm in my own little skinner box
[2012-03-27 17:49:32 -0400] hoover_damm: :o
[2012-03-27 17:49:37 -0400] holoway: and everytime the blocks turn green I get food
[2012-03-27 17:49:48 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-03-27 17:49:58 -0400] hoover_damm: sounds like you've been having too much fun there
[2012-03-27 17:49:59 -0400] hoover_damm: glad to hear it
[2012-03-27 17:50:17 -0400] holoway: but I can control how applications roll out across the infrastructure with like 10 lines of json inside the application repository
[2012-03-27 17:50:30 -0400] holoway: which is pretty nat
[2012-03-27 17:50:33 -0400] holoway: s/nat/neat/g
[2012-03-27 17:51:09 -0400] hoover_damm: self discovering distributed coordinator
[2012-03-27 17:51:17 -0400] hoover_damm: with no master
[2012-03-27 17:51:32 -0400] holoway: yep
[2012-03-27 17:51:41 -0400] c_t: what could possibly go wrong
[2012-03-27 17:51:59 -0400] holoway: although, more accurate to say that each node is responsible for the entirety of it's state
[2012-03-27 17:52:15 -0400] holoway: and it's making decisions based on what it can see about the infrastructure
[2012-03-27 17:52:24 -0400] hoover_damm: game on
[2012-03-27 17:52:36 -0400] holoway: cause there really isn't anything distributed about it
[2012-03-27 17:52:42 -0400] hoover_damm: well right, I was thinking each node would keep it's own metadata
[2012-03-27 17:52:44 -0400] holoway: nodes aren't talking to each other at all
[2012-03-27 17:52:46 -0400] hoover_damm: but discover it and share it
[2012-03-27 17:52:47 -0400] holoway: hoover_damm: exactly
[2012-03-27 17:52:50 -0400] holoway: yep
[2012-03-27 17:52:53 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm quasi on share
[2012-03-27 17:52:58 -0400] hoover_damm: but damn how are we on the same page?
[2012-03-27 17:53:09 -0400] hoover_damm: this was just a dream of mine, how did you code it?
[2012-03-27 17:53:15 -0400] c_t: maybe the nodes should post their status on Facebook and Twitter!
[2012-03-27 17:53:23 -0400] holoway: a little more elbow grease and I'll make a movie
[2012-03-27 17:53:35 -0400] holoway: hoover_damm: you can see all the bits and pieces on github
[2012-03-27 17:54:00 -0400] c_t: (For some reason, known only to God and themselves, when you make a new VM in Parallels it asks you if you want to share the fact that you just made a new VM on Twitter/Facebook/etc.)
[2012-03-27 17:54:01 -0400] hoover_damm: holoway, perhaps in time... currently making a ruby 1.9.3 ppa
[2012-03-27 17:54:18 -0400] c_t: ... it's beyond me why they'd think anyone could possibly ever care about that
[2012-03-27 17:54:25 -0400] hoover_damm: holoway, I'm quite sure one of my clients will bug me to poke at it
[2012-03-27 17:54:29 -0400] hoover_damm: and see if we can use it already
[2012-03-27 17:54:46 -0400] holoway: yeah, it's so not ready for prime time
[2012-03-27 17:55:06 -0400] holoway: the repository manager piece is ready for other people to hack on if they were so inclined
[2012-03-27 17:55:07 -0400] hoover_damm: c_t, different state of the problem
[2012-03-27 17:55:25 -0400] holoway: (it takes packages from arbitrary upstreams, imports them into a pool, and lets you create light-weight repositories)
[2012-03-27 17:55:30 -0400] holoway: (driven by an api)
[2012-03-27 17:55:45 -0400] holoway: c_t: yeah, I don't want twitter and facebook integration in my virtualization software
[2012-03-27 17:55:56 -0400] c_t: it's just *dumb*
[2012-03-27 17:55:58 -0400] hoover_damm: gosh that sounds like a idea i knew of
[2012-03-27 17:56:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but made better
[2012-03-27 17:56:28 -0400] hoover_damm: rails made private twitter accounts popular to share ip's over
[2012-03-27 17:56:44 -0400] c_t: I mean, tweeting about where you had lunch with Foursquare is fairly uninteresting, but that pales behind tweeting about firing up a new VM
[2012-03-27 17:56:46 -0400] hoover_damm: your config management just had to login to the twitter account and list the last tweets to determine the db_master ip
[2012-03-27 17:56:57 -0400] hoover_damm: what could be wrong with that right?
[2012-03-27 17:57:06 -0400] hoover_damm: </sarcasm>
[2012-03-27 17:57:13 -0400] c_t: "connecting to FAIL_WHALE..."
[2012-03-27 17:57:26 -0400] hoover_damm: not my fault you don't run squid
[2012-03-27 17:58:59 -0400] hoover_damm: do most people in here who use remote_file not add a not_if resource to block if the file exists already?
[2012-03-27 17:59:20 -0400] hoover_damm: I always felt it was proper to add a not_if file.exists to be a good 'net neighbor'
[2012-03-27 17:59:41 -0400] cwj: hoover_damm:  generally yes
[2012-03-27 18:00:12 -0400] hoover_damm: :(
[2012-03-27 18:00:24 -0400] hoover_damm: poor kittens
[2012-03-27 18:00:40 -0400] cwj: wat
[2012-03-27 18:01:38 -0400] hoover_damm: think about it, remote_file "/tmp/firefox.deb" do ...
[2012-03-27 18:01:53 -0400] hoover_damm: always fetching that 18meg file each time you run chef
[2012-03-27 18:01:59 -0400] cwj: oh i misread your question
[2012-03-27 18:02:01 -0400] hoover_damm: don't you think your a bad net citizen?
[2012-03-27 18:02:03 -0400] cwj: i do use not_if
[2012-03-27 18:02:11 -0400] hoover_damm: ah ok
[2012-03-27 21:55:04 -0400] hoover_damm: coderanger, so how far did you backfill the logs btw?
[2012-03-27 21:55:18 -0400] coderanger: Only up to the start of the year
[2012-03-27 21:55:22 -0400] hoover_damm: ahh
[2012-03-27 21:55:28 -0400] hoover_damm: no history?
[2012-03-27 21:55:30 -0400] hoover_damm: that's the best part
[2012-03-27 21:55:33 -0400] coderanger: The ingestion seems to like segfaulting on the production servers >_<
[2012-03-27 21:55:41 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-03-27 21:56:04 -0400] coderanger: so I have to restart it every two or three weeks
[2012-03-27 22:07:46 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-03-27 22:07:51 -0400] hoover_damm: that's silly
[2012-03-27 22:07:57 -0400] hoover_damm: must be ruby
[2012-03-27 22:08:22 -0400] coderanger: inorite
[2012-03-27 22:08:38 -0400] hoover_damm: I always heckle people for using Ruby and the json gem
[2012-03-27 22:08:47 -0400] hoover_damm: it's like they don't know the kind of doom they are beckoning
[2012-03-27 22:09:07 -0400] hoover_damm: json has to be one of the /worst/ gems ever
[2012-03-27 22:09:12 -0400] hoover_damm: or close to it
[2012-03-27 22:10:07 -0400] coderanger: hoover_damm: I found someone that re-implemented Rail's auto_link as a C extension, that has got to be up there in the running
[2012-03-27 22:11:41 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/tanoku/rinku
[2012-03-27 22:11:46 -0400] hoover_damm: for anyone who uses rails
[2012-03-27 22:11:49 -0400] hoover_damm: and wants to try different
[2012-03-27 22:12:18 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, thats the one
[2012-03-27 22:12:43 -0400] hoover_damm: didn't take much to find
[2012-03-27 22:12:45 -0400] coderanger: I smell buffer overflows like dead rats under a sinking barge
[2012-03-27 22:12:49 -0400] hoover_damm: right
[2012-03-27 22:12:53 -0400] hoover_damm: but because it's a C extension
[2012-03-27 22:13:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it's likely you won't know
