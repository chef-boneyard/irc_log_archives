[2012-03-02 00:13:00 -0500] jacques_chester: I have a question about review procedure
[2012-03-02 00:14:00 -0500] jacques_chester: I submitted a patch and closed a ticket, as it says on the wiki
[2012-03-02 00:14:00 -0500] jacques_chester: when I submit an updated patch, do I close the ticket again to trigger a new review?
[2012-03-02 00:21:00 -0500] jtimberman: jacques_chester: did you *close* the ticket or resolve it?
[2012-03-02 00:21:00 -0500] jtimberman: we review resolved untriaged tickets weekly
[2012-03-02 00:22:00 -0500] jtimberman: closed tickets won't show up in the search filter
[2012-03-02 00:22:00 -0500] jacques_chester: According to jira I marked it resolved
[2012-03-02 00:22:00 -0500] jacques_chester: Bryan reviewed, gave excellent feedback, then reopened
[2012-03-02 00:23:00 -0500] jacques_chester: (CHEF-2938 fwiw)
[2012-03-02 00:23:00 -0500] jacques_chester: so, to be correct, I should be marking it resolved?
[2012-03-02 00:25:00 -0500] kallistec: jacques_chester: yeah, we look for tickets marked resolved with triaged flag not set
[2012-03-02 00:26:00 -0500] jacques_chester: OK, I'll do that now.
[2012-03-02 00:28:00 -0500] c_t: hrm
[2012-03-02 00:28:00 -0500] laurent\: i've just re-resolved CHEF-2599 again. don't want it to be missed for .10.10
[2012-03-02 00:28:00 -0500] laurent\: :-)
[2012-03-02 00:28:00 -0500] c_t: unexpectedly installing packing is unexpected
[2012-03-02 00:28:00 -0500] c_t: package, even
[2012-03-02 00:29:00 -0500] laurent\: haven't had time to look at btm's gist for OHAI-325 yet
[2012-03-02 00:50:00 -0500] fujin: btm: how can we get the priority on 310 and the rackspace one raised? I don't have any other ideas for a fix but happy to help implement
[2012-03-02 00:53:00 -0500] btm: fujin: I don't know that there is a priority to get raised on them, we just need to figure out a solution. Maybe I can recruit another dev to join wednesdays triage meeting and we can try to brainstorm some more ourselves, but they aren't in the engineering backlog.
[2012-03-02 00:53:00 -0500] fujin: got ya
[2012-03-02 00:53:00 -0500] fujin: maybe the solution isn't to enable it all the time, but expliclity enable it?
[2012-03-02 00:53:00 -0500] btm: fujin: I think some folks need to spend some hours poking around the environments in search of anything unique.
[2012-03-02 00:54:00 -0500] btm: fujin: right, that was proposed. A workaround might be a mechanism for that sort of thing, maybe an enabled/forced ohai plugins attribute you could set in an ec2 role.
[2012-03-02 00:54:00 -0500] fujin: yeh synscanner was fastest way I could detect 169.254.169.245 on any network
[2012-03-02 00:54:00 -0500] btm: poor ohai lacks the mechanisms we really want here, but we should be able to find something.
[2012-03-02 00:54:00 -0500] fujin: reliably
[2012-03-02 00:55:00 -0500] fujin: but that requires pcap and other gross stuff
[2012-03-02 00:55:00 -0500] fujin: packetfu and pcap and shit
[2012-03-02 00:55:00 -0500] btm: and seems like it could scare enterprise security folks.
[2012-03-02 00:56:00 -0500] fujin: haha, for sure. those people are dumb
[2012-03-02 00:57:00 -0500] fujin: anyways.. hmm
[2012-03-02 00:57:00 -0500] fujin: a 2 second run time increase is kind of worth the fix at this stage, i would say
[2012-03-02 00:57:00 -0500] fujin: like optimizing that out of the fix may be asking a little much
[2012-03-02 00:57:00 -0500] fujin: you currently get no ec2 data for ohai on vpc instances
[2012-03-02 00:57:00 -0500] fujin: hasn't bit me badly yet, but I'm sure it will eventually :)
[2012-03-02 00:58:00 -0500] btm: maybe. but that also tempts us to ignore finding a solution because it works and then fixing it is just optimizing out a two-second delay. it would be bad form.
[2012-03-02 00:58:00 -0500] btm: I'll definitely talk to kallistec about it again at triage on wednesday at least.
[2012-03-02 00:59:00 -0500] yfeldblum: maybe the solution is to split the ec2 and rackspace gems out into separate ohai plugins that don't ship with ohai, and have your bootstrap template optionally install them if it detects that it's been invoked with `knife ec2 (server|rackspace) create`
[2012-03-02 01:00:00 -0500] btm: yfeldblum: I think having a whitelist of optional plugins would be easier then managing more gems.
[2012-03-02 01:03:00 -0500] yfeldblum: btm, but how to figure out whether to opt in to the plugin?
[2012-03-02 01:04:00 -0500] yfeldblum: it's easy to manage multiple gems if you manage them in one repo, release them all at once with identical versions, and have = dependency constraints, somewhat like is done with chef, chef-server-api, chef-server-webui, etc., but not like is done with chef vis a vis knife-rackspace
[2012-03-02 01:10:00 -0500] fujin: btm: thanks re: kallistec, and if you guys come up with anything, i'm glad to help out w/ testing
[2012-03-02 01:10:00 -0500] fujin: also agree WRT lazy bug fix, but I just wants my dataz.
[2012-03-02 01:11:00 -0500] fujin: It's also hard to monkeypatch? I think, the ec2 plugin
[2012-03-02 01:11:00 -0500] fujin: i tried a little bit but cannot recall getting it working
[2012-03-02 01:11:00 -0500] fujin: since it uses a method defined in an anonymous scope
[2012-03-02 01:11:00 -0500] fujin: o_0
[2012-03-02 01:29:00 -0500] laurent\: rotfl
[2012-03-02 01:31:00 -0500] fujin: i am going to fucking kill myself
[2012-03-02 01:31:00 -0500] jtimberman: fujin: thats unfortunate
[2012-03-02 01:31:00 -0500] jtimberman: fujin: then i won't see you at chefconf!
[2012-03-02 01:31:00 -0500] jtimberman: <3
[2012-03-02 01:32:00 -0500] fujin: language barriers are hard
[2012-03-02 02:14:00 -0500] spheromak: indeed
[2012-03-02 02:45:00 -0500] hoover_damm: is there any tickets regarding mash and well leaving extlib out of the client?
[2012-03-02 02:45:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I really need to install emacsjira
[2012-03-02 02:45:00 -0500] hoover_damm: or am I the devil who wants to not have Mash?
[2012-03-02 02:46:00 -0500] fujin: I'm pretty sure it doesn't use a Mash anymore?
[2012-03-02 02:46:00 -0500] fujin: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/node/attribute.rb
[2012-03-02 02:47:00 -0500] fujin: we rewrote it in like... 0.8 ? maybe, to not use Mash directly anymore
[2012-03-02 02:47:00 -0500] hoover_damm: fujin, I did some stupidity earlier
[2012-03-02 02:47:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and well got shocked with a mash!
[2012-03-02 02:47:00 -0500] hoover_damm: https://gist.github.com/f650503c7eb3ca705884
[2012-03-02 02:47:00 -0500] fujin: that's weird
[2012-03-02 02:47:00 -0500] hoover_damm: for your review
[2012-03-02 02:48:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I did find a work around that is meh, I basically make a hash in the recipe and then assign the content to the file resource
[2012-03-02 02:49:00 -0500] fujin: ahhh
[2012-03-02 02:49:00 -0500] fujin: it does use mash
[2012-03-02 02:49:00 -0500] fujin: it's a chef mash now, not an extlib one
[2012-03-02 02:49:00 -0500] fujin: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/node/attribute.rb#L377
[2012-03-02 02:49:00 -0500] fujin: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/mash.rb
[2012-03-02 02:49:00 -0500] fujin: that makes sense cause I don't remmeber programming the indifferent accessors like mash
[2012-03-02 02:49:00 -0500] hoover_damm: oh wow
[2012-03-02 02:49:00 -0500] hoover_damm: that makes it even so much harder for me to read those
[2012-03-02 02:50:00 -0500] hoover_damm: because if it was an extlib mash, I could just require 'extlib' on top of yaml
[2012-03-02 02:50:00 -0500] hoover_damm: to grok it
[2012-03-02 02:50:00 -0500] hoover_damm: sucky, but liveable crime
[2012-03-02 02:50:00 -0500] hoover_damm: (perhaps)
[2012-03-02 02:51:00 -0500] fujin:  huh, what problem are you having?
[2012-03-02 02:51:00 -0500] fujin: the yaml won't parse?
[2012-03-02 02:57:00 -0500] fujin: yeh, it wouldn't I guess. lame lol
[2012-03-02 02:57:00 -0500] fujin: hoover_damm: generally when I do something like that I construct the hash to be rendered on the fly, from attributes, re-binding them if necessary
[2012-03-02 02:58:00 -0500] fujin: like, create a new standalone hash then #to_yaml that
[2012-03-02 02:58:00 -0500] fujin: make sure you don't have any mashy bits left over.
[2012-03-02 02:58:00 -0500] fujin: it would be great if it was directly yaml compatible though, so at least you can parse it back.
[2012-03-02 02:59:00 -0500] hoover_damm: fujin, damn that's exactly what I did
[2012-03-02 02:59:00 -0500] hoover_damm: seriously
[2012-03-02 02:59:00 -0500] fujin: well, good work then!
[2012-03-02 02:59:00 -0500] hoover_damm: it was the only sane solution I thought
[2012-03-02 02:59:00 -0500] fujin: yes, plus it makes sure that if someone chucks something into your hash and you dont' know about it, it doesn't end up in your file
[2012-03-02 02:59:00 -0500] fujin: since you explicitlyh bind node values to the yamlized hash
[2012-03-02 03:00:00 -0500] fujin: ze protocol is preserved
[2012-03-02 03:00:00 -0500] hoover_damm: honestly the win I viewed was, you could expand it
[2012-03-02 03:00:00 -0500] hoover_damm: as you define the structure in an attributes file, override it on the node or a role... to add or customize
[2012-03-02 03:00:00 -0500] hoover_damm: everything was node.default so it's just a win to go beyond
[2012-03-02 03:00:00 -0500] fujin: yeah - but you could walk part of that attribute structure and re-bind it into a guaranteed hash
[2012-03-02 03:00:00 -0500] hoover_damm: true
[2012-03-02 03:01:00 -0500] fujin: inject a new hash into an attribute walk or something, if you want to use the vals directly
[2012-03-02 03:01:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I was avoiding doing that
[2012-03-02 03:01:00 -0500] hoover_damm: but I may end up doing it
[2012-03-02 03:01:00 -0500] fujin: i *hate* yaml
[2012-03-02 03:01:00 -0500] hoover_damm: well i'm just being technically correct
[2012-03-02 03:01:00 -0500] fujin: word
[2012-03-02 03:01:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yaml is becoming a disease
[2012-03-02 03:01:00 -0500] hoover_damm: that's going to blah
[2012-03-02 03:01:00 -0500] hoover_damm: i'm just repeating old stories
[2012-03-02 03:02:00 -0500] fujin: maybe open a bug that chef attributes should pretend to be hashes when serialized to yaml
[2012-03-02 03:02:00 -0500] fujin: instead of passing through the potnetially unknown 'mash' hash, especially if it isn't the same as an extlib hash
[2012-03-02 03:02:00 -0500] fujin: an operator might require 'extlib' above YAML.load and expect the behavior of extlib/mash and chef/mash to match
[2012-03-02 03:03:00 -0500] hoover_damm: i'm not sure it wasn't a bug based on my pattern though
[2012-03-02 03:03:00 -0500] hoover_damm: my original pattern /was/ bad
[2012-03-02 03:04:00 -0500] hoover_damm: but I wanted the flexibility
[2012-03-02 03:04:00 -0500] fujin: naw, it would be cool to have that flexibility
[2012-03-02 03:04:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and I am not forced to walk it really
[2012-03-02 03:04:00 -0500] fujin: I think the problem is #to_hash doesn't actually convert it properly to a hash
[2012-03-02 03:04:00 -0500] fujin: if it is still saying it is a Mash to yaml
[2012-03-02 03:05:00 -0500] hoover_damm: indeed
[2012-03-02 03:05:00 -0500] fujin: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/node/attribute.rb#L444
[2012-03-02 03:05:00 -0500] fujin: and that is probably a bug..
[2012-03-02 03:05:00 -0500] hoover_damm: but if your tryign to do basically {"production": { "adapter" ...
[2012-03-02 03:05:00 -0500] hoover_damm: you need a hash
[2012-03-02 03:07:00 -0500] hoover_damm: anywho, I will look into filing a bug after I stop pissing around with jiramode
[2012-03-02 03:08:00 -0500] hoover_damm: oh... org-jira
[2012-03-02 03:08:00 -0500] hoover_damm: damn there goes my night
[2012-03-02 03:22:00 -0500] hoover_damm: created my first ticket in emacs
[2012-03-02 03:22:00 -0500] hoover_damm: woohoo!
[2012-03-02 03:55:00 -0500] spheromak:       # We have invented a new kind of duck-typing, we call it Madoff typing.
[2012-03-02 03:55:00 -0500] spheromak: heh
[2012-03-02 17:17:00 -0500] hoover_damm: sometimes I wish I could do
[2012-03-02 17:18:00 -0500] hoover_damm: knife data bag create credentials database production
[2012-03-02 17:18:00 -0500] hoover_damm: currently using environments to track development / staging / production creds
[2012-03-02 17:18:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so it kinda limits you
[2012-03-02 17:18:00 -0500] hoover_damm: or am I looking at this wrong?
[2012-03-02 17:19:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and I really don't want 1 data bag with 5 different sets of creds
[2012-03-02 17:19:00 -0500] hoover_damm: that seems bad
[2012-03-02 20:28:00 -0500] jespada: Guys in https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/tree/master/chef_handler README.md there is a stupid typo.. is obvious but...
[2012-03-02 20:29:00 -0500] jespada: under # handle exceptions only
[2012-03-02 20:29:00 -0500] jespada: supports exception => true
[2012-03-02 20:29:00 -0500] jespada: should be
[2012-03-02 20:29:00 -0500] jespada: supports :exception => true
[2012-03-02 20:30:00 -0500] fujin: looks right. maybe file a bug on the COOK project
[2012-03-02 20:30:00 -0500] fujin: schisamo: ^^
[2012-03-02 20:30:00 -0500] jespada: also I "fixed" that on wiki.opscode.com
[2012-03-02 20:31:00 -0500] fujin: awesome
[2012-03-02 20:31:00 -0500] jespada: if schisamo wants I can issue a bug con COOK project
[2012-03-02 20:45:00 -0500] jespada: fujin, schisamo , done : COOK-1069
[2012-03-02 23:22:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so am I using librarian wrong? I end up realizing that I need to modify the cookbook quickly
[2012-03-02 23:22:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and have to remove it from the Cheffile
[2012-03-02 23:22:00 -0500] hoover_damm: it's actually a really awesome idea, but it's just not jiving for me
[2012-03-02 23:22:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and i'm wondering if it's just me doing it wrong?
