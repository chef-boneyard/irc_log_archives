[2012-07-20 07:42:04 -0400] thom: hoover_damm: there's a knife plugin that'll download everything
[2012-07-20 14:20:02 -0400] fnichol: hoover_damm: You could give knife-server a spin; it has a `knife server backup` subcommand http://fnichol.github.com/knife-server/#knife-server-backup
[2012-07-20 16:11:19 -0400] hoover_damm: fnichol, yeah I saw knife server didn't notice thebackup
[2012-07-20 16:11:22 -0400] hoover_damm: will have to keep that in mind
[2012-07-20 17:08:59 -0400] z: hoover_damm: I keep nodes in gitrepo/nodes and 'knife node from file' - admittedly that isn't an ideal workflow for some folk
[2012-07-20 17:20:49 -0400] hoover_damm: z, nah I was wanting just a pure backup option... we run too many nodes for that to be even pallatable
