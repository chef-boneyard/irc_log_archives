[2012-07-27 05:14:09 -0400] tigris_: hi guys, i wonder if someone is able to help with a deploy resource issue... i was following the documentation for `migration_command "rake db:migrate"` but i get an error: Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - bundle exec rake db:migrate
[2012-07-27 05:26:51 -0400] tigris_: ok, i think it is because migration_command does not have my rbenv stuff... e.g. for before_migrate i can pass it a block and in that block I can use rbenv_script block to call bundle install... however it seems can not pass block to migration_command
[2012-07-27 21:28:02 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] lamont-opscode created CHEF-2496 (+1 new commit): http://git.io/VvBMVg
[2012-07-27 21:28:02 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/CHEF-2496] First cut at porting Jason's patch to chef 10.14 - Lamont Granquist
[2012-07-27 21:33:26 -0400] hoover_damm: so this ticket isn't triaged... http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1502 is it safe to mark resolved?
[2012-07-27 21:35:15 -0400] mattray: I'll take it
[2012-07-27 21:35:43 -0400] mattray: I'll assign it to me and next time I'm fixing something in pxe_dust I'll merge and release it
[2012-07-27 21:36:01 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, cool i'm just cleaning up pxe_dust
[2012-07-27 21:36:07 -0400] hoover_damm: we're using it to reinstall servers in voxel
[2012-07-27 21:36:08 -0400] mattray: much appreciated!
[2012-07-27 21:36:21 -0400] hoover_damm: not sure why the platform was getting omitted in syslinux
[2012-07-27 21:36:39 -0400] hoover_damm: it's in our local file
[2012-07-27 21:36:42 -0400] hoover_damm: :/
[2012-07-27 21:37:06 -0400] mattray: I plan on adding arm support perhaps next week
[2012-07-27 21:37:15 -0400] hoover_damm: huh
[2012-07-27 21:37:18 -0400] hoover_damm: that's it
[2012-07-27 21:37:19 -0400] hoover_damm: w t f
[2012-07-27 21:37:30 -0400] hoover_damm: server lacked platform
[2012-07-27 21:37:33 -0400] hoover_damm: okay phew
[2012-07-27 21:37:45 -0400] hoover_damm: freaky that it worked :)
[2012-07-27 21:38:25 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, I just don't want to do cobbler or anything like that... and if I was going to make my own thing i'd just wrap a lame dashboard in front of it
[2012-07-27 21:38:49 -0400] mattray: I'm trying to keep it very focused and unopinionated
[2012-07-27 21:38:51 -0400] hoover_damm: but it's not like pxe is something you can truly automate to a state that perfectly
[2012-07-27 21:38:56 -0400] mattray: true
[2012-07-27 21:39:07 -0400] hoover_damm: you did a perfect job
[2012-07-27 21:39:09 -0400] hoover_damm: that's all i wanted
[2012-07-27 21:39:24 -0400] hoover_damm: i do serial console as well
[2012-07-27 21:39:27 -0400] mattray: perfect, that's what I wanted
[2012-07-27 21:39:30 -0400] hoover_damm: so we have to add that bits
[2012-07-27 21:39:59 -0400] hoover_damm: also you should move netcfg/chooseinterface=auto
[2012-07-27 21:40:03 -0400] hoover_damm: instead of eth0
[2012-07-27 21:40:17 -0400] hoover_damm: yin and yang is not always the same
[2012-07-27 21:40:24 -0400] hoover_damm: sometimes we rename them in udev
[2012-07-27 21:40:25 -0400] mattray: yeah I had some issue around that
[2012-07-27 21:40:33 -0400] hoover_damm: which makes us even more confused
[2012-07-27 21:40:35 -0400] hoover_damm: when we hit that
[2012-07-27 21:40:35 -0400] mattray: like it booted one and then the order changed
[2012-07-27 21:40:44 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah someone renamed it in udev
[2012-07-27 21:40:46 -0400] hoover_damm: i got a few of those
[2012-07-27 21:41:04 -0400] hoover_damm: the actual interfaces are swapped due to the PCI edge?
[2012-07-27 21:41:06 -0400] hoover_damm: i believe
[2012-07-27 21:41:11 -0400] mattray: probably
[2012-07-27 21:41:26 -0400] mattray: or one was pci, one was mb
[2012-07-27 21:41:30 -0400] hoover_damm: it's not a huge deal and auto just means it does a link check
[2012-07-27 21:41:46 -0400] mattray: my gear is not exactly server-class
[2012-07-27 21:41:47 -0400] hoover_damm: if both links are up and both answer to dhcp
[2012-07-27 21:41:48 -0400] hoover_damm: oops
[2012-07-27 21:42:08 -0400] hoover_damm: voxel does do some mtm offering... bare metal
[2012-07-27 21:42:24 -0400] hoover_damm: you could get a server or two and have some dual interfaces to test against for awhile for a cheap price :)
[2012-07-27 21:42:35 -0400] hoover_damm: a/k/a internap
[2012-07-27 21:42:54 -0400] mattray: my boxes have 2 nics, the problem I had was one booted for pxe, then the ubuntu installer promptly switched them
[2012-07-27 21:42:56 -0400] hoover_damm: we host our graphite servers there currently (pushing almost 800k metrics)
[2012-07-27 21:43:08 -0400] mattray: so eth0 no longer worked
[2012-07-27 21:43:36 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-07-27 21:43:39 -0400] mattray: I probably need to switch which one I'm booting from
[2012-07-27 21:43:58 -0400] hoover_damm: SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="00:25:90:73:59:96", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth0"
[2012-07-27 21:44:01 -0400] hoover_damm: SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="00:25:90:73:59:97", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth1"
[2012-07-27 21:44:04 -0400] hoover_damm: you need something like that jank
[2012-07-27 21:44:09 -0400] hoover_damm: in /etc/udev/rules.d
[2012-07-27 21:44:22 -0400] hoover_damm: to fix the ordering
[2012-07-27 21:44:24 -0400] mattray: pushed in on the preseed?
[2012-07-27 21:44:33 -0400] hoover_damm: not sure how you'd do it on the preseed
[2012-07-27 21:44:42 -0400] hoover_damm: but that's actually how you flip them
[2012-07-27 21:44:46 -0400] mattray: sure
[2012-07-27 21:44:51 -0400] mattray: or I manually flip them :)
[2012-07-27 21:44:54 -0400] hoover_damm: I think debian also has it's owh ethrename package too
[2012-07-27 21:44:58 -0400] hoover_damm: or fix the IRQ
[2012-07-27 21:44:59 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-07-27 21:45:12 -0400] hoover_damm: not always possible
[2012-07-27 21:45:40 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: not exactly server-class: http://www.flickr.com/photos/mray/6886718717/
[2012-07-27 21:46:19 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, nice and clean
[2012-07-27 21:46:28 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, trust me i've lived with many geeks
[2012-07-27 21:47:20 -0400] mattray: yeah, I need to get another router and a 3rd network for openstack testing, just so I have a similar setup to real production environments
[2012-07-27 21:47:31 -0400] mattray: s/switch/router/
[2012-07-27 21:48:39 -0400] mattray: I do have an offer from a service provider for free boxes for openstack testing
[2012-07-27 21:48:48 -0400] mattray: maybe 50-100
[2012-07-27 21:49:24 -0400] mattray: any fixes you have for pxe_dust let me know, it needs more contact with larger deployments
[2012-07-27 21:49:31 -0400] mattray: ipxe might be nice
[2012-07-27 21:50:57 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, if you can drop 3 bills
[2012-07-27 21:51:05 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, the cisco i picked up a bit ago is quite nice
[2012-07-27 21:51:25 -0400] mattray: heh, I'm mostly using dd-wrt
[2012-07-27 21:51:37 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041ORN6U/ref=wms_ohs_product
[2012-07-27 21:51:45 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, then you can help us automate IOS in chef
[2012-07-27 21:51:49 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, it's a managed switch
[2012-07-27 21:52:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and no I don't mean iOS ... I mean Cisco IOS
[2012-07-27 21:52:05 -0400] mattray: yup
[2012-07-27 21:52:34 -0400] mattray: or blame Cisco for not getting more litigious defending their IOS
[2012-07-27 21:53:24 -0400] hoover_damm: Apple's some big guns... don't think they want to upset those guns
[2012-07-27 21:54:50 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, also i'm not sure if you really want to set the hostname in syslinux
[2012-07-27 21:55:03 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, i'm gonna try riding without it... it basically overrides my dhcp hostname
[2012-07-27 21:55:06 -0400] hoover_damm: :(
[2012-07-27 21:55:10 -0400] mattray: ahh, mine match
[2012-07-27 21:55:16 -0400] hoover_damm: so do mine
[2012-07-27 21:55:26 -0400] hoover_damm: that's why i don't get why i get dummy
[2012-07-27 21:56:23 -0400] mattray: dunno, feel free to send me any patches you make and I'll try to test them. Assuming they don't break me too badly, I'll upstream them
[2012-07-27 21:57:34 -0400] hoover_damm: I'm not really planning on going to far with this at the time, it's pretty brute testing pxe changes
[2012-07-27 21:57:40 -0400] hoover_damm: as you likely know
[2012-07-27 21:57:59 -0400] hoover_damm: and debugging failure for me as i'm doing remote ssh console only
[2012-07-27 21:58:04 -0400] hoover_damm: is not fun
[2012-07-27 22:08:30 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, your not interested in the insanity of partman and the wonderful recipes are you?
[2012-07-27 22:08:44 -0400] miah: mattray: my pal spheromak shared some pxe_dust code with me, i still have to take a look at things. i've been mostly fixing our nagios install over the last week, but i'll get back to the dhcp/pxe stuff soon.
[2012-07-27 22:09:14 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, for the most part pxe_dust doesn't require much
[2012-07-27 22:09:26 -0400] miah: hoover_damm: if you're on debian
[2012-07-27 22:09:29 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, most changes done to the preseed are going to be really hard to properly make generic
[2012-07-27 22:09:43 -0400] hoover_damm: isn't that the kickstart cookbook?
[2012-07-27 22:09:46 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: yeah, I thought about that for awhile
[2012-07-27 22:09:53 -0400] miah: it doesnt have kickstart stuff in it :/
[2012-07-27 22:10:00 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, you want the kickstart cookbook
[2012-07-27 22:10:03 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, not pxe_dust
[2012-07-27 22:10:05 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, go away
[2012-07-27 22:10:07 -0400] miah: oh?
[2012-07-27 22:10:11 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, damn redhat user
[2012-07-27 22:10:19 -0400] miah: i almost worked at redhat..
[2012-07-27 22:10:23 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: partman could be done with a disk cookbook of some sort after the preinstall
[2012-07-27 22:10:44 -0400] miah: turned them down for turbolinux (also, living in San Francisco vs Raleigh)
[2012-07-27 22:10:47 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, oh we just made our setup do 100% lvm with a small / and a lot of free space
[2012-07-27 22:11:09 -0400] hoover_damm: also your late comand seems to be daft on 12.04
[2012-07-27 22:11:26 -0400] hoover_damm: example show now
[2012-07-27 22:11:27 -0400] hoover_damm: #d-i preseed/late_command string apt-install zsh; in-target chsh -s /bin/zsh
[2012-07-27 22:11:37 -0400] hoover_damm: you actually have a chroot command in yours
[2012-07-27 22:12:16 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, lol turbolinux
[2012-07-27 22:12:40 -0400] miah: hey. i worked there for 6 months before they laid off most of the staff
[2012-07-27 22:12:42 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, it's amazing how many distributions there are... I wish we could all come together in one big hug and shrug them off and go back to binaries
[2012-07-27 22:12:48 -0400] hoover_damm: and tarballs
[2012-07-27 22:12:59 -0400] miah: pacman is mostly tarball package format
[2012-07-27 22:13:01 -0400] hoover_damm: but i know i'm delusional in that
[2012-07-27 22:13:16 -0400] hoover_damm: oh if i switched distros i'd move to Exherbo
[2012-07-27 22:13:20 -0400] mattray: I would like to add kickstarts to pxe_dust
[2012-07-27 22:13:33 -0400] miah: i am stupidly refactoring the nagios cookbook this week
[2012-07-27 22:13:35 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, prolly should just keep them seperate
[2012-07-27 22:13:51 -0400] mattray: hmm.. or make it pluggable
[2012-07-27 22:13:53 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, not to be mean but preseed and kickstart different but not
[2012-07-27 22:14:11 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, ideally what you should do is make a pxe cookbook that depends on ubuntu_pxe and then centos_pxe
[2012-07-27 22:14:17 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, and lwrp it
[2012-07-27 22:14:21 -0400] mattray: yeah, that's what I'm thinking
[2012-07-27 22:14:35 -0400] mattray: I'll tackle it sometime, probably when I need openstack on fedora
[2012-07-27 22:14:46 -0400] hoover_damm: ew
[2012-07-27 22:14:52 -0400] hoover_damm: fesmora?
[2012-07-27 22:15:05 -0400] miah: are files plopped into <cookbook>/libraries basically loaded as modules into the recipe space?
[2012-07-27 22:15:18 -0400] miah: eg
[2012-07-27 22:15:18 -0400] miah: https://github.com/miah/nagios/blob/refactor/libraries/default.rb
[2012-07-27 22:15:34 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, close
[2012-07-27 22:15:54 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, where did you want these to be used exactly?
[2012-07-27 22:16:03 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] lamont-opscode pushed 1 new commit to CHEF-2496: http://git.io/-Cw2Ig
[2012-07-27 22:16:03 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/CHEF-2496] include new ips package provider - Lamont Granquist
[2012-07-27 22:16:05 -0400] miah: i think those are just used inside the nagios cookbook
[2012-07-27 22:16:29 -0400] hoover_damm: i mean if you want to tack onto node
[2012-07-27 22:16:37 -0400] hoover_damm: you want to do class Chef::Node
[2012-07-27 22:16:40 -0400] hoover_damm: def monkey
[2012-07-27 22:17:02 -0400] hoover_damm: "blue"
[2012-07-27 22:17:02 -0400] hoover_damm: end
[2012-07-27 22:17:05 -0400] hoover_damm: then node.monkey
[2012-07-27 22:17:23 -0400] miah: you are confusing me =)
[2012-07-27 22:17:44 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, where do you want nagios_attr exposed?
[2012-07-27 22:17:56 -0400] miah: just inside the nagios cookbook
[2012-07-27 22:18:01 -0400] miah: but i didnt write this
[2012-07-27 22:18:11 -0400] miah: i would actually define it as a module
[2012-07-27 22:18:15 -0400] hoover_damm: I really haven't looked at this cookbook
[2012-07-27 22:18:19 -0400] miah: its a mess
[2012-07-27 22:18:24 -0400] hoover_damm: i've heard
[2012-07-27 22:18:52 -0400] hoover_damm: oh ew
[2012-07-27 22:18:54 -0400] hoover_damm: that's natsy
[2012-07-27 22:18:56 -0400] hoover_damm: nasty*
[2012-07-27 22:19:02 -0400] hoover_damm: he's using that to dry up templates
[2012-07-27 22:19:04 -0400] hoover_damm: yack
[2012-07-27 22:19:40 -0400] spheromak: miah: maybe one day ill just clean it up  too :)
[2012-07-27 22:20:33 -0400] miah: look at my refactor branch
[2012-07-27 22:20:38 -0400] miah: i have a bunch i need to push though
[2012-07-27 22:20:47 -0400] spheromak: oh i ll check it out
[2012-07-27 22:20:56 -0400] miah: i'm trying to sort out the search side of things right now
[2012-07-27 22:20:57 -0400] spheromak: not alot of time atm tho maybe over the weekend
[2012-07-27 22:20:59 -0400] miah: its just fugly code
[2012-07-27 22:21:11 -0400] spheromak: the code in the libraries is mixed into Chef::Language IIRC
[2012-07-27 22:21:14 -0400] spheromak: but would have to look
[2012-07-27 22:21:22 -0400] hoover_damm: sort of
[2012-07-27 22:21:24 -0400] spheromak: i.e. bare methods in a foo.rb
[2012-07-27 22:21:27 -0400] hoover_damm: you can actually indicate where it lands
[2012-07-27 22:21:33 -0400] hoover_damm: if you do it like this
[2012-07-27 22:21:36 -0400] spheromak: sure
[2012-07-27 22:21:37 -0400] hoover_damm: it's a little more organic
[2012-07-27 22:21:38 -0400] spheromak: its parsed
[2012-07-27 22:21:54 -0400] hoover_damm: my preference is to namespace what your doing properly
[2012-07-27 22:22:01 -0400] spheromak: of course
[2012-07-27 22:22:03 -0400] miah: i think im just going to write a module and expose it to my recipes. my module will contain some methods used for searching
[2012-07-27 22:22:08 -0400] spheromak: and mix that in where you want it
[2012-07-27 22:22:15 -0400] hoover_damm: eventually you must realize that starting over would be easier
[2012-07-27 22:22:17 -0400] spheromak: i.e. Chef::Recipe or w/e
[2012-07-27 22:22:32 -0400] hoover_damm: It was a rough lesson for me to learn, but it was a good one.
[2012-07-27 22:22:38 -0400] spheromak: miah: that the exact patern i use, and other (fujins stuff )
[2012-07-27 22:22:42 -0400] miah: ya
[2012-07-27 22:22:45 -0400] hoover_damm: when reading over the cookbook and absorbing what it does and throwing it away and starting from scratch
[2012-07-27 22:22:47 -0400] miah: i am following his example
[2012-07-27 22:22:49 -0400] hoover_damm: will produce a better result
[2012-07-27 22:22:53 -0400] hoover_damm: then trying to fix the piece of crap
[2012-07-27 22:22:54 -0400] spheromak: I have a Heplers module that i use all our custom shit to namespace
[2012-07-27 22:23:03 -0400] spheromak: Helpers::Search.scoped_search
[2012-07-27 22:23:04 -0400] miah: awesome
[2012-07-27 22:23:18 -0400] hoover_damm: I follow Adam's lead
[2012-07-27 22:23:23 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-07-27 22:23:24 -0400] miah: i follow your moms lead
[2012-07-27 22:23:30 -0400] hoover_damm: as some of this code was commited by adam that I learned it from
[2012-07-27 22:23:39 -0400] hoover_damm: and others
[2012-07-27 22:24:19 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, you shouldn't follow my moms lead.  She's been with a lot of scary men
[2012-07-27 22:25:01 -0400] miah: ok
[2012-07-27 22:25:38 -0400] hoover_damm: like my father
[2012-07-27 22:25:44 -0400] hoover_damm: he was one of the saner ones
[2012-07-27 22:29:51 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, if you ever figure out a way to install ubuntu/debian without swap and have it not care :) let me know
[2012-07-27 22:30:00 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, I hate allocating 128gb to swap just because of the 1:1 rule
[2012-07-27 22:30:24 -0400] mattray: hmmm I'll add that to my pxe_dust backlog
[2012-07-27 22:38:18 -0400] hoover_damm: debian doesn't let you as a rule install without swap
[2012-07-27 22:38:43 -0400] hoover_damm: and you can set your min/max
[2012-07-27 22:38:52 -0400] hoover_damm: but I really haven't found a 100% happy spot there
[2012-07-27 22:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: installing servers with 128gig of ram and you get 128gig swap
[2012-07-27 22:39:07 -0400] hoover_damm: just wait till i get 256gig servers
[2012-07-27 22:41:12 -0400] mattray: lame
[2012-07-27 22:41:15 -0400] mattray: I'm out
[2012-07-27 23:06:19 -0400] hoover_damm:   ACTIVE            '/dev/system/root' [46.56 GiB] inherit
[2012-07-27 23:06:20 -0400] hoover_damm:   ACTIVE            '/dev/system/swap_1' [396.46 GiB] inherit
[2012-07-27 23:06:22 -0400] hoover_damm: entirely
[2012-07-27 23:06:32 -0400] hoover_damm: only a sandybridge with 128gig of ram
[2012-07-27 23:06:36 -0400] hoover_damm: notthing special
[2012-07-27 23:06:45 -0400] hoover_damm: partman says 1-5gig yet it went up to 4gig
[2012-07-27 23:06:48 -0400] hoover_damm: er 400g
