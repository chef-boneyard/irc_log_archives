[2012-07-13 00:25:01 -0400] ampledata: jtimberman
[2012-07-13 00:25:02 -0400] ampledata: on twitter
[2012-07-13 00:25:04 -0400] ampledata: but on irc?
[2012-07-13 00:25:13 -0400] ampledata: inquiring minds (me) want to know (not really)
[2012-07-13 00:26:58 -0400] jtimberman: ampledata: wot?
[2012-07-13 00:27:34 -0400] ampledata: wot
[2012-07-13 00:27:51 -0400] ampledata: can i get some feedback on http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1442
[2012-07-13 00:28:13 -0400] ampledata: probably originated with http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-668
[2012-07-13 00:29:33 -0400] ampledata: it's a tough one, since it's initially installation we know postfix won't already be running
[2012-07-13 00:29:58 -0400] ampledata: i was thinking about wrapping restart in a handler to check if it's running first
[2012-07-13 00:30:00 -0400] ampledata: turtles
[2012-07-13 00:30:02 -0400] ampledata: basically
[2012-07-13 00:30:46 -0400] ampledata: we could [:enable, :start] the service, but i'd assume people want to err on the side of not starting the service until it's fully configured
[2012-07-13 00:41:32 -0400] ampledata: uh does anything even use the status command
[2012-07-13 00:41:55 -0400] ampledata: ah n/m
[2012-07-13 00:41:56 -0400] ampledata: determine_current_status
[2012-07-13 00:55:52 -0400] ampledata: oh god maybe i'm just atarded
[2012-07-13 01:04:21 -0400] ampledata: holy shit since when can you have bare constants in attribute files?
[2012-07-13 01:04:34 -0400] ampledata: default['postfix']['myhostname'] = fqdn
[2012-07-13 01:10:46 -0400] jtimberman: always could
[2012-07-13 01:10:49 -0400] jtimberman: not constants though
[2012-07-13 01:10:51 -0400] jtimberman: those are attributes
[2012-07-13 01:10:53 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-07-13 01:11:08 -0400] jtimberman: ampledata: the attributes files are evaluated in the context of the Chef::Node object.
[2012-07-13 01:11:18 -0400] jtimberman: so you don't *need* to use node['thing'] in them
[2012-07-13 01:11:23 -0400] ampledata: oic
[2012-07-13 01:11:33 -0400] ampledata: ok so in hindsight the bug i opened was inaccurate
[2012-07-13 01:11:48 -0400] ampledata: nothing to do with restart behavior per se
[2012-07-13 01:12:00 -0400] jtimberman: well then close it :D
[2012-07-13 01:12:03 -0400] ampledata: it's due to a missing ['postfix']['domain'] attribute
[2012-07-13 01:12:14 -0400] ampledata: it generates a template with 'mydomain = '
[2012-07-13 01:12:19 -0400] ampledata: which postfix chokes on
[2012-07-13 01:12:51 -0400] jtimberman: ah
[2012-07-13 01:12:55 -0400] jtimberman: you're using vagrant?
[2012-07-13 01:13:01 -0400] jtimberman: might not have the fqdn set right
[2012-07-13 01:13:12 -0400] ampledata: wtf are u clairvoyant?
[2012-07-13 01:13:58 -0400] jtimberman: this ain't my first rodeo!
[2012-07-13 01:14:54 -0400] ampledata: man i'm really liking librarian and vagrant for testing
[2012-07-13 01:15:08 -0400] ampledata: if only i could integ the two so i didn't have to keep typing librarian-chef update
[2012-07-13 01:15:19 -0400] ampledata: if only i could = if only i spent the time
[2012-07-13 01:15:45 -0400] jtimberman: hehe
[2012-07-13 01:15:53 -0400] ampledata: testing fix
[2012-07-13 01:15:54 -0400] ampledata: thanks
[2012-07-13 01:16:29 -0400] ampledata: man we had a release today that was like lollercopters napalming a derp farm
[2012-07-13 01:21:09 -0400] ampledata: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/postfix/pull/5
[2012-07-13 01:24:14 -0400] jtimberman: hum
[2012-07-13 01:26:35 -0400] jtimberman: what about something like
[2012-07-13 01:26:36 -0400] jtimberman: https://gist.github.com/3102177
[2012-07-13 01:26:38 -0400] jtimberman: instead?
[2012-07-13 01:26:47 -0400] jtimberman: example.com is probably totally wrong, whatever the default in postfix is
[2012-07-13 01:26:55 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, you see the same issue enough that you don't need clairvoyance
[2012-07-13 01:26:58 -0400] jtimberman: and probably likewise for myhostname
[2012-07-13 01:27:11 -0400] ampledata: i was just gonna say
[2012-07-13 01:27:12 -0400] hoover_damm: a lot of people prolly think i'm some trollish genius
[2012-07-13 01:27:12 -0400] jtimberman: anyway, back in a bit, maybe tomorrow :)
[2012-07-13 01:27:17 -0400] ampledata: having no mydomain should be valid operation
[2012-07-13 01:27:29 -0400] ampledata: let me check postfix doz
[2012-07-13 01:27:30 -0400] ampledata: x
[2012-07-13 01:27:31 -0400] hoover_damm: but really I just watch chef and chef-hacking and watch the patterns of failures
[2012-07-13 01:27:31 -0400] ampledata: dox
[2012-07-13 01:27:39 -0400] hoover_damm: and just keep a mental note
[2012-07-13 01:28:42 -0400] ampledata: mydomain (default: see "postconf -d" output)
[2012-07-13 01:28:43 -0400] ampledata: The internet domain name of this mail system. The default is to use $http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#myhostname minus the first component, or "localdomain" (Postfix 2.3 and later). $http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#mydomain is used as a default value for many other configuration parameters.
[2012-07-13 01:28:43 -0400] ampledata: Example:
[2012-07-13 01:28:43 -0400] ampledata: http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#mydomain = domain.tld
[2012-07-13 01:28:46 -0400] ampledata: http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#mydomain
[2012-07-13 01:29:37 -0400] ampledata: ok an unset mydomain will default to 'localdomain' on my vm
[2012-07-13 01:29:48 -0400] ampledata: which is as neutral as 'example.com'
[2012-07-13 01:29:57 -0400] ampledata: without having chef pre-determine that i will always be 'example.com'
[2012-07-13 01:30:03 -0400] ampledata: i'll paste this into the jira
[2012-07-13 01:31:48 -0400] ampledata: updated
[2012-07-13 01:47:51 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, I end up doing a weird my_destination that's fake on exim
[2012-07-13 01:48:05 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, because I always want it to relay and never want it to get confused into thinking it can be local
[2012-07-13 01:48:11 -0400] hoover_damm: too extreme
[2012-07-13 01:48:16 -0400] hoover_damm: but it makes me feel good
