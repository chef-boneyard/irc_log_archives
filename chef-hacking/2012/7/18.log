[2012-07-18 06:06:16 -0400] c_t: let's start taking bets on whether jesserobbins will say anything or not
[2012-07-18 17:10:16 -0400] hoover_damm: c_t, I imagine jesse has his irc client setup to auto open or something.  He'd respond I bet if someone talked to him directly
[2012-07-18 17:10:55 -0400] hoover_damm: and honestly if Chef was part of something I built, i'd watch every angle I could just because i'd want to watch over what I built with love.
[2012-07-18 17:34:51 -0400] c_t: hoover_damm: certainly
[2012-07-18 17:35:00 -0400] c_t: he says stuff periodically too
[2012-07-18 17:47:43 -0400] hoover_damm: yepyep
[2012-07-18 18:47:05 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, chef operates in LC_ALL="C"
[2012-07-18 18:47:07 -0400] hoover_damm: fwiw
[2012-07-18 18:47:21 -0400] hoover_damm: kinda fun unsetting that

[2012-07-18 19:58:35 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] CHEF-3302: Typo library_load_failed -> library_file_load_failed - Bryan McLellan
[2012-07-18 20:03:27 -0400] joewilliams: if i do a 'node = Chef::Node.load("blah")' how do i merge node to act like the @node variable in a recipe?
[2012-07-18 20:03:49 -0400] joewilliams: been digging through the chef-client code and its not obvious to me yet
[2012-07-18 20:04:40 -0400] yfeldblum: joewilliams, what are you trying to achieve?
[2012-07-18 20:07:02 -0400] joewilliams: i am doing some experimenting using chef basically as a lib to give other pieces of code access to node data, search, etc
[2012-07-18 20:09:14 -0400] yfeldblum: joewilliams, can you be more specific?
[2012-07-18 20:10:10 -0400] joewilliams: yfeldblum: not sure, what are you looking for?
[2012-07-18 20:10:35 -0400] yfeldblum: joewilliams, what are you trying to accomplish with `node = Chef::Node.load("blah")`?
[2012-07-18 20:12:16 -0400] joewilliams: well that line of code returns an instance of a node to you, this includes all the data regarding that node that chef knows about. my guess was that if you have that you can merge down the various attribute types down into one mash just like @node in a recipe
[2012-07-18 20:14:14 -0400] yfeldblum: `node` in a recipe is not merged
[2012-07-18 20:14:25 -0400] yfeldblum: also use `node` rather than `@node` since the latter is deprecated
[2012-07-18 20:15:17 -0400] StormSilver: joewilliams: I typically just use Chef::Search::Query when I'm using chef in my outside-chef code.
[2012-07-18 20:15:29 -0400] StormSilver: Gives you exactly what you want in return.
[2012-07-18 20:16:05 -0400] joewilliams: yfeldblum: so you're saying node.override_attributes, node.automatic_attributes, etc are not merged into node in a recipe?
[2012-07-18 20:16:25 -0400] yfeldblum: joewilliams, that's right
[2012-07-18 20:16:40 -0400] yfeldblum: joewilliams, they are merged on-the-fly, as you access each attribute
[2012-07-18 20:18:13 -0400] joewilliams: yfeldblum: okay they are "effectively" merged on access, i am asking you how that is done
[2012-07-18 20:19:35 -0400] yfeldblum: joewilliams, every time you do `node["apache2"]["www_dir"]` in a recipe, chef computes what the merged value would be from all four levels of attributes and returns that value
[2012-07-18 20:20:41 -0400] superbaloo: joewilliams: node = Chef::Node.load(fqdn) node["foo"] = "bar" node.save()
[2012-07-18 20:20:45 -0400] superbaloo: is what you want
[2012-07-18 20:20:49 -0400] joewilliams: yfeldblum: yup, understood, i've been aware of this from the start, i am just asking where the code is that performs that merging
[2012-07-18 20:20:59 -0400] yfeldblum: joewilliams, ah!
[2012-07-18 20:22:23 -0400] yfeldblum: joewilliams, Chef::Node (https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/node.rb#L249-252) and Chef::Node::Attribute (https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/node/attribute.rb#L89-113)
[2012-07-18 20:23:42 -0400] superbaloo: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/node.rb#L394
[2012-07-18 20:23:48 -0400] superbaloo: here is the deep merge
[2012-07-18 20:24:41 -0400] yfeldblum: joewilliams, the code is all pretty complicated and weird; but it happens both for the `node` method in recipes and templates and also for nodes returned from Chef::Node.load and search for nodes
[2012-07-18 20:25:30 -0400] joewilliams: cool, thanks guys
[2012-07-18 20:26:25 -0400] StormSilver: Can I just say that I *love* being able to include chef in my other Ruby code and use it? Pretty great.
[2012-07-18 20:26:42 -0400] joewilliams: yeah pretty nifty
[2012-07-18 20:27:34 -0400] superbaloo: same here
[2012-07-18 20:28:02 -0400] superbaloo: being able to setup a webui to allow users to interact with chef db
[2012-07-18 20:28:06 -0400] superbaloo: is really great
[2012-07-18 20:28:34 -0400] StormSilver: superbaloo: Interesting.
[2012-07-18 20:28:45 -0400] StormSilver: It's great for building an "almost automatic" infrastructure.
[2012-07-18 20:29:10 -0400] superbaloo: i do store my users ssh keys in a databg
[2012-07-18 20:29:26 -0400] superbaloo: users can change their ssh keys
[2012-07-18 20:29:31 -0400] superbaloo: using the webui
[2012-07-18 20:29:40 -0400] superbaloo: (logging in with openid)
[2012-07-18 20:30:16 -0400] superbaloo: still, they don't get an chef admin key
[2012-07-18 20:30:25 -0400] superbaloo: only the webui does
[2012-07-18 20:30:39 -0400] superbaloo: (that's just an example)
[2012-07-18 20:31:38 -0400] superbaloo: we do have another one for chef handlers
[2012-07-18 20:32:07 -0400] superbaloo: but we do need infos about the node itself, then it just loads data from the db
[2012-07-18 20:32:17 -0400] superbaloo: using chef:node
[2012-07-18 20:32:23 -0400] superbaloo: pretty neat actually
[2012-07-18 20:32:53 -0400] superbaloo: (custom version of nico's cuisine)
[2012-07-18 20:34:32 -0400] superbaloo: https://github.com/baloo/Tambouille here is another example
[2012-07-18 20:34:45 -0400] superbaloo: this does generate debian preseeds
[2012-07-18 20:34:54 -0400] superbaloo: using chef database

[2012-07-18 21:45:15 -0400] hoover_damm: curious question, anyone ever download all their nodes and keep a backup of your hosted account? Maybe seems overkill but I wanted extra backup (beyond what Opscode has)
