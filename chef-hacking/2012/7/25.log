[2012-07-25 01:37:44 -0400] ampledata: fnichol: what's the diff between 'chef-user' and 'users'?
[2012-07-25 12:47:59 -0400] tigris_: hi guys, i am wondering if someone can point me in the right direction to figure out how to get "default" attributes from attributes.rb files to interpolate values from node JSON... e.g. default['nginx']['prefix'] = "/opt/nginx-#{node['nginx']['version']}"
[2012-07-25 12:49:44 -0400] tigris_: from my understanding, i can use "set" instead of "default" since set will parse after node JSON has been loaded, however this is less than ideal as it means 'nginx/prefix' won't be settable by node JSON
[2012-07-25 14:20:35 -0400] tigris_: would anyone consider my answer here http://stackoverflow.com/a/11651880/1312356 to be a bug in chef-solo? i've just learnt to deal with it and it doesn't bother me, but if people think it's a bug i'm happy to ticket it
[2012-07-25 14:33:41 -0400] paulmooring: tigris_:  I'll take a look
[2012-07-25 14:37:30 -0400] tigris_: i think it may be ohai related, i think ohai sees that /etc/chef/ohai_plugins/README already exists, loads some plugins or whatever and that must trigger some kind of reload on the solo.rb file
[2012-07-25 14:38:06 -0400] tigris_: if you remove that README it also fixes the problem, but that's the only reason i think it's related to ohai, i've not looked into the code yet, i grepped for references to that README but found nothing
[2012-07-25 14:44:22 -0400] paulmooring: I suspect the only relevance of the README is it's the only file in there, so without it there's not need to re-run ohai
[2012-07-25 14:46:02 -0400] tigris_: no i also have a /etc/chef/ohai_plugins/nginx.rb file... i can safely leave that intact
[2012-07-25 14:47:17 -0400] paulmooring: at any rate I think you're probably correct, but I'm gonna keep digging and find the problem in the code
[2012-07-25 14:52:52 -0400] tigris_: it's a very weird issue that is for certain, thanks for looking
[2012-07-25 14:53:08 -0400] paulmooring: that's what I'm here for :)
[2012-07-25 15:19:39 -0400] paulmooring: tigris_: were you able to recreate that issue?
[2012-07-25 15:23:13 -0400] tigris_: yep, give me a minute and i will shoot you a gist
[2012-07-25 15:25:32 -0400] paulmooring: tigris_: I ask because I'm not seeing it on 10.12, what version are you running
[2012-07-25 15:27:25 -0400] tigris_: i have seen it on both 0.10.10 and 10.12.0
[2012-07-25 15:28:05 -0400] paulmooring: using a node.json file?
[2012-07-25 15:35:33 -0400] tigris_: yep
[2012-07-25 15:57:11 -0400] tigris_: sorry for the delay paulmooring
[2012-07-25 15:57:12 -0400] tigris_: https://github.com/tigris/chef-test
[2012-07-25 16:02:21 -0400] paulmooring: tigris_: many thanks you are awesome
[2012-07-25 16:02:59 -0400] tigris_: if i were awesome, i would have submitted a patch already :P
[2012-07-25 16:28:41 -0400] paulmooring: tigris_: fyi it's definitely a bug with the line `::IO.read(Chef::Config[:config_file])`
[2012-07-25 16:34:07 -0400] tigris_: in ohai? in my chef-test repo i wasn't seein the bug until i did `include_recipe 'ohai'`
[2012-07-25 16:46:07 -0400] paulmooring: yeah in the ohai default recipe
[2012-07-25 16:47:09 -0400] paulmooring: the line starts with if `rd.updated? ||` so it succeeds on the first run or if you delete the read me because there's new files, so rd.updated? is true
[2012-07-25 16:47:42 -0400] paulmooring: if it's not updated it chokes on ::IO.read(Chef::Config), only when Chef::Config is a relative path
[2012-07-25 16:49:04 -0400] paulmooring: I'm filing a bug now
[2012-07-25 16:54:37 -0400] tigris_: ok cheers
[2012-07-25 16:55:41 -0400] tigris_: i have a fix for COOK-1483 and COOK-1484 as well, but the nginx guys seem a bit flat out, i notice a few people have submitted fixes
