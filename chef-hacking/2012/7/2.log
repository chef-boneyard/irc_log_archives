[2012-07-02 08:56:52 -0400] nacx: hi all, I am working on the jclouds-chef Java api, and i am having issues when creating a new cookbook
[2012-07-02 08:57:31 -0400] nacx: Currently I am using community Chef 0.10.8, and what I do to upload the cookbook is: create the upload sandbox, upload the contents, commit the sandbox, and finally create the new cookbook
[2012-07-02 08:57:53 -0400] nacx: however, in the last step I alsays get a 400 bad Request error saying that the contents of the cookbook have not been uploaded yet
[2012-07-02 08:58:25 -0400] nacx: Here are the traces od the requests and their output, as long as the server.log output: http://pastie.org/4186287
[2012-07-02 08:58:34 -0400] nacx: any help or hint will be appreciated!
[2012-07-02 12:03:22 -0400] BryanWB_: what's the best way to work on the chef-client source? so far it seems that using bundler w/ `gem "chef", :path => '/path/checked/out/from/git'`
[2012-07-02 12:06:50 -0400] geekbri: BryanWB_: thats generally what I do
[2012-07-02 12:08:30 -0400] BryanWB_: geekbri: do u have to do bundle update every time u make a change in order for it to be reflected?
[2012-07-02 12:09:01 -0400] geekbri: BryanWB_: Yeah, if you use that workflow you have to
[2012-07-02 12:09:13 -0400] BryanWB_: tks geekbri
[2012-07-02 12:10:44 -0400] geekbri: BryanWB_: if you checkout the repository locally, you could build the gem and just install it that way.
[2012-07-02 16:05:44 -0400] martha: anyone use chef on solaris? I've written providers for pkgutil packages and for zones and I'd love someone else to try them out and give me some feedback.
[2012-07-02 16:41:07 -0400] adriancole: aloha folks.  if anyone has chef rest api experience, nacx could use a hand sorting the *last* api glitch we have on java/clojure support
[2012-07-02 16:42:01 -0400] adriancole: in case you weren't online earlier...

[2012-07-02 16:42:24 -0400] adriancole: once this is licked, one can hack chef inside many parens..
[2012-07-02 16:42:25 -0400] adriancole: :P
[2012-07-02 16:42:32 -0400] nacx: hi adriancole :)
[2012-07-02 16:42:46 -0400] nacx: just to add some info, the same requests to create a new cookbook are working fine in Hosted Chef
[2012-07-02 16:42:49 -0400] adriancole: nacx buena tarde!
[2012-07-02 16:45:27 -0400] adriancole: nacx might want to try the ML as well http://lists.opscode.com/sympa
[2012-07-02 16:48:18 -0400] nacx: I'll do. I wanted to wait to see if I could fix it today, but I'll post to chef-dev later today if I have no luck
[2012-07-02 16:48:50 -0400] nacx: also I'll try to install another chef server (the one I have currently installed is 0.10.8) just to see if it still appears
[2012-07-02 16:49:54 -0400] adriancole: nacx if you end up with an ML link, I can beg opscode folks to help :P
[2012-07-02 16:51:16 -0400] adriancole: nacx good plan, man
[2012-07-02 16:51:33 -0400] adriancole: p.s. epic effort, getting things to work on chef .9, .10 and also private chef
[2012-07-02 16:51:46 -0400] adriancole: most folks don't do such comprehensive things
[2012-07-02 16:53:35 -0400] nacx: thx!
[2012-07-02 16:54:22 -0400] nacx: it's being woth the effort :) i'm getting used to all that guice magic
[2012-07-02 16:54:57 -0400] nacx: , and in the other hand making live tests pass will guarantee a bit more that the Abiquo features that use them still work too :)
[2012-07-02 16:55:50 -0400] nacx: it is not 100% altruistic, but I'll keep on that, hehe
[2012-07-02 16:56:00 -0400] adriancole: ahh agenda exposed
[2012-07-02 16:56:01 -0400] adriancole: :P
[2012-07-02 16:57:10 -0400] nacx: well, not an official agenda, but a personal desire of upgrading from jclouds-chef 1.0.0 (WTF!) to 1.5
