[2012-07-31 21:43:08 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] file diffs should work on Solaris too - Marc Paradise
[2012-07-31 21:55:06 -0400] hoover_damm: wouldn't it be great if node[:ipaddress] was a array?
[2012-07-31 21:56:04 -0400] hoover_damm: just talking about the wonderful fun of walking node['network'][#{interface}]['addresses'] basically
[2012-07-31 21:56:54 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: do the array elements match to eth0/eth1/etc?
[2012-07-31 21:57:26 -0400] mattray: because rhel6 destroys that
[2012-07-31 21:57:57 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, define rhel6 destroys that?
[2012-07-31 21:58:06 -0400] mattray: no longer have eth0, eth1
[2012-07-31 21:58:06 -0400] hoover_damm: mattray, because I don't have the time to know the nuances of every distro :/
[2012-07-31 21:58:13 -0400] hoover_damm: naming them e1001g?
[2012-07-31 21:58:20 -0400] hoover_damm: they never had to be named this way
[2012-07-31 21:58:27 -0400] mattray: instead you get the physical ids
[2012-07-31 21:58:27 -0400] hoover_damm: you can stop naming them that way now
[2012-07-31 21:58:37 -0400] hoover_damm: mac? or
[2012-07-31 21:58:48 -0400] mattray: like pci#, mb#, usb#
[2012-07-31 21:58:59 -0400] hoover_damm: oh gah
[2012-07-31 21:59:01 -0400] hoover_damm: could be neat
[2012-07-31 21:59:07 -0400] mattray: it's at least consistent
[2012-07-31 21:59:16 -0400] hoover_damm: that's good
[2012-07-31 21:59:21 -0400] hoover_damm: now is the rest of the world joining?
[2012-07-31 21:59:25 -0400] hoover_damm: or is this where we look dumb?
[2012-07-31 21:59:39 -0400] mattray: dunno, I've only seen it on rhel6 so far
[2012-07-31 22:00:06 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah it sounds like a one off behavior change that I hope gets pushed up
[2012-07-31 22:00:14 -0400] hoover_damm: but I would have expected to see that behavior on Fedora Core
[2012-07-31 22:00:21 -0400] hoover_damm: as that is how el normally works
[2012-07-31 22:00:36 -0400] mattray: btw, I switched the pxelinux.cfg.erb to use interface=auto and netcfg/chooseinterface=auto to no ill effects
[2012-07-31 22:00:53 -0400] mattray: so next pxe_dust release will just roll that in
[2012-07-31 22:01:00 -0400] hoover_damm: nice
[2012-07-31 22:01:44 -0400] mattray: but I will before too long
[2012-07-31 22:01:54 -0400] mattray: any other patches you may have for pxe_dust, please send them along
[2012-07-31 22:02:08 -0400] hoover_damm: oh i'm just hacking the preseed lately
[2012-07-31 22:02:12 -0400] hoover_damm: trying to make my life better
[2012-07-31 22:02:22 -0400] hoover_damm: sadly very little of use beyond me
[2012-07-31 22:02:24 -0400] mattray: I'd be amenable to switching to a smaller LVM / instead of the current setup
[2012-07-31 22:02:46 -0400] hoover_damm: well our current setup lvm's the whole disk and then sets up root and swap on lvm... 50G swap
[2012-07-31 22:02:57 -0400] mattray: yeah the swap :(
[2012-07-31 22:03:00 -0400] hoover_damm: err 50G root 100% swap (100% ram swap)
[2012-07-31 22:03:11 -0400] hoover_damm: now if you have 128gig of ram... ,,!! debian
[2012-07-31 22:03:15 -0400] hoover_damm: that's all I can say
[2012-07-31 22:03:41 -0400] hoover_damm: I actually have my preseed file set to 1g to 5g
[2012-07-31 22:03:44 -0400] hoover_damm: and it takes up 384gig
[2012-07-31 22:03:45 -0400] mattray: yeah, I'd be happy to support no swap if someone sends the patch
[2012-07-31 22:03:50 -0400] hoover_damm: not possible
[2012-07-31 22:04:06 -0400] hoover_damm: the installer actually will go interactive and say WAT NO SWAP? HOW DARE YOU!
[2012-07-31 22:04:15 -0400] mattray: perhaps in the posthook drop the swap and resize the root to the whole disk?
[2012-07-31 22:04:18 -0400] hoover_damm: and prompt you to add swap
[2012-07-31 22:04:39 -0400] hoover_damm: i'd prefer to push that upstream on ubuntu/debian to support properly
[2012-07-31 22:04:40 -0400] hoover_damm: then jank it
[2012-07-31 22:04:54 -0400] mattray: bah
[2012-07-31 22:05:05 -0400] mattray: (says the maintainer of the annoyances cookbook)
[2012-07-31 22:05:35 -0400] hoover_damm: If you don't file a ticket about your annoyance and you sit there with your thumb up your butt because x annoys you and it isn't getting fixed...
[2012-07-31 22:05:36 -0400] mattray: I agree, but you don't always get an elegant solution
[2012-07-31 22:05:52 -0400] mattray: true, is there a ticket with Debian?
[2012-07-31 22:05:54 -0400] hoover_damm: your not really helping yourself or providing a solution
[2012-07-31 22:06:05 -0400] hoover_damm: if not we can file one

[2012-07-31 22:09:15 -0400] github-bawt: [chef/master] solaris should fail w/ EPERM when creating a link that already exists - Marc Paradise
[2012-07-31 22:38:34 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: debian doesn't appear to have a web form for submitting bugs :(
[2012-07-31 22:38:50 -0400] mattray: looks like I'd have to install debian just to open a bug
[2012-07-31 22:39:05 -0400] hoover_damm: boot an ec2 instance?
[2012-07-31 22:39:06 -0400] hoover_damm: :-p
[2012-07-31 22:39:12 -0400] mattray: nothing here: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=base-installer
[2012-07-31 22:39:12 -0400] hoover_damm: horrible but true
[2012-07-31 22:39:58 -0400] ampledata: just complain on twitter
[2012-07-31 22:40:02 -0400] ampledata: :)
[2012-07-31 22:40:02 -0400] mattray: lol

[2012-07-31 22:40:17 -0400] hoover_damm: there is this
[2012-07-31 22:40:21 -0400] hoover_damm: fyi
[2012-07-31 22:40:42 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, actually that was one of the reasons i closed my twitter account
[2012-07-31 22:40:57 -0400] mattray: hoover_damm: +1ed
[2012-07-31 22:41:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I regret the few times I actually thought twitter was proper
[2012-07-31 22:41:44 -0400] mattray: later
