[2012-07-03 18:30:41 -0400] Mithrandir: has anybody looked at configuring non-chef capable devices with chef yet?  Like, routers?
[2012-07-03 18:31:12 -0400] c_t: I was wondering about that a bit, actually
[2012-07-03 18:31:32 -0400] c_t: but I'm not sure how well it would work
[2012-07-03 18:32:12 -0400] Mithrandir: probably a different set of providers that knew how to execute stuff on the router (using ssh or whatever) and then a separate chef-client per node on some agent machine
[2012-07-03 18:32:32 -0400] c_t: hmm, interesting way of going about it
[2012-07-03 18:32:43 -0400] Mithrandir: I don't really see how else you'd do it.
[2012-07-03 18:32:45 -0400] webframp: Mithrandir: there was talk about that last November at the chef summit, matt ray was leading some of the discussion I think
[2012-07-03 18:32:54 -0400] c_t: I need to update my router, actually, which is always a pain since I've tricked it out a bunch
[2012-07-03 18:33:11 -0400] Mithrandir: my router runs openwrt, but not going to try to get chef to run there.
[2012-07-03 18:33:12 -0400] c_t: but while it has (what seems to me at least) quite a bit of RAM, it doesn't have *that* much RAM
[2012-07-03 18:33:19 -0400] c_t: me too, Mithrandir
[2012-07-03 18:33:28 -0400] Mithrandir: I could possibly, maybe get cfengine running, but chef?  No way.
[2012-07-03 18:33:31 -0400] c_t: also might stress the thumbdrive I have stuck in there a bit much
[2012-07-03 18:33:45 -0400] Mithrandir: not without craziness like swapping over AoE which is just a bad idea on that kind of host.
[2012-07-03 18:33:54 -0400] Mithrandir: thumbdrives are cheap. :-)
[2012-07-03 18:34:07 -0400] c_t: sure, but still
[2012-07-03 18:34:08 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, i'd love a remote-chef.
[2012-07-03 18:34:32 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, a local chef-client that would connect to a remote device via telnet/soap/whatever and use ohai to determine the state of the device, and then configure it
[2012-07-03 18:34:45 -0400] cwj: i admit to trying to get chef on my pfsense router
[2012-07-03 18:34:45 -0400] hoover_damm: via a set of providers
[2012-07-03 18:34:55 -0400] cwj: gave up pretty quickly though
[2012-07-03 18:35:22 -0400] Mithrandir: hoover_damm: yeah.  _How_ to do it is pretty clear.  I was wondering if anybody had actually done the legwork yet.
[2012-07-03 18:35:43 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, I haven't done it due to lack of hardware to automate
[2012-07-03 18:35:45 -0400] hoover_damm: :(
[2012-07-03 18:35:53 -0400] hoover_damm: desire, but nothing to test/do it with
[2012-07-03 18:36:05 -0400] c_t: hmm
[2012-07-03 18:36:11 -0400] Mithrandir: I'm slightly reluctant to do this with my in-production home router. :-P
[2012-07-03 18:36:13 -0400] c_t: you know, I do have an extra wifi router laying around
[2012-07-03 18:36:34 -0400] c_t: DD-WRT only though, last I checked, and no way to stick extra space on it
[2012-07-03 18:36:44 -0400] Mithrandir: c_t: AoE?
[2012-07-03 18:36:54 -0400] c_t: still, interesting way to ensure it works in a small space
[2012-07-03 18:37:04 -0400] c_t: never tried, Mithrandir
[2012-07-03 18:37:06 -0400] Mithrandir: yes, a hack and evil and icky and all, but it works quite well.
[2012-07-03 18:37:17 -0400] Mithrandir: also, "security??"
[2012-07-03 18:37:29 -0400] Mithrandir: but for a plaything, probably completely fine
[2012-07-03 18:37:58 -0400] c_t: AoE's "security", as I recall, depends on it not being routable
[2012-07-03 18:38:04 -0400] Mithrandir: yeah
[2012-07-03 18:38:06 -0400] c_t: beyond that, good luck
[2012-07-03 18:38:14 -0400] Mithrandir: it's just raw ATA put into ethernet frames.
[2012-07-03 18:38:22 -0400] Mithrandir: the spec is about three pages, IIRC
[2012-07-03 18:38:25 -0400] c_t: but, I suppose, if someone's on your network that severely you have pretty big problems already
