[2012-07-09 00:23:11 -0400] hoover_damm: it's unfortunate every time I see someone try to use rvm or rbenv in production I wonder why is it so hard to have slotted rubies?
[2012-07-09 00:23:16 -0400] hoover_damm: s/slotted/prefixed
[2012-07-09 00:23:52 -0400] hoover_damm: I think the multiple ruby personality syndrome is just rough
[2012-07-09 00:25:08 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, isolation
[2012-07-09 00:25:20 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, we don't want multiple rubies; we want isolation of ruby
[2012-07-09 00:25:26 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, some, anyway, want that
[2012-07-09 00:28:56 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, then they don't understand what they want
[2012-07-09 00:29:04 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, which we all know is a real issue
[2012-07-09 16:41:11 -0400] c_t: So... did the Seattle folks get the lightning?
[2012-07-09 17:41:00 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-07-09 17:41:00 -0400] hoover_damm: we did
[2012-07-09 17:41:03 -0400] hoover_damm: pretty good show
[2012-07-09 17:41:25 -0400] superbaloo: would _REALLY_ need a knifeignore file for knife upload
[2012-07-09 17:41:31 -0400] superbaloo: would _REALLY_ need a knifeignore file for knife cookbook upload
[2012-07-09 17:41:43 -0400] superbaloo: otherwise i keep uploading my vim undofiles :(
[2012-07-09 17:41:50 -0400] hoover_damm: stop storing them there?
[2012-07-09 17:41:57 -0400] ampledata: doesn't this exist?
[2012-07-09 17:41:58 -0400] hoover_damm: I know it's a chicken or the egg problem
[2012-07-09 17:42:28 -0400] superbaloo: same problem for emacs
[2012-07-09 17:42:33 -0400] superbaloo: and so on
[2012-07-09 17:43:38 -0400] hoover_damm: i don't have that problem with emacs
[2012-07-09 17:43:49 -0400] hoover_damm: I don't litter my files with .files
[2012-07-09 17:52:29 -0400] jtimberman: superbaloo: there's a chefignore
[2012-07-09 18:02:03 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, see it does exist!
[2012-07-09 18:02:22 -0400] hoover_damm: but i've never really had an issue with littering my cookbooks with bogon files
[2012-07-09 18:02:30 -0400] hoover_damm: guess i'm lucky
[2012-07-09 18:05:00 -0400] ampledata: you're so lucky
[2012-07-09 18:05:01 -0400] ampledata: jt
[2012-07-09 18:05:04 -0400] ampledata: re: python thing

[2012-07-09 23:58:15 -0400] hoover_damm: man i wish i knew why my debian preseed was not accepting my http mirror
