[2012-07-30 01:14:29 -0400] g-rider: hey now.... chef newbie... I'm trying to install the mysql cookbook on ubuntu and it's wanting a windows cookbook
[2012-07-30 01:14:32 -0400] g-rider: anyone know why?
[2012-07-30 01:15:55 -0400] g-rider: this is via a hosted chef trial
[2012-07-30 01:47:55 -0400] sascha_d: g-rider...  http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1237
[2012-07-30 01:48:16 -0400] sascha_d: oops
[2012-07-30 01:48:20 -0400] sascha_d: that's for chef-solo
[2012-07-30 01:48:30 -0400] sascha_d: I have heard this is an issue or at least I've seen folks complain about it
[2012-07-30 01:49:50 -0400] hoover_damm: that is the problem with dependencies
[2012-07-30 01:49:59 -0400] hoover_damm: those cookbooks however should be noop on non-windows platforms
[2012-07-30 01:50:50 -0400] sascha_d: I see in that ticket I referenced that there is also another ticket with a request for case statements in the metadata.rb
[2012-07-30 01:50:53 -0400] sascha_d: for platforms
[2012-07-30 01:52:31 -0400] sascha_d: ah here's a better ticket http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1458
[2012-07-30 01:55:44 -0400] sascha_d: oic this has been fully discussed over in the other chef channel. That's what I get for randomly looking at IRC
[2012-07-30 01:55:56 -0400] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-07-30 01:56:23 -0400] sascha_d: I have an alarm on the windows keyword that causes me to look every so often
[2012-07-30 02:19:33 -0400] hoover_damm: ssd7, don't you wish people would just ask their question? ;)
[2012-07-30 02:19:40 -0400] hoover_damm: instead of asking if we were available
[2012-07-30 02:22:39 -0400] ssd7: :)
[2012-07-30 02:23:08 -0400] ssd7: Well, the biggest problem is that if it takes too long, I look away and then feel bad when I forget to look back.
[2012-07-30 02:24:30 -0400] hoover_damm: Totally context switch is lost
[2012-07-30 02:24:35 -0400] hoover_damm: you return to it once you are freed up
[2012-07-30 02:24:45 -0400] hoover_damm: and if they have patience you can then respond
[2012-07-30 02:24:49 -0400] hoover_damm: but usually they get annoyed by that point
[2012-07-30 02:33:52 -0400] sascha_d: I do that.  Pop in and ask and then hope someone remembers to use my user id when they answer
[2012-07-30 03:05:50 -0400] g-rider: hey guys
[2012-07-30 03:05:54 -0400] g-rider: sorry was over in #chef
[2012-07-30 03:06:01 -0400] g-rider: now i'm trying to do puppet on hosted chef
[2012-07-30 03:06:11 -0400] g-rider: and I found a fix for the issue i'm having but it still occurs
[2012-07-30 03:06:27 -0400] g-rider: pip fails
[2012-07-30 03:06:44 -0400] g-rider: the fix is here : https://github.com/lastobelus/python/commit/4c2e7d734c3c184f875d6afaa2d8e89f2b0fe440
[2012-07-30 03:06:47 -0400] g-rider: but it doesn't work
[2012-07-30 07:55:32 -0400] nico: heya hackers
[2012-07-30 08:01:07 -0400] nico: laurent\: around ?
[2012-07-30 08:03:53 -0400] nico: does anyone ever added a package provider using monkey patching ?
[2012-07-30 11:39:16 -0400] laurent\: nico: oui
[2012-07-30 13:58:32 -0400] superbaloo: does anyone have an idea / example for manipulating /etc/network/interfaces in debian (with chef)
[2012-07-30 14:03:41 -0400] nico: using an augeas lens ?
[2012-07-30 14:06:02 -0400] superbaloo: nico: don't you need a schema for this ?
[2012-07-30 14:06:08 -0400] nico: dunno
[2012-07-30 14:06:16 -0400] superbaloo: describing file content ?
[2012-07-30 14:06:41 -0400] nico: augeas has lenses
[2012-07-30 14:06:54 -0400] nico: http://packages.debian.org/stable/augeas-lenses
[2012-07-30 14:07:21 -0400] nico: /usr/share/augeas/lenses/dist/interfaces.aug is in the package
[2012-07-30 14:07:49 -0400] superbaloo: lenses is just a way to access/modify a data in a tree
[2012-07-30 14:07:58 -0400] superbaloo: still you need the tree :p
[2012-07-30 14:08:05 -0400] superbaloo: i'll take a look
[2012-07-30 14:14:40 -0400] superbaloo: nico: ok ... it looks awesome
[2012-07-30 14:14:48 -0400] superbaloo: thanks
[2012-07-30 14:14:55 -0400] nico: np
