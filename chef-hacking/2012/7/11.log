[2012-07-11 00:18:48 -0400] ampledata: word
[2012-07-11 00:18:56 -0400] ampledata: completely moved to librarian for 3rd party cookbooks
[2012-07-11 00:18:58 -0400] ampledata: feels good
[2012-07-11 00:28:51 -0400] hoover_damm: i tried using librarian long term
[2012-07-11 00:29:06 -0400] hoover_damm: but i stopped working for that client and found it only a semi-useful pattern
[2012-07-11 01:49:38 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, what might make it better?
[2012-07-11 01:50:38 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, it's not you, it's me.
[2012-07-11 01:50:58 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, I was open to it originally as it helped my 'rails'ish flow
[2012-07-11 01:51:15 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, but that flow really doesn't apply and i really don't like the prospect of filling in a file to have it clone all my repos
[2012-07-11 01:51:43 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, what are you doing differently?
[2012-07-11 01:51:50 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, i'm not dealing with that problem atm
[2012-07-11 01:51:51 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-07-11 01:51:54 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, ie from the "rails"ish flow?
[2012-07-11 01:52:12 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, not building repos for people and i just clone it in directly now and fill in the blanks
[2012-07-11 01:52:16 -0400] hoover_damm: submodule if i want tracking
[2012-07-11 01:52:39 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, cool
[2012-07-11 01:55:37 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, just to be clear the pattern that bundler applied scared the living crap out of me for about a year
[2012-07-11 01:55:46 -0400] hoover_damm: and I only accepted it because it was forced on the rails community
[2012-07-11 01:56:42 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, yep, didn't we talk about the bundler and apps at one point?
[2012-07-11 01:57:56 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, to be clear, there are many quite sensible reasons for doing things many different ways
[2012-07-11 02:08:09 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, yep
[2012-07-11 02:08:13 -0400] hoover_damm: pretty sure we did
[2012-07-11 02:09:35 -0400] miah: getting people to adopt a 'git repo per cookbook' style of development seems difficult...
[2012-07-11 02:09:46 -0400] miah: its been a uphill battle here, but i think i've finally convinced
[2012-07-11 02:10:34 -0400] hoover_damm: heh you did it?
[2012-07-11 02:10:35 -0400] hoover_damm: omg
[2012-07-11 02:11:08 -0400] hoover_damm: i wanted to split up ey's stuff for so long... but always got tied up with other people caring
[2012-07-11 02:11:25 -0400] hoover_damm: i just couldn't understand why people cared so much
[2012-07-11 02:11:27 -0400] hoover_damm: over so little
[2012-07-11 02:11:55 -0400] miah: ya
[2012-07-11 02:12:00 -0400] miah: agreed. thats been my point
[2012-07-11 02:12:32 -0400] miah: 'it will take you longer to create a gmail account than it will for me to execute a for loop that "git filter-branch"s each cookbook in site-cookbooks'
[2012-07-11 02:14:25 -0400] miah: i'm also trying to get people to adopt a standard coding style for our cookbooks
[2012-07-11 02:15:12 -0400] hoover_damm: i think i need to buy another mouse
[2012-07-11 02:15:22 -0400] hoover_damm: apple trackpad is finally getting to me
[2012-07-11 02:17:20 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, the only way to adopt a coding style is to make one
[2012-07-11 02:17:25 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, have you started with one?
[2012-07-11 02:17:53 -0400] miah: es
[2012-07-11 02:17:55 -0400] miah: yes
[2012-07-11 02:18:13 -0400] miah: i need to finish writing it up though. i've got plenty of code examples/
[2012-07-11 02:18:38 -0400] yfeldblum: miah, i'd start with "canonical ruby" as the coding standard ...
[2012-07-11 02:18:54 -0400] miah: lol ya
[2012-07-11 02:19:07 -0400] hoover_damm: remember ruby developers make the worst chef cookbooks
[2012-07-11 02:19:26 -0400] miah: yup
[2012-07-11 02:19:31 -0400] hoover_damm: if ruby or rails is their total profession and they are a 'developer'
[2012-07-11 02:19:33 -0400] hoover_damm: keep them away from chef
[2012-07-11 02:19:43 -0400] miah: so, that is exactly what i'm deal ing with
[2012-07-11 02:19:46 -0400] miah: but i suspect i can change them =)
[2012-07-11 02:20:32 -0400] hoover_damm: you can try
[2012-07-11 02:20:35 -0400] hoover_damm: but likely you will fail
[2012-07-11 02:20:52 -0400] hoover_damm: and if failure is what you expect and you succeed
[2012-07-11 02:20:57 -0400] hoover_damm: you'll be grinning for weeks
[2012-07-11 02:21:00 -0400] miah: :P
[2012-07-11 02:21:42 -0400] miah: yfeldblum: getting people to stop abusing the bash resource is my first order of business (especially when I see a HERE document)
[2012-07-11 02:22:00 -0400] hoover_damm: they wanted to dry up teh erb templates by adding macros to the libraries
[2012-07-11 02:22:18 -0400] miah: i think that is the best way honestly
[2012-07-11 02:22:31 -0400] miah: keep your code in libraries, classes, and modules.
[2012-07-11 02:22:57 -0400] hoover_damm: it's really not
[2012-07-11 02:23:04 -0400] hoover_damm: it's the most dry method
[2012-07-11 02:23:07 -0400] hoover_damm: and it can look perty
[2012-07-11 02:23:07 -0400] miah: as far as templates, most people i've talked to have said its best to keep code out of templates
[2012-07-11 02:23:14 -0400] hoover_damm: but the end result of troubleshooting a erb wtf
[2012-07-11 02:23:17 -0400] hoover_damm: is a lot more insane
[2012-07-11 02:23:18 -0400] yfeldblum: miah, `only_if "test -f /path/to/file"` vs `only_if { Pathname("/path/to/file").exist? }`
[2012-07-11 02:23:35 -0400] miah: oh god yes
[2012-07-11 02:23:37 -0400] miah: i see that a ton
[2012-07-11 02:23:59 -0400] yfeldblum: (often versus `creates "/path/to/file"` but that's another story)
[2012-07-11 02:24:28 -0400] hoover_damm: creates is a whole new thing for me
[2012-07-11 02:24:30 -0400] hoover_damm: so i don't use it
[2012-07-11 02:24:31 -0400] miah: when i see a bash resource, with a HERE document that does 'mkdir, chmod, and echo >> "file"' i cringe
[2012-07-11 02:24:32 -0400] yfeldblum: miah, local variables
[2012-07-11 02:24:43 -0400] hoover_damm: i tend to do only_if { File.exists?( or ..
[2012-07-11 02:25:14 -0400] miah: yfeldblum: yes, pass variables over to the templates
[2012-07-11 02:25:37 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, i tend to capture the path in a local variable first, so: `path = Pathname("/path/to/file") ; resource(path.to_s) { only_if { path.exist? } }`
[2012-07-11 02:25:39 -0400] miah: i need to get going
[2012-07-11 02:25:55 -0400] miah: ttyl
[2012-07-11 02:25:57 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, since most likely i will be using it twice
[2012-07-11 02:26:00 -0400] yfeldblum: miah, latez
[2012-07-11 02:26:06 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, or more
[2012-07-11 02:26:13 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, heh makes sense
[2012-07-11 02:27:25 -0400] hoover_damm: basically i don't want my librarires in my templates
[2012-07-11 02:27:31 -0400] hoover_damm: i don't want to export ruby code to my templates
[2012-07-11 02:27:34 -0400] hoover_damm: or functions
[2012-07-11 02:27:53 -0400] hoover_damm: i find it harder to travel back the trace
[2012-07-11 02:27:59 -0400] hoover_damm: and see it as plainly
[2012-07-11 02:28:04 -0400] hoover_damm: and as I actually read stack traces
[2012-07-11 02:28:12 -0400] hoover_damm: and debug from them
[2012-07-11 02:28:18 -0400] hoover_damm: i care alot about em :/
[2012-07-11 03:13:54 -0400] jtimberman: miah: the bash resource isn't all bad
[2012-07-11 03:14:11 -0400] jtimberman: when you're learning how to adapt your existing pile of shell script automation over to chef
[2012-07-11 03:19:58 -0400] sascha_d: Smart chefs find that their first refactor exercise is to erase all verbatim tranfers of shell scripts
[2012-07-11 03:19:58 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, absolutely, but once you've completed the step of porting your giant bash script over to a giant bash resource in a single-resource recipe, it's time to continue refactoring :P
[2012-07-11 03:20:26 -0400] sascha_d: :)
[2012-07-11 03:24:46 -0400] jtimberman: yfeldblum: totally
[2012-07-11 07:59:54 -0400] Mithrandir: sigh.
[2012-07-11 08:01:12 -0400] Mithrandir: knife search node $query -i's output format is now much less useful for use in for loops.
[2012-07-11 13:13:55 -0400] superbaloo: how are we supposed to escape @ chars in search queries ?
[2012-07-11 13:16:10 -0400] superbaloo: putting a @ in a searched value makes search explose while it's not a special character according to the wiki
[2012-07-11 13:17:45 -0400] superbaloo: (running queries like: knife search users 'mail:foo@acme.com'

[2012-07-11 14:44:27 -0400] yfeldblum: superbaloo, those are the best kind!
[2012-07-11 14:47:24 -0400] superbaloo: yfeldblum: this one was easy to fix in fact
[2012-07-11 14:47:38 -0400] superbaloo: https://github.com/opscode/chef/pull/333/files
[2012-07-11 14:48:52 -0400] yfeldblum: superbaloo, nice
[2012-07-11 15:31:16 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, my understanding of ruby was at one point 1.8.x was stable, 1.9.1 was development
[2012-07-11 15:31:20 -0400] hoover_damm: then 1.9.2 came out, which was stable
[2012-07-11 15:31:25 -0400] hoover_damm: but it versions itself as 1.9.1
[2012-07-11 15:31:27 -0400] hoover_damm: *twitch*
[2012-07-11 15:31:43 -0400] hoover_damm: anywho step forward to 1.9.3 the original p0 was a development release with 1.9.2 as stable
[2012-07-11 15:31:47 -0400] hoover_damm: I thought
[2012-07-11 15:32:03 -0400] hoover_damm: completely in my head and p0 was a stable release?
[2012-07-11 15:32:36 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, they were all intended to be stable, as far as i'm aware
[2012-07-11 15:32:52 -0400] jtimberman: no
[2012-07-11 15:32:53 -0400] superbaloo: hoover_damm: are you using debian ?
[2012-07-11 15:32:57 -0400] jtimberman: they were always "stable releases"
[2012-07-11 15:33:06 -0400] jtimberman: in as far as they were released.
[2012-07-11 15:33:15 -0400] jtimberman: Ruby doesn't do the "Linux Kernel Odd Numbered Dev Release" thing
[2012-07-11 15:33:27 -0400] superbaloo: ruby1.9.1 (1.9.2.0-2)
[2012-07-11 15:33:28 -0400] hoover_damm: actually I thought we did
[2012-07-11 15:33:32 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, whether they were, after-the-fact, proved to be stable or unstable is another question
[2012-07-11 15:33:32 -0400] hoover_damm: 1.9.1 was development
[2012-07-11 15:33:32 -0400] superbaloo: be carefull with debian
[2012-07-11 15:33:34 -0400] hoover_damm: 1.9.3 was development
[2012-07-11 15:33:36 -0400] hoover_damm: 1.9.2 was stable
[2012-07-11 15:33:39 -0400] hoover_damm: 1.9.4 would be stable
[2012-07-11 15:34:16 -0400] yfeldblum: 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 proved to be too unstable for much production use; 1.9.2 fixed most of the instabilities and is usually recognized as stable enough for most production use
[2012-07-11 15:34:19 -0400] hoover_damm: I believe that was the intention and it quickly dropped
[2012-07-11 15:34:24 -0400] hoover_damm: after 1.9.2's acceptance was high
[2012-07-11 15:34:40 -0400] hoover_damm: 1.9.1 was eh
[2012-07-11 15:34:40 -0400] superbaloo: jtimberman: when will be the next triage meeting ?
[2012-07-11 15:34:43 -0400] hoover_damm: and so was 1.9.0
[2012-07-11 15:34:53 -0400] hoover_damm: not bad ehs but as far as adoption
[2012-07-11 15:34:55 -0400] hoover_damm: it was an eh?
[2012-07-11 15:35:26 -0400] jtimberman: superbaloo: today
[2012-07-11 15:35:35 -0400] jtimberman: superbaloo: our code review meetings are weekly on wednesday
[2012-07-11 15:35:37 -0400] jtimberman: for cookbooks
[2012-07-11 15:35:52 -0400] jtimberman: for chef and other projects (knife plugins, ohai, etc), there's also a meeting on Mondays
[2012-07-11 15:36:30 -0400] hoover_damm: superbaloo, I use Ubuntu generally
[2012-07-11 15:36:43 -0400] hoover_damm: superbaloo, but the versioning of ruby in distros is abhorric
[2012-07-11 15:36:56 -0400] hoover_damm: more chickens need to be sacrificed to the mayan gods to fix the ruby versioning scheme
[2012-07-11 15:36:57 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, you open-sourcing opscode-cookbooks/solve-world-hunger soon?
[2012-07-11 15:37:06 -0400] superbaloo: jtimberman: ok
[2012-07-11 15:37:42 -0400] jtimberman: yfeldblum:  after i open source "reduce USA federal deficit"
[2012-07-11 15:37:43 -0400] jtimberman: :P
[2012-07-11 15:38:27 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, never gonna happen
[2012-07-11 15:38:32 -0400] jtimberman: no one sane has ever used the distribution-provided packages for their application stack
[2012-07-11 15:38:44 -0400] jtimberman: yfeldblum: i saw on the internet it is mathematically impossible now
[2012-07-11 15:40:15 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, it was on the internet so it must be true
[2012-07-11 15:40:23 -0400] jtimberman: yfeldblum: thats my thouhts on the matter!
[2012-07-11 15:40:54 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, gonna fork github/usgovernment/budget.git?
[2012-07-11 15:41:06 -0400] hoover_damm: and license it with Apache 2?
[2012-07-11 15:42:59 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, well, if we can't pay the national debt down when rates are below 0% right now, you can be sure we won't pay it down when rates go back to normal
[2012-07-11 15:43:59 -0400] jtimberman: well
[2012-07-11 15:44:04 -0400] jtimberman: its nuanced
[2012-07-11 15:44:13 -0400] jtimberman: but basically, people are trying to borrow their way out of debt
[2012-07-11 15:44:23 -0400] jtimberman: which is itself mathematically and logically impossible.
[2012-07-11 15:44:24 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-07-11 15:44:36 -0400] jtimberman: I digress
[2012-07-11 15:46:01 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, they read the new york times
[2012-07-11 15:49:28 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-07-11 16:04:22 -0400] hoover_damm: I don't think people realize that when the national debt hits 0 we are al broke
[2012-07-11 16:04:26 -0400] hoover_damm: s/al/all
[2012-07-11 16:04:45 -0400] hoover_damm: but that's subject for debate in some better #ot channel
[2012-07-11 16:31:32 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, happy to oblige ^_^
[2012-07-11 16:32:55 -0400] c_t: This is, oddly enough, where I go to take a break from politics
[2012-07-11 16:33:43 -0400] hoover_damm: really?
[2012-07-11 16:33:52 -0400] hoover_damm: well I have several offtopic channels I join... just not on freenode
[2012-07-11 16:34:29 -0400] c_t: hoover_damm: politics is part of the package at the ol' day job
[2012-07-11 16:34:38 -0400] hoover_damm: c_t, poor thing
[2012-07-11 16:34:40 -0400] hoover_damm: i can't do that
[2012-07-11 16:34:51 -0400] c_t: which isn't bad, mind you, but it's kind of nice to be able to get away from it sometimes
[2012-07-11 16:35:57 -0400] hoover_damm: oh i bet
[2012-07-11 16:39:11 -0400] c_t: wow, only about 3.5 more months of this
[2012-07-11 16:43:58 -0400] c_t: hoover_damm: it was kind of funny actually at the Chef Summit, because I went there with every intention of not talking politics at all
[2012-07-11 16:44:13 -0400] c_t: but it ended up being a large chunk of what people wanted to talk to *me* about
[2012-07-11 16:58:49 -0400] hoover_damm: poor thing
[2012-07-11 17:01:17 -0400] hoover_damm: I guess i've been avoding meetups / etc because I don't see the value in it lately.  I don't wanna talk about me, I don't wanna talk about how i'm a shithead.  I don't want people to talk to me just so they can sponge what information I have.
[2012-07-11 17:03:38 -0400] c_t: I haven't made it to any of the meetups and such simply from being busy, but there's something to be said about seeing people in the same general field occasionally
[2012-07-11 17:03:58 -0400] c_t: but I don't think it's a huge deal one way or another
[2012-07-11 17:04:03 -0400] hoover_damm: it really isn't
[2012-07-11 17:04:48 -0400] c_t: went to the summit because it was relatively near by, but otherwise never gotten around to it
[2012-07-11 17:04:50 -0400] hoover_damm: I would be more willing to go out on a paintball shootout with some Chef / Ops folks then go to a meetup about devops
[2012-07-11 17:10:54 -0400] imeyer: hey jtimberman
[2012-07-11 17:11:11 -0400] imeyer: i love you, can you explain FC001 about accessing node atrributes not as symbols?
[2012-07-11 17:15:37 -0400] yfeldblum: imeyer, internally they're always strings; interpolation with symbols is awkward; symbols aren't quite intended for this type of case; JSON knows only strings and doesn't know symbols; symbols can be confusing to those new to ruby, especially when juxtaposed with JSON data
[2012-07-11 17:17:11 -0400] jtimberman: imeyer: use strings OR symbols if you like.
[2012-07-11 17:17:19 -0400] jtimberman: and ignore that particular rule :)
[2012-07-11 17:18:06 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: heh, well, it started out as joking aroudn :)
[2012-07-11 17:18:20 -0400] c_t: hmm?
[2012-07-11 17:18:31 -0400] jtimberman: the politics stuff
[2012-07-11 17:18:34 -0400] jtimberman: anyway
[2012-07-11 17:19:07 -0400] imeyer: yfeldblum: yeah, i get that
[2012-07-11 17:19:10 -0400] jtimberman: imeyer: I also explained it all in an issue on the foodcritic project.
[2012-07-11 17:19:15 -0400] imeyer: i know i read the issue
[2012-07-11 17:19:18 -0400] imeyer: and i still don't get it
[2012-07-11 17:19:44 -0400] jtimberman: ok
[2012-07-11 17:19:52 -0400] imeyer: what yfeldblum makes sense, but it seems like a weird rule to put in place
[2012-07-11 17:20:10 -0400] imeyer: i mean, i think it makes more sense to just pick one way or not at all
[2012-07-11 17:20:14 -0400] jtimberman: well, i think it would make total sense to have that particular rule be configurable.
[2012-07-11 17:20:28 -0400] yfeldblum: imeyer, do you mix-and-match any of the other coding conventions you follow?
[2012-07-11 17:20:36 -0400] imeyer: cause i imagine if chef broke symbol "interpolation" then well...
[2012-07-11 17:21:01 -0400] imeyer: to paraphrase super troopers.. "i'm all symbols"
[2012-07-11 17:21:21 -0400] jtimberman: node[:"symbols can be strings you know"]
[2012-07-11 17:21:49 -0400] yfeldblum: imeyer, it's a coding convention; it's better to be consistent with one or the other than to mix-and-match, and my preferred choice is to use strings consistently
[2012-07-11 17:23:08 -0400] yfeldblum: i wonder if symbol interpolation and every use of String#to_sym requires locking the VM's symbol table
[2012-07-11 17:23:11 -0400] imeyer: i'm pretty stupid
[2012-07-11 17:23:20 -0400] imeyer: because i just realized it's a style and attributes rule
[2012-07-11 17:23:23 -0400] imeyer: which i don't care about anyway
[2012-07-11 17:24:11 -0400] yfeldblum: imeyer, like tabs vs spaces ;P
[2012-07-11 17:24:35 -0400] c_t: Indent style!
[2012-07-11 17:24:48 -0400] imeyer: yfeldblum: spaces!!!!!!!!
[2012-07-11 17:24:51 -0400] imeyer: VI!
[2012-07-11 17:24:55 -0400] imeyer: OS X!
[2012-07-11 17:24:57 -0400] jtimberman: EMACS
[2012-07-11 17:25:01 -0400] jtimberman: OS X we can agree on :)
[2012-07-11 17:25:03 -0400] imeyer: haha
[2012-07-11 17:25:12 -0400] jtimberman: wait... E_MACS...
[2012-07-11 17:25:24 -0400] c_t: any emacs fuckers are gonna get beaten
[2012-07-11 17:25:34 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: you can't handle my arthritic style
[2012-07-11 17:25:38 -0400] hoover_damm: emacs always wins
[2012-07-11 17:25:51 -0400] hoover_damm: it's unfortunate that people care so much about an editor that they quit jobs, start fights
[2012-07-11 17:25:55 -0400] hoover_damm: shove fist in mouth
[2012-07-11 17:26:04 -0400] jtimberman: Adam said you should never leave your editor. Thus, you should emacs, because no one can figure out how to exit.
[2012-07-11 17:26:22 -0400] jtimberman: ;)
[2012-07-11 17:26:23 -0400] hoover_damm: i don't agree with figuring out how to exit
[2012-07-11 17:26:25 -0400] hoover_damm: but the rest is right
[2012-07-11 17:26:26 -0400] c_t: kill -9 does wonders
[2012-07-11 17:26:29 -0400] imeyer: holoway is not my dad, he doesn't own me!
[2012-07-11 17:26:31 -0400] hoover_damm: if you exit your editor
[2012-07-11 17:26:36 -0400] hoover_damm: your doing it wrong
[2012-07-11 17:26:40 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, thought you weren't a fan of the politics
[2012-07-11 17:26:57 -0400] c_t: this is different
[2012-07-11 17:27:03 -0400] c_t: THIS IS SRS BUSINESS
[2012-07-11 17:27:16 -0400] imeyer: yah!
[2012-07-11 17:28:50 -0400] jtimberman: lol
[2012-07-11 17:28:51 -0400] jtimberman: <3
[2012-07-11 17:30:18 -0400] paulmooring: why are you not suppose to exit your editor?
[2012-07-11 17:32:21 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, because your choice of editor is fundamentally a moral choice; pick the wrong editor and you are essentially picking the wrong side of the "murder is wrong" debate
[2012-07-11 17:33:18 -0400] c_t: that's not even it, yfeldblum, because many would argue there are cases where murder is not wrong
[2012-07-11 17:33:24 -0400] c_t: like war, self-defence, etc.
[2012-07-11 17:33:34 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, if my choice of editor is a moral choice... better watch out for Adolf the emacs user
[2012-07-11 17:33:40 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, from another perspective, you want to pick the same editor that Nietzche's ubermenschen might pick
[2012-07-11 17:33:42 -0400] c_t: But ethicists have yet to find a situation where the use of emacs is ethical
[2012-07-11 17:34:06 -0400] hoover_damm: I really don't care about editors this much
[2012-07-11 17:34:22 -0400] hoover_damm: I use emacs, it works for me.  I can't stand vim-tiny, vim, the keybindings mess with me
[2012-07-11 17:34:27 -0400] c_t: Does anyone actually care that much?
[2012-07-11 17:34:30 -0400] jtimberman: fucking godwin's law
[2012-07-11 17:34:30 -0400] hoover_damm: Please move past the hate
[2012-07-11 17:34:32 -0400] hoover_damm: the stupidity
[2012-07-11 17:34:39 -0400] hoover_damm: and find love
[2012-07-11 17:35:07 -0400] yfeldblum: c_t, "murder" excludes "justified" killing
[2012-07-11 17:35:59 -0400] c_t: hush
[2012-07-11 17:39:50 -0400] geekbri: Plus everybody knows that vim is the right editor.
[2012-07-11 17:40:05 -0400] geekbri: duh
[2012-07-11 17:40:53 -0400] geekbri: clearly this cartoon explains it all. http://i.imgur.com/ODZlJ.png
[2012-07-11 17:40:56 -0400] hoover_damm: Here's the truth as I see it.  If you care about vim enough that you want to tell me to use it? You are not worth my time.  Don't tell me how to use my editor better, don't give me advise on how to use emacs.  I am a polyglot
[2012-07-11 17:41:05 -0400] hoover_damm: I can use vim and emacs
[2012-07-11 17:41:07 -0400] hoover_damm: just as well
[2012-07-11 17:41:34 -0400] hoover_damm: caring about an editor enough to the point that you won't work with someone? I will fire you
[2012-07-11 17:41:40 -0400] geekbri: I think you should use whatever editor you feel most comfortable using.
[2012-07-11 17:41:41 -0400] hoover_damm: I've had coworkers like that in the past
[2012-07-11 17:41:43 -0400] hoover_damm: I will fire them
[2012-07-11 17:41:44 -0400] hoover_damm: again
[2012-07-11 17:41:56 -0400] hoover_damm: it is wrong to tell your employer that I won't work with someone because they don't use nano
[2012-07-11 17:42:01 -0400] hoover_damm: or vim
[2012-07-11 17:42:02 -0400] hoover_damm: or emacs
[2012-07-11 17:42:13 -0400] hoover_damm: incredibly wrong
[2012-07-11 17:42:31 -0400] geekbri: Clearly you are right, except that you should obviously refuse to work with somebody who uses nano as their main editor ;)
[2012-07-11 17:42:58 -0400] paulmooring: geekbri: you should keep 1 nano user to unite vim and emacs users against a common enemy :)
[2012-07-11 17:43:07 -0400] geekbri: paulmooring: oh great point!
[2012-07-11 17:43:24 -0400] hoover_damm: geekbri, that's not left nor right
[2012-07-11 17:43:26 -0400] geekbri: every team needs a whipping boy too you know.
[2012-07-11 17:43:33 -0400] hoover_damm: no they don't
[2012-07-11 17:43:41 -0400] hoover_damm: if I have to be the whipping boy on another team
[2012-07-11 17:43:48 -0400] hoover_damm: I will likely slit someones throat
[2012-07-11 17:44:01 -0400] hoover_damm: don't ever make someone the whipping boy until you've been in that role
[2012-07-11 17:44:08 -0400] paulmooring: hoover_damm: for the record that was sarcasm, I really don't care what editor anyone uses
[2012-07-11 17:44:08 -0400] geekbri: Well I'm sorry hoover_damm if youre a throat slitter we can't consider you for the whipping boy position.
[2012-07-11 17:44:33 -0400] hoover_damm: paulmooring, I wasn't referring to you :)
[2012-07-11 17:45:00 -0400] hoover_damm: paulmooring, Don't forget your awesome
[2012-07-11 17:45:18 -0400] c_t: your awesome may have fallen behind the couch; look there
[2012-07-11 17:45:21 -0400] hoover_damm: geekbri, good because i refuse to let someone fuck with me for a paycheck.
[2012-07-11 17:45:21 -0400] paulmooring: I'm thankful for the use what's best attitude as I'm one of the few at Opscode that realizes vim is best ;)
[2012-07-11 17:45:25 -0400] geekbri: It is obvious I am always serious, especially in the past ten minutes.
[2012-07-11 17:45:26 -0400] imeyer: are you spelling you're/your incorrectly on purpose to troll?
[2012-07-11 17:45:59 -0400] imeyer: because it's working, if so.
[2012-07-11 17:46:06 -0400] StormSilver: Now imeyer is pissed.
[2012-07-11 17:46:18 -0400] lnxchk: you'll get three snaps and a hair flip for that
[2012-07-11 17:46:22 -0400] geekbri: hulk mode activate.
[2012-07-11 17:46:33 -0400] imeyer: StormSilver: I CAN'T DEAL WITH INCORRECT SPELLING.
[2012-07-11 17:46:43 -0400] IMEYER: ARGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[2012-07-11 17:47:01 -0400] paulmooring: IMEYER: your right I think you're anger is justified
[2012-07-11 17:47:20 -0400] lnxchk: looool
[2012-07-11 17:47:28 -0400] geekbri: Have some chamomile tea, it should help
[2012-07-11 17:47:31 -0400] imeyer: k, i'm cool.
[2012-07-11 17:47:49 -0400] StormSilver: imeyer: Are you not capitalizing I'm on purpose to troll?
[2012-07-11 17:48:02 -0400] imeyer: argh, you got me.
[2012-07-11 17:48:14 -0400] geekbri: StormSilver: Did you not quote "I'm" on purpose to troll?
[2012-07-11 17:48:18 -0400] imeyer: i would've gotten away with it too, if it hadn't been for you meddlin' hackers
[2012-07-11 17:48:22 -0400] hoover_damm: next company I start, I will not hire any vim users
[2012-07-11 17:48:31 -0400] hoover_damm: just so I don't have to hear about how 'vim is better then x'
[2012-07-11 17:48:43 -0400] StormSilver: geekbri: Argh, you got me.
[2012-07-11 17:48:45 -0400] hoover_damm: god that is so tiresome
[2012-07-11 17:48:46 -0400] geekbri: Just because you won't hear about it won't make it any less true.
[2012-07-11 17:48:55 -0400] StormSilver: geekbri: The worst part is that I considered quoting it but didn't.
[2012-07-11 17:48:55 -0400] imeyer: zing
[2012-07-11 17:48:57 -0400] c_t: What if you hire someone who converts?
[2012-07-11 17:49:04 -0400] hoover_damm: c_t, if they care
[2012-07-11 17:49:06 -0400] hoover_damm: they won't be hired
[2012-07-11 17:49:18 -0400] geekbri: what if you hire somebody who claims to use emacs, but really just has a bash alias that points emacs to vim
[2012-07-11 17:49:34 -0400] imeyer: geekbri: and what if they never knew it was aliased to vim
[2012-07-11 17:49:48 -0400] geekbri: Yeah, what if they were blissfully ignorant.
[2012-07-11 17:50:07 -0400] imeyer: so they thought that emacs had insert and visual modes
[2012-07-11 17:50:19 -0400] geekbri: and they thought all emacs plugins were written in vimscript
[2012-07-11 17:50:26 -0400] c_t: what if...
[2012-07-11 17:50:28 -0400] imeyer: (maybe emacs has them, i don't know, i don't use shitty editors (paging: jtimberman))
[2012-07-11 17:50:38 -0400] c_t: IT WAS NOTEPAD ALL ALONG??!
[2012-07-11 17:50:44 -0400] imeyer: LOL
[2012-07-11 17:50:46 -0400] geekbri: ahhhhhhhh!!!
[2012-07-11 17:50:55 -0400] geekbri: OH... it was all just a dream.
[2012-07-11 17:51:00 -0400] cwj: inception
[2012-07-11 17:51:03 -0400] imeyer: i used to read word up magazine
[2012-07-11 17:51:07 -0400] jtimberman: imeyer: WAT
[2012-07-11 17:51:14 -0400] StormSilver: An editor inside an editor inside an editor?
[2012-07-11 17:51:15 -0400] imeyer: salt n pepa and heavy d up in the limousine
[2012-07-11 17:51:20 -0400] cwj: salt 'n' peppah, heavy d up in the limousine???
[2012-07-11 17:51:33 -0400] imeyer: cwj: :D
[2012-07-11 17:51:42 -0400] lnxchk: wordpad 4 lyf
[2012-07-11 17:51:47 -0400] cwj: i can tell that imeyer used to let his tape rock until his tape pop
[2012-07-11 17:52:11 -0400] imeyer: i have severe issues with rap lyrics and every day life
[2012-07-11 17:52:25 -0400] geekbri: ...and that's just the way it is?
[2012-07-11 17:52:25 -0400] cwj: i am similarly afflicted
[2012-07-11 17:52:42 -0400] c_t: have you ever attempted to retrace Sir Mix-a-Lot's journey in "My Posse's on Broadway"?
[2012-07-11 17:53:10 -0400] imeyer: the worst is digital underground's "humpty dance".. i can't go a day without being able to jump into a phrase from someone saying something that goes along with the song
[2012-07-11 17:53:40 -0400] geekbri: I think I might be deeply offended that we are calling those different assorted artists you have mentioned rap.
[2012-07-11 17:53:50 -0400] geekbri: but I'm just not sure yet.
[2012-07-11 17:53:59 -0400] cwj: whatever happened to the emcees
[2012-07-11 17:54:01 -0400] imeyer: well, hip-hop?
[2012-07-11 17:54:17 -0400] geekbri: I think I offended myself by calling them artists.
[2012-07-11 17:54:29 -0400] jtimberman: run Emacs in a terminal, then use M-x shell to launch a shell, and run tmux in that. INCEPTION.
[2012-07-11 17:54:31 -0400] imeyer: that's messed up
[2012-07-11 17:54:42 -0400] imeyer: jtimberman: you're a towel in a towel in a towel
[2012-07-11 17:54:44 -0400] geekbri: jtimberman: what if you launch vim in that shel
[2012-07-11 17:54:52 -0400] jtimberman: geekbri: the singularity
[2012-07-11 17:54:53 -0400] cwj: vimception
[2012-07-11 17:54:59 -0400] imeyer: cwj: lulz
[2012-07-11 17:54:59 -0400] geekbri: that amused me.
[2012-07-11 17:55:02 -0400] jtimberman: cwj: :D
[2012-07-11 17:55:07 -0400] cwj: :D
[2012-07-11 17:55:18 -0400] geekbri: open screen -> launch tmux -> launch emacs -> launch shell inside of emacs with vim
[2012-07-11 17:55:22 -0400] geekbri: thats my current work environment.
[2012-07-11 17:55:31 -0400] cwj: edit one file in two editors at once
[2012-07-11 17:55:39 -0400] cwj: pair over tmux for bonus points
[2012-07-11 17:55:43 -0400] imeyer: put 'em on the glass
[2012-07-11 17:55:57 -0400] vaq: Quick question, how to debug a chef-client thats using 72% cpu usage, running as daemon.. I used the chef-client cookbook from the opscode site.
[2012-07-11 17:55:59 -0400] jtimberman: ah, see, in emacs you don't edit a file. you open a buffer that is visiting the file. for tea and crumpets, usually.
[2012-07-11 17:56:09 -0400] vaq: default installation.
[2012-07-11 17:56:27 -0400] c_t: Some people believe the world rests on the back of a neckbeard swimming in a great ocean
[2012-07-11 17:56:40 -0400] paulmooring: vaq: can you re-create it in the forgeround?
[2012-07-11 17:56:58 -0400] vaq: paulmooring: one sec.
[2012-07-11 17:57:00 -0400] geekbri: c_t: that is because some people know the truth.
[2012-07-11 17:57:02 -0400] lnxchk: jtimberman: that file is totally going to make you look at its holiday photos from majorca
[2012-07-11 17:58:42 -0400] vaq: paulmooring: chef-client -i 3600 -s 600, equals 96% cpu load
[2012-07-11 17:59:02 -0400] paulmooring: what's it doing anything getting logged?
[2012-07-11 17:59:25 -0400] vaq: turning debug logging on now.
[2012-07-11 17:59:34 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, what version of ubuntu do you run?
[2012-07-11 17:59:36 -0400] hoover_damm: or the kernel?
[2012-07-11 17:59:47 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, if that's ec2... i'd say you just hit the tsc bug

[2012-07-11 18:01:45 -0400] hoover_damm: basically with Xen what you see is the CPU steal going up usually
[2012-07-11 18:01:58 -0400] hoover_damm: so chef will have 60% cpu and 35% will be in 'steal'
[2012-07-11 18:02:18 -0400] hoover_damm: you should be able tos ee this behavior in top
[2012-07-11 18:03:00 -0400] vaq: this is not a xen kernel, however it is 2.6.32
[2012-07-11 18:03:39 -0400] hoover_damm: it's also el6.2 so it could just be your ruby version?
[2012-07-11 18:03:40 -0400] hoover_damm: ruby -v
[2012-07-11 18:03:41 -0400] vaq: so my options are to try and compile a custom kernel with that patch, or running chef-client as a cron job instead?
[2012-07-11 18:03:58 -0400] vaq: ruby 1.9.2p290 (2011-07-09 revision 32553) [x86_64-linux]

[2012-07-11 18:04:24 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, what are you running this on/under?
[2012-07-11 18:04:42 -0400] paulmooring: hoover_damm: that looks like the omnibus ruby version to me
[2012-07-11 18:04:50 -0400] hoover_damm: paulmooring, yep
[2012-07-11 18:04:51 -0400] jtimberman: vaq: the chef-client cookbook has a cron recipe for setting it up there instead of as a service.
[2012-07-11 18:05:01 -0400] vaq: yes it has
[2012-07-11 18:05:04 -0400] hoover_damm: paulmooring, so far everything i could have thought is wrong
[2012-07-11 18:05:14 -0400] vaq: hoover_damm: wow what?
[2012-07-11 18:05:27 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, is this metal/vbox?
[2012-07-11 18:05:29 -0400] hoover_damm: what?
[2012-07-11 18:05:35 -0400] vaq: paulmooring: i am using http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/chef-client
[2012-07-11 18:05:52 -0400] vaq: hoover_damm: metal 16 cores 32gig mem
[2012-07-11 18:06:12 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, and you rebooted since leapsecond?
[2012-07-11 18:06:22 -0400] hoover_damm: hate to ask
[2012-07-11 18:07:06 -0400] paulmooring: vaq: I actually use the cookbook all the time without problems
[2012-07-11 18:07:06 -0400] vaq: hm no, the box has been up for 38 days
[2012-07-11 18:07:15 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, you should a reboot it
[2012-07-11 18:07:18 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, two cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
[2012-07-11 18:07:23 -0400] hoover_damm: i bet it's tsc
[2012-07-11 18:07:24 -0400] paulmooring: does this happen immediately or does it have to run a while?
[2012-07-11 18:07:28 -0400] hoover_damm: but you are leapseconded likely
[2012-07-11 18:07:29 -0400] hoover_damm: with that kernel
[2012-07-11 18:07:32 -0400] hoover_damm: and that version of centos
[2012-07-11 18:07:32 -0400] vaq: # cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource tsc
[2012-07-11 18:07:43 -0400] hoover_damm: in top how much cpu is ksoftirq taking? 0?
[2012-07-11 18:07:57 -0400] hoover_damm: I saw several abberations of the leapsecond bug depending on how you attached to the clock
[2012-07-11 18:08:13 -0400] vaq: 0.2
[2012-07-11 18:08:17 -0400] hoover_damm: where ksoftirq was taking up 0% but the instance was still under duress
[2012-07-11 18:08:35 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, cpu time on them?
[2012-07-11 18:08:41 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, ps aux | grep ksoftirq
[2012-07-11 18:08:47 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, should be in seconds right?
[2012-07-11 18:09:07 -0400] hoover_damm: .2% cpu on a 16-core box can be a lot
[2012-07-11 18:09:10 -0400] vaq: http://pastebin.ca/2169754
[2012-07-11 18:09:30 -0400] hoover_damm: reboot
[2012-07-11 18:09:38 -0400] hoover_damm: and then verify your chef-client is the same please
[2012-07-11 18:09:48 -0400] vaq: but..
[2012-07-11 18:10:08 -0400] hoover_damm: welcome to leapsecond
[2012-07-11 18:10:09 -0400] c_t: we had to reboot our rails servers after the leap second business, vaq
[2012-07-11 18:10:12 -0400] hoover_damm: it burns everyone
[2012-07-11 18:10:22 -0400] hoover_damm: even opscode had issues
[2012-07-11 18:10:24 -0400] vaq: How can this cause a chef-client to load 72% when I've had no other issues with the server
[2012-07-11 18:10:32 -0400] vaq: so this only affects ruby apps?
[2012-07-11 18:10:36 -0400] hoover_damm: only people who had a 3.4 kernel or higher didn't sufer a ailure fate
[2012-07-11 18:10:44 -0400] hoover_damm: no it affects kernels from 2.6.32 to 3.4.x
[2012-07-11 18:10:45 -0400] c_t: oddly the perl servers didn't show any problems
[2012-07-11 18:10:55 -0400] hoover_damm: you should still reboot them
[2012-07-11 18:11:11 -0400] hoover_damm: all servers that have not been rebooted since the leapsecond bug are still taking 1Megawatt additional power
[2012-07-11 18:11:14 -0400] hoover_damm: then required
[2012-07-11 18:11:18 -0400] hoover_damm: so everyone /should/ reboot
[2012-07-11 18:11:26 -0400] hoover_damm: REBOOT EVERYTHING!
[2012-07-11 18:11:38 -0400] vaq: Okay guys, thank for your help.. I'm sad @ ruby
[2012-07-11 18:11:56 -0400] hoover_damm: this isn't ruby
[2012-07-11 18:11:59 -0400] hoover_damm: this is everything
[2012-07-11 18:12:02 -0400] jtimberman: the leapsecond issue is kernel related.
[2012-07-11 18:12:13 -0400] hoover_damm: https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/6/30/122
[2012-07-11 18:12:19 -0400] vaq: then how can It be that I havn't had any other issues with the server?
[2012-07-11 18:12:25 -0400] hoover_damm: those that used clock_realtime
[2012-07-11 18:12:27 -0400] hoover_damm: suffered a worse fate
[2012-07-11 18:12:28 -0400] hoover_damm: then others
[2012-07-11 18:12:37 -0400] miah: jtimberman: i think ultimately, the bash resource leads to bad practices. sure. its good while on that learning track.. but i still don't see chef as a paralellized shell script execution system.. =)
[2012-07-11 18:13:08 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, your whole infrastrcture is affected you just don't have any monitoring to see it
[2012-07-11 18:13:13 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, sucks to be you
[2012-07-11 18:13:25 -0400] vaq: thanks :)
[2012-07-11 18:13:28 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, see the lkml post i put up earlier
[2012-07-11 18:13:34 -0400] vaq: reading it now
[2012-07-11 18:13:37 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, this isn't fud or bs or anything lame :(
[2012-07-11 18:13:39 -0400] vaq: thanks for your help everyone
[2012-07-11 18:13:41 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, i wish it was
[2012-07-11 18:13:46 -0400] vaq: hoover_damm: me2
[2012-07-11 18:14:02 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, we had to reboot 1000 ec2 servers +
[2012-07-11 18:14:08 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, so my condolences
[2012-07-11 18:14:14 -0400] vaq: damn
[2012-07-11 18:14:20 -0400] vaq: what a day you've must have had
[2012-07-11 18:14:20 -0400] StormSilver: hoover_damm: So are you saying if I've got a server that's been up for 78 days, I should see a high load on it?
[2012-07-11 18:14:35 -0400] hoover_damm: weekend
[2012-07-11 18:14:37 -0400] hoover_damm: i lost my weekend
[2012-07-11 18:14:42 -0400] hoover_damm: first to have the power outage screw me
[2012-07-11 18:14:49 -0400] hoover_damm: then to have leapsecond add to the pain
[2012-07-11 18:15:08 -0400] hoover_damm: StormSilver, your ksoftirq normally should be under 10minutes of usage
[2012-07-11 18:15:09 -0400] vaq: hoover_damm: my condolence, here is a IRC BEER :)
[2012-07-11 18:15:09 -0400] hoover_damm: or less
[2012-07-11 18:15:18 -0400] hoover_damm: not hours
[2012-07-11 18:15:19 -0400] hoover_damm: or days
[2012-07-11 18:15:23 -0400] jtimberman: miah: IRC reply necromancer.
[2012-07-11 18:15:45 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, what's worse about bash is when you deal with perfectionists
[2012-07-11 18:15:51 -0400] StormSilver: hoover_damm: I see.
[2012-07-11 18:16:09 -0400] hoover_damm: basically review ksoftirq there's one for each cpu
[2012-07-11 18:16:14 -0400] hoover_damm: our power usage went up
[2012-07-11 18:16:52 -0400] cwj: vaq: re: BEER http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4063/4247405618_40bbe44794.jpg
[2012-07-11 18:16:53 -0400] hoover_damm: review the lkml post i linked above
[2012-07-11 18:16:55 -0400] hoover_damm: and have fun
[2012-07-11 18:17:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it wasn't fun :(
[2012-07-11 18:17:09 -0400] vaq: cwj: looks like a sad beer
[2012-07-11 18:17:22 -0400] StormSilver: Well, I've not noticed any problems.
[2012-07-11 18:17:39 -0400] StormSilver: But I guess now is as good a time as any to reboot the prod LB :)
[2012-07-11 18:17:56 -0400] hoover_damm: StormSilver, I didn't notice any problems at first either
[2012-07-11 18:18:04 -0400] vaq: cwj: this is a good beer http://tinyurl.com/cdgvy9f
[2012-07-11 18:18:04 -0400] hoover_damm: StormSilver, I was wrong
[2012-07-11 18:18:05 -0400] vaq: :)
[2012-07-11 18:18:14 -0400] hoover_damm: then i saw the pain
[2012-07-11 18:18:16 -0400] hoover_damm: and went omg
[2012-07-11 18:18:58 -0400] hoover_damm: basically depending on how you attach to the clock source (or your applications) related directly to how it messed up
[2012-07-11 18:19:23 -0400] hoover_damm: there are people that are affected and unaware likely for years to come
[2012-07-11 18:19:57 -0400] StormSilver: Interesting.
[2012-07-11 18:30:00 -0400] hoover_damm: leapsecond

[2012-07-11 18:33:13 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, reboot
[2012-07-11 18:33:16 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, don't be an idiot
[2012-07-11 18:33:23 -0400] hoover_damm: date -s is a soft patch
[2012-07-11 18:33:48 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, it clears the leapsecond from the register which solves your immediate problem.  You still take more power, you should still reboot
[2012-07-11 18:34:04 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, please don't accept date -s as victory.  It's not
[2012-07-11 18:34:16 -0400] vaq: alright, thanks for inf
[2012-07-11 18:34:17 -0400] vaq: +o
[2012-07-11 18:34:46 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, it's ultra crappy that it affected every distro basically and almost every linux user
[2012-07-11 18:35:00 -0400] hoover_damm: vaq, and it affected them in all different ways so if they all talked together... they could never agree on what happened
[2012-07-11 18:35:02 -0400] vaq: more power as in CPU cycles or electric
[2012-07-11 18:35:09 -0400] hoover_damm: eletric
[2012-07-11 18:35:20 -0400] hoover_damm: your cpu is drawing more power from the psu then it needs
[2012-07-11 18:35:28 -0400] hoover_damm: wonder what the longterm side effects are
[2012-07-11 18:35:56 -0400] vaq: okay hoover_damm thanks for insight
[2012-07-11 18:36:13 -0400] vaq: rebooting now.
[2012-07-11 18:36:42 -0400] hoover_damm: and dammit fujin was right
[2012-07-11 18:36:46 -0400] hoover_damm: but don't let him hear that
[2012-07-11 18:37:09 -0400] vaq: PHK @FreeBSD was right too
[2012-07-11 18:37:20 -0400] hoover_damm: what's phk up to?
[2012-07-11 18:37:53 -0400] vaq: just been telling everyone the past couple of months that the were a problem
[2012-07-11 18:38:12 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm sure others have as well
[2012-07-11 18:38:16 -0400] hoover_damm: it's just they were not being heard
[2012-07-11 20:04:50 -0400] yfeldblum: did someone win the vim vs emacs war here?
[2012-07-11 20:05:29 -0400] atomic-penguin: ed is the one true editor
[2012-07-11 20:06:00 -0400] yfeldblum: nano
[2012-07-11 20:06:38 -0400] lnxchk: pico
[2012-07-11 20:07:05 -0400] atomic-penguin: nano is just a rebranded pico
[2012-07-11 20:07:13 -0400] lnxchk: editorHipster only uses editors that don't come installed on any distro
[2012-07-11 20:07:25 -0400] atomic-penguin: Cause pine which pico came with wasn't FLOSS
[2012-07-11 20:08:40 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, emacs is always the winner
[2012-07-11 20:09:05 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, I have effectively paired with more emacs users with tmux then vim
[2012-07-11 20:09:36 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, enlightenment? or statistical abnormality?
[2012-07-11 20:09:38 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, pairing via tmux either in person or remotely is a valiable skill in general and having people work in the same editor and win
[2012-07-11 20:09:48 -0400] hoover_damm: it only worked really well with emacs
[2012-07-11 20:10:00 -0400] hoover_damm: every time I paired with a vim user the first 5 minutes was their vim setup
[2012-07-11 20:10:12 -0400] hoover_damm: emacs user? they just fire it up and work
[2012-07-11 20:10:13 -0400] hoover_damm: never exit
[2012-07-11 20:10:41 -0400] hoover_damm: it's a whole different work flow that is much more calm
[2012-07-11 20:11:01 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm afraid the vim users wouldn't get it yet
[2012-07-11 20:11:03 -0400] hoover_damm: in time
[2012-07-11 20:11:10 -0400] hoover_damm: if they pray hard enough
[2012-07-11 20:12:05 -0400] atomic-penguin: Are editor wars and github-bawt the only purpose of #chef-hacking?
[2012-07-11 20:12:58 -0400] hoover_damm: atomic-penguin, nope just a weird day
[2012-07-11 20:13:36 -0400] yfeldblum: eclipse is better
[2012-07-11 20:14:08 -0400] yfeldblum: mostly because it's written in java
[2012-07-11 20:14:14 -0400] yfeldblum: and everything written in java is better
[2012-07-11 20:14:18 -0400] yfeldblum: because it has beans in it
[2012-07-11 20:19:29 -0400] hoover_damm: netbeans!
[2012-07-11 20:19:37 -0400] hoover_damm: which has emacs mode
[2012-07-11 20:19:37 -0400] hoover_damm: win
[2012-07-11 20:19:48 -0400] hoover_damm: it all comes back
[2012-07-11 21:04:18 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: know anything about App::cpanminus?
[2012-07-11 21:04:50 -0400] jtimberman: yfeldblum: SublimeText2 fwiw
[2012-07-11 21:05:44 -0400] ashb: jtimberman: i know a fair bit about cpanm
[2012-07-11 21:06:51 -0400] ashb: oh thouight that probably doesn't help if its about the cpanm patch I submitted
[2012-07-11 21:10:07 -0400] jtimberman: ashb: ah ha!
[2012-07-11 21:10:13 -0400] jtimberman: ashb: so, we werej ust reviewing your ticket :)
[2012-07-11 21:10:28 -0400] jtimberman: ashb: and we're hesitant to ship the full file in the cookbook, and prefer remote_file instead.
[2012-07-11 21:10:48 -0400] jtimberman: however, its not really a versioned thing w/o doing the github.com zip/tar.gz
[2012-07-11 21:14:07 -0400] ashb: jtimberman: i can switch it to remote_file quite easily - and make it pull from CPAN which is the 'official' location for perl modules
[2012-07-11 21:14:24 -0400] ashb: (or pull the same version from github)
[2012-07-11 21:15:21 -0400] ashb: http://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/M/MI/MIYAGAWA/App-cpanminus-1.5015.tar.gz for instance
[2012-07-11 21:15:33 -0400] btm: ashb: you're awesome.
[2012-07-11 21:16:31 -0400] ashb: jtimberman: store version and checksum in attributes is the prefered way of doing this?
[2012-07-11 21:26:02 -0400] ashb: btm: thanks. why? :)
[2012-07-11 21:26:18 -0400] jtimberman: ashb: yeah, attributes, so someone can update them in a role
[2012-07-11 21:27:25 -0400] jtimberman: ashb: you're awesome for: contributing in general! also for being responsive to our request, and fixing the Config.pm thing (that annoyed me too :))
[2012-07-11 21:27:48 -0400] jtimberman: (I would have generalized Config.pm, but i don't know much of anything about that, or Perl in general (my perl knowledge has atrophied from not using it for about 10 years
[2012-07-11 21:27:52 -0400] ashb: the main reason was actuall the other ticket (failure to install not reporting an error)
[2012-07-11 21:27:52 -0400] c_t: jtimberman: oddly enough, I was looking at it a week or two ago
[2012-07-11 21:28:45 -0400] c_t: maybe a little longer
[2012-07-11 21:29:12 -0400] c_t: jtimberman, ashb: either of you guys see my perl ticket?
[2012-07-11 21:29:21 -0400] c_t: I suspect there may be some overlap
[2012-07-11 21:29:31 -0400] ashb: c_t: not unless it was http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1299
[2012-07-11 21:29:34 -0400] c_t: (mine's OS X related changes)
[2012-07-11 21:29:44 -0400] jtimberman: ashb's should work on osx too
[2012-07-11 21:29:53 -0400] c_t: lemme find mine
[2012-07-11 21:29:59 -0400] ashb: yeah - cpanm is what I use locally for installing things
[2012-07-11 21:30:05 -0400] ashb: but not checked and the path might not be right
[2012-07-11 21:30:21 -0400] ashb: where cpanm gets installed to, so should maybe attributeify that too
[2012-07-11 21:30:31 -0400] c_t: hey, off by one error: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1300
[2012-07-11 21:31:32 -0400] c_t: there's some deeper perl cookbook issues with os x, anyway
[2012-07-11 21:41:10 -0400] ashb: so the options are remote_file, execute, delete (and notifies/deletes etc) or a curl + bash script. I guess remote file is 'more portable'?
[2012-07-11 21:42:54 -0400] jtimberman: use remote_file, its idempotent
[2012-07-11 21:43:28 -0400] ashb: so cpanm recommends installing by curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - --self-upgrade
[2012-07-11 21:43:35 -0400] jtimberman: i'm not sure if i like .zip or .tar.gz; seems that .zip would be more portable, but i don't know where you'd want it that .tar.gz wouldn't be ok.
[2012-07-11 21:43:36 -0400] ashb: which is obivously not what we want to do here
[2012-07-11 21:43:46 -0400] jtimberman: correct, we definitely don't want to do that :)
[2012-07-11 21:44:01 -0400] jtimberman: its bad enough we're downloading code from a third party site randomly from the internet :D
[2012-07-11 21:44:12 -0400] jtimberman: make the URL an attribute
[2012-07-11 21:44:21 -0400] jtimberman: and then users can stick it on a local web server
[2012-07-11 22:03:11 -0400] yfeldblum: ashb, you don't need to use the resources shipped with chef when you don't actually care about converging the system around the resources
[2012-07-11 22:03:27 -0400] ashb: sorry what was that in relation to?
[2012-07-11 22:04:04 -0400] yfeldblum: ashb, "so the options are remote_file, execute, delete (and notifies/deletes etc) or a curl + bash script."
[2012-07-11 22:04:12 -0400] ashb: ah
[2012-07-11 22:04:55 -0400] yfeldblum: ashb, use resources when you want to declare what the final state of the system shall be; you don't need to use resources when what you're actually talking about is implementation details rather than describing the final state of the system
[2012-07-11 22:05:26 -0400] ashb: that's a good way of thinking about it
[2012-07-11 22:05:48 -0400] yfeldblum: ashb, at that point, it's what's the easiest way to achieve repeatable, failure-tolerant, idempotent convergence?
[2012-07-11 22:06:00 -0400] ashb: the only reall difference there then (not that I'm doing either way) is curl/wget dep vs not

[2012-07-11 22:06:42 -0400] fujin: fujin was right
[2012-07-11 22:06:43 -0400] fujin: all along
[2012-07-11 22:06:44 -0400] fujin: tbh
[2012-07-11 22:08:54 -0400] ashb: jtimberman: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/perl/pull/5
[2012-07-11 22:09:12 -0400] ashb: let me know if I should rebase those commits into one
[2012-07-11 22:17:46 -0400] yfeldblum: ashb, pretty sure `source ['perl']['cpanm']['url']` doesn't do anything good
[2012-07-11 22:18:11 -0400] ashb: huh. you might be right :)
[2012-07-11 22:18:23 -0400] ashb: should probably actually fire up a way of testing this
[2012-07-11 22:23:31 -0400] ashb: how do i set the temp dir for shef?
[2012-07-11 22:27:46 -0400] fujin: Chef::Config hash

[2012-07-11 22:28:02 -0400] ashb: ta
[2012-07-11 22:28:15 -0400] fujin: hrm
[2012-07-11 22:28:17 -0400] fujin: I dont' see the temp dir there
[2012-07-11 22:28:19 -0400] fujin: what temp dir do you mean?
[2012-07-11 22:28:36 -0400] ashb: remote_file is wanting to write to somewhere under /var/chef
[2012-07-11 22:28:42 -0400] ashb: or something is
[2012-07-11 22:28:47 -0400] ashb: for now I'll just create it
[2012-07-11 22:31:09 -0400] ashb: oh backup files

[2012-07-11 22:33:06 -0400] ashb: yfeldblum: what's the purpose of the .to_hash (in your comment to my commit)
[2012-07-11 22:34:12 -0400] yfeldblum: ashb, gives you an actual Hash instance, which
[2012-07-11 22:34:26 -0400] yfeldblum: ashb, which doesn't fail completely when you try to use it as a Hash
[2012-07-11 22:35:14 -0400] yfeldblum: ashb, as opposed to skipping that call, which returns to you a Chef::Node::Attribute instance, which does fail to work right when you try to use it as a normal Hash in any but the simplest of scenarios (which this example isn't)
[2012-07-11 22:36:03 -0400] ashb: ah

[2012-07-11 22:37:33 -0400] fujin: oh yeh
[2012-07-11 22:37:34 -0400] fujin: cache path
[2012-07-11 22:37:36 -0400] fujin: there you go
[2012-07-11 22:37:38 -0400] fujin: :D
[2012-07-11 22:37:50 -0400] ashb: yeah. sudo mkdir /var/chef && sudo chown was easier for the quick test :)
[2012-07-11 22:38:16 -0400] ashb: (as you can tell I never got around to chef-ing my laptop)
[2012-07-11 22:38:56 -0400] fujin: heh
[2012-07-11 22:39:11 -0400] ashb: anyway I've fixed up the pull request to you know, work
[2012-07-11 22:51:10 -0400] yfeldblum: ashb, might also think about applying the same technique in definitions/cpan_module.rb
[2012-07-11 22:51:41 -0400] ashb: yfeldblum: could do - only use two attribute uses tho
