[2012-07-17 03:33:59 -0400] lusis: jtimberman: it is not
[2012-07-17 03:34:23 -0400] lusis: it IS idempotent when you use the shortened fingerprint
[2012-07-17 03:35:19 -0400] lusis: ahh yeah I think that fix will actually work
[2012-07-17 03:35:26 -0400] lusis: just took a look at the pull request
[2012-07-17 03:35:32 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-07-17 03:35:34 -0400] hoover_damm: it's not
[2012-07-17 03:35:38 -0400] hoover_damm: i never cared
[2012-07-17 03:35:42 -0400] hoover_damm: kinda soft failed
[2012-07-17 03:36:13 -0400] lusis: well in my case I got spurious alerts for run failures last night
[2012-07-17 03:36:24 -0400] hoover_damm: boo
[2012-07-17 03:36:25 -0400] hoover_damm: that sucks
[2012-07-17 03:36:30 -0400] lusis: because the gpg keyserver was blocking/timing out
[2012-07-17 03:36:48 -0400] hoover_damm: doh
[2012-07-17 03:36:48 -0400] lusis: so I just changed to the shortened fingerprint and things were much happier
[2012-07-17 03:36:58 -0400] lusis: now if I can just deal with github storage server failures better ;)
[2012-07-17 03:37:25 -0400] hoover_damm: you can't
[2012-07-17 03:37:28 -0400] hoover_damm: you just fail on that
[2012-07-17 03:37:38 -0400] lusis: I'm more annoyed that the nrpe lwrp always reports as updated
[2012-07-17 03:37:41 -0400] lusis: as does one other
[2012-07-17 03:38:07 -0400] lusis: chef_handler[GraphiteReporting],chef_handler[Chef::Handler::Logstash],service[nagios-nrpe-server]
[2012-07-17 03:38:10 -0400] hoover_damm: nrpe fails for me because it doesn't restart
[2012-07-17 03:38:15 -0400] hoover_damm: when we update our configs
[2012-07-17 03:38:17 -0400] lusis: that happens sometimes too
[2012-07-17 03:38:21 -0400] hoover_damm: so we have to manually restart it
[2012-07-17 03:38:25 -0400] hoover_damm: it's more then sometimes
[2012-07-17 03:38:25 -0400] lusis: fucking NRPE
[2012-07-17 03:38:30 -0400] hoover_damm: it's lame
[2012-07-17 03:38:40 -0400] lusis: this is why I'm ditching as much as possible for logstash + collectd + graphite
[2012-07-17 03:38:41 -0400] hoover_damm: ios6 beta 3? sigh
[2012-07-17 03:38:42 -0400] hoover_damm: another update
[2012-07-17 03:38:51 -0400] hoover_damm: collectd with write_graphite i hope
[2012-07-17 03:38:54 -0400] lusis: yep
[2012-07-17 03:39:24 -0400] lusis: but I thought about using write_http with a logstash http input as well
[2012-07-17 03:39:30 -0400] lusis: so I could hit pager duty first
[2012-07-17 03:39:39 -0400] lusis: with the pagerduty output in logstash ;)
[2012-07-17 03:39:56 -0400] lusis: but for now, I'm just using nagios to poll everything from graphite
[2012-07-17 03:40:02 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-07-17 03:40:09 -0400] lusis: some log-based stuff bypasses nagios alltogether
[2012-07-17 03:40:13 -0400] hoover_damm: do you use umpire too?
[2012-07-17 03:40:16 -0400] lusis: not yet
[2012-07-17 03:40:19 -0400] lusis: considering it
[2012-07-17 03:40:27 -0400] lusis: I still haven't picked a dashboard
[2012-07-17 03:40:56 -0400] jtimberman: lusis: !!!!!!!!
[2012-07-17 03:40:58 -0400] jtimberman: hi
[2012-07-17 03:41:03 -0400] lusis: ohla
[2012-07-17 03:41:05 -0400] lusis: er hola
[2012-07-17 03:41:13 -0400] lusis: I came up for air
[2012-07-17 03:41:19 -0400] jtimberman: yeah?
[2012-07-17 03:41:19 -0400] bawt: yeah is only seems to show auto attributes from what i can see
[2012-07-17 03:41:24 -0400] jtimberman: lol
[2012-07-17 03:41:28 -0400] jtimberman: bawt: forget yeah
[2012-07-17 03:41:28 -0400] bawt: done
[2012-07-17 03:41:47 -0400] jtimberman: i'm working on wrapping up some truly badass stuff that we're doing for cookbook testing in jenkins.
[2012-07-17 03:42:10 -0400] jtimberman: author of foodcritic did some excellent work on this
[2012-07-17 03:43:15 -0400] lusis: nice
[2012-07-17 03:43:50 -0400] jtimberman: i like the stuff that atomic-penguin, nathen harvey, fletcher et all have done for travis-ci integration
[2012-07-17 03:44:05 -0400] jtimberman: but travis doesn't support private repos, and i don't imagine people want to share their internal cookbooks quite yet
[2012-07-17 03:44:32 -0400] lusis: heh
[2012-07-17 03:44:39 -0400] lusis: well you can get the code for travis though right?
[2012-07-17 03:44:40 -0400] lusis: so
[2012-07-17 03:44:47 -0400] jtimberman: eh
[2012-07-17 03:44:52 -0400] jtimberman: we already have jenkins
[2012-07-17 03:45:01 -0400] jtimberman: or you mean code for travis integration?
[2012-07-17 03:45:19 -0400] hoover_damm: I just use a regular graphite-web dashboard
[2012-07-17 03:45:27 -0400] hoover_damm: the whole caring over a better dashboard then the django app
[2012-07-17 03:45:29 -0400] hoover_damm: makes me LOL
[2012-07-17 03:45:42 -0400] hoover_damm: better problems to solve
[2012-07-17 03:45:53 -0400] jtimberman: i think we have gdash
[2012-07-17 03:46:03 -0400] hoover_damm: gdash is a 'dashboard'
[2012-07-17 03:46:06 -0400] hoover_damm: not a replacement :)
[2012-07-17 03:47:17 -0400] jtimberman: i have 0 experience with graphite
[2012-07-17 04:03:45 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, we were all a newb once
[2012-07-17 04:03:58 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, i need to update my graphite cookbook here
[2012-07-17 04:05:51 -0400] hoover_damm: I was happpy when i broke half a million
[2012-07-17 04:05:59 -0400] hoover_damm: i'll be happier once I break a full million in metrics
[2012-07-17 04:07:07 -0400] hoover_damm: due to graphite's documentation scaling graphite is ... fun
[2012-07-17 04:07:14 -0400] hoover_damm: and more reading the source
[2012-07-17 04:07:16 -0400] hoover_damm: then chef ever
[2012-07-17 09:47:55 -0400] superbaloo: looks like apt.opscode.com / wheezy is broken :(
[2012-07-17 09:58:13 -0400] superbaloo: libyajl-ruby(0.8.2-2lucid0) from opscode / wheezy conflicts with ruby-yajl(1.1.0-1) debian/wheezy
[2012-07-17 09:59:15 -0400] superbaloo: same with ruby-polyglot / libpolyglot-ruby
[2012-07-17 10:00:34 -0400] superbaloo: same with ruby-treetop / libtreetop-ruby
[2012-07-17 10:00:58 -0400] superbaloo: same with ruby-mixlib-log / libmixlib-log-ruby
[2012-07-17 10:01:57 -0400] superbaloo: oops
[2012-07-17 10:01:59 -0400] superbaloo: my bad
[2012-07-17 10:02:55 -0400] superbaloo: in fact, those packages are still there, but there is no conflict in lib*-ruby  packages
[2012-07-17 10:03:20 -0400] superbaloo: then upgrade path is broken because apt can't know it should be remove thoses
[2012-07-17 10:03:23 -0400] superbaloo: then conflict
[2012-07-17 10:06:05 -0400] superbaloo: will file a bug and a pull request
[2012-07-17 10:46:40 -0400] superbaloo: btm: if you can take a look at http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3298
[2012-07-17 15:00:37 -0400] superbaloo: btm: there ?
[2012-07-17 15:00:37 -0400] bawt: btm: there is a ticket regarding switching from run_command to shell_out, I think I'd like to work on it, but before that - I want to make sure that this is really needed and this patch would be accepted
[2012-07-17 15:01:08 -0400] btm: bawt, forget btm: there
[2012-07-17 15:01:08 -0400] bawt: okay then :)
[2012-07-17 15:01:20 -0400] btm: that was odd.
[2012-07-17 15:01:23 -0400] btm: superbaloo: yes, here.
[2012-07-17 15:01:32 -0400] superbaloo: (regarding CHEF-3298)
[2012-07-17 15:01:38 -0400] superbaloo: wheezy packages
[2012-07-17 15:01:57 -0400] superbaloo: the thing is: if you have old wheezy chef install
[2012-07-17 15:02:00 -0400] superbaloo: which i did
[2012-07-17 15:02:17 -0400] superbaloo: you had chef, ohai and libyajl-ruby (and others)
[2012-07-17 15:02:24 -0400] superbaloo: type apt-get upgrade
[2012-07-17 15:02:46 -0400] superbaloo: then chef get upgraded with new deps (ruby-yajl and others)
[2012-07-17 15:02:58 -0400] superbaloo: and libyajl-ruby stays here
[2012-07-17 15:03:12 -0400] superbaloo: as it doesn't have any explicit conflict with ruby-yajl
[2012-07-17 15:03:21 -0400] superbaloo: so apt tries to install ruby-yajl
[2012-07-17 15:03:50 -0400] superbaloo: and warns about files already owned by libyajl-ruby
[2012-07-17 15:04:19 -0400] superbaloo: then the only way out is the howto i put in the bug desc
[2012-07-17 15:04:54 -0400] superbaloo: while i agree chef should depends on ruby-yajl and others
[2012-07-17 15:05:19 -0400] superbaloo: libyajl MUST stays here and specify a explicit conflict with ruby-yajl
[2012-07-17 15:06:00 -0400] superbaloo: you can't put a conflict in Tollef's packages as they would refer to a package other than one in debian
[2012-07-17 15:07:35 -0400] superbaloo: upgrade problem will happen when debian will switch from squeeze to wheezy, libyajl-ruby will stay and make conflicts
[2012-07-17 15:09:00 -0400] superbaloo: btm: am i wrong ?
[2012-07-17 15:30:53 -0400] btm: superbaloo: I agree the lack of libyajl-ruby upstream is a bit of an issue to be sorted out. In other cases, ruby-mixlib-log does have a breaks for libmixlib-log-ruby, so we need to pin down why that isn't working (versioning?). Further, there's some discussion to evaluate using breaks instead of conflicts. http://lists.debian.org/debian-ruby/2011/06/msg00045.html
[2012-07-17 15:32:31 -0400] superbaloo: ho didn't see ruby-mixlib-log break
[2012-07-17 16:08:37 -0400] jtimberman: the thing?
[2012-07-17 16:08:37 -0400] bawt: the thing is that puppet has its problems
[2012-07-17 16:08:43 -0400] jtimberman: bawt: forget the thing
[2012-07-17 16:08:43 -0400] bawt: okay
