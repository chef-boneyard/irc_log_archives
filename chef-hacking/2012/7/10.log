[2012-07-10 17:27:11 -0400] hoover_damm: you know i wish people posted their question with the cookbook url in question, or gist of recipe, stacktrace, version of cookbook if applicable
[2012-07-10 17:27:29 -0400] hoover_damm: the common questions we always end up always re-asking
[2012-07-10 17:28:34 -0400] hoover_damm: and even if you put that in the topic it would be ignored 9/10
[2012-07-10 17:28:41 -0400] hoover_damm: so perhaps overcare is my problem today
[2012-07-10 17:36:12 -0400] jtimberman: http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[2012-07-10 17:36:13 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-07-10 17:36:50 -0400] ampledata: jtimberman
[2012-07-10 17:37:04 -0400] jtimberman: ampledata:
[2012-07-10 17:37:26 -0400] ampledata: lets talk about http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1415
[2012-07-10 17:42:16 -0400] jtimberman: what about it?
[2012-07-10 17:42:28 -0400] ampledata: you said ping you to discuss
[2012-07-10 17:42:41 -0400] jtimberman: ok :)
[2012-07-10 17:42:42 -0400] ampledata: what do you think, should that resource be changed to use the cookbook's attribute
[2012-07-10 17:42:48 -0400] jtimberman: no
[2012-07-10 17:42:53 -0400] jtimberman: not in the resources file
[2012-07-10 17:42:58 -0400] jtimberman: because the attribute might not be available there
[2012-07-10 17:43:10 -0400] jtimberman: due to the order in which the compoents of a cookbook are loaded.
[2012-07-10 17:43:34 -0400] ampledata: ok, should we even propagate the version from the attributes to the resource at all
[2012-07-10 17:43:41 -0400] ampledata: whatever method that might be
[2012-07-10 17:43:54 -0400] ampledata: it just seems wrong to have two different defaults set
[2012-07-10 17:43:54 -0400] jtimberman: ampledata: if you want to do that in your own recipe using the resource, then you can have it
[2012-07-10 17:43:58 -0400] jtimberman: er have at it
[2012-07-10 17:44:20 -0400] jtimberman: brb
[2012-07-10 17:45:11 -0400] ampledata: so the root of why i'm asking is this: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application_python/blob/master/providers/django.rb#L98
[2012-07-10 17:45:50 -0400] ampledata: the django resource calls python_virtualenv, without passing a python version. the default python version for python_virtualenv is 2.6, the default python version for the python cookbook is 2.7.1
[2012-07-10 17:46:12 -0400] ampledata: maybe we should change the default python version for python_virtualenv to 2.7.1 to match the cookbook
[2012-07-10 17:57:08 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, I remember when I started linking that url.
[2012-07-10 17:57:14 -0400] hoover_damm: s/ampledata/jtimberman
[2012-07-10 17:57:31 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, but smart questions really doesn't completely help
[2012-07-10 17:57:38 -0400] ampledata: meta questions
[2012-07-10 17:59:23 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, isn't 2.6 only for centos?
[2012-07-10 17:59:33 -0400] hoover_damm: and it should be 2.7.x for non el*
[2012-07-10 18:03:14 -0400] ampledata: idk, don't use centos
[2012-07-10 18:03:20 -0400] ampledata: ubuntu 1204 ships with 2.7
[2012-07-10 18:03:36 -0400] ampledata: and the much older version of the python cookbook we'd been using ships with 2.7.1 as the default
[2012-07-10 18:04:10 -0400] ampledata: i guess i don't care as much what the default is, as long as it's consistent
[2012-07-10 18:08:25 -0400] ampledata: """I was on http://weibo.com/ (Chinese Twitter) and spotted some questions asked about Splunk. I will communicate with them and get their detailed needs."""
[2012-07-10 18:08:41 -0400] ampledata: missed opportunity for chinese language social media experts
[2012-07-10 18:10:09 -0400] jtimberman: ampledata: well
[2012-07-10 18:10:23 -0400] jtimberman: ampledata: what is the python binary going to be called?
[2012-07-10 18:10:27 -0400] jtimberman: is it just python?
[2012-07-10 18:11:13 -0400] hoover_damm: 12.04 ships with 2.7 + 3.2
[2012-07-10 18:11:37 -0400] jtimberman: sure
[2012-07-10 18:11:53 -0400] jtimberman: so perhaps, if anything, the interpreter attribute in the resource should be 'python' and not 'python26' ?
[2012-07-10 18:22:31 -0400] ampledata: oh yeah
[2012-07-10 18:22:36 -0400] ampledata: that's better actually
[2012-07-10 18:23:55 -0400] ampledata: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/python/blob/master/providers/virtualenv.rb#L28
[2012-07-10 18:27:12 -0400] ampledata: i'll submit a thing thing
[2012-07-10 18:28:59 -0400] hoover_damm:  fwiw status.opscode.com
[2012-07-10 18:29:02 -0400] hoover_damm: won't open
[2012-07-10 18:29:17 -0400] ampledata: what error message
[2012-07-10 18:29:24 -0400] ampledata: i get errors ALL THE TIME with tumblr's
[2012-07-10 18:29:30 -0400] ampledata: or they need status.status.opscode.com
[2012-07-10 18:29:39 -0400] hoover_damm: strange
[2012-07-10 18:29:40 -0400] hoover_damm: not sure
[2012-07-10 18:29:43 -0400] hoover_damm: it's a redirect
[2012-07-10 18:29:47 -0400] hoover_damm: that firefox isn't using
[2012-07-10 18:29:52 -0400] hoover_damm: it's actually saying the connection is reset
[2012-07-10 18:29:59 -0400] hoover_damm: but curl walking the 302's works
[2012-07-10 18:30:01 -0400] hoover_damm: so hrmph
[2012-07-10 18:30:17 -0400] hoover_damm: weird
[2012-07-10 18:33:35 -0400] ampledata: hoover what's your github username
[2012-07-10 18:33:57 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, damm
[2012-07-10 18:34:29 -0400] ampledata: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/python/pull/15
[2012-07-10 18:35:49 -0400] hoover_damm: nice looks good and straight forward to me
[2012-07-10 18:35:51 -0400] ampledata: whoops fixed your callout
[2012-07-10 18:37:05 -0400] jtimberman: ampledata: Sweet. Thanks!
[2012-07-10 18:37:15 -0400] ampledata: add that to the 15 other i created yesterday
[2012-07-10 18:37:18 -0400] jtimberman: ampledata: I'm going to go tackle the deluge of tickets and pull requests.
[2012-07-10 18:37:25 -0400] jtimberman: Yeah. geez. ;)
[2012-07-10 18:37:28 -0400] jtimberman: You're awesome sir.
[2012-07-10 18:37:54 -0400] ampledata: luckily you guy's workflow is identical to ours
[2012-07-10 18:38:08 -0400] ampledata: jira -> branch -> PR
[2012-07-10 18:38:12 -0400] jtimberman: yay jira!
[2012-07-10 18:38:26 -0400] ampledata: i like the comment someone made at velocity about jira
[2012-07-10 18:38:39 -0400] jtimberman: "
[2012-07-10 18:38:46 -0400] jtimberman: "All ticket systems sucks, Jira sucks less"?
[2012-07-10 18:38:53 -0400] ampledata: "everybody is using it, but nobody is talking about it, probably because they don't want to answer the 100 'omg how did u get jira to do that?' questions"
[2012-07-10 18:38:58 -0400] jtimberman: lol
[2012-07-10 18:40:08 -0400] jtimberman: i've used just about all the popular ticket tracking tools
[2012-07-10 18:40:41 -0400] jtimberman: and jira is my favorite of all of them.
[2012-07-10 18:40:54 -0400] ampledata: ditto
[2012-07-10 18:43:21 -0400] jtimberman: ampledata: don't forget to resolve (but don't mark triaged) on tickets
[2012-07-10 18:43:26 -0400] ampledata: oh ok
[2012-07-10 18:43:32 -0400] ampledata: wasn't sure what the workflow was for that over there
[2012-07-10 18:43:43 -0400] hoover_damm: they don't touch it until you resolve the jira ticket
[2012-07-10 18:44:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i kinda wish there was a 'waiting to be reviewed' state to put it in
[2012-07-10 18:44:14 -0400] hoover_damm: resolving a ticket and then having to re-open it if the pull request isn't accepted feels awkward
[2012-07-10 18:44:27 -0400] hoover_damm: normally shouldn't have to do that though either
[2012-07-10 18:44:31 -0400] hoover_damm: so it's just a mild awkward
[2012-07-10 18:47:21 -0400] jtimberman: yeah
[2012-07-10 18:47:28 -0400] jtimberman: i don't like the "triaged" box
[2012-07-10 18:47:35 -0400] jtimberman: i think it should be "reviewed"
[2012-07-10 18:47:48 -0400] jtimberman: there's better workflow stuff that can be done, but btm and i haven't had round tuits
[2012-07-10 18:48:06 -0400] hoover_damm: in time
[2012-07-10 18:48:15 -0400] hoover_damm: maybce once it's the year 1 again?
[2012-07-10 18:51:40 -0400] ampledata: ok jiras closed
[2012-07-10 18:53:40 -0400] ampledata: <Chloe Yeung 11:52> take their five lines of bash code and turn it into >20 of python. but its prettier.
[2012-07-10 18:53:43 -0400] ampledata: best interns ever
[2012-07-10 19:10:00 -0400] jtimberman: ampledata: closed? or resolved?
[2012-07-10 19:48:38 -0400] ampledata: sorry resolved
[2012-07-10 19:53:10 -0400] jtimberman: k :)
[2012-07-10 20:00:59 -0400] ampledata: are there any chef focused job boards, we really need people
[2012-07-10 20:04:18 -0400] btm: ampledata: some folks have used the linkedin group. http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Opscode-Chef-Users-Group-3751378
[2012-07-10 20:04:37 -0400] btm: ampledata: there's a jobs board project on hold inside Opscode for integration into the community site.
[2012-07-10 20:07:25 -0400] ampledata: cool
[2012-07-10 20:47:03 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, most part job 'boards' are a cornacopia
[2012-07-10 20:47:16 -0400] hoover_damm: you gotta post your ad on github, on stackoverflow, on craigslist
[2012-07-10 20:47:28 -0400] hoover_damm: I wonder if there's some service that automates all the places you can post to?
[2012-07-10 20:47:37 -0400] hoover_damm: other then jobvite
[2012-07-10 20:48:55 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, I'm in the same boat
[2012-07-10 20:49:03 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, I need to write up a job posting and then find someone
[2012-07-10 20:49:17 -0400] hoover_damm: ampledata, so if you find any good things beyond the linked in group lmk
[2012-07-10 20:54:45 -0400] ampledata: just come work here
[2012-07-10 20:54:48 -0400] ampledata: we'll solve 2 problems
[2012-07-10 20:59:41 -0400] hoover_damm: that makes it more fun to find work
[2012-07-10 21:00:01 -0400] hoover_damm: and beyond that dunno? I never had a reason to say no to Splunk, nor yes..

[2012-07-10 23:50:35 -0400] hoover_damm: the world doesn't need to hear my tweets
[2012-07-10 23:50:46 -0400] hoover_damm: and I don't need to share stupidity
[2012-07-10 23:51:02 -0400] hoover_damm: my mom thinks i'm dead now

[2012-07-10 23:53:41 -0400] hoover_damm: basically I signed up for twitter awhile back and she tweet'd happy birthday the other year.  I ignored her, and when I left EY i deleted my twitter account
[2012-07-10 23:53:45 -0400] hoover_damm: so now she thinks i'm dead
[2012-07-10 23:53:51 -0400] hoover_damm: because I deleted my twitter account
[2012-07-10 23:54:30 -0400] hoover_damm: hard lesson
