[2012-07-01 01:03:51 -0400] hoover_damm: sorry

[2012-07-01 01:17:12 -0400] jtimberman: bemu: Folks are working on it.
[2012-07-01 01:17:22 -0400] bemu: I understand, I'm just exhausted and has been a hellish week.
[2012-07-01 01:17:29 -0400] bemu: Thank you!
[2012-07-01 01:17:45 -0400] bemu: I'm an idiot for not running newer kernels.

[2012-07-01 01:20:20 -0400] hoover_damm: it's worth it anywho
[2012-07-01 01:20:38 -0400] hoover_damm: owning your images and your bootstrap allows us to make our bootstrap process even sexier
