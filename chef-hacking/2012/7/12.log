[2012-07-12 15:30:41 -0400] geekbri: jtimberman: what is this method chaining for attributes that is being spoken of :)
[2012-07-12 15:38:21 -0400] jtimberman: geekbri: node.platform, node.ipaddress
[2012-07-12 15:38:22 -0400] jtimberman: etc
[2012-07-12 15:38:37 -0400] geekbri: jtimberman: oh, as upposed to node['blah'] ?
[2012-07-12 15:38:42 -0400] jtimberman: geekbri: but it can be surprising to people who aren't used to ruby, because you can have attributes with characters that aren't allowed in method names.
[2012-07-12 15:38:52 -0400] jtimberman: if i set
[2012-07-12 15:38:55 -0400] jtimberman: node['chef-client']
[2012-07-12 15:39:00 -0400] jtimberman: i can't use  node.chef-client
[2012-07-12 15:39:07 -0400] geekbri: yeah, that makes sense,  I never even considered accessing attributes that way.
[2012-07-12 15:39:07 -0400] jtimberman: because thats like, node.chef - client
[2012-07-12 15:39:14 -0400] jtimberman: some folks like it
[2012-07-12 15:39:18 -0400] jtimberman: and its totally cool
[2012-07-12 15:39:22 -0400] geekbri: i guess as long as you use _ :)
[2012-07-12 15:39:27 -0400] jtimberman: use what you like and are comfortable with :)
[2012-07-12 15:39:35 -0400] StormSilver: Seems like chaining is getting more and more popular.
[2012-07-12 15:39:36 -0400] geekbri: Yeah, its certainly less typing  :)
[2012-07-12 15:39:37 -0400] jtimberman: however, when making things sharable, that can bite people not used to it.
[2012-07-12 15:41:48 -0400] geekbri: Either way seems reasonable to me.
[2012-07-12 15:47:24 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, but can you do this? `node.send :"chef-client"`
[2012-07-12 15:48:56 -0400] geekbri: node['foo']['bar'] would just be node.foo.bar ?
[2012-07-12 15:50:06 -0400] jtimberman: yfeldblum: probably? I don't know, that seems really awkward and loses the nicety of the syntax :)
[2012-07-12 15:50:13 -0400] jtimberman: geekbri: yes
[2012-07-12 15:50:18 -0400] jtimberman: thats the "chaining"
[2012-07-12 15:50:24 -0400] geekbri: jtimberman: ok so, I'll go dig into the code, but I assume its just using method_missing ?
[2012-07-12 15:50:30 -0400] jtimberman: no
[2012-07-12 15:50:34 -0400] jtimberman: well, maybe
[2012-07-12 15:50:39 -0400] jtimberman: its "autovivvified"
[2012-07-12 15:50:56 -0400] geekbri: ah ok.
[2012-07-12 15:51:03 -0400] jtimberman: which i think is a term that comes from Perl?
[2012-07-12 15:51:05 -0400] geekbri: so maybe theres some other fancy metaprogramming that is making accessors for those ?
[2012-07-12 15:51:11 -0400] jtimberman: Yes.
[2012-07-12 15:51:13 -0400] geekbri: yeah thats a perlism
[2012-07-12 15:51:19 -0400] geekbri: I know because I always misspell it.
[2012-07-12 15:51:23 -0400] jtimberman: hyahaha
[2012-07-12 15:52:10 -0400] geekbri: I general avoid using the word due to my inability to ever spell it right :)

[2012-07-12 15:53:37 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, but you replace the nicety of the syntax with the geekery of the convolution of the syntax, which more than makes up the difference
[2012-07-12 15:57:41 -0400] jtimberman: lol
[2012-07-12 15:57:43 -0400] jtimberman: fair enough
[2012-07-12 16:03:25 -0400] geekbri: I can see what kind of a DM you are sir!
[2012-07-12 16:07:57 -0400] geekbri: jtimberman: I found the part where its letting you do the method chaining.  It's using method_missing, and also has auto_vivify_on_read? inside of it.
[2012-07-12 16:29:36 -0400] yfeldblum: nicer syntax, but confuses the fact that you're dealing with data rather than objects
