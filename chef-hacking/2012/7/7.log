[2012-07-07 01:03:07 -0400] ampledata: hey fujin
[2012-07-07 01:15:26 -0400] fujin: what up ampledata
[2012-07-07 01:16:05 -0400] ampledata: hey question about your changes to the chef-jenkins cookbook from wayback
[2012-07-07 01:16:18 -0400] ampledata: er rather
[2012-07-07 01:16:23 -0400] ampledata: maybe its chef-pennyworth
[2012-07-07 01:16:44 -0400] fujin: ya
[2012-07-07 01:16:45 -0400] ampledata: https://github.com/heavywater/chef-pennyworth/blob/develop/templates/default/package_from_git.erb#L49
[2012-07-07 01:17:08 -0400] ampledata: any idea where that remotePoll param comes from? the version of jenkins i've got doesn't seem to support it
[2012-07-07 01:17:23 -0400] fujin: sorry dude, no idea. the git Plugin I suppose
[2012-07-07 01:17:31 -0400] fujin: fuck jenkins
[2012-07-07 01:17:36 -0400] fujin: shit is for noobs
[2012-07-07 01:17:44 -0400] ampledata: heh orly
[2012-07-07 01:17:46 -0400] fujin: bit twiddling mother fuckers wanna deploy jenkins all day
[2012-07-07 01:17:55 -0400] ampledata: what are you guys rolling now?
[2012-07-07 01:18:06 -0400] fujin: jenkins. i just ripped it out of some infrastructure. rough day
[2012-07-07 01:18:23 -0400] fujin: I don't want to use jenkins
[2012-07-07 01:18:44 -0400] fujin: I think the fucking nightmare mess of automation I currently reflect on as pennyworth is horrible
[2012-07-07 01:18:48 -0400] fujin: You should only use it if you are insane
[2012-07-07 01:19:00 -0400] ampledata: haha ok
[2012-07-07 01:19:05 -0400] ampledata: i'm ripping bits of pennyworth out
[2012-07-07 01:19:08 -0400] ampledata: for use here
[2012-07-07 01:19:19 -0400] fujin: the concept is excellent, the implementaion is first-bake
[2012-07-07 01:19:20 -0400] ampledata: we use bamboo now, which is jenkins for cash
[2012-07-07 01:19:47 -0400] fujin: I have some stuff in the pipes... umm
[2012-07-07 01:19:51 -0400] fujin: So much flux -_-
[2012-07-07 01:19:56 -0400] ampledata: i was talking to miah and noah about this a while back
[2012-07-07 01:20:03 -0400] fujin: https://github.com/heavywater/pennyworth-packages
[2012-07-07 01:20:09 -0400] ampledata: i was trying to roll a CI -> Packaging solution and they pitched pennyworth
[2012-07-07 01:20:09 -0400] fujin: new bunchr definitions for ruby and shite
[2012-07-07 01:20:22 -0400] fujin: pennyworth at least kind of works sometimes. mostly
[2012-07-07 01:20:29 -0400] fujin: the public stuff anyway
[2012-07-07 01:20:35 -0400] fujin: the problems I'm referrign to are stuff we've added to it
[2012-07-07 01:23:17 -0400] ampledata: ok something to work off of, thanks
[2012-07-07 01:47:00 -0400] fujin: ampledata: I'll keep you posted bro. On the precipice
[2012-07-07 01:47:02 -0400] fujin: of something
[2012-07-07 01:47:05 -0400] fujin: 100% less brittle
[2012-07-07 01:47:08 -0400] fujin: 200% less complex
[2012-07-07 01:47:14 -0400] fujin: 65% reduced functionality
[2012-07-07 01:48:47 -0400] ampledata: cool thanks
[2012-07-07 01:48:58 -0400] ampledata: fwiw i just got everything working over here, i'll blog it up on monday
[2012-07-07 01:49:19 -0400] ampledata: github -> jenkins -> python pkg -> pypi
[2012-07-07 01:49:28 -0400] ampledata: noah would be pleased
[2012-07-07 01:50:50 -0400] fujin: nice man.
[2012-07-07 01:51:09 -0400] fujin: I think we'll likely setttle on a "github services" model, which consumes Github service hook (a-la Travis CI)
[2012-07-07 01:51:35 -0400] ampledata: ah yeah that's good
[2012-07-07 01:51:59 -0400] ampledata: i started running an loopback git server for testing those integrations
[2012-07-07 01:52:03 -0400] ampledata: instead of relying on github
[2012-07-07 01:52:07 -0400] fujin: word
[2012-07-07 01:52:21 -0400] fujin: I'd like to get that in there as well -- but primarly, ripping Jenkins out
[2012-07-07 01:52:34 -0400] fujin: we can have the principles of continuous delivery w/o that fucking nightmare continous integration setup
[2012-07-07 01:52:49 -0400] ampledata: also, why is every ci system a java hole
[2012-07-07 01:53:01 -0400] ampledata: i want ifttt for ci
[2012-07-07 01:53:16 -0400] fujin: heh. that's all you really need.
[2012-07-07 01:53:29 -0400] fujin: ampledata: well, we are in agreement. that very principle drives this one
[2012-07-07 01:53:55 -0400] fujin: continuously explaining to people how we use jenkins to essentialy be a "work flow" engine
[2012-07-07 01:53:59 -0400] fujin: kind of sucks the big donkey dick
[2012-07-07 01:54:39 -0400] ampledata: i mean, what are workflow engines?
[2012-07-07 01:54:44 -0400] ampledata: like our build system is a workflow engine
[2012-07-07 01:54:48 -0400] ampledata: our ci is kind of that
[2012-07-07 01:54:58 -0400] ampledata: they could probably do the same thing and shit out the same packages
[2012-07-07 01:55:59 -0400] fujin: yahuh
[2012-07-07 02:00:14 -0400] ampledata: ok i'm out, thanks for the help
[2012-07-07 02:00:42 -0400] fujin: later dude
