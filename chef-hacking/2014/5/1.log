[2014-05-01 17:28:57 -0400] c_t: ohai hacking oriented chefs
[2014-05-01 17:29:45 -0400] juliancdunn: ohai
[2014-05-01 17:29:53 -0400] juliancdunn: what craziness have you cooked up in goiardi now? :-P
[2014-05-01 17:30:19 -0400] c_t: prepping the next release
[2014-05-01 17:30:31 -0400] c_t: the mysql branch has been merged into master
[2014-05-01 17:30:47 -0400] juliancdunn: hah! awesome :)
[2014-05-01 17:31:23 -0400] c_t: it's behaving pretty well against chef-pedant now
[2014-05-01 17:32:27 -0400] c_t: the remaining failures involve /environments/<name>/roles (I set it up to issue a redirect to the equivalent under roles, but it looks like that doesn't actually make anything happy, so I may need to just bite the bullet)
[2014-05-01 17:33:08 -0400] c_t: and some nitpicky behavior that may reflect chef 10 bugs, or are at least not important
[2014-05-01 17:33:28 -0400] c_t: like a test that chef should allow you to totally delete the version string from a cookbook version
[2014-05-01 17:33:44 -0400] c_t: (not from metadata, either)
[2014-05-01 17:33:51 -0400] c_t: I... can't image why you would want to do that
[2014-05-01 17:48:57 -0400] btm: atomic-penguin: I'm not sure off-hand. I've got OHAI-551 on my list of yaks to visit. It's about the 4th yak down right now.
[2014-05-01 17:50:28 -0400] atomic-penguin: btm, I'm transitioning to new $job, but when you get to it feel free to ping me and I'll see if I can hop in and help out.
