[2014-02-06 19:36:30 -0500] github-bawt: chef/inline-syntax-check b8f52ad danielsdeleo: Use RubyVM to syntax check in-process where possible
[2014-02-06 20:12:01 -0500] aspiers: is there a good reason why CookbookCompiler#load_libraries_from_cookbook totally ignores $LOADED_FEATURES?
[2014-02-06 20:12:03 -0500] aspiers: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/run_context/cookbook_compiler.rb#L175
[2014-02-06 20:12:24 -0500] aspiers: if one library file requires another, this leads to the file being loaded twice
[2014-02-06 20:12:39 -0500] aspiers: which results in redefined constants and other worse breakage
[2014-02-06 20:12:55 -0500] aspiers: I guess this is what coderanger meant about no control over the loading order
[2014-02-06 20:12:58 -0500] aspiers: :-/
[2014-02-06 20:16:09 -0500] aspiers: this is about the 10th time I've regretted not switching to poise now :-/
[2014-02-06 20:23:23 -0500] coderanger: aspiers: I've not found a great fix for multi-running lib files, I might just have Poise monkeypatch Chef until it is fixed upstream
[2014-02-06 20:24:09 -0500] aspiers: coderanger: by wrapping Kernel#load invocations in a check of $LOADED_FEATURES?
[2014-02-06 20:24:36 -0500] coderanger: Or replacing it with #require which does exactly that :P
[2014-02-06 20:25:08 -0500] coderanger: I think it was originally load because in the days before forking mode, it _had_ to reload them on successive chef runs
[2014-02-06 20:25:12 -0500] aspiers: right - and if each library file contains the correct require dependencies then the exact load order doesn't matter anyway
[2014-02-06 20:25:25 -0500] aspiers: ah
[2014-02-06 20:25:27 -0500] aspiers: what's forking mode?
[2014-02-06 20:26:03 -0500] coderanger: It was added in the 10.teens I think, each chef run happens in its own forked-off worker proc which is reaped afterwards
[2014-02-06 20:26:43 -0500] aspiers: ah
[2014-02-06 20:26:57 -0500] aspiers: isn't there a new parallel execution mode coming in right about now too?
[2014-02-06 20:27:12 -0500] coderanger: Not that I've heard of
[2014-02-06 20:27:54 -0500] aspiers: https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3104
[2014-02-06 20:27:58 -0500] aspiers: is that what you mean?
[2014-02-06 20:28:02 -0500] aspiers: 10.14.0
[2014-02-06 20:28:21 -0500] aspiers: which is luckily older than the 10.24.x I'm forced to use
[2014-02-06 20:29:04 -0500] coderanger: On a train so loading webpages will take forever :)
[2014-02-06 20:29:23 -0500] aspiers: "Adds fork support for chef runs"
[2014-02-06 20:29:39 -0500] aspiers: "Adds support for forking chef runs. This resolves an issue where chef may potentially consume a large amount of memory via cookbooks (or any other source) and is unable to return it to the system. Every run is within a new fork so any memory allocated is returned once the run has completed."
[2014-02-06 20:29:40 -0500] coderanger: Yeah, that
[2014-02-06 20:29:52 -0500] aspiers: *sigh*
[2014-02-06 20:32:35 -0500] aspiers: coderanger: I think you should push for poise to go into core
[2014-02-06 20:32:51 -0500] aspiers: it should be the only way to define LWRPs in the future
[2014-02-06 20:32:56 -0500] coderanger: Yeah, just as a side effect, it means each run starts out with a mostly blank VM
[2014-02-06 20:33:39 -0500] aspiers: VM?
[2014-02-06 20:34:01 -0500] aspiers: it doesn't make sense for Chef to support two patterns for defining LWRPs, when they both suck in comparison to poise
[2014-02-06 20:34:15 -0500] coderanger: Not unless I get commit on core, and there is currently no precedent for non-employees to have commit despite me bringing it up many times
[2014-02-06 20:34:21 -0500] coderanger: Ruby virtual machine
[2014-02-06 20:34:28 -0500] aspiers: ah
[2014-02-06 20:34:37 -0500] coderanger: And LWRPs and Poise aren't mutually exclusive
[2014-02-06 20:34:51 -0500] coderanger: You should be able to use most of the helpers from an LWRP :)
[2014-02-06 20:35:04 -0500] aspiers: which helpers?
[2014-02-06 20:35:20 -0500] aspiers: oh, poise helpers
[2014-02-06 20:35:26 -0500] coderanger: subresources, include_recipe, option_collector, template_content
[2014-02-06 20:35:44 -0500] aspiers: yeah but why encourage people to continue writing LWRPs in a way which is known to be broken?
[2014-02-06 20:35:58 -0500] aspiers: why would you need commit on core?
[2014-02-06 20:36:20 -0500] aspiers: pull requests would still work
[2014-02-06 20:36:30 -0500] aspiers: and peer review is required for a change that big anyway
[2014-02-06 20:36:37 -0500] coderanger: Because I'm not giving my project to someone else?
[2014-02-06 20:36:38 -0500] aspiers: well, for any change :)
[2014-02-06 20:36:50 -0500] coderanger: Hah, lmao if you think opscode does peer review for all changes
[2014-02-06 20:36:59 -0500] aspiers: oh dear
[2014-02-06 20:37:10 -0500] coderanger: Mostly, yes. All, no.
[2014-02-06 20:37:11 -0500] aspiers: but we're all giving our code to everybody anyway
[2014-02-06 20:37:42 -0500] coderanger: and anyways, I would want control over the direction of it since I don't think Opscode is moving in the right direction on that front
[2014-02-06 20:37:52 -0500] coderanger: so saying "I trust you as stewards" is a non-starter
[2014-02-06 20:38:13 -0500] coderanger: As a point of comparison, I'm seriously considering forking Chef in the near future
[2014-02-06 20:38:30 -0500] coderanger: And transitioning the fork to a community-run project
[2014-02-06 20:40:09 -0500] aspiers: you mean you discussed the direction with them and they have agreed to disagree?
