[2014-06-04 15:21:00 -0400] hakunin: so I decided to try working with chef-dk
[2014-06-04 15:21:30 -0400] hakunin: and was trying to contrib to some cookbook out there
[2014-06-04 15:21:55 -0400] hakunin: that cookbook does a funny thing in its metadata.rb where it checks chef version in there
[2014-06-04 15:22:28 -0400] hakunin: it uses chef's Chef::Version to do the comparison
[2014-06-04 15:22:43 -0400] hakunin: and the chef currently in chef-dk is of version 11.14.0.alpha.1
[2014-06-04 15:22:59 -0400] hakunin: well, turns out Chef::Version inside 11.14.0.alpha.1 can't parse its own version
[2014-06-04 15:23:32 -0400] hakunin: '11.14.0.alpha.1' does not match 'x.y.z' or 'x.y'
[2014-06-04 15:23:39 -0400] hakunin: ^ this is the error
[2014-06-04 15:24:03 -0400] hakunin: it's a little sad in a funny kind of way :)
[2014-06-04 15:26:18 -0400] hakunin: cc jtimberman
[2014-06-04 15:37:44 -0400] hakunin: P.S. this is the offensive logic in the cookbook metadata: https://github.com/maxim/brightbox-ruby-cookbook/blob/master/metadata.rb#L20
[2014-06-04 15:56:36 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] mcquin force-pushed CHEF-5323 from de2188e to e043945: http://git.io/xvDARA
[2014-06-04 15:56:36 -0400] github-bawt: chef/CHEF-5323 e043945 Claire McQuin: save non-utf-8 encodable registry key data to node as an md5 checksum
[2014-06-04 16:05:51 -0400] jtimberman: hakunin: I don't think I would have used Chef::Version in metadata.rb.
[2014-06-04 16:06:21 -0400] hakunin: jtimberman: i agree, not my cookbook, not sure what type of chef regressions forced them to do it
[2014-06-04 16:06:43 -0400] hakunin: jtimberman: but the interesting part is that Chef::Version can't parse "11.14.0.alpha.1" as a version
[2014-06-04 16:07:18 -0400] jtimberman: no idea.
[2014-06-04 16:07:20 -0400] juliancdunn: also, I use Gem::Requirement to deal with pre-releases
[2014-06-04 16:07:33 -0400] jtimberman: Gem has some fine version comparison logic that it uses.
[2014-06-04 16:07:58 -0400] juliancdunn: but also, yeah, metadata should be metadata... keep the logic out of it
[2014-06-04 16:08:04 -0400] juliancdunn: IMO.
[2014-06-04 16:08:06 -0400] hakunin: agree
[2014-06-04 16:08:10 -0400] jtimberman: yup
[2014-06-04 16:08:18 -0400] juliancdunn: like line 1, 'require "chef"' ... ugh
[2014-06-04 16:08:29 -0400] hakunin: so it's not a bug that Chef::Version can't parse this type of version?
[2014-06-04 16:09:00 -0400] juliancdunn: it's not that it can't parse, it's that the comparison operators don't know how to deal with that
[2014-06-04 16:09:11 -0400] juliancdunn: 'cause... is "beta1" > "alpha69340" ?
[2014-06-04 16:09:39 -0400] jtimberman: well
[2014-06-04 16:09:45 -0400] hakunin: juliancdunn: it's really parsing, not comparison: /opt/chefdk/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/2.1.0/gems/chef-11.14.0.alpha.1/lib/chef/version_class.rb:65:in `parse'
[2014-06-04 16:09:52 -0400] hakunin: juliancdunn: that's source of the error
[2014-06-04 16:10:01 -0400] jtimberman: right.
[2014-06-04 16:10:10 -0400] jtimberman: this is the reason why cookbook versions have to be x.y.z
[2014-06-04 16:10:32 -0400] jtimberman: and can't be more semver-friendly type versions that include things like .rc, -1, timestamps, etc.
[2014-06-04 16:10:59 -0400] hakunin: this says that Version class is meant for cookbooks, not just any version
[2014-06-04 16:11:25 -0400] jtimberman: right.
[2014-06-04 16:11:31 -0400] hakunin: not a big deal i guess, but could be then named CookbookVersion
[2014-06-04 16:11:45 -0400] hakunin: to discourage this type of use
[2014-06-04 16:11:47 -0400] jtimberman: like, it worksish if your versions are like Cookbook Versions in the x.y.z confinement.
[2014-06-04 16:12:31 -0400] hakunin: also i believe this could just be delegated to some full blown version lib
[2014-06-04 16:12:41 -0400] hakunin: that supports fun things like these
[2014-06-04 16:13:05 -0400] hakunin: none of this is really important :) i will PR a cleanup for this particular metadata
[2014-06-04 16:14:19 -0400] hakunin: but just thinking out loud
[2014-06-04 16:14:55 -0400] hakunin: juliancdunn: and there are probably libs that figured out some reasonable heuristics for comparing these, but might not be worth a dependency
[2014-06-04 16:15:33 -0400] juliancdunn: in order to make "pre-release" cookbooks, gems, sensible I think we'd need to enforce more constraints on the naming than what semver.org prescribes
[2014-06-04 16:15:41 -0400] juliancdunn: 'cause you can choose anything, and that's just sad
[2014-06-04 16:17:16 -0400] hakunin: juliancdunn: jtimberman: so to improve the Chef::Version situation my humble suggestion is one of: 1. rename it to Chef::CookbookVersion, 2. make it smarter about more complex version names 3. all of the above
[2014-06-04 16:17:35 -0400] hakunin: s/version names/versions/
[2014-06-04 16:18:14 -0400] hakunin: but it does already enforce strict x.y or x.y.z
[2014-06-04 16:21:10 -0400] juliancdunn: yep, although we may already have a CookbookVersion, I'm not sure
[2014-06-04 16:21:14 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] mcquin force-pushed CHEF-5323 from e043945 to e12675b: http://git.io/xvDARA

[2014-06-04 16:21:25 -0400] juliancdunn: anyway. we would definitely take a ticket or a PR as a starting point for discussion hakunin
[2014-06-04 16:25:05 -0400] hakunin: juliancdunn: eh, a single incident. I'll do it if I see this mistake repeated.
[2014-06-04 16:25:48 -0400] juliancdunn: it's come up before, so it'd be good to get it on the board
[2014-06-04 16:25:56 -0400] juliancdunn: at least for pre-release cookbook versions
[2014-06-04 16:26:05 -0400] hakunin: for pre-release yes
[2014-06-04 16:26:05 -0400] juliancdunn: the metadata.rb hackery with logic is definitely WONTFIX ;)
[2014-06-04 16:26:15 -0400] juliancdunn: 'cause that's just gross
[2014-06-04 16:26:28 -0400] hakunin: agree, but i think those attribute declarations encourage it
[2014-06-04 16:27:25 -0400] juliancdunn: the irony is that those declarations aren't even consumed by Chef
[2014-06-04 16:28:03 -0400] hakunin: juliancdunn: i wasn't sure, i vaguely remembered that they might be for hosted chef?
[2014-06-04 16:28:30 -0400] juliancdunn: I've never seen them used anywhere
[2014-06-04 16:30:51 -0400] hakunin: juliancdunn: they are part of chef: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_metadata.html
[2014-06-04 16:31:30 -0400] hakunin: looks like they are for hosted UI
[2014-06-04 16:35:31 -0400] juliancdunn: maybe in v1 of the hosted UI, but I don't see them used in v2 anymore
[2014-06-04 16:35:33 -0400] juliancdunn: (the current one)

[2014-06-04 19:11:37 -0400] ohlol: trying to require a gem in a library with chef-zero, like https://sethvargo.com/using-gems-with-chef/
[2014-06-04 19:11:45 -0400] ohlol: should those work?
[2014-06-04 19:15:05 -0400] jkeiser: ohlol: yeah, and their failure or success shouldn't have anything to do with chef-zero--there's no point where they contact the Chef server
[2014-06-04 19:15:17 -0400] ohlol: hmm k didn't think it would

[2014-06-04 19:29:10 -0400] jkeiser: ohlol: what stuff
[2014-06-04 19:29:59 -0400] ohlol: most of it is specific to my setup
[2014-06-04 19:30:05 -0400] jkeiser: It would be pretty nice to have resources for provisioning that sort of stuff.  As long as it works with the fog:AWS driver configuration, resources in chef-metal-fog would be really welcome :)
