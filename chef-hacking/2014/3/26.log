[2014-03-26 15:51:35 -0400] braeuer: hi everyone. I used chef-solo before and am in the process of migrating to chef-client/chef-zero (so I can use search and data_bags). Previously it was easy to override attributes and template, by having multiple cookbooks-directories set. Seems like chef-client behaves differently. What is the currently recommended best practise e.g. to override a template in a upstream cookbook?
[2014-03-26 16:29:40 -0400] fnichol: hey chefs, how could create a chef validator (private) key and/or user (private) key completely without a chef server? i.e. an openssl/ssh-keygen command that would do this?
[2014-03-26 16:34:43 -0400] c_t: totally untested, but maybe ssh-keygen -t rsa -f validator?
[2014-03-26 16:35:10 -0400] c_t: then update the public_key attribute on the client/uer
[2014-03-26 16:35:53 -0400] c_t: hmm, although ssh keys are a little different looking
[2014-03-26 16:35:56 -0400] c_t: so it might not work
[2014-03-26 16:36:25 -0400] fnichol: c_t: this was the closest i have so far `ssh-keygen -m RFC4716 -f fnichol.pem`, but wasn't totally sure. i'd love to find the code on the server side, which would also help
[2014-03-26 16:37:13 -0400] fnichol: c_t: basically looking to populate a chef server from nothing & pre-generating a couple of private keys
[2014-03-26 16:38:03 -0400] c_t: I was mucking about with such code for goiardi auth a little while ago
[2014-03-26 16:38:14 -0400] c_t: but I've been generating those keys inside of it
[2014-03-26 16:38:18 -0400] fnichol: c_t: ah!
[2014-03-26 16:39:20 -0400] c_t: assuming goairdi behaves the same as the official server (and I think it does), you should be able to set public_key to any properly formatted public key that you generated
[2014-03-26 16:39:29 -0400] c_t: ... the question being making the key in the first place
[2014-03-26 16:39:59 -0400] fnichol: c_t: well, it's time for me to try it out i suppose. will report back :)
[2014-03-26 16:40:05 -0400] fnichol: c_t: and thx!
[2014-03-26 16:41:10 -0400] c_t: fnichol: in case this helps: https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi/blob/master/chef_crypto/chef_crypto.go#L34
[2014-03-26 16:43:21 -0400] c_t: the keys that generates pass all the relevant chef-pedant tests
[2014-03-26 16:45:48 -0400] c_t: in other news, postgres really is nicer than mysql, isn't it?

[2014-03-26 17:31:53 -0400] fnichol: c_t: totally, pg just keeps getting better and better
[2014-03-26 17:34:12 -0400] c_t: fnichol: now that goiardi has working auth and all, I've been working on adding real db support too instead of just running in memory
[2014-03-26 17:34:18 -0400] c_t: (all as options of course)
[2014-03-26 17:34:37 -0400] c_t: starting with MySQL, but with the intention of doing postgres next
[2014-03-26 17:35:10 -0400] c_t: and researching pg more as I go along, since I've been meaning to learn more about it anyway
