[2014-07-30 16:52:10 -0400] matti: I am curious what output ohai produces on such architecture.
[2014-07-30 16:52:35 -0400] matti: But, since amd64 prevails everywhere, ia64 is a hard thing to come by nowadays ;]

[2014-07-30 17:53:31 -0400] kallistec: miah_: you around?
[2014-07-30 18:07:39 -0400] miah_: hi
[2014-07-30 18:11:14 -0400] kallistec: miah: hello! So, first of all, maybe you should look at this: https://github.com/danielsdeleo/chef-workflow2-prototype/blob/master/docs/demo-script.txt
[2014-07-30 18:11:26 -0400] imeyer: hi
[2014-07-30 18:11:58 -0400] kallistec: that's an imagined terminal session for what we think (or thought) using the chefdk policyfile stuff would look like
[2014-07-30 18:12:27 -0400] kallistec: the part that I think is relevant to what we were talking about on twitter is
[2014-07-30 18:12:59 -0400] kallistec: that testing is included out of the box as part of the default flow
[2014-07-30 18:13:14 -0400] kallistec: what we want to do is something like how rails works
[2014-07-30 18:13:45 -0400] kallistec: if you're learning to program by writing rails, you never *start* with TDD
[2014-07-30 18:14:14 -0400] kallistec: but each time you generate a new model/controller w/ rails, it creates a test stub for you
[2014-07-30 18:14:40 -0400] kallistec: so there's a subtle but continual hint that, "hey, you should be testing stuff"
[2014-07-30 18:15:13 -0400] kallistec: once you kind of know your way around the basics, then you're in a good place to start writing tests
[2014-07-30 18:16:28 -0400] kallistec: but you have to give the user some time to grow and learn the tooling and concepts
[2014-07-30 18:17:13 -0400] kallistec: and probably get bitten a little bit by not using them so there's a more visceral understanding of why it's worth it
[2014-07-30 18:19:36 -0400] miah: hi, sorry. was hacking out another response to chef-rfc/pull/34
[2014-07-30 18:20:06 -0400] jtimberman: miah: just saw it :D
[2014-07-30 18:20:41 -0400] miah: and goddamn pandora keeps thinking my turntablism and hiphop station needs jungle and idm so i may be cranky
[2014-07-30 18:21:20 -0400] imeyer: well at least it's not edm

[2014-07-30 18:23:19 -0400] imeyer: miah: are you familiar with P.O.S. ?
[2014-07-30 18:24:43 -0400] z: packet over sonet?

[2014-07-30 18:26:41 -0400] miah: hrm
[2014-07-30 18:26:53 -0400] imeyer: sorry my mind latched on to the music talk
[2014-07-30 18:26:57 -0400] miah: not off the top of my head, but i can be bad with band names
[2014-07-30 18:27:15 -0400] miah: i remember the sounds well though
[2014-07-30 18:27:22 -0400] imeyer: "Graves (We Wrote the Book)" "Stand Up (Let's get Murdered)" are two songs I recommend
[2014-07-30 18:27:26 -0400] jtimberman: miah: "Furthermore, the names and structure we pass to the variable is almost always going to be different. See log_dir, log_directory, log-dir, etc." - I'm sorry, as I'm sure I started a bunch of that inconsistent nonsense long ago. :-|
[2014-07-30 18:27:49 -0400] miah: i am certain i contributed to it =)
[2014-07-30 18:28:03 -0400] imeyer: you pathetic imperfect humans!!!
[2014-07-30 18:28:37 -0400] jtimberman: imeyer: :(
[2014-07-30 18:28:45 -0400] miah: which is why we need guides; to help us not make the same mistake over and over
[2014-07-30 18:29:15 -0400] kallistec: miah: not to interrupt the dance party :P but did you have any comments about what I said re: policyfile and testing?
[2014-07-30 18:29:25 -0400] miah: i just read through that
[2014-07-30 18:29:28 -0400] miah: im still chewing on it
[2014-07-30 18:29:42 -0400] miah: first thing that comes to mind;
[2014-07-30 18:29:51 -0400] miah: over-reliance on chef server =)
[2014-07-30 18:30:01 -0400] miah: (chef-zero in this case)
[2014-07-30 18:30:14 -0400] miah: and i often think that chefspec tests are pointless
[2014-07-30 18:30:35 -0400] miah: yes, if chef converge completed, the file resource you declared will have been applied
[2014-07-30 18:30:44 -0400] miah: what we _should_ be testing is; are the contents what i expect
[2014-07-30 18:30:59 -0400] miah: but that can still be done inside a provider
[2014-07-30 18:31:10 -0400] miah: i mean, the whole point is to apply a state
[2014-07-30 18:31:40 -0400] miah: if we can guarantee that if we feed provider a <input foo> and it always produces <output foo>
[2014-07-30 18:31:46 -0400] jtimberman: i concur that in a large number of cases, chefspec tests are pointless.
[2014-07-30 18:32:01 -0400] kallistec: well, chefspec does that, too (modulo caveats). I see chefspec as a way to get really fast feedback of the sort you'd get from, say, the haskell compiler
[2014-07-30 18:32:03 -0400] lamont_oc: chefspec tests are fast though
[2014-07-30 18:32:11 -0400] jtimberman: like, if your recipe is three Chef core resources (package, template, service, e.g.), you don't need a chefspec test that you have those three things.
[2014-07-30 18:32:18 -0400] miah: so is twiddling your thumbs, and you get the same result
[2014-07-30 18:32:21 -0400] jtimberman: because that tests taht chef works.
[2014-07-30 18:32:29 -0400] miah: right
[2014-07-30 18:32:39 -0400] jtimberman: testing that you didn't have any typo that causes the recipe to not converge though, that's more useful.
[2014-07-30 18:32:46 -0400] lamont_oc: you can also test dozens of different fauxhai configs without having to spin up real virts for all of them
[2014-07-30 18:32:47 -0400] miah: and you can test templates without even involing chef
[2014-07-30 18:33:01 -0400] miah: require 'erb' ERB.new, feed it your template and your variables
[2014-07-30 18:33:02 -0400] jtimberman: however, the value i see is when you have a recipe that has branching conditionals and the like
[2014-07-30 18:33:06 -0400] miah: does it blend?
[2014-07-30 18:33:19 -0400] jtimberman: to catch regressions
[2014-07-30 18:33:35 -0400] miah: i think conditionals in recipes is often bad
[2014-07-30 18:33:44 -0400] jtimberman: adding a new platform to a cookbook that tests multiple platforms can help ensure that something else didn't break.
[2014-07-30 18:33:52 -0400] miah: because the users dont understand seperation between resources during converge time and during compile time
[2014-07-30 18:34:15 -0400] miah: plus it leads to the ugliest code =)
[2014-07-30 18:34:44 -0400] miah: it can be.. useful. but you have to wield it carefuly
[2014-07-30 18:34:53 -0400] miah: just like lazy {}
[2014-07-30 18:35:23 -0400] miah: and the many conditionals that branch on node attributes
[2014-07-30 18:35:28 -0400] imeyer: lol @ twiddling your thumbs
[2014-07-30 18:35:44 -0400] imeyer: none of this is going to *force* testing is it?
[2014-07-30 18:35:50 -0400] miah: well
[2014-07-30 18:35:56 -0400] miah: what i would want is useful testing
[2014-07-30 18:36:08 -0400] miah: i want mindstorms; we have duplos
[2014-07-30 18:36:08 -0400] imeyer: well "useful" can mean many things
[2014-07-30 18:36:16 -0400] imeyer: for me, useful testing is canary testing
[2014-07-30 18:36:23 -0400] lamont_oc: if youve got multiple platform support in a cookbook, though, and its ugly, then you can refactor and if youve got chefspec tests you can determine that for a given platform you still run the same resources in the same sequence  all on your mac.
[2014-07-30 18:36:24 -0400] kallistec: IMO if you have to use lazy, that's an indication that you should be encapsulating a thing, but it's too hard right now, LWRPs are too restricted and magical, HWRPs are too hard
[2014-07-30 18:36:51 -0400] imeyer: HWRPs aren't hard if you know what you're doing though
[2014-07-30 18:36:52 -0400] holoway: can we just call them resources and providers again? :)
[2014-07-30 18:36:56 -0400] miah: imeyer: agreed
[2014-07-30 18:37:03 -0400] miah: i am find with resources and providers
[2014-07-30 18:37:04 -0400] lamont_oc: which is the same thing we do with core chef unit tests  so kallistec doesnt have to spin up a windows virt to know if he broke a windows provider and avoids him getting all grouchy by touching windows
[2014-07-30 18:37:08 -0400] kallistec: imeyer: no, testing isn't going to be enforced, but we just want to make it easy to get into
[2014-07-30 18:37:12 -0400] holoway: I regret ever having the LWRP thing be not just the thing
[2014-07-30 18:37:15 -0400] imeyer: kallistec: okay, cool.
[2014-07-30 18:37:34 -0400] imeyer: holoway: don't regret, man. it's all good.
[2014-07-30 18:37:39 -0400] holoway: miah: I commented on your PR (which I'm glad is where some of this discussion is happening because folks who aren't here can see it)
[2014-07-30 18:37:49 -0400] miah: ya
[2014-07-30 18:37:54 -0400] miah: ill read in a moment
[2014-07-30 18:37:58 -0400] holoway: tl;dr, I think you and I are on the same page
[2014-07-30 18:38:02 -0400] miah: hot
[2014-07-30 18:38:03 -0400] jtimberman: lamont_oc: right, that's the thign i see value
[2014-07-30 18:38:05 -0400] holoway: about what useful shared abstractions actually are
[2014-07-30 18:38:29 -0400] jtimberman: imeyer: i'm a fan of using < LWRPBase in "libraries/thing_provider.rb" etc.
[2014-07-30 18:38:30 -0400] holoway: we just need more working code to bang on
[2014-07-30 18:38:31 -0400] miah: abstractions are really hard to talk about
[2014-07-30 18:38:39 -0400] holoway: because of what you just said
[2014-07-30 18:38:43 -0400] miah: holoway: would <3 review; https://gitlab.com/viscera/chef_instance
[2014-07-30 18:38:46 -0400] miah: still very infancy
[2014-07-30 18:38:51 -0400] holoway: there is actually, literally, 0 value in putting that shit in an RFC
[2014-07-30 18:39:01 -0400] holoway: unless we have code to fondle
[2014-07-30 18:39:14 -0400] holoway: cause we'll just have a storm of misunderstandings and crazy
[2014-07-30 18:39:14 -0400] imeyer: RFCs are annoying
[2014-07-30 18:39:14 -0400] bawt: OK
[2014-07-30 18:39:16 -0400] holoway: :)
[2014-07-30 18:39:16 -0400] kallistec: I have an idea I want to try, where we run chefspec with a default "does it compile" test, add conventions for attributes/data bags/etc. file layout so they get picked up automatically, then you reuse those to run a TK converge
[2014-07-30 18:39:20 -0400] holoway: I *love* the RFCs
[2014-07-30 18:39:22 -0400] imeyer: cool your jets bawt
[2014-07-30 18:40:01 -0400] imeyer: sorry let me be more succinct, RFCs as I seem implemented in orgs nowadays annoy me.
[2014-07-30 18:40:02 -0400] mparadise:  /win 14
[2014-07-30 18:40:08 -0400] imeyer: s/seem/see/
[2014-07-30 18:40:25 -0400] holoway: miah: on the just rubygems thing, I feel the same way, basically. I think that way lies madness, but I've been wrong about lots of shit
[2014-07-30 18:40:30 -0400] holoway: miah: just because I can't see it doesn't mean its bad
[2014-07-30 18:40:36 -0400] holoway: miah: just means I'm the way wrong human to write it
[2014-07-30 18:40:48 -0400] miah: ya
[2014-07-30 18:40:57 -0400] miah: i think implementing yet another packaging system is always the wrong idea
[2014-07-30 18:41:07 -0400] miah: because its going to be awful. we know that.
[2014-07-30 18:41:17 -0400] miah: so might as well use the one the most people are banging on in the community
[2014-07-30 18:41:17 -0400] holoway: my hope is we get to a place where we actually have a layer where writing that experiment doesn't mean having to break the world
[2014-07-30 18:41:20 -0400] miah: which is rubygems
[2014-07-30 18:41:20 -0400] bawt: OK
[2014-07-30 18:41:29 -0400] miah: bawt: which is not rubygems
[2014-07-30 18:41:35 -0400] imeyer: holoway: lol yeah, let's go back to openid ;)
[2014-07-30 18:41:53 -0400] holoway: (ie - you could write a new section of that RFC that uses the same 'chef' commands but uses rubygems to resolve)
[2014-07-30 18:41:58 -0400] kallistec: The one thing I see there, is there's lots of visceral negative reactions to a flat namespace, because people really want their nginx cookbook to be named "nginx" and not after the author's dog or whatever
[2014-07-30 18:41:59 -0400] holoway: (and literally nobody would know)
[2014-07-30 18:42:10 -0400] miah: yup
[2014-07-30 18:42:15 -0400] holoway: at which point we aren't fighting about whether its a good idea
[2014-07-30 18:42:23 -0400] holoway: we're just embracing the experiment and seeing what pops
[2014-07-30 18:42:25 -0400] imeyer: kallistec: true
[2014-07-30 18:42:31 -0400] holoway: imeyer: I was ahead of my time
[2014-07-30 18:42:47 -0400] miah: i dont care if im redis, or miah_redis, or chef_redis, or shit_redis
[2014-07-30 18:42:50 -0400] imeyer: kallistec: i've grown to like Go's import system
[2014-07-30 18:42:51 -0400] holoway: :)
[2014-07-30 18:42:53 -0400] miah: as long as i have a unique name that can be found
[2014-07-30 18:43:28 -0400] holoway: miah: I super want us to get some of the swashbuckling back that lets us experiment without fear
[2014-07-30 18:43:31 -0400] imeyer: which really is no different than doing like imeyer_haproxy or whatever in a gem format
[2014-07-30 18:43:46 -0400] lamont_oc: problem is that if you fork the apt recipe and call it miah_apt, then you need to fix all the upstream dependencies of every cookbook that does dependency
[2014-07-30 18:43:48 -0400] jtimberman: chef_gem "imeyer_haproxy"
[2014-07-30 18:43:49 -0400] lamont_oc: grrr
[2014-07-30 18:43:58 -0400] miah: lamont_oc: yup
[2014-07-30 18:44:03 -0400] lamont_oc: depdency or include_recipe
[2014-07-30 18:44:06 -0400] imeyer: well then fix the import system
[2014-07-30 18:44:16 -0400] imeyer: so that you can say import miah_awesome as awesome
[2014-07-30 18:44:31 -0400] miah: ^^
[2014-07-30 18:44:31 -0400] lamont_oc: meh, typing broke, more coffee
[2014-07-30 18:44:47 -0400] imeyer: chef_gem "imeyer_haproxy" do
[2014-07-30 18:44:52 -0400] holoway: imeyer: that was the tl;dr on where the namespace convo landed in the first IRC meetings aftermath
[2014-07-30 18:45:02 -0400] imeyer:   :namespace "haproxy"
[2014-07-30 18:45:03 -0400] imeyer: end
[2014-07-30 18:45:19 -0400] imeyer: awesome :D
[2014-07-30 18:45:27 -0400] miah: :replaces
[2014-07-30 18:45:30 -0400] miah: :obsoletes
[2014-07-30 18:45:31 -0400] holoway: imeyer: whether it's a gem or not is irrelevant
[2014-07-30 18:45:32 -0400] miah: etc etc
[2014-07-30 18:45:38 -0400] imeyer: holoway: of course
[2014-07-30 18:45:42 -0400] miah: holoway: not true
[2014-07-30 18:45:51 -0400] miah: because metadata 'suggests' 'obsoletes' etc is all useless
[2014-07-30 18:45:58 -0400] holoway: miah: let me change me phrase - it's orthogonal
[2014-07-30 18:46:05 -0400] holoway: miah: we could fix that
[2014-07-30 18:46:06 -0400] miah: so i'd rather use rubygems resolver =)
[2014-07-30 18:46:12 -0400] miah: you could yes
[2014-07-30 18:46:20 -0400] holoway: whether we should is a different conversation
[2014-07-30 18:46:25 -0400] miah: i think those issues have existed for ~4 years?
[2014-07-30 18:46:28 -0400] holoway: see also +100 on experiments
[2014-07-30 18:46:28 -0400] miah: =)
[2014-07-30 18:46:49 -0400] holoway: miah: they've never been hot enough that anyone actually takes up arms to defeat the enemy
[2014-07-30 18:46:55 -0400] holoway: for two reasons
[2014-07-30 18:47:06 -0400] holoway: 1) they want to be blessed that the work would be accepted as the de-facto way forward
[2014-07-30 18:47:10 -0400] holoway: 2) they want somone else to do it :)
[2014-07-30 18:47:20 -0400] miah: yup
[2014-07-30 18:47:32 -0400] holoway: my argument is we need to drop 1 as a requirement like a hot rock
[2014-07-30 18:47:43 -0400] holoway: so we can stop being theoretical and get back to whether the code feels fucking sweet or not
[2014-07-30 18:47:48 -0400] miah: +1
[2014-07-30 18:47:51 -0400] imeyer: yes
[2014-07-30 18:48:03 -0400] imeyer: let's bring it back to 2009 when shit was cool
[2014-07-30 18:48:06 -0400] holoway: that workflow RFC doesn't have berkshelf or the policyfile in it
[2014-07-30 18:48:14 -0400] holoway: one because berks is a lightning rod
[2014-07-30 18:48:21 -0400] miah: i basically feel like 'wrappers' and 'berkshelf way' have been a distraction, and really the wrong way forward
[2014-07-30 18:48:24 -0400] holoway: and two because I want kallistec to kick out the jams
[2014-07-30 18:48:40 -0400] miah: so adopting them as any kind of 'ya lets do that for now' is just.. accepting the shit reality.
[2014-07-30 18:48:44 -0400] holoway: and not be burdended by solving the near term issues on getting the right policyfile stuff
[2014-07-30 18:48:55 -0400] kallistec: Personally, I'm totally all about killing off the useless metadata, but that's orthogonal to rubygems vs. other solver. At the end of the day you have a graph of artifacts with versions and dependency contraints and you solve it with an algorithm
[2014-07-30 18:48:57 -0400] holoway: miah: I think I agree
[2014-07-30 18:49:08 -0400] holoway: (that they are wrong and a distraction)
[2014-07-30 18:49:37 -0400] miah: it really has to be caveated that 'this is _not_ the right way. this is wrong for; reasons'
[2014-07-30 18:49:41 -0400] holoway: I care about the experience of a bunch of folks who aren't where you are, and so I'm going to help fix that, and also make more room for you to crush the things that could be made better
[2014-07-30 18:49:50 -0400] miah: ya
[2014-07-30 18:49:57 -0400] kallistec: IMO, at least most of the berkshelf way is trying to build the right thing on the wrong foundation
[2014-07-30 18:49:58 -0400] holoway: and hopefully provide a way for those folks to come along
[2014-07-30 18:50:10 -0400] miah: kallistec: ya i'd agree with that
[2014-07-30 18:50:26 -0400] holoway: this is the less clear part of that RFC proposal - if I can get people typing the same things, I can swap out waht those things do
[2014-07-30 18:50:40 -0400] kallistec: so most of the policyfile stuff is about fixing the foundation (or at least a part of it)
[2014-07-30 18:50:41 -0400] holoway: (focus on the use cases, not the implementation)
[2014-07-30 18:50:56 -0400] holoway: ie: you can build the gem system and we can try it
[2014-07-30 18:51:01 -0400] holoway: instead of talk about it :)
[2014-07-30 18:51:32 -0400] miah: i have worked with so many people who have struggled with chef because of the confusion; re; berkshelf way; wrappers; htf does the compile process work
[2014-07-30 18:52:01 -0400] miah: but when i talk to them about ruby
[2014-07-30 18:52:04 -0400] miah: as if it were ruby
[2014-07-30 18:52:08 -0400] miah: it all makes sense
[2014-07-30 18:52:20 -0400] miah: and the blank glaze they once had turns to a bright sparkle
[2014-07-30 18:52:21 -0400] imeyer: wasn't that one of the main seeling points of chef?
[2014-07-30 18:52:28 -0400] imeyer: chef == ruby
[2014-07-30 18:52:30 -0400] imeyer: chef dsl == ruby
[2014-07-30 18:52:37 -0400] holoway: well, the chef dsl is a deep dsl
[2014-07-30 18:52:39 -0400] imeyer: ruby == happy (ish)
[2014-07-30 18:52:53 -0400] imeyer: a deep dsl? the fuck is that
[2014-07-30 18:53:08 -0400] miah: the whole cookbook development model is.. confusion. compared to 'write a ruby app' or 'write a ruby library'
[2014-07-30 18:53:13 -0400] imeyer: makes me wanna listen to deep house though
[2014-07-30 18:53:18 -0400] miah: but i can point people towards books on writing a ruby library
[2014-07-30 18:53:29 -0400] miah: and that knowledge is directly applicable to writing a library for use with chef
[2014-07-30 18:53:47 -0400] miah: something.. im not sure what
[2014-07-30 18:53:54 -0400] imeyer: not trying to distract anything here but why do i just never see this "confusion" with the cookbook development model
[2014-07-30 18:54:12 -0400] miah: needs to happen to make that way more visible for people who can write code
[2014-07-30 18:54:20 -0400] imeyer: i have never once been confused about how to make/"test"/deploy cookbooks
[2014-07-30 18:54:27 -0400] imeyer: are we talking community here?
[2014-07-30 18:54:31 -0400] holoway: imeyer: a deep dsl means that it not only extends the host language, but actually provides its own mini-language (parser/lexer, execution flow, etc.)
[2014-07-30 18:55:03 -0400] holoway: miah: I think we agree. We would probably even come to a conclusion on a way forward with our voices and enough time
[2014-07-30 18:55:05 -0400] kallistec: imeyer: probably people having different backgrounds. If you come from a dev background, chef is really weird
[2014-07-30 18:55:17 -0400] miah: =)
[2014-07-30 18:55:25 -0400] miah: kallistec: yup
[2014-07-30 18:55:31 -0400] imeyer: holoway: okay so when did that happen because i was always under the impression (from almost everyone here) that the dsl was really just ruby
[2014-07-30 18:55:38 -0400] holoway: imeyer: it is just ruby
[2014-07-30 18:55:43 -0400] kallistec: like, why not do `class BuildMeAnNginxServer < OtherThing; #code; end`
[2014-07-30 18:55:48 -0400] holoway: imeyer: it's a subtlety in what it means to inherit the host language
[2014-07-30 18:55:53 -0400] holoway: imeyer: that is probably without distinction
[2014-07-30 18:55:58 -0400] miah: kallistec: right, and there is no reason you can't
[2014-07-30 18:56:03 -0400] miah: there just aren't many examples
[2014-07-30 18:56:04 -0400] lamont_oc: re: htf does the compile process work  id love to kill compile/converge mode
[2014-07-30 18:56:12 -0400] holoway: lamont_oc: except when you need it
[2014-07-30 18:56:18 -0400] miah: (apart from a few community cookbooks, and chef resource providers internals)
[2014-07-30 18:56:24 -0400] imeyer: when do you need it?
[2014-07-30 18:56:28 -0400] imeyer: did we need it in 0.8 ?
[2014-07-30 18:56:32 -0400] imeyer: 0.9 ?
[2014-07-30 18:56:40 -0400] holoway: imeyer: it's always been there
[2014-07-30 18:56:48 -0400] lamont_oc: yep, its just not that easy, wed need a way to dep inject stuff and replace all the ways people open up the resource collection and hack it
[2014-07-30 18:56:55 -0400] imeyer: holoway: yeah i know
[2014-07-30 18:57:04 -0400] imeyer: but something shifted at some point (11?)
[2014-07-30 18:57:06 -0400] holoway: imeyer: when you want to manipulate order, or mutate the contents
[2014-07-30 18:57:08 -0400] holoway: imeyer: nope
[2014-07-30 18:57:21 -0400] imeyer: define manipulate order?
[2014-07-30 18:57:29 -0400] miah: notifies ; subscribes
[2014-07-30 18:57:30 -0400] kallistec: miah imeyer OTOH, if you're used to configuring boxes with (mostly) non-turing complete config languages, development is weird and/or percieved to be hard
[2014-07-30 18:57:42 -0400] holoway: imeyer: you want to be able to make a choice about what resources are in the collection
[2014-07-30 18:57:56 -0400] miah: those both work by inserting things in the resource collection; either immediately next; or append to the end
[2014-07-30 18:57:58 -0400] holoway: imeyer: and if you remove the compile stage, you never have the intermediate representation
[2014-07-30 18:58:16 -0400] miah: im not sure how subscribes works actually, probably similarly i just havent read the code recently
[2014-07-30 18:58:27 -0400] imeyer: suddenly i feel like the chef i've been using for however long is not the chef i thought
[2014-07-30 18:58:31 -0400] holoway: imeyer: which means you can never "see" whats in front of you
[2014-07-30 18:58:37 -0400] miah: imeyer: =)
[2014-07-30 18:58:44 -0400] holoway: imeyer: you can see whats behind you, but not whats coming
[2014-07-30 18:58:55 -0400] lamont_oc: the problem is having one recipe being able to declare a resource and a surrounding wrapper being able to open up the resource collection in compile mode and hack the resource to point it at another template or somehing  the chef-rewind pattern.
[2014-07-30 18:59:09 -0400] holoway: that's one use case
[2014-07-30 18:59:12 -0400] imeyer: i am pretty sure my medication was not swapped with LSD today but let me ask this anyway
[2014-07-30 18:59:18 -0400] holoway: ok, I gotta go to a meeting
[2014-07-30 18:59:24 -0400] lamont_oc: if you eliminate compile/converge then the resource you want to hack has already done its work by the time you want to hack it
[2014-07-30 18:59:40 -0400] holoway: miah: if you make things awesome, my commitment is that we'll try 'em and take the best of it
[2014-07-30 18:59:47 -0400] miah: <3
[2014-07-30 18:59:48 -0400] miah: i always try
[2014-07-30 18:59:56 -0400] holoway: miah: and in return, you can let those who need to worry about the folks who arne't there worry about it
[2014-07-30 18:59:58 -0400] miah: i am sorry if i am somtimes angry while i do it
[2014-07-30 19:00:01 -0400] holoway: miah: I can take care of the others
[2014-07-30 19:00:04 -0400] kallistec: lamont_oc: yeah, you could move the filter/modify around though
[2014-07-30 19:00:05 -0400] holoway: miah: you never seem angry
[2014-07-30 19:00:12 -0400] holoway: miah: blunt, but not angry
[2014-07-30 19:00:13 -0400] miah: i get care mad
[2014-07-30 19:00:16 -0400] miah: ok
[2014-07-30 19:00:20 -0400] miah: blunt, i can deal
[2014-07-30 19:00:29 -0400] lamont_oc: you could invert the order though and pop something onto a stack somewhere that says when you see the template[/tmp/foo] resource pop up, please point the cookbook at me
[2014-07-30 19:00:31 -0400] jtimberman: but you care
[2014-07-30 19:00:34 -0400] jtimberman: and that's awesome :)
[2014-07-30 19:00:37 -0400] miah: ya
[2014-07-30 19:00:38 -0400] holoway: miah: I won't ask you to be beholden to the folks who aren't there, and I'll make it my job to work it out
[2014-07-30 19:00:41 -0400] jtimberman: everyone gets mad and thats cool
[2014-07-30 19:00:44 -0400] jtimberman: <3
[2014-07-30 19:00:50 -0400] imeyer: shut up timberlake
[2014-07-30 19:01:00 -0400] jtimberman: imeyer: why you gotta hate, towel?
[2014-07-30 19:01:01 -0400] miah: i dont feel beholden to those folks
[2014-07-30 19:01:03 -0400] jtimberman: :D
[2014-07-30 19:01:13 -0400] miah: but i do feel like, we need to make things much better for them
[2014-07-30 19:01:19 -0400] imeyer: BECAUSE IM DRY AND I NEED TO ABSORB MOISTURE
[2014-07-30 19:01:22 -0400] miah: because i'd rather see them learning the beauty of programming
[2014-07-30 19:01:38 -0400] miah: than getting lost in confusion over really weird patterns =)
[2014-07-30 19:02:27 -0400] imeyer: i dunno i just use chef to build infrastructure, i don't see it as programming
[2014-07-30 19:02:38 -0400] imeyer: i'm also a horrible programmer so whatever
[2014-07-30 19:02:54 -0400] miah: https://www.simple.com/engineering/infrastructure-as-code
[2014-07-30 19:03:08 -0400] miah: our infrastructure is weird; but its totally programming
[2014-07-30 19:03:39 -0400] lamont_oc: id like to fire every single system admin i used to work with who told me that perl was ugly and one day theyd learn python and then went back to writing endless little 20-line bash scripts because they werent a programmer  i dont know how they get away with pulling down high salaries while whining that programming is too hard
[2014-07-30 19:03:41 -0400] fujin: oh hello hackers
[2014-07-30 19:03:59 -0400] lamont_oc: but id be an asshole to really do that
[2014-07-30 19:04:10 -0400] miah: lamont_oc: i worked with many of those types in the 'enterprise' world
[2014-07-30 19:04:18 -0400] imeyer: perl is fucking ugly are you kidding me
[2014-07-30 19:04:27 -0400] miah: but perl is the same thing as 'line noise'
[2014-07-30 19:04:27 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: hail!
[2014-07-30 19:04:32 -0400] lamont_oc: lol
[2014-07-30 19:04:56 -0400] miah: i am certain perl _can_ be written in a way that is legible
[2014-07-30 19:05:05 -0400] miah: but i feel it _rarely_ if _ever_ is
[2014-07-30 19:05:12 -0400] imeyer: miah: i read that article and cried a bit
[2014-07-30 19:05:14 -0400] lamont_oc: yeah, so i would have picked ruby but after amazons internal rails disaster of 2003 i still didnt trust it
[2014-07-30 19:05:35 -0400] imeyer: miah: it can be, but it almost never is because it's perceived as the "oh shit i need to get this done fast" which perl totally lets you do like an asshole
[2014-07-30 19:05:40 -0400] lamont_oc: feedback i generally got was that my perl was readable, largely because i was more verbose and avoided tricks and line noise
[2014-07-30 19:05:52 -0400] imeyer: my perl was only readable because of K&R
[2014-07-30 19:05:53 -0400] jtimberman: miah: I've seen some very readable perl code from holoway :)
[2014-07-30 19:05:55 -0400] miah: i only learned ruby like maybe starting 5 years ago
[2014-07-30 19:06:08 -0400] miah: jtimberman: ya, i am certain it can be done
[2014-07-30 19:06:15 -0400] lamont_oc: but anyway, i see our industry evolving in the direction of infrastructure-as-code   we just cant go around firing everyone who isnt on board...
[2014-07-30 19:06:18 -0400] lamont_oc: yet
[2014-07-30 19:06:19 -0400] miah: spotting it in the wild though..
[2014-07-30 19:06:22 -0400] lamont_oc: =)
[2014-07-30 19:06:26 -0400] miah: its like snipe hunting
[2014-07-30 19:06:28 -0400] imeyer: HTML::Mason
[2014-07-30 19:06:30 -0400] imeyer: that's all i have to say
[2014-07-30 19:06:50 -0400] miah: lamont_oc: right. but we can educate them.
[2014-07-30 19:07:07 -0400] imeyer: i don't believe that necessarily
[2014-07-30 19:07:21 -0400] miah: well, true. you wouldnt want to know what i really think about humanity =)
[2014-07-30 19:07:29 -0400] imeyer: i kind of already have an idea
[2014-07-30 19:07:42 -0400] miah: but; i think that you can point people in the right direction
[2014-07-30 19:07:49 -0400] imeyer: and i think we're quite similar in that regard
[2014-07-30 19:07:52 -0400] miah: its ultimately up to them if they will listen
[2014-07-30 19:07:58 -0400] imeyer: right, that's the catch
[2014-07-30 19:08:02 -0400] miah: .. you can lead a horse to water.
[2014-07-30 19:08:03 -0400] imeyer: they have to be open
[2014-07-30 19:08:34 -0400] fujin: we are all the horses at the water
[2014-07-30 19:08:37 -0400] imeyer: well that's also dependent on *my* ability to lead the horse to water
[2014-07-30 19:08:40 -0400] fujin: neiggghhhh
[2014-07-30 19:08:45 -0400] miah: imeyer: yup
[2014-07-30 19:08:51 -0400] fujin: be the horse at the water
[2014-07-30 19:08:57 -0400] miah: i am the horse
[2014-07-30 19:09:04 -0400] miah: i have the stinkiest road apples
[2014-07-30 19:09:11 -0400] miah: and the flies love me
[2014-07-30 19:09:15 -0400] fujin: :-D
[2014-07-30 19:09:23 -0400] jtimberman: be a horse ON the water!
[2014-07-30 19:09:32 -0400] imeyer: horse jesus
[2014-07-30 19:09:35 -0400] fujin: do u guys know what is fun? doing devops at 6am
[2014-07-30 19:09:36 -0400] miah: seriously, growing up in michigan. i used to be chased by horse flies while riding my bicycle
[2014-07-30 19:09:39 -0400] fujin: DEVOPS!!
[2014-07-30 19:09:43 -0400] miah: those things bite hard..
[2014-07-30 19:09:51 -0400] imeyer: i fucking hate horse flies
[2014-07-30 19:09:51 -0400] fujin: somebody plz do the needful
[2014-07-30 19:10:12 -0400] imeyer: i also hate bumblebees
[2014-07-30 19:11:08 -0400] imeyer: they used to hang out on the fairway of the golf course next to my house and when i'd go to my great grandfathers pool to swim i'd inevitably step on one or two
[2014-07-30 19:11:15 -0400] imeyer: cause who the fuck wears shoes on grass
[2014-07-30 19:12:33 -0400] miah: ya. my grandparents pond; every summer; meat tenderizer
[2014-07-30 19:13:00 -0400] imeyer: i would love the midwest so much if all the people just disappeared
[2014-07-30 19:13:08 -0400] miah: seriously. i would move back.
