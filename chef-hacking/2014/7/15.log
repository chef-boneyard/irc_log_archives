[2014-07-15 03:55:02 -0400] github-bawt: [chef-rfc] fujin opened pull request #18: Propose Arbitrary Meeting Time (master...time-zone-proposal) http://git.io/pDo3nw
[2014-07-15 03:56:56 -0400] fujin: ohai github-bawt
[2014-07-15 03:57:00 -0400] fujin: yeah, was just going to post that here
[2014-07-15 03:57:02 -0400] fujin: https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/pull/18
[2014-07-15 03:57:05 -0400] fujin: if anyone is interested
[2014-07-15 03:57:37 -0400] fujin: would like to propose moving the dev meeting to a little later in the day, tryign to solicit some feedback on what times would be ideal for varying tzs
[2014-07-15 04:13:30 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: Hail friend. I like the proposal. Time zones are definitely difficult. There's not an obligation for CHEF employees to attend, but at least two, holoway or nathenharvey will be present at an arbitrary week. They're Pacific and Eastern US times respectively. :/
[2014-07-15 04:13:51 -0400] jtimberman: I don't know how many people we had that were participating last Friday that are e.g. Europe-based.
[2014-07-15 04:17:46 -0400] jtimberman: the proposed time would be 3pm eastern, 7pm UTC. That seems fairly reasonable for what is probably the broadest time zones for people who are active in the community development. (not to exclude those in the middle east or asia, i'm just ignorant of who it might affect)
[2014-07-15 04:30:50 -0400] c_t: it's a little less brutal for NZ it seems
[2014-07-15 05:44:46 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: kind of excludes Australia at that stage
[2014-07-15 05:44:52 -0400] fujin: they are on the downswing of the 24 cycle
[2014-07-15 05:44:58 -0400] fujin: 1200 pacific is 0500 +10
[2014-07-15 05:45:32 -0400] fujin: the Americans have the most to sacrifice in terms of window availability
[2014-07-15 05:45:36 -0400] fujin: We'll see how the comments pan out

[2014-07-15 22:03:07 -0400] jalberts: anyone know how I can have an omnibus project default to installing to the user's home directory?  I tried using "#{ENV['home']}/mypackage", but it builds a package that defaults to be installed in a directory with my home directory path in the name instead of the current user. :)
[2014-07-15 22:03:54 -0400] jalberts: i'm going to try just using ~, but I thought I'd ask here in case someone knew for sure.
[2014-07-15 22:04:09 -0400] jalberts: since it takes like 30 minutes each time I try to build a package.
[2014-07-15 22:08:01 -0400] fujin: should be leveraging build caching
[2014-07-15 22:08:08 -0400] fujin: jalberts: the new generated omnibus.rb has an example for building in the ~/
[2014-07-15 22:08:18 -0400] fujin: you need to update the install_dir in the project to point at the same path in the omnibus cfg
[2014-07-15 22:08:52 -0400] fujin: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-ruby/blob/master/lib/omnibus/generator_files/omnibus.rb.erb#L9-L27
[2014-07-15 22:09:55 -0400] jalberts: fujin: understood.  I intentionally clear the cache before building because my project deps are rapidly changing right now and I want to make sure I'm not using an older cached version of something
[2014-07-15 22:10:40 -0400] jalberts: i don't see an example of building in ~/.  Just in the relative path of ./local
[2014-07-15 22:11:36 -0400] jalberts: i'm building again now.  I'll see if using install_dir "~/mypackage" does the right thing when building a dmg.
[2014-07-15 22:11:47 -0400] lamont_oc: jalberts: im not sure i know of an example of an rpm or deb installing to a users home directory
[2014-07-15 22:12:31 -0400] jalberts: lamont_oc: very true.  I hadn't thought about rpm or deb yet.  just thinking about my app installing on osx right now.
[2014-07-15 22:13:09 -0400] lamont_oc: we definitely werent thining about home dir installs when developing the dmg code, i dont know if dmgs support that either...
[2014-07-15 22:13:18 -0400] jalberts: i was hoping to have it install to a user's home dir. since my app doesn't require root permission, I thought requiring admin rights to install to /opt/mypackage seemed silly.
[2014-07-15 22:13:33 -0400] jalberts: ok.  sure.  that makes sense.
[2014-07-15 22:13:37 -0400] jalberts: not a huge deal
[2014-07-15 22:14:18 -0400] jalberts: just thought it would be nice if I could make it do a user install by default for dmg.   not a biggie.  thanks fujin and lamont_oc for the help.
[2014-07-15 22:14:19 -0400] lamont_oc: yeah, if you can figure out if thats even possible, you could submit a patch for it
[2014-07-15 22:14:29 -0400] jalberts: lamont_oc: will do.
[2014-07-15 22:18:24 -0400] fujin: jalberts: ./local is going to be based on CWD when you run it, so in my testing that has been like, /home/omnibus/local or /home/vagrant/local, unless you're building as root
[2014-07-15 22:18:42 -0400] fujin: (i have a docker build container w/ omnibus inside of it w/ 'omnibus' user)
[2014-07-15 22:20:27 -0400] jalberts: fujin: ah.  excellent.  that might do what i want for dmg then.  i'll give that a try.
[2014-07-15 22:23:09 -0400] fujin: word
