[2014-07-21 17:23:54 -0400] c_t: kallistec: dunno if it's specific to me, but I did notice while uploading the supermarket cookbooks that not all of them actually pass all the validations according to chef-pedant
[2014-07-21 17:24:05 -0400] c_t: not sure if that's old or new behavior
[2014-07-21 17:24:49 -0400] c_t: (meaning if they're really old 0.9 etc. coookbooks or erchef changed platform and dependency validations)
[2014-07-21 17:25:38 -0400] kallistec: c_t: what chef-pedant? the chef-pedant I know is a integration test suite for chef-server
[2014-07-21 17:26:45 -0400] c_t: kallistec: I mean that the validations that chef-pedant said a chef server needed to do
[2014-07-21 17:27:04 -0400] c_t: it gets unhappy with platform versions like "12.04"
[2014-07-21 17:28:07 -0400] c_t: I looked at chef-pedant though and I'm pretty sure that chef-pedant expect those to fail
[2014-07-21 17:29:02 -0400] c_t: also dependencies only having a nil array seems to be an occasional problem
[2014-07-21 17:29:30 -0400] c_t: "yum": "< 3" comes up a lot too, instead of "< 3.0"
[2014-07-21 17:38:47 -0400] kallistec: c_t: where do you see that in master? I think at one point we attempted to validate those things but since they aren't actually functional anywhere, we relaxed all those validations
[2014-07-21 17:39:34 -0400] c_t: huh, ok
[2014-07-21 17:39:44 -0400] c_t: maybe I'm just being too picky

[2014-07-21 23:03:28 -0400] claire__: Can anyone help with kitchen + ec2? Been trying for too long with no luck. I run kitchen create default-ubuntu-1204 and it seems to hang somewhere (my guess is ssh?). Ive verified that the box does get created and I can ssh into it directly.
[2014-07-21 23:09:24 -0400] juliancdunn: claire__: someara has lots of experience fighting with kitchen+ec2
[2014-07-21 23:09:45 -0400] someara: DEFEAT ALL DRAGONS
[2014-07-21 23:09:53 -0400] juliancdunn: BURNINATE ALL CLOUDS
[2014-07-21 23:10:37 -0400] someara: chaire__ use this as an example for layout: https://github.com/someara/httpd
[2014-07-21 23:10:42 -0400] someara: or https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql
[2014-07-21 23:10:50 -0400] claire__: @juliancdunn @someara I just re-read the env var settings slowly this time and realized theres a big difference between AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
[2014-07-21 23:10:55 -0400] claire__: DUMB
[2014-07-21 23:11:01 -0400] someara: usually hangs are ssh keys and/or firewall rules in the security grou
[2014-07-21 23:11:03 -0400] someara: p
[2014-07-21 23:11:16 -0400] juliancdunn: claire__: lol. there's your trouble
[2014-07-21 23:11:23 -0400] someara: also be advised that the minimum billing resolution on ec2 is an hour
[2014-07-21 23:11:27 -0400] claire__: so frikkin stupid
[2014-07-21 23:11:39 -0400] someara: so if you run 100 10 second long tests... that's 100 hours billed
[2014-07-21 23:11:51 -0400] someara: digital ocean is more friendly about that
[2014-07-21 23:12:07 -0400] claire__: oh. shit. well. oops.
[2014-07-21 23:12:10 -0400] someara: =)
[2014-07-21 23:12:26 -0400] someara: afk for the day later!
