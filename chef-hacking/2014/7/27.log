[2014-07-27 00:47:18 -0400] z: Seeing some weirdness between chef-zero invoked with a single cookbook_path entry, versus an array of entries

[2014-07-27 00:48:19 -0400] z: Any inkling as to why "WARN: Child with name 'XYZ.json' found in multiple directories" is spit out for the second (and every subsequent) element when you pass an array into cookbook_path?
[2014-07-27 01:28:48 -0400] z: It looks like its something to do with MultiplexedDir and potentially a jkeiser question. Heh.
[2014-07-27 01:42:20 -0400] z: Pretty sure I know what's happening now, but hell if I can find the actual code involved and thereby solve it
[2014-07-27 01:43:46 -0400] z: I think when you pass an Array into cookbook_path, something to do with Local Mode (likely in or around MultiplexedDir) is not just diving into each of the cookbook directories (as expected) in order to merge for ChefFS, but is also going into nodes (and potentially other things) the same # of times as there are entries in the cookbook_path array
[2014-07-27 01:44:13 -0400] z: Thereby causing it to see the node.json several times, even though, in reality on disk it only exists onces
