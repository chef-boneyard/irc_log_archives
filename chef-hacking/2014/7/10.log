[2014-07-10 17:13:38 -0400] jalberts: so, just to follow up with my omnibus bzip2 build problem from yesterday.  I initially thought the build problem was due to the change to using install_path.  It's not. It was using -soname in the makefile on mavericks. Submitting a PR with a fix in a few.
[2014-07-10 17:14:56 -0400] jalberts: in my short but recent experience. mavericks changing from standard gcc to clang sucks... just sayin. ;)
[2014-07-10 17:15:26 -0400] c_t: that's been building for a while now
[2014-07-10 17:48:10 -0400] lamont_oc: jalberts: the bzip2 software definition pretty clearly only supports linux right now, i think its only used as a dep for the server, which only runs on linux
[2014-07-10 17:49:05 -0400] kallistec: hrm, that's kind of an edge case in our new "we don't support everything in omnibus-software" policy :\
[2014-07-10 17:50:42 -0400] lamont_oc: yeah, im okay with fixing the existing things we have to compile on other OSen, particularly since Im writing helper functions to make that easier by default
[2014-07-10 17:51:03 -0400] lamont_oc: but, just looked at the patch...
[2014-07-10 17:51:24 -0400] lamont_oc: and holy shit, wtf bzip, y u no configure script?
[2014-07-10 17:54:14 -0400] lamont_oc: yeah thats awesome  hardcodes gcc and assumes gnu tools, because linux is the only operating system and gcc is the only compiler in the known universe
[2014-07-10 18:04:14 -0400] jalberts: lamont_oc: sry, haven't setup my weechat notifications yet. just noticed your message
[2014-07-10 18:04:35 -0400] jalberts: lamont_oc: I needed that to get python to build on osx
[2014-07-10 18:04:48 -0400] jalberts: fixing a python configure problem on mavericks now too
[2014-07-10 18:05:04 -0400] lamont_oc: yeah it looks fine to me
[2014-07-10 18:05:15 -0400] lamont_oc: can you make curry bot happy about your CLA status for me?
[2014-07-10 18:05:39 -0400] jalberts: kallistec: should I not be using the omnibus-software repo for as a base for my omnibus projects?
[2014-07-10 18:05:54 -0400] jalberts: "for as" = as :)
[2014-07-10 18:06:15 -0400] jalberts: lamont_oc: i took care of it immediately... at least i thought
[2014-07-10 18:06:29 -0400] jalberts: i linked my gihub account and signed the icla
[2014-07-10 18:06:47 -0400] lamont_oc: hmmm, yeah, so we need some way so that curry bot lets us know you did that...
[2014-07-10 18:07:02 -0400] lamont_oc: so you should be aware of this: http://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/06/30/omnibus-a-look-forward/
[2014-07-10 18:07:04 -0400] jalberts: i was wondering how you'd know. i was going to leave a comment
[2014-07-10 18:07:08 -0400] kallistec: jalberts: http://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/06/30/omnibus-a-look-forward/
[2014-07-10 18:07:28 -0400] jalberts: hadn't noticed that.  reading now
[2014-07-10 18:07:51 -0400] kallistec: but I think a patch for a thing we do use to work in a way we don't use it is probably okay
[2014-07-10 18:08:23 -0400] lamont_oc: well porting to other O/Sen is okay by me
[2014-07-10 18:09:27 -0400] jalberts: thx for pointing out that blog post. didn't notice it for some reason
[2014-07-10 18:10:00 -0400] lamont_oc: the problem comes when someone wants to build and link mongodb to python so we wind up shipping mongo in chef server builds  even though we dont use or test it  and then eventually it winds up as a client dep somehow and we wind up needing to compile it on AIX
[2014-07-10 18:12:34 -0400] lamont_oc: and the Signed CLA tag got applied to the PR by curry bot (im still learning how to use this stuff, too)
[2014-07-10 18:13:10 -0400] jalberts: lamont_oc: yeah, i noticed that.  Needs a 'verified cla' tag though, right?
[2014-07-10 18:13:56 -0400] lamont_oc: oh huh
[2014-07-10 18:15:21 -0400] jalberts: kallistec: and lamont_oc: I'll have a patch that fixes the configure step for python on mavericks shortly.  should I bother to submit a PR for it?
[2014-07-10 18:16:05 -0400] jalberts: I'm not sure what is going to be pulled out of the repo that's unused by Chefco
[2014-07-10 18:16:12 -0400] lamont_oc: yeah, go ahead
[2014-07-10 18:16:24 -0400] jalberts: k
[2014-07-10 18:16:55 -0400] kallistec: yeah, submit the PR. if nothing else it'll force us to clarify where the edges of what we support in omnibus-software are
[2014-07-10 18:16:57 -0400] lamont_oc: largely its me + sethv driving that policy
[2014-07-10 18:17:01 -0400] lamont_oc: right
[2014-07-10 18:17:12 -0400] kallistec: but it seems like a reasonable patch
[2014-07-10 18:18:51 -0400] lamont_oc: its work that i can reasonably expect that wed need to do in the future, so would like to capture it, and doesnt cause the other issues that im more worried about (bloat)
