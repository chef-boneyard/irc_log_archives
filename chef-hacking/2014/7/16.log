[2014-07-16 02:13:17 -0400] fujin: yo holoway
[2014-07-16 02:13:21 -0400] fujin: what's the story gus
[2014-07-16 02:13:38 -0400] fujin: https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/489228576395239424
[2014-07-16 02:13:44 -0400] fujin: did I miss something? haha
[2014-07-16 02:13:54 -0400] holoway: With what? Progressive reveal?
[2014-07-16 02:14:37 -0400] holoway: Jamie asked about content for berks
[2014-07-16 02:14:45 -0400] fujin: ahhhhh
[2014-07-16 02:14:57 -0400] holoway: My answer was not until we get to a place where you would know why you care
[2014-07-16 02:15:01 -0400] fujin: "it first shows up when you want to test in isolation :)"
[2014-07-16 02:15:08 -0400] fujin: I didn't understand what you were talking about
[2014-07-16 02:15:26 -0400] fujin: I think I understand now
[2014-07-16 02:15:28 -0400] fujin: Thanks!
[2014-07-16 02:17:05 -0400] holoway: We need to shift from berks trashing to solutions
[2014-07-16 02:17:12 -0400] holoway: Shits getting ridiculous
[2014-07-16 02:17:42 -0400] fujin: uhh
[2014-07-16 02:17:48 -0400] fujin: shit has been ridiculous for a long ass time
[2014-07-16 02:18:00 -0400] fujin: some of the most patient users are losing patience
[2014-07-16 02:18:11 -0400] fujin: but yeh, totally agree
[2014-07-16 02:18:17 -0400] fujin: oy holoway you seen omnifetch ?
[2014-07-16 02:18:22 -0400] fujin: who am I kidding, of course you have seen omnifetch
[2014-07-16 02:18:28 -0400] fujin: https://github.com/danielsdeleo/cookbook-omnifetch
[2014-07-16 02:19:59 -0400] fujin: we have been toying with the idea of a golang /universe depsolver as well, to prove out alternative implementations
[2014-07-16 02:20:14 -0400] fujin: focusing exclusively on depsolve, like omnifetch has
[2014-07-16 02:20:22 -0400] fujin: the best way -- is no way
[2014-07-16 02:20:45 -0400] c_t: what does /universe do, anyway?
[2014-07-16 02:20:47 -0400] fujin: I am afraid of adding another half-cooked fish to the pile
[2014-07-16 02:21:17 -0400] fujin: c_t: https://supermarket.getchef.com/universe
[2014-07-16 02:21:19 -0400] fujin: try to guess lol
[2014-07-16 02:21:38 -0400] holoway: So, we have three things that people have said that seem concretre
[2014-07-16 02:21:46 -0400] holoway: I would love to add more
[2014-07-16 02:21:50 -0400] holoway: The first is information shear
[2014-07-16 02:22:28 -0400] holoway: They feel like they are forced in to using, say, Chef DK, which causes fear about ruby versions, Berkshelf 3, and fear of/misunderstanding of the /universe endpoint in supermarket
[2014-07-16 02:23:21 -0400] holoway: The second is the need for a Berks-API server to serve assets from a chef server (which we should solve by just adding a /universe endpoint)
[2014-07-16 02:23:46 -0400] fujin: like the c.servers own little mini-universe-as-an-asset-server?
[2014-07-16 02:24:01 -0400] holoway: The third is people dislike the implementation choices the Berks team made inside - celluloid, Ridley, etc
[2014-07-16 02:24:07 -0400] holoway: fujin: exactly
[2014-07-16 02:24:26 -0400] holoway: Oh, lets call out a fourth problem
[2014-07-16 02:24:34 -0400] fujin: how do you make the Berks pipeline modular: the inputs to a depsolver, and the outputs
[2014-07-16 02:24:45 -0400] fujin: to allow the "way of nothingness"
[2014-07-16 02:24:50 -0400] holoway: People feel forced off of what they feel like is a workflow that worked for them
[2014-07-16 02:25:10 -0400] holoway: fujin: those words don't parse as having enough context to be understood by me in an airport :)
[2014-07-16 02:25:40 -0400] fujin: haha
[2014-07-16 02:25:51 -0400] holoway: I don't know what the "way of nothingness" is
[2014-07-16 02:25:58 -0400] holoway: :)
[2014-07-16 02:26:18 -0400] fujin: Not being forced into the way of berkshelf
[2014-07-16 02:26:24 -0400] fujin: What you just said
[2014-07-16 02:26:27 -0400] fujin: Except without backwards yoda talk
[2014-07-16 02:26:37 -0400] holoway: So, that's the part that actively frustrates me, personally
[2014-07-16 02:26:44 -0400] fujin: hm?
[2014-07-16 02:26:45 -0400] bawt: hm not found
[2014-07-16 02:26:48 -0400] fujin: :-()
[2014-07-16 02:26:52 -0400] fujin: quiet, bawt!
[2014-07-16 02:27:07 -0400] holoway: You have a group of people who have written a fuck ton of code to make doing test driven infrastructure work in their experience
[2014-07-16 02:27:17 -0400] holoway: A group of people who say they don't want it (which is just fine)
[2014-07-16 02:27:26 -0400] holoway: And then we wind up in the middle of a conversation about how someone is forced
[2014-07-16 02:27:33 -0400] holoway: I actually just purely don't Groh it
[2014-07-16 02:27:45 -0400] holoway: This spell check thing in irccloud is passing me off
[2014-07-16 02:27:50 -0400] holoway: PASSING? FUCK YOU
[2014-07-16 02:28:00 -0400] lamont_oc: Dave Grohl?
[2014-07-16 02:28:03 -0400] fujin: lol
[2014-07-16 02:28:13 -0400] holoway: So, making people not need it is easy
[2014-07-16 02:28:14 -0400] c_t: he'll ducking autocorrect
[2014-07-16 02:28:25 -0400] holoway: And we can make it first class to never use it
[2014-07-16 02:28:29 -0400] fujin: I don't think I don't want Berkshelf -- I use it exclusively (berkshelf2, even) to resolve [not very often] a deep set of dependencies
[2014-07-16 02:28:35 -0400] fujin: I know operators who literally have never used berkshelf
[2014-07-16 02:28:39 -0400] holoway: right
[2014-07-16 02:28:42 -0400] holoway: And that's no problem
[2014-07-16 02:28:51 -0400] holoway: So what's the forcing?
[2014-07-16 02:28:56 -0400] fujin: All of my colleagues do not touch it for fear of breaking it?
[2014-07-16 02:29:01 -0400] c_t: I've never used it (I just fight with dependencies by hand)
[2014-07-16 02:29:05 -0400] holoway: Beyond Jamie on stage talking about it? Or it getting included?
[2014-07-16 02:29:10 -0400] fujin: Some super mega-chef dude has to pony up and play the dependency game by hand, from time to time
[2014-07-16 02:29:28 -0400] fujin: holoway: it has become the default way to teach beginners
[2014-07-16 02:29:34 -0400] fujin: or so it seems?
[2014-07-16 02:29:35 -0400] holoway: So, I object to that
[2014-07-16 02:29:41 -0400] holoway: Have you looked at learnchef?
[2014-07-16 02:29:43 -0400] holoway: Not a whisper
[2014-07-16 02:29:50 -0400] holoway: Our training classes?
[2014-07-16 02:29:51 -0400] holoway: Not a peep
[2014-07-16 02:29:53 -0400] fujin: of course, I have, I haven't used it personally, but I've referred my students to it
[2014-07-16 02:30:06 -0400] holoway: We don't talk about it *at all*
[2014-07-16 02:30:10 -0400] fujin: so you immediately get throw into wanting to manage your chefrepo as  "software project"
[2014-07-16 02:30:13 -0400] holoway: Except for the folks who build it
[2014-07-16 02:30:13 -0400] fujin: needing 1,000 repositories
[2014-07-16 02:30:18 -0400] fujin: every cookbook is a repo
[2014-07-16 02:30:22 -0400] fujin: you have to buy into the whole dogma
[2014-07-16 02:30:27 -0400] fujin: as soon as youw ant to use a community c/b
[2014-07-16 02:30:36 -0400] fujin: which happens, because you aren't an expert to write a whole world yet
[2014-07-16 02:30:37 -0400] holoway: Ok, so now we have a new problem
[2014-07-16 02:30:57 -0400] fujin: i hope learnchef coverred git, cause you gonna need it
[2014-07-16 02:31:03 -0400] holoway: Of course we didn't cover git
[2014-07-16 02:31:04 -0400] lamont_oc: fujin: internally chefinc uses a one-big-chef-repo with a Berksfile that pulls in the community stuff
[2014-07-16 02:31:28 -0400] fujin: heh.
[2014-07-16 02:31:30 -0400] fujin: That's what I use too.
[2014-07-16 02:31:34 -0400] fujin: Berks2 though.
[2014-07-16 02:31:44 -0400] fujin: Because YAGNI berks3, IDGAF
[2014-07-16 02:31:52 -0400] holoway: fujin: as far as I can tell, the only people telling other people how to do their stuff isn't the berkshelf people
[2014-07-16 02:32:01 -0400] fujin: They are killing off chef herre anyway lol :-( so maybe the future will be different in $nextjob
[2014-07-16 02:32:03 -0400] lamont_oc: at home i use one-repo-per-cookbook, i actually think it is better and drank the kool-aid.
[2014-07-16 02:32:14 -0400] fujin: lamont_oc: spheromak says one-repo-per-cookbook is better as well
[2014-07-16 02:32:29 -0400] fujin: I have never spent enough time with it in a professional capacity to share the ideal
[2014-07-16 02:32:29 -0400] holoway: Berks 3 is better in a ton of ways
[2014-07-16 02:32:42 -0400] lamont_oc: right, but were not going to stop supporting either way
[2014-07-16 02:32:47 -0400] holoway: But the point is, the mere existence of another workflow has caused this kind of strange market hysteria
[2014-07-16 02:32:59 -0400] holoway: Where it's all cats and dogs and cancer and shit
[2014-07-16 02:33:06 -0400] holoway: And when you ask for actual evidence?
[2014-07-16 02:33:26 -0400] holoway: All we get is folks irritated about omnibus' build lab
[2014-07-16 02:33:30 -0400] holoway: Which I respect and all
[2014-07-16 02:33:33 -0400] fujin: dude,
[2014-07-16 02:33:35 -0400] fujin: that is me personally
[2014-07-16 02:33:42 -0400] holoway: (you aren't the only one)
[2014-07-16 02:33:43 -0400] holoway: :)
[2014-07-16 02:33:51 -0400] fujin: i mean, omnibus aint chef
[2014-07-16 02:33:53 -0400] holoway: My larger point is
[2014-07-16 02:33:57 -0400] fujin: that is a big ass fish for another day
[2014-07-16 02:34:01 -0400] holoway: For sure!
[2014-07-16 02:34:02 -0400] fujin: i get how you guys use berks there and everything
[2014-07-16 02:34:22 -0400] fujin: like I said I have the capabilities to rip berks out and use another container system to run Omnibus in
[2014-07-16 02:34:25 -0400] holoway: the existence of having Berks and test kitchen in the DK seems to have just caused this crazy thing
[2014-07-16 02:34:25 -0400] lamont_oc: actually like 8 months ago trying to use berks 2 was painful and the world changed every 2 weeks and it did kinda suck for a long time.
[2014-07-16 02:34:31 -0400] lamont_oc: but that was 8 months ago
[2014-07-16 02:34:44 -0400] holoway: And I keep saying "lets fix it"
[2014-07-16 02:34:53 -0400] holoway: And the only answer seems to be "can we get rid of it?"
[2014-07-16 02:34:54 -0400] fujin: I don't even use DK aye, I can't even comment, has this really happened more since the DK release?
[2014-07-16 02:35:03 -0400] holoway: he'll yes
[2014-07-16 02:35:07 -0400] holoway: MOTHERFUCKER
[2014-07-16 02:35:15 -0400] holoway: What is going on
[2014-07-16 02:35:19 -0400] holoway: This must end
[2014-07-16 02:35:21 -0400] holoway: One second
[2014-07-16 02:36:02 -0400] fujin: lamont_oc: I think that time period you are talking about may have burned a lot of folks precious time and it is super hard to get trust back once you have lost it.
[2014-07-16 02:36:14 -0400] fujin: lamont_oc: you only have to try to use berks3 on a platform where gecode spins dem fans (non-DK)
[2014-07-16 02:36:28 -0400] holoway: right
[2014-07-16 02:36:32 -0400] holoway: this is what I mean by shear
[2014-07-16 02:36:42 -0400] holoway: the root of this issue is Berkshelf got a ton of press
[2014-07-16 02:36:49 -0400] holoway: before it was actually a solved thing for regular humans
[2014-07-16 02:37:00 -0400] holoway: so we have all these people who have heard the dream
[2014-07-16 02:37:05 -0400] holoway: test driven infrastructure! woot!
[2014-07-16 02:37:14 -0400] fujin: oh wait. now I have to build CI? and there a no instructions for that?
[2014-07-16 02:37:15 -0400] holoway: and they go to get some of that
[2014-07-16 02:37:26 -0400] fujin: heh.. if you're lucky, or extrremely skilled, or hire a consult
[2014-07-16 02:37:32 -0400] holoway: and they get smacked in the jumblies with gecode compiles because they gem install berkshefl
[2014-07-16 02:37:46 -0400] fujin: they have been trained to gem install berkshelf or whatever, over time!
[2014-07-16 02:37:50 -0400] holoway: riught
[2014-07-16 02:37:52 -0400] fujin: gem install test-kitchen
[2014-07-16 02:37:54 -0400] holoway: right
[2014-07-16 02:37:57 -0400] fujin: kitchen init
[2014-07-16 02:38:00 -0400] fujin: etc
[2014-07-16 02:38:01 -0400] holoway: blam
[2014-07-16 02:38:12 -0400] holoway: the exact thing the DK is trying to solve for is that shear
[2014-07-16 02:38:22 -0400] holoway: ie: please to not be fucking everyone as they try and advance
[2014-07-16 02:38:37 -0400] holoway: (it was IE, btw, that was 'fixing' my spelling)
[2014-07-16 02:38:47 -0400] lamont_oc: lol redmond
[2014-07-16 02:39:04 -0400] holoway: fujin: I'm with you - we should probably cut a berks 4
[2014-07-16 02:39:10 -0400] holoway: that uses the berks 2 gem
[2014-07-16 02:39:18 -0400] fujin: 0_0
[2014-07-16 02:39:21 -0400] holoway: and start putting 3 excluisvely in the dk
[2014-07-16 02:39:29 -0400] holoway: (by I'm with you, the spinning thing sucks)
[2014-07-16 02:39:37 -0400] lamont_oc: theres probably ways to fix that
[2014-07-16 02:39:39 -0400] holoway: until its baked
[2014-07-16 02:39:46 -0400] holoway: in the DK
[2014-07-16 02:39:46 -0400] fujin: even on my fast rig it takes a few mins eh
[2014-07-16 02:40:05 -0400] holoway: right - it makes things literally 10x faster than berks 2
[2014-07-16 02:40:08 -0400] fujin: can you static link gecode into some apps
[2014-07-16 02:40:13 -0400] lamont_oc: julian mentioned he had some knowledge of how to make gecode compiles less stupidly long
[2014-07-16 02:40:19 -0400] holoway: no
[2014-07-16 02:40:23 -0400] fujin: hmm
[2014-07-16 02:40:29 -0400] holoway: (fucking go guys, all static link crazy)
[2014-07-16 02:40:43 -0400] fujin: lol
[2014-07-16 02:40:46 -0400] holoway: (says the man who brought you omnibus)
[2014-07-16 02:40:52 -0400] holoway: (also, static linking ain't easy)
[2014-07-16 02:40:54 -0400] fujin: static binary all day long
[2014-07-16 02:40:57 -0400] lamont_oc: we can probably look at using rake-compiler to package up pre-compiled libgecode on major platforms
[2014-07-16 02:40:58 -0400] c_t: go's great, man
[2014-07-16 02:41:06 -0400] fujin: lol
[2014-07-16 02:41:27 -0400] holoway: clearly this topic goes on the agenda for the next meeting
[2014-07-16 02:41:29 -0400] lamont_oc: nokogiri uses that to have its own omnibus-in-a-gem for windows so it doesnt have to fuck with different windows compiler environments
[2014-07-16 02:41:39 -0400] fujin: you can't even fuckinm gem in stall berkshelf presently'
[2014-07-16 02:41:46 -0400] fujin: FUCK
[2014-07-16 02:42:00 -0400] fujin: it's probably something in my env. disregard.
[2014-07-16 02:42:07 -0400] holoway: the point stands, though
[2014-07-16 02:42:17 -0400] holoway: a well integrated new world does not exist
[2014-07-16 02:42:28 -0400] holoway: the poorly integrated first passed of the new world no longer work well
[2014-07-16 02:42:43 -0400] holoway: and all it takes is one google and a youtube video to drink the koolaid
[2014-07-16 02:42:48 -0400] holoway: regardless of whether one likes the taste
[2014-07-16 02:42:51 -0400] holoway: :)
[2014-07-16 02:43:03 -0400] lamont_oc: actually i sorta think what weve got is pretty good right now and fairly remarkable
[2014-07-16 02:43:07 -0400] holoway: (which, for the record, I do, and I invented the one repo/vendor branch model)
[2014-07-16 02:43:19 -0400] holoway: lamont_oc: it totally is
[2014-07-16 02:43:24 -0400] holoway: lamont_oc: what it isn't is widely used yet
[2014-07-16 02:43:35 -0400] fujin: how many private cookbooks do you guys have in git
[2014-07-16 02:43:37 -0400] fujin: 1 cookbook per repo
[2014-07-16 02:43:44 -0400] holoway: a whole bunch
[2014-07-16 02:43:45 -0400] fujin: $$ unless you self host git
[2014-07-16 02:43:49 -0400] fujin: you do that?
[2014-07-16 02:44:05 -0400] holoway: also, one cookbook per repo isn't actually needed
[2014-07-16 02:44:07 -0400] holoway: for the test workflows
[2014-07-16 02:44:14 -0400] fujin: (it's one of those "now you have two problems")
[2014-07-16 02:44:20 -0400] lamont_oc: i self host git for my cookbooks
[2014-07-16 02:44:22 -0400] holoway: we can ship a trivial feature in berkshelf to auto-resolve to olocal
[2014-07-16 02:44:24 -0400] fujin: I am sure it isn't.
[2014-07-16 02:44:26 -0400] lamont_oc: do it over ssh
[2014-07-16 02:44:47 -0400] fujin: holoway: local what, megarepo cookbooks/ site-cookbooks/ dirs?
[2014-07-16 02:44:48 -0400] holoway: literally just have "../cookbooks" as a path for FS resolution
[2014-07-16 02:44:52 -0400] holoway: yes
[2014-07-16 02:44:59 -0400] lamont_oc: ssh into my git host and git init /git/cookbook_name.git --bare
[2014-07-16 02:45:00 -0400] holoway: would be an easy easy source
[2014-07-16 02:45:12 -0400] fujin: https://gist.github.com/073efbf81ef64b1de024
[2014-07-16 02:45:19 -0400] holoway: and the workflow would look the same (you specify the cookbooks in metadata, have a berksfile thats two lines long)
[2014-07-16 02:45:24 -0400] fujin: I have walked this road many times before
[2014-07-16 02:45:33 -0400] holoway: fujin: right - lets make it a default source
[2014-07-16 02:45:37 -0400] holoway: so you just say
[2014-07-16 02:45:37 -0400] fujin: ah, soo.
[2014-07-16 02:45:43 -0400] holoway: source :repo
[2014-07-16 02:45:50 -0400] holoway: metadata
[2014-07-16 02:45:54 -0400] holoway: and that's your berksfile
[2014-07-16 02:45:57 -0400] fujin: heh.
[2014-07-16 02:46:09 -0400] holoway: and you literally can just... use all the shit
[2014-07-16 02:46:11 -0400] holoway: or not
[2014-07-16 02:46:12 -0400] fujin: okay, I can start to buy into that, but then, why didn't I bother to think of raising and contributing ?
[2014-07-16 02:46:14 -0400] holoway: with no pain
[2014-07-16 02:46:33 -0400] fujin: that isn't the only pain point I had -- but many of the others have had been p\otentially resolved or made worse by berks3
[2014-07-16 02:46:38 -0400] holoway: fujin: because we stopped hanging out in IRC and swearing at each other - no lie
[2014-07-16 02:46:41 -0400] fujin: I simply have not had the profiessional capacity afforded to me in order to determine the gain or loss
[2014-07-16 02:47:05 -0400] holoway: fujin: cause my company grew by a 100 people and a CEO died
[2014-07-16 02:47:11 -0400] fujin: I surely have been missing for IRC a long time
[2014-07-16 02:47:22 -0400] holoway: so we've been having some communication problems
[2014-07-16 02:47:39 -0400] holoway: that have been made worse by falling into the trap of Chef Software being a participant in our community, rather then the people in this room
[2014-07-16 02:47:49 -0400] holoway: and, viola - distance and rumors
[2014-07-16 02:47:51 -0400] holoway: :)
[2014-07-16 02:47:56 -0400] holoway: it's perfectly human
[2014-07-16 02:47:59 -0400] c_t: "voila"
[2014-07-16 02:48:05 -0400] holoway: c_t: pedant :)
[2014-07-16 02:48:11 -0400] c_t: a viola is a stringed instrument similar, but larger than, a violin
[2014-07-16 02:48:17 -0400] holoway: internet explorer would've auto-completed that for me
[2014-07-16 02:48:42 -0400] holoway: fujin: but when I talk about solutions, thats what I mean - by definition, the people writing those tools don't have your pain
[2014-07-16 02:48:44 -0400] c_t: I correct because I love
[2014-07-16 02:48:57 -0400] holoway: fujin: but our main source of feedback became twitter hate storsm
[2014-07-16 02:49:01 -0400] c_t: (also to take a break from puzzling over the best way to write this query)
[2014-07-16 02:49:07 -0400] holoway: fujin: which makes fixing it BRUTAL, because you have to unpack all the feels
[2014-07-16 02:49:12 -0400] fujin: why ? because I don't write or deploy my infrastructure the same way, they do?
[2014-07-16 02:49:12 -0400] holoway: so...many...feels
[2014-07-16 02:49:20 -0400] fujin: I am forced to feel like I am breaking the mold
[2014-07-16 02:49:30 -0400] fujin: I am forced toa bide the ideals of Berkshelf-driven Infrastructure Development
[2014-07-16 02:49:34 -0400] holoway: nah, we just need to take each other seriously
[2014-07-16 02:49:42 -0400] fujin: I am totally serious
[2014-07-16 02:49:56 -0400] fujin: I have to professionally represent Berkshelf to my potential future colleagues
[2014-07-16 02:50:02 -0400] fujin: I have to train beginners
[2014-07-16 02:50:16 -0400] holoway: we don't teach beginners berkshelf
[2014-07-16 02:50:22 -0400] holoway: (and we teach a lot of beginners)
[2014-07-16 02:50:35 -0400] fujin: I sure as hell have to teach beginner SRE/Ops Engineers berkshelf, if they';ve not come in contact with it before
[2014-07-16 02:50:45 -0400] fujin: e.g. crossing over from another automation field
[2014-07-16 02:50:50 -0400] fujin: Or a non-automation background
[2014-07-16 02:51:00 -0400] holoway: to do which part of your workflow?
[2014-07-16 02:51:10 -0400] holoway: (I'm not being a dick, I really want to understand, so I can solve them)
[2014-07-16 02:51:16 -0400] holoway: (like, say, a local berks source)
[2014-07-16 02:51:17 -0400] fujin: Gather the deep dependencies required for interacting with the corp chefserver
[2014-07-16 02:51:24 -0400] fujin: Equivalent to the other staff
[2014-07-16 02:51:33 -0400] holoway: fujin: where do those deep dependencies come from?
[2014-07-16 02:51:54 -0400] holoway: no lie, I'ma patch berkshelf on the plane
[2014-07-16 02:51:57 -0400] fujin: A mix of mega-repo site-cookbooks (I do not have a cookbooks/ dir, in that sense) and external git repositories, or what was the community site
[2014-07-16 02:52:03 -0400] holoway: cause the rage in me is strong
[2014-07-16 02:52:21 -0400] fujin: I don't understand what the patch would be -- it is teachable
[2014-07-16 02:52:29 -0400] holoway: fujin: right - so you have at least four sources?
[2014-07-16 02:52:37 -0400] holoway: fujin: we can make it not a "hack"
[2014-07-16 02:52:48 -0400] holoway: to make what you just said easy to explain
[2014-07-16 02:52:57 -0400] fujin: Others will have use for the chef-server as an asset source
[2014-07-16 02:53:04 -0400] fujin: As part of a CI promotion workflow
[2014-07-16 02:53:11 -0400] holoway: you need N sources of mega-repo, external git repos, and community stuff
[2014-07-16 02:53:14 -0400] fujin: Since it can be canonical cookbook storage with easy APIs
[2014-07-16 02:53:35 -0400] fujin: That is one of the early targets of Go Chef api: Cookbook uploads/downloads
[2014-07-16 02:53:36 -0400] holoway: and the chef server
[2014-07-16 02:53:58 -0400] holoway: so if the solution was something like this
[2014-07-16 02:54:15 -0400] lamont_oc: holoway:  this is a major pain point with git repos: https://github.com/berkshelf/berkshelf/issues/1126
[2014-07-16 02:55:39 -0400] fujin: holoway: you definitely have looked at kallistec's omnifetch right?
[2014-07-16 02:55:39 -0400] lamont_oc: that has its roots in code-as-configuration and metadata.rb -> metadata.json issues
[2014-07-16 02:56:31 -0400] holoway: fujin: yes
[2014-07-16 02:56:36 -0400] juliancdunn: just a data point 'cause this a "safe" forum -- you know it's bad when Opscode's own consulting org stays away from telling customers about Berkshelf
[2014-07-16 02:56:38 -0400] lamont_oc: which has resulted in The Berkshelf Way being to only use finalized artifacts which leads to berks API servers for artifacts that you push to github repos, and nobody understands Why very well
[2014-07-16 02:56:56 -0400] holoway: so lets back up
[2014-07-16 02:57:05 -0400] holoway: what use cases are universal?
[2014-07-16 02:57:11 -0400] lamont_oc: i /honestly/ dont understand the bit deal about Berkshelf, its really pretty simple
[2014-07-16 02:57:16 -0400] lamont_oc: *big
[2014-07-16 02:57:30 -0400] fujin: wow just read that issue
[2014-07-16 02:57:33 -0400] fujin: mother fucking hell
[2014-07-16 02:57:38 -0400] holoway: I totally understand not wanting to run a berks api to get shit from git
[2014-07-16 02:57:42 -0400] fujin: that would be like the one useful case for being able to switch out shit to local dev mode
[2014-07-16 02:57:42 -0400] holoway: that's crazytown
[2014-07-16 02:57:59 -0400] holoway: yeah, I'm not sure I agree with teh conclusion there
[2014-07-16 02:58:05 -0400] holoway: but I see what happened
[2014-07-16 02:58:06 -0400] lamont_oc: its not crazytown, the problem is that people use ruby code in their metadata.rb to generate version numbers
[2014-07-16 02:58:36 -0400] fujin: ya i've had someone reach into a pgsql db and pull a column out to be used to help with the version
[2014-07-16 02:58:39 -0400] fujin: don't even get me started
[2014-07-16 02:58:43 -0400] fujin: some people cannot be reasoned with
[2014-07-16 02:58:46 -0400] holoway: (if we want opinionated solutions to the mess, we should force pin to master everywehere and punch everyone)
[2014-07-16 02:59:06 -0400] fujin: one of the models of cookbook storage I am experimenting with allows only one version of a cookbook ever to be stored
[2014-07-16 02:59:07 -0400] lamont_oc: seth and jaime are taking a pretty rational course of action given the CI/CD users that they really want to target
[2014-07-16 02:59:21 -0400] holoway: lamont_oc: we could simply change that
[2014-07-16 02:59:40 -0400] lamont_oc: yeah well i think with the PolicyFile stuff dan is working on it all goes away
[2014-07-16 02:59:46 -0400] fujin: I keep saying that
[2014-07-16 02:59:49 -0400] holoway: I think it probably does
[2014-07-16 02:59:50 -0400] fujin: but I dunno about policyfile
[2014-07-16 02:59:52 -0400] fujin: It's vaporware
[2014-07-16 02:59:58 -0400] holoway: it's not quite vaporware
[2014-07-16 03:00:02 -0400] fujin: i'm j/k I love kallistec
[2014-07-16 03:00:15 -0400] holoway: I dunno if its ready-ware
[2014-07-16 03:00:17 -0400] fujin: I read the https://github.com/danielsdeleo/chef-workflow2-prototype
[2014-07-16 03:00:17 -0400] holoway: :)
[2014-07-16 03:00:27 -0400] holoway: fujin: he's been actualyl writing a real implementation
[2014-07-16 03:00:29 -0400] lamont_oc: today: https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk/pull/97
[2014-07-16 03:00:31 -0400] juliancdunn: it's not really ready-ware
[2014-07-16 03:00:35 -0400] fujin: oh fucking hell
[2014-07-16 03:00:59 -0400] fujin: that overwhelming living under a rock feeling
[2014-07-16 03:01:06 -0400] holoway: because we'll never know if he's right until we can touch it
[2014-07-16 03:01:08 -0400] holoway: :)
[2014-07-16 03:01:41 -0400] fujin: dude it uses omnifetch
[2014-07-16 03:02:01 -0400] holoway: of course
[2014-07-16 03:02:03 -0400] fujin: sometimes, I'm like "grrr"', but today, I am quite happy
[2014-07-16 03:02:09 -0400] holoway: (which comes from... Berkshelf)
[2014-07-16 03:02:16 -0400] fujin: yeah yeah, so I read
[2014-07-16 03:02:21 -0400] lamont_oc: omnifetch was extracted from berkshelf for it
[2014-07-16 03:02:44 -0400] holoway:  my plane is boarding
[2014-07-16 03:02:45 -0400] holoway: gotta go
[2014-07-16 03:02:50 -0400] fujin: fly safely friend
[2014-07-16 03:02:54 -0400] holoway: fujin: write a task list down
[2014-07-16 03:03:07 -0400] holoway: join the fix it brigade, even if just by spreading the word
[2014-07-16 03:03:10 -0400] holoway: don't have to write a line of code
[2014-07-16 03:03:21 -0400] holoway: ok
[2014-07-16 03:03:23 -0400] holoway: on to airplane
[2014-07-16 03:03:25 -0400] fujin: probably should get chef-dk working on arch linux
[2014-07-16 03:03:34 -0400] fujin: real workstation
[2014-07-16 03:03:40 -0400] fujin: nevermind windows
[2014-07-16 03:03:44 -0400] fujin: need to target Arch Linux
[2014-07-16 03:03:56 -0400] fujin: #1 Task in All of the Land
[2014-07-16 03:10:49 -0400] holoway: We need a way to take artifacts from trusted sources
[2014-07-16 03:11:15 -0400] fujin: ARE YOU IN THE AIR ???
[2014-07-16 03:11:25 -0400] holoway: Man, IRC cloud on android is the bomb
[2014-07-16 03:11:42 -0400] fujin: Is there a way for me to test that chef-dk on archlinux, without the availability of an omnibus chefdk for archlinux .pkg?
[2014-07-16 03:11:57 -0400] fujin: I stopped usign irccloud recently, I am just using Circe in Emacs.
[2014-07-16 03:12:04 -0400] fujin: It's a mighty fine IRC client.
[2014-07-16 03:12:37 -0400] holoway: Yeah - just rip it out of the rpm with cpio
[2014-07-16 03:12:46 -0400] fujin: yeah was just about to say
[2014-07-16 03:12:50 -0400] fujin: I can use ar to rip the data directory out of the dpkg
[2014-07-16 03:12:51 -0400] holoway: It'll work
[2014-07-16 03:12:54 -0400] fujin: If it's just Omnibus
[2014-07-16 03:13:02 -0400] fujin: I will have enough shared libs on my host for it to run
[2014-07-16 03:13:05 -0400] fujin: glibcy and so forth
[2014-07-16 03:13:07 -0400] holoway: We should build a tarball with the glibc version
[2014-07-16 03:13:18 -0400] fujin: All-linux portable tarball
[2014-07-16 03:13:21 -0400] fujin: Yes please!
[2014-07-16 03:13:36 -0400] fujin: It's the year of Linux on the Desktop
[2014-07-16 03:13:46 -0400] holoway: :)
[2014-07-16 03:16:27 -0400] fujin: I don't seem to be able to use bundler to install 'berkshelf', even with an explicit mention of 'dep-selector-libgecode' in the Gemfile
[2014-07-16 03:16:39 -0400] fujin: I know this worked recently.. it spun up my fans compiling it

[2014-07-16 20:16:39 -0400] c_t: oooh
[2014-07-16 20:16:45 -0400] c_t: I wholeheartedly approve
[2014-07-16 20:16:55 -0400] github-bawt: [chef-rfc] danielsdeleo opened pull request #19: Propose universe endpoint for chef-server (master...universe-endpoint) http://git.io/Q3U9zw
[2014-07-16 20:42:33 -0400] c_t: kallistec: what's the likely "location_type" for chef-server /universe?
[2014-07-16 20:43:27 -0400] kallistec: c_t: good question. I'd have to ask someone familiar with the berkshelf-api service what names are "taken"
[2014-07-16 20:43:59 -0400] c_t: I took a sec and implemented /universe real quick for goiardi
[2014-07-16 20:44:15 -0400] c_t: (seriously, took 5 minutes or so)
[2014-07-16 20:44:31 -0400] kallistec: Ideally it would be something obvious like "chef-server", but I don't know if that would break anything that already exists in berks
[2014-07-16 20:44:43 -0400] c_t: I stuck "chef_server" in for now, but figured coordinating was worthwhile
[2014-07-16 20:46:00 -0400] kallistec: yeah, the workstation-side tooling will need to use that field to figure out that it needs to download the cookbook_version JSON object and fetch the files from the embedded links
[2014-07-16 20:47:52 -0400] kallistec: as opposed to fetching tarballs
