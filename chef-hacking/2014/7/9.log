[2014-07-09 00:23:01 -0400] jalberts: any chance someone here can help with a suggestion for my use case of the deep_merge gem?  Tried to hit up kallistec directly, but he's afk right now.
[2014-07-09 00:23:15 -0400] jalberts: nvm :)
[2014-07-09 00:24:11 -0400] jalberts: ok. asking here.
[2014-07-09 00:24:30 -0400] jalberts: i'm using deep_merge to merge an array of hashes.
[2014-07-09 00:24:54 -0400] jalberts: i know about the merge_hash_arrays option, but it doesn't do what I want.
[2014-07-09 00:25:09 -0400] jalberts: here's what I'm trying to do. plz bear with me, slow typer
[2014-07-09 00:27:07 -0400] jalberts: src = layers: [ { name: "name1", key2: "value1" }, { name: "name2", key2: "value2" }], dest = layers: [ { name: "name1", key2: "new value" } ]
[2014-07-09 00:27:36 -0400] jalberts: if i'm merging src and dest, is there any way for me to indicate that 'name' is a unique key to merge by?
[2014-07-09 00:27:56 -0400] kallistec: jalberts: deep_merge doesn't have that logic built in
[2014-07-09 00:28:48 -0400] kallistec: IMO you'd be better served by changing from an array to hash, because you have an implicit uniqueness constraint on the name
[2014-07-09 00:28:57 -0400] jalberts: kallistec: I tried using a knockout prefix at various levels, etc. and then specify the entire new 'name1' hash that I wanted to replace, but that didn't work for me either
[2014-07-09 00:29:22 -0400] jalberts: kallistec: totally agree, but I'm working with a set format for the opsworks API that I need to stick with
[2014-07-09 00:29:44 -0400] jalberts: ok.  i figured I was out of luck and need to add some additional logic somewhere to do what I need.
[2014-07-09 00:30:07 -0400] jalberts: maybe i'll add it as a new feature to the deep_merge gem and submit a pull request.
[2014-07-09 00:30:25 -0400] jalberts: except for this one use case, this deep_merge gem is working perfectly for me.
[2014-07-09 00:30:34 -0400] jalberts: ty for maintaining it
[2014-07-09 00:30:41 -0400] kallistec: yeah, deep_merge does the sort orf base case for merging and I think the knockout stuff is designed to handle incoming form data in rails or some use case like that
[2014-07-09 00:31:42 -0400] kallistec: the design doesn't really allow for special logic like you need to be easily added
[2014-07-09 00:33:10 -0400] jalberts: Yeah, i figured it would take some work.  I was thinking I could add a special option for handling of an array of hashes, where all elements of the array must be a hash.
[2014-07-09 00:34:05 -0400] jalberts: kallistec: anyway.  ty for taking the time to help me.
[2014-07-09 00:34:14 -0400] jalberts: i need to run right now.
[2014-07-09 00:34:19 -0400] kallistec: jalberts: you bet

[2014-07-09 19:13:10 -0400] gondoi: i'm trying to build out some chefspec tests on a recipe that is notifying a resource from upstream to restart
[2014-07-09 19:13:29 -0400] gondoi: although chefspec is erroring out that the resource is not in the collection
[2014-07-09 19:13:48 -0400] gondoi: my assumption is because it's not loading that dependency recipe
[2014-07-09 19:14:14 -0400] gondoi: nvm i just found the error
[2014-07-09 22:26:08 -0400] jalberts: i'm trying to create a full stack installer using omnibus-ruby for the first time and I'm hitting an issue trying to build on my mac.  I get a gcc error.
[2014-07-09 22:29:28 -0400] jalberts: wow. weechat really doesn't want me to paste 2 lines.  keeps locking up the terminal. :)
[2014-07-09 22:29:42 -0400] fujin: use gist bro
[2014-07-09 22:29:44 -0400] jalberts: i get this error for the bzip2 package
[2014-07-09 22:29:47 -0400] fujin: or pastebin or something.
[2014-07-09 22:30:05 -0400] jalberts: fujin: i usually do for more than a few lines. this is just 2.
[2014-07-09 22:30:25 -0400] fujin: Then you aren't giving enough diagnostics information.
[2014-07-09 22:30:32 -0400] jalberts: fujin: yeah, true
[2014-07-09 22:30:46 -0400] fujin: omnibus-ruby is like, totally unsupported outside of opscode
[2014-07-09 22:30:52 -0400] fujin: show me what you're seeing and I'll see if I can help
[2014-07-09 22:31:15 -0400] jalberts: here's the output i'm getting.  https://gist.github.com/albertsj1/b75c08b431d24588c7c6
[2014-07-09 22:31:50 -0400] jalberts: fujin: ah, i thought it was like, the new cool way to make full stack installers. :)
[2014-07-09 22:32:34 -0400] jalberts: fujin: congrats on the new job, btw.
[2014-07-09 22:32:38 -0400] fujin: cheers
[2014-07-09 22:32:41 -0400] fujin: looking
[2014-07-09 22:33:24 -0400] jalberts: i'm assuming the error has something to do with the fact i'm on mavericks and gcc is now a link to clang
[2014-07-09 22:34:06 -0400] fujin: heh
[2014-07-09 22:34:12 -0400] fujin: sorry man, I don't run OSX
[2014-07-09 22:34:20 -0400] fujin: Never tried to use the new Omnibus OSX shit
[2014-07-09 22:34:21 -0400] jalberts: but not sure what the best solution would be. Since the bzip2 library is pretty common, I was hoping someone here had seen this before
[2014-07-09 22:34:44 -0400] fujin: It is unlikely many folks (at all) use the OSX package creation facilities of omnibus-ruby
[2014-07-09 22:35:08 -0400] fujin: I have NFI what the OSX build slaves @ Opscode look like
[2014-07-09 22:35:17 -0400] fujin: could be a question for the release engineering team, they may be able to provide some insight.
[2014-07-09 22:35:28 -0400] fujin: that thing where I keep saying opscode instaed of chefinc
[2014-07-09 22:36:10 -0400] jalberts: i intentionally still say opscode because it's confusing to managers who don't know there was a name change. :)
[2014-07-09 22:36:27 -0400] jalberts: thx for taking a look.
[2014-07-09 22:39:04 -0400] fujin: jalberts: If I had some way to test I would totally try, sorry man
[2014-07-09 22:39:16 -0400] fujin: jalberts: do you have like an older OSX version you can run against? or maybe try to pull in GCC or similar with Brew?
[2014-07-09 22:39:31 -0400] fujin: fwiw, I use clang (I actually have Omnibus install Clang, into the prefix) for one of my omnibus projects
[2014-07-09 22:40:24 -0400] jalberts: fujin: no older osx version.  my next step was to install gcc 4.x.
[2014-07-09 23:18:16 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: they're mac minis!
[2014-07-09 23:18:21 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: the os x build systems.
[2014-07-09 23:18:24 -0400] jtimberman: thats all i know though
[2014-07-09 23:18:28 -0400] jtimberman: i've never used em.
[2014-07-09 23:18:37 -0400] fujin: yeah
[2014-07-09 23:18:47 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: by the looks, jalberts was trying to run it on Mavericks against clang
[2014-07-09 23:19:05 -0400] fujin: and clang is giving him an error regarding the '-soname' flag, from bzip2 software defn
[2014-07-09 23:19:20 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: do you happen to  know whom might know what version of OSX they are running, and any GCC configuration, so that we might inform jalberts ?
[2014-07-09 23:19:39 -0400] jalberts: pretty sure I found the problem.  still building right now though, so not certain.  The bzip2 package failed because the path to the libs was wrong due to the fact that install_path is used now instead of install_dir
[2014-07-09 23:20:02 -0400] jalberts: funny thing is, seth just submitted a PR to revert and go back to using install_dir. :)
[2014-07-09 23:20:09 -0400] fujin: heh..
[2014-07-09 23:20:19 -0400] fujin: glad I didn't change all of mine, then
