[2014-04-14 22:01:51 -0400] armendonigian: how do you specify cookbook version using knife node edit
[2014-04-14 22:02:21 -0400] armendonigian: in env files, you can use cookbook_versions({
[2014-04-14 22:02:22 -0400] armendonigian:     "nginx" => "<= 1.1.0",
[2014-04-14 22:02:23 -0400] armendonigian:     "apt" => "= 0.0.1"
[2014-04-14 22:02:23 -0400] armendonigian: })
[2014-04-14 22:02:31 -0400] armendonigian: but what about knife node edit...
[2014-04-14 22:02:31 -0400] jonlives: armendonigian: you can
[2014-04-14 22:02:37 -0400] armendonigian: how
[2014-04-14 22:02:40 -0400] jonlives: armendonigian: you can't specify a cookbook version on the node itself
[2014-04-14 22:02:53 -0400] jonlives: only in the environment the node is in
[2014-04-14 22:03:13 -0400] jonlives: the node just gets a run_list containing the cookbooks or roles it gets, the environment dictates the versions.
[2014-04-14 22:03:29 -0400] armendonigian: why cant you specify a particular cookbook version in node?
[2014-04-14 22:04:36 -0400] armendonigian: ?
[2014-04-14 22:04:37 -0400] jonlives: I would guess so that you can centrally control versions in environments rather than having to do it on a node specific basis
[2014-04-14 22:04:53 -0400] jonlives: imagine having to worry about dependency prededence between nodes and environments
[2014-04-14 22:04:54 -0400] armendonigian: do you have a source for this?
[2014-04-14 22:05:13 -0400] jonlives: armendonigian: on the fact that it's not possible?
[2014-04-14 22:05:23 -0400] armendonigian: yes
[2014-04-14 22:06:57 -0400] zts: hm, there's a documented syntax for specifying an equal-to constraint in the run list - http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_versions.html#run-lists
[2014-04-14 22:07:02 -0400] jonlives: armendonigian: apologies, I may have been wrong
[2014-04-14 22:07:08 -0400] zts: i've never seen that before
[2014-04-14 22:07:16 -0400] jonlives: yeah, I'd never seen that either!
[2014-04-14 22:07:20 -0400] jonlives: page I was just on
[2014-04-14 22:07:29 -0400] armendonigian: nice
[2014-04-14 22:07:35 -0400] armendonigian: #awesome
[2014-04-14 22:07:38 -0400] armendonigian: #youguysrock
[2014-04-14 22:07:39 -0400] jonlives: armendonigian: so actually, you can use an "exactly equal to" constraint in the run_list
[2014-04-14 22:07:42 -0400] jonlives: TIL.
[2014-04-14 22:08:48 -0400] zts: TIL also.  Shame that didn't come an hour later, or I could have bunked off work on the grounds that I'd already learned something for the day
[2014-04-14 22:09:21 -0400] jonlives: haha you and me both.
[2014-04-14 22:09:38 -0400] jonlives: armendonigian: so thanks for indirectly teaching both of us something new :D
[2014-04-14 22:09:51 -0400] armendonigian: :)
