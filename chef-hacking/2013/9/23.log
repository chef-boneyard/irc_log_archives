[2013-09-23 18:14:24 -0400] cwj: anyone have a suggestion as to where i should start if test-kitchen+chef-zero is telling me i am missing cookbooks?
[2013-09-23 18:14:46 -0400] cwj: the cookbooks are on the file system

[2013-09-23 18:16:43 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: Where on the file system?  I admit ignorance of the actual chef-zero setup in test-kitchen, but I know all files need to go in a specific repo directory
[2013-09-23 18:17:44 -0400] cwj: test-kitchen sets up /tmp/kitchen-chef-zero, where cookbooks, clients, data_bags, roles, dna.json etc are written
[2013-09-23 18:17:57 -0400] cwj: and chef-client-zero.rb which sets up chef-zero and calls chef-client

[2013-09-23 18:18:47 -0400] github-bawt: omnibus-chef/OC-8537 d7906d7 Lamont Granquist: install windows chef gem on windows....
[2013-09-23 18:19:02 -0400] cwj: jkeiser: chef-client-zero.rb https://gist.github.com/cwjohnston/61e6a807691b1cb2695a
[2013-09-23 18:22:22 -0400] cwj: gets run like this: sudo -E /opt/chef/embedded/bin/ruby /tmp/kitchen-chef-zero/chef-client-zero.rb --config /tmp/kitchen-chef-zero/client.rb --json-attributes /tmp/kitchen-chef-zero/dna.json --log_level info
[2013-09-23 18:24:02 -0400] cwj: added client.rb to gist
[2013-09-23 18:26:14 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: and the cookbooks are in there?  Hmm.  If you do knife list /cookbooks -c /tmp/kitchen-chef-zero/client.rb, what does it show?
[2013-09-23 18:27:16 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: or even ls -l /tmp/kitchen-chef-zero/cookbooks
[2013-09-23 18:27:31 -0400] jkeiser: Both would be useful actually, in different ways
[2013-09-23 18:27:59 -0400] cwj: i will have to figure out how to get chef-zero started manually but the cookbooks dir does appear to contain what i expect
[2013-09-23 18:28:01 -0400] jkeiser: If a cookbook is effectively empty, chef-zero won't server it (for example, if it has nothing but a .git file
[2013-09-23 18:28:46 -0400] cwj: the cookbook i am testing has at least a valid metadata
[2013-09-23 18:29:15 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: install knife-essentials, and add chef_server_url :local to the client.rb for a sec
[2013-09-23 18:29:31 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: that should spin up a chef-zero server in that directory when you start knife list
[2013-09-23 18:30:50 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: you can also just use knife serve -c /tmp/kitchen-chef-zero/client.rb
[2013-09-23 18:31:03 -0400] cwj: ok stand by
[2013-09-23 18:31:05 -0400] jkeiser: But that will have to run in the background and you'll still have to add chef_server_url if you do that
[2013-09-23 18:31:12 -0400] jkeiser: to point at it
[2013-09-23 18:31:17 -0400] jkeiser: :local is easier
[2013-09-23 18:35:02 -0400] cwj: looks like knife wants me to have a key but the wrapper script set up by test-kitchen is setting :generate_real_keys => false
[2013-09-23 18:35:11 -0400] cwj: is there a way to approximate that in the client.rb as well?
[2013-09-23 18:50:21 -0400] cwj: jkeiser: ok i got it working, i am getting a cookbook list back from the chef-zero instance
[2013-09-23 18:50:37 -0400] cwj: includes both the cookbooks in my suites run list
[2013-09-23 18:50:48 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: awesome!  what did you have to change?
[2013-09-23 18:51:06 -0400] jkeiser: generate_real_keys => false should not make a lick of difference
[2013-09-23 18:51:18 -0400] jkeiser: Except to make chef-zero faster
[2013-09-23 18:52:48 -0400] cwj: had to tell knife about the path to the validator via client.rb
[2013-09-23 18:53:09 -0400] cwj: and the chef-zero server url
[2013-09-23 18:53:16 -0400] cwj: so i am not using the :local config
[2013-09-23 18:54:29 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: oh!  so you mean you got knife working, but test-kitchen chef-client still isn't, correct?
[2013-09-23 18:54:37 -0400] cwj: correct
[2013-09-23 18:54:50 -0400] cwj: but knife is confirming the cookbooks are there
[2013-09-23 18:54:58 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: is this the chef-zero instance set up by test-kitchen or one you ran?
[2013-09-23 18:55:24 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] lamont-granquist pushed 1 new commit to lcg/mingw-gemspec: http://git.io/j2K3sQ
[2013-09-23 18:55:25 -0400] github-bawt: chef/lcg/mingw-gemspec 8406494 Lamont Granquist: ignore ronn if its not in the bundle
[2013-09-23 18:55:42 -0400] cwj: its one i am running, but i am running it the way tk would with a slight change
[2013-09-23 18:56:43 -0400] cwj: the script tk drops off starts the server in the background and then runs the client, ensuring the server is killed when the client exits
[2013-09-23 18:57:06 -0400] cwj: so i modified that script to run tk foreground and not run the client
[2013-09-23 19:02:21 -0400] cwj: running chef-client against the chef-zero instance i have started is returning the same error wrt unsolvable versions
[2013-09-23 19:03:04 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: interesting.  Looking at the error again.  Maybe it's actually version constraints
[2013-09-23 19:06:08 -0400] cwj: not sure where a version constraint would come from, my run list is [recipe[apt],recipe[haystack::elasticsearch]]
[2013-09-23 19:06:18 -0400] cwj: i dont see any versions specified in the dna.json
[2013-09-23 19:07:25 -0400] cwj: can i turn up logging from ChefZero::Server somehow?
[2013-09-23 19:35:37 -0400] cwj: going to go ahead and blame this one on berkshelf
[2013-09-23 19:37:40 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: berkshelf does have weird constraints.  Sorry, I'm bouncing about quite a bit
[2013-09-23 19:38:01 -0400] jkeiser: its solver isn't perfect.  But if there are no version constraints anywhere ...
[2013-09-23 19:38:02 -0400] cwj: no worries, i appreciate your help so far
[2013-09-23 19:38:35 -0400] cwj: i have blown away my Berksfile.lock and rerun berks install, will see if that helps my tk run
[2013-09-23 19:38:41 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: you had your actual error in the gist before, but it looks gone now
[2013-09-23 19:39:12 -0400] cwj: i can readd it, i had accidentally posted a very long kitchen log file
[2013-09-23 19:43:35 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: mind posting the actual error?  One thing chef-zero sucks at (unfortunately) is error logging in the depsolver when solving fails
[2013-09-23 19:43:45 -0400] cwj: yep 1sec
[2013-09-23 19:43:59 -0400] jkeiser: so far we haven't found a case where it's *wrong*, but when it can't solve, it doesn't help you very much.
[2013-09-23 19:46:21 -0400] cwj: added a relevant section from the kitchen log
[2013-09-23 19:46:33 -0400] cwj: https://gist.github.com/cwjohnston/61e6a807691b1cb2695a/raw/0fc3b96b1a336e15eceb456b3eae8d3d17446c73/elasticsearch-aws-ubuntu-1204.log
[2013-09-23 19:46:36 -0400] cwj: so many longs
[2013-09-23 19:47:04 -0400] cwj: if i remove haystack::elasticsearch from the run list i am ok
[2013-09-23 19:47:29 -0400] cwj: ill add the metadata for haystack cookbook too
[2013-09-23 19:53:09 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: it's weird that it says "Missing Cookbooks" but doesn't say what they are
[2013-09-23 19:54:40 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: oh!  there are plenty of cookbook dependencies and version constraints in there
[2013-09-23 19:54:54 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: are the dependent cookbooks in your cookbook repo?
[2013-09-23 19:55:50 -0400] cwj: they are in separate repos, my berksfile knows where they are, and it looks like they are getting uploaded into the cookbook path on the test-kitchen instance
[2013-09-23 20:00:19 -0400] cwj: so i am thinking that either berks is uploading all the cookbooks i need but not the right versions, or something else
[2013-09-23 20:07:29 -0400] cwj: jkeiser: afaict all the cookbooks i depend on directly are there, and the ones with version constraints seem to be a correct verision
[2013-09-23 20:08:09 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: does it succeed if you remove apt but keep the other one?
[2013-09-23 20:08:18 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: solving, I mean
[2013-09-23 20:08:38 -0400] cwj: nope
[2013-09-23 20:08:42 -0400] cwj: but apt itself works
[2013-09-23 20:09:09 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: ok, so it sounds a little like the other cookbook is self-contradictory version-wise
[2013-09-23 20:09:34 -0400] cwj: well it works in test-kitchen under solo provisioner
[2013-09-23 20:09:40 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: maybe remove apt, and start removing "depends" lines from it
[2013-09-23 20:09:48 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: solo doesn't check dependency constraints at all :)
[2013-09-23 20:10:16 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: somewhere one of the cookbooks is saying "I want cookbook x at version 1.0.0" and another is saying "I want cookbook x, but only versions >= 1.1"
[2013-09-23 20:10:24 -0400] jkeiser: At least, that is what I am guessing from this
[2013-09-23 20:10:42 -0400] jkeiser: It would likely fail on the chef server too (again, hypothesis)
[2013-09-23 20:10:55 -0400] cwj: yeah i hear you
[2013-09-23 20:11:53 -0400] cwj: the cookbook does work under chef-server in general, but maybe my changes in this branch are the problem
[2013-09-23 20:28:02 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: well if you remove a "depends" line and it starts working, you have a culprit :)  The good old test case minimization dance
[2013-09-23 20:40:49 -0400] cwj: jkeiser: fwiw i just tested a known-good version (works under chef-server) under test-kitchen+chef-zero, same error
[2013-09-23 20:43:47 -0400] jkeiser: cwj: could be you've found a chef-zero bug.  Can you narrow it down by getting rid of apt and getting rid of dependencies until you find the essentials ones to the problem?
[2013-09-23 20:44:02 -0400] jkeiser: That'll help a lot with solving the solver problem, assuming there is one
[2013-09-23 20:44:24 -0400] cwj: will do
[2013-09-23 20:44:31 -0400] cwj: first, lunch. bbiab
