[2013-01-28 16:26:46 -0500] renchap: btm: i would like to know if the current behaviour is wanted
[2013-01-28 16:38:41 -0500] btm: renchap: personally I don't think it should overwrite without a --force. I thought there was some discussion somewhere along the lines of "well, I'm telling it to create so it should do what I want" but I can't find it and I don't think that invalidates the common --force pattern.
[2013-01-28 16:39:15 -0500] renchap: it is quite dangerous
[2013-01-28 16:39:22 -0500] renchap: as it is today
[2013-01-28 16:40:50 -0500] btm: renchap: that said, I don't think --force is necessarily the appropiate argument unless we use it a lot and it seems best to keep a common argument. Maybe --overwrite. Or exit with a unique exit code so people could recover and script a knife [client|node] delete if they wanted that functionality.
[2013-01-28 16:41:08 -0500] btm: but yeah, I agree. knife * create shouldn't overwrite an existing object.
[2013-01-28 16:41:50 -0500] renchap: we discovered it in a bad way
[2013-01-28 16:42:00 -0500] renchap: when one of our nodes became empty
[2013-01-28 16:42:09 -0500] renchap: and we spotted a typo i na knife node create command

[2013-01-28 22:29:13 -0500] josephholsten: keep getting 'Could not find task "all" in "jamie" namespace.', but I've got a require 'jamie/thor_tasks' in the thorfile
[2013-01-28 22:29:17 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: you could be the first :) what were you expecting?
[2013-01-28 22:29:45 -0500] fnichol: ah, maybe there's a problem with the `thor jamie:all` task then. do any of the individual tasks work?
[2013-01-28 22:29:59 -0500] josephholsten: I've verified that it's executing Jamie::ThorTasks.define, but it's not adding any tasks
[2013-01-28 22:31:15 -0500] josephholsten: hmm.  and jamie list is saying "No instances for regex `', try running `jamie list'". I guess I should run from head, not the released gem
[2013-01-28 22:32:16 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: is it the beta4 release you're using? do you have a .jamie.yml file in your project's root? on the todo list is a graceful failure when that isn't the case
[2013-01-28 22:33:09 -0500] josephholsten: I do. trying to hack the chef-rvm one to my uses
[2013-01-28 22:34:03 -0500] josephholsten: ah, I had commented out suites.
[2013-01-28 22:34:12 -0500] josephholsten: that's not very brainy.
[2013-01-28 22:34:49 -0500] fnichol: ah, then that's all on me :) we'll put in a nice error message if the yaml can't be properly ingested
[2013-01-28 22:35:51 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: we'll be getting better examples out there, but in the meantime here are some other config files i've been using, mostly as .jamie.local.yml files: https://gist.github.com/098bba30a76b5a6b3764
[2013-01-28 22:36:42 -0500] fnichol: some examples of what the ec2, dummy, and bluebox driver configs could look like. the yaml files are also passed through an ERB processor so you can escape into Ruby if you really need to.
[2013-01-28 22:36:56 -0500] josephholsten: nice.
[2013-01-28 22:41:25 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: there, that should be tracked now https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen/issues/37
[2013-01-28 22:41:46 -0500] josephholsten: awesome.
[2013-01-28 22:41:56 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: so assuming that `jamie list` returns you some instances, do the thor tasks work now?
[2013-01-28 22:43:35 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: there are 2 small differences with the rake/thor tasks 1) the `thor jamie:all` runs the instances in serial, one after the other and 2) a failed instance test will *always* destroy itself at the end (in the cli mode, `jamie test`, a failed instance is not destroyed so you can poke around afterwards)
[2013-01-28 22:44:24 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: my assumption was that the thor/rake tasks are probably going to be used primarily in a CI environment. in a development context, you'd probably opt for the CLI
[2013-01-28 22:44:59 -0500] josephholsten: the thor tasks don't no. I'm mostly trying to get an end-to-end spike of adding jamie with minitest and vagrant.
[2013-01-28 22:45:18 -0500] josephholsten: so yes, I'm just using the jamie script
[2013-01-28 22:46:29 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: ah ok, you can trigger the individual actions (create -> converge -> setup -> verify) from the CLI or run the test task which will: destroy -> create -> converge -> setup -> verify -> (destroy on success)
[2013-01-28 22:47:44 -0500] josephholsten: awesome. are docs still going into https://github.com/jamie-ci/jamie-ci.github.com for the time being? or elsewhere?
[2013-01-28 22:48:02 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: when working on cookbook code, i'd spend a lot of time running `jamie converge <instance>` with some `jamie destroy <instance> && jamie converge <instance>` commands in there to make sure everything is clean. then move on to `jamie verify <instance>` when i'm writing verifications/tests
[2013-01-28 22:49:13 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: heh, good question :) i imagine for the short term they would be, but eventually something under the opscode org for docs. i'd really like to have a dedicated documentation site at least until it makes sense to merge them into docs.opscode.com or something
[2013-01-28 22:49:34 -0500] josephholsten: sounds good.
[2013-01-28 22:49:43 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: so no matter what, everyone should have clear directions on how to use it, hack it, extend it, etc
[2013-01-28 22:50:56 -0500] fnichol: seth vargo's been helping on on the doc front, i should sync up with him this week :) it would have been me writing the docs, but things got a lot more interesting in the last two weeks
[2013-01-28 22:51:00 -0500] fnichol: in a great way :)
[2013-01-28 22:52:00 -0500] josephholsten: I'd like to get it to be competitive with gembundler.com. especially, move the minimal getting started onto the first page, and call-to-actions for main goals.
[2013-01-28 22:52:25 -0500] schisamo: fnichol: sethvargo: josephholsten: we shoudl be able to set up a github pages site under opscode/test-kitchen until an official move to docs.opscode.com
[2013-01-28 22:52:44 -0500] schisamo: that would make the most sense pre-1.0
[2013-01-28 22:53:07 -0500] schisamo: tell me what we need and I make sure it happens
[2013-01-28 22:53:18 -0500] josephholsten: are all the kitchen plugins going under opscode/? or will we be getting an opscode-kitchen/ org?
[2013-01-28 22:53:23 -0500] fnichol: schisamo: that sounds pretty reasonable. so far we have jamie-ci.github.com which uses middleman (static site generator) uploading to github pages
[2013-01-28 22:53:55 -0500] schisamo: josephholsten: TBD of the org...for now we are creating the repos we need under opscode/
[2013-01-28 22:54:19 -0500] schisamo: fnichol: we should chat about that tomorrow...what repos we need
[2013-01-28 22:54:38 -0500] josephholsten: kk, because worst case, we're going to get this many runners: http://fog.io/about/supported_services.html
[2013-01-28 22:54:46 -0500] fnichol: schisamo: sounds good, i had a couple of questions re: gem releases as well
[2013-01-28 22:55:16 -0500] schisamo: josephholsten: naw. hoping this may take https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen/issues/33
[2013-01-28 22:55:30 -0500] schisamo: FEEDBACK PLZ :)
[2013-01-28 22:55:31 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: lol, so few...
[2013-01-28 22:55:52 -0500] josephholsten: oh yeah. (enter koolaid man)
[2013-01-28 22:56:07 -0500] schisamo: if we can sort out the yml config structure I think a single driver makes the most sense from maintainability.
[2013-01-28 22:56:11 -0500] jtimberman: yeah hopefully we can leverage fog to not have a requirement for so many providers.
[2013-01-28 22:56:18 -0500] jtimberman: plugins
[2013-01-28 22:56:20 -0500] jtimberman: as separate pugins
[2013-01-28 22:56:55 -0500] jtimberman: in the "i want an instance to test this thing really quick" use case (99% for this?), how often do you need all the weird esoteric differences?
[2013-01-28 22:56:59 -0500] schisamo: fnichol: josephholsten jtimberman plz comment on that issue.  I was spiking on kitchen-fog but took a step back to design the yml structure
[2013-01-28 22:57:24 -0500] jtimberman: like, if you're looking for ELB or elastic IP support out of the driver, i think you're probably approaching the problem from the wrong point of view.
[2013-01-28 22:57:46 -0500] josephholsten: absolutely.
[2013-01-28 23:05:04 -0500] josephholsten: is anyone currently using jamie to set up multi-node configurations? I was thinking about how to test multi-master replication with ipa_server's ldap and I don't know if that's possible today.
[2013-01-28 23:07:18 -0500] jtimberman: josephholsten: i believe reset was going to look into that.
[2013-01-28 23:07:41 -0500] jtimberman: but i can't speak for him :)
[2013-01-28 23:08:48 -0500] josephholsten_: kk
[2013-01-28 23:12:27 -0500] schisamo: josephholsten: we all def want multi-node support.  My team (erchef/chef-server) has a real need to test private chef HA clusters in our jenkins pipelines...
[2013-01-28 23:13:22 -0500] jtimberman: while that part's awesome, i really want client/server easier so i can test things like nagios cookbook :)
