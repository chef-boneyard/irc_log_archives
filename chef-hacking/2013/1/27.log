[2013-01-27 20:03:27 -0500] schisamo: jtimberman: fnichol: reset: how does everyone feel about refering the new jamie infused version of test-kitchen as test-kitchen 1.0?  we are only at 0.7.0.
[2013-01-27 20:03:53 -0500] schisamo: not sure if we should jump to 2.0 since it is such a change.
[2013-01-27 20:04:07 -0500] reset: I think that's the right route
[2013-01-27 20:04:26 -0500] reset: 0.x series is pretty much a prototype
[2013-01-27 20:04:35 -0500] reset: 1.x would be the solidified release
[2013-01-27 20:05:45 -0500] schisamo: reset: I can dig it. test-kitchen 1.0 it is.
[2013-01-27 20:05:58 -0500] schisamo: working on organizing the GH issues a little.
[2013-01-27 20:06:17 -0500] schisamo: I have a bunch to get entered two based on some jamie usage/hacking this weekend.
[2013-01-27 20:06:58 -0500] reset: any idea when the 'jamie' branch will pop up in test-ktichen?
[2013-01-27 20:07:16 -0500] reset: I saw the issues that jtimberman entered and was going to start to dig in
[2013-01-27 20:07:19 -0500] reset: but didn't have anywhere to start
[2013-01-27 20:09:03 -0500] schisamo: fnichol: ^^ ???  :)
[2013-01-27 20:10:16 -0500] schisamo: reset: I think we need to do some triage as a group on the tickets/features we all enter just to ensure we focus on a MVP for the 1.0 release.
[2013-01-27 20:13:41 -0500] reset: yeah, that would be helpful
[2013-01-27 20:14:02 -0500] reset: i'll go through and weigh in what I think
[2013-01-27 20:14:56 -0500] schisamo: yeah ima add some comments to tickets jtimberman created and try to get my new ones in today.
[2013-01-27 21:26:50 -0500] kisoku: schisamo: where is this work visible ? Which fork on githu has all of these features ?
[2013-01-27 21:30:55 -0500] schisamo: kisoku: we are in the process of moving fnichol 's jamie project into test-kitchen
[2013-01-27 21:31:01 -0500] kisoku: ah
[2013-01-27 21:31:04 -0500] schisamo: think of when merb merged into rails
[2013-01-27 21:31:06 -0500] schisamo: :)
[2013-01-27 21:31:15 -0500] kisoku: I will go take a look at that
[2013-01-27 21:32:35 -0500] kisoku: are you guys going to be pushing your branches publically so we can read what's going on ?
[2013-01-27 21:33:02 -0500] schisamo: kisoku: yes. nothing is private ATM.
[2013-01-27 21:33:24 -0500] schisamo: you should see a new branch of test-kitchen pop up this week as stuff begins getting ported in.
[2013-01-27 21:33:52 -0500] schisamo: kisoku: the existing jamie code lives at https://github.com/jamie-ci/jamie
[2013-01-27 21:35:15 -0500] schisamo: kisoku: jtimberman also made a brief announcement on Friday http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef-dev/2013-01/msg00038.html

[2013-01-27 21:36:15 -0500] kisoku: yeah I literally just started hacking on somethinglast night, so i wasn't exactly up to speed with the current state of test-kitchen

[2013-01-27 21:40:52 -0500] fnichol: schisamo, jtimberman, reset, kisoku: I'm hoping to get a branch on test-kitchen tomorrow or failing that tuesday. the only thing that was hanging me up was a couple of last minute commits into jamie-ci/jamie
[2013-01-27 21:41:16 -0500] schisamo: fnichol: w00t!
[2013-01-27 21:46:04 -0500] fnichol: schisamo: worked with miketheman Friday night to get some Ruby style commits in and start of aruba testing for the CLI
[2013-01-27 21:46:27 -0500] schisamo: hawt
[2013-01-27 21:52:09 -0500] fnichol: and i banged out some more spec coverge. i originally planned on full spec coverage before i bugged opscode with it :) we'll get there though, that was a project goal originally
