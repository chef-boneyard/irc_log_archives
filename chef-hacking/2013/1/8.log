[2013-01-08 02:36:39 -0500] jtimberman: but, support@opscode.com?
[2013-01-08 02:42:39 -0500] fujin: jtimberman: ticket or email?

[2013-01-08 02:45:22 -0500] jtimberman: fujin: I believe emailing that address opens a ticket anyway..
[2013-01-08 02:45:51 -0500] fujin:  sick
[2013-01-08 02:45:52 -0500] fujin: thx
[2013-01-08 02:46:36 -0500] jtimberman: fujin: dunno if anyone's about tho, but i believe there were some errors from S3 recentlyish. saw some in my own org this AM
[2013-01-08 02:46:42 -0500] jtimberman: totally nonscientific correlation.
[2013-01-08 02:47:03 -0500] fujin: hmm
[2013-01-08 02:47:07 -0500] fujin: this is weird, temperamental anyway

[2013-01-08 03:00:21 -0500] jtimberman: o ok
[2013-01-08 03:02:29 -0500] paulmooring: fujin: you still around?
[2013-01-08 03:04:42 -0500] fujin:  yes
[2013-01-08 03:04:45 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: sup mate
[2013-01-08 03:05:11 -0500] paulmooring: We noticed that issue late last week, still working on a fix but it's related to a large number of files in a single cookbook
[2013-01-08 03:05:35 -0500] paulmooring: large being 200+ when I tested it which isn't really *that* large
[2013-01-08 03:06:02 -0500] fujin: hmm
[2013-01-08 03:07:04 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: What' kind of files, you mean, files for cookbook_file distribution? OR anything, recipes. libraries, etc/
[2013-01-08 03:07:48 -0500] paulmooring: we're still looking into the exact cause but it looks like any files libraries recipes ect.
[2013-01-08 03:08:24 -0500] paulmooring: like I recreated it by putting 300 1 line library files in a cookbook an uploading
[2013-01-08 03:09:34 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: all cookbooks, sorted by name, with # of 'any files (find predicate -f)'   # #
[2013-01-08 03:09:35 -0500] fujin:   # # File { owner => 0, group => 0, mode => 0644 }
[2013-01-08 03:09:35 -0500] fujin:   # #
[2013-01-08 03:09:35 -0500] fujin:   # # file { '/etc/motd':

[2013-01-08 03:10:15 -0500] fujin: well fuck me
[2013-01-08 03:10:20 -0500] fujin: hope I killed that fast enough, y'all get flooded?
[2013-01-08 03:10:31 -0500] paulmooring: not too bad fujin
[2013-01-08 03:10:35 -0500] paulmooring: like 5 lines
[2013-01-08 03:10:35 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: cookbooks, by name, with find -type f predicate for each showing #files. https://gist.github.com/d61a5901b3231a6f8234
[2013-01-08 03:12:09 -0500] paulmooring: fujin are all your cookbooks doing it or only select ones?
[2013-01-08 03:12:48 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: the org is empty, I'm trying to upload everything
[2013-01-08 03:12:54 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: yum was triggering it quite often?
[2013-01-08 03:13:18 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: is there are error visible presented from S3 back to the sandbox API I wonder?
[2013-01-08 03:13:36 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: ya just tried yum cookbook and started happening straight away.
[2013-01-08 03:14:00 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: https://gist.github.com/995ca06c7c2f90a5731c
[2013-01-08 03:14:15 -0500] paulmooring: hmmm mind trying a few other 1-off uploads to see if it's global?
[2013-01-08 03:15:17 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: just tried 'redis' --include-dependencies (apt) and failed straight away
[2013-01-08 03:15:18 -0500] fujin: logs inc
[2013-01-08 03:15:40 -0500] paulmooring: this might be something different
[2013-01-08 03:15:45 -0500] paulmooring: what's the org name?
[2013-01-08 03:16:00 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: sweetspot-heavywater
[2013-01-08 03:16:03 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: https://gist.github.com/f758332d74a6888868a2
[2013-01-08 03:16:06 -0500] paulmooring: if you don't want that in IRC we can take this elsewhere
[2013-01-08 03:16:18 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: idc this is lowest rung org
[2013-01-08 03:16:45 -0500] paulmooring: fujin: I'm gonna check out our logs which might take a while, I'll grab that support ticket and update you there
[2013-01-08 03:16:50 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: thanks man
[2013-01-08 03:19:29 -0500] paulmooring: fujin: one more thing, sometimes doing a purge/delete fixes upload errors
[2013-01-08 03:19:41 -0500] paulmooring: knife cookbook delete apache2 -yap
[2013-01-08 03:19:43 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: as I mentioned this org is entirely clean, I purged everything earlier which is what shored this up :(
[2013-01-08 03:19:48 -0500] paulmooring: knife cookbook upload apache2
[2013-01-08 03:19:59 -0500] fujin: I'd just finished running a 'knife cookbook bulk delete ".*" -yp' yes/purge
[2013-01-08 03:20:05 -0500] paulmooring: oh, you had stuff in there and purged everything
[2013-01-08 03:20:08 -0500] fujin: Indeed
[2013-01-08 03:20:27 -0500] fujin: We reguarly knock out this org as lowest rung in our test workflow
[2013-01-08 03:20:39 -0500] fujin: before promoting upward to qa, staging, then eventually prod

[2013-01-08 18:38:58 -0500] rodrigda: hey guys I have a question
[2013-01-08 18:39:27 -0500] rodrigda: I have been working with chef for a bit now but I am seeing something interesting that I can't figure out and it has to do with attributes
[2013-01-08 18:40:19 -0500] rodrigda: I have two attributes that are defined in the default attributes file and than I am overriding them with a role
[2013-01-08 18:41:14 -0500] rodrigda: When I run my recipe on the server the attribute isn't set.  I am trying to use that attribute value in a template file and I am passing the variable over but I am not seeing come threw.  I get a nil
[2013-01-08 18:56:52 -0500] rodrigda: any thoughts

[2013-01-08 21:27:35 -0500] fujin: yo
[2013-01-08 21:27:38 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: wassup man, around?
[2013-01-08 21:27:55 -0500] paulmooring: I am
[2013-01-08 21:30:48 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: any update on that issue, I just gave it another try and still plaguing that env?
[2013-01-08 21:30:55 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: can we nuke the org and recreate it or something?
[2013-01-08 21:31:40 -0500] paulmooring: fujin we're working on the issue right now, but if it's better for you to nuke the org to get going right now I can work that out too
[2013-01-08 21:32:35 -0500] fujin: paulmooring: if you can swing it, let's make it happen. I can reprovision everything as soon as it is back online if it is something you think will be resolved by a full nuke & re-create.
