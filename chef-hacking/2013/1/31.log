[2013-01-31 20:00:38 -0500] sn0wb1rd: Does anybody here know a way to dynamically update a resource's attribute? I have a method of doing it here: https://gist.github.com/4659646 But it seems to be overly complicated and wanted to see anybody have any simpler way.
[2013-01-31 21:46:03 -0500] spheromak: yea opening up th ecollection and twiddling hte instance there is the only way i've done it before
[2013-01-31 21:47:22 -0500] spheromak: sn0wb1rd: what are you doing that you ned to redefine that content ?
[2013-01-31 21:48:09 -0500] spheromak: you can also just do  file_r.run
[2013-01-31 21:48:31 -0500] spheromak: in your block, and that should make it happen. or you can have a delayed notification on that file.
[2013-01-31 21:48:44 -0500] sn0wb1rd: Yeah.. that code looks good and works fine. But it is a little complicated if someone who is new to Chef tries to read and understand.
[2013-01-31 21:48:46 -0500] spheromak: so it will write out at the end
[2013-01-31 21:48:55 -0500] spheromak: well what your dong isn't well handeled
[2013-01-31 21:49:02 -0500] spheromak: i mean you can redefine the resource straight up
[2013-01-31 21:49:04 -0500] spheromak: with new content
[2013-01-31 21:49:06 -0500] spheromak: if you want
[2013-01-31 21:49:20 -0500] sn0wb1rd: That was just an example.
[2013-01-31 21:49:28 -0500] spheromak: i've only had to do what your doing when writing providers/lwrps.
[2013-01-31 21:50:21 -0500] sn0wb1rd: I see. okay, no problem then.
[2013-01-31 21:50:22 -0500] spheromak: yea the compile time eval is because of the block tho in this case right.
[2013-01-31 21:51:52 -0500] spheromak: really at convergance its always dynamic it just takes the last set value you're forcing that resource to be created at compile with the ruby block. why i was asking what the goal was. seems a lil out of place. wondering if there was a specific reason for exploring it.
[2013-01-31 21:58:43 -0500] sn0wb1rd: My use case is: I download a compressed file (step1) and detect the filetype and set the extension based on the type and this filename is used in another resource (step 2)
[2013-01-31 21:59:00 -0500] sn0wb1rd: So I don't want to download the file in compile phase.
[2013-01-31 21:59:13 -0500] sn0wb1rd: I need to send in the filename with the extension to the resource I'm using in step 2.
[2013-01-31 21:59:41 -0500] sn0wb1rd: So I dynamically update the filename in converge.
[2013-01-31 21:59:46 -0500] sn0wb1rd: Am I clear
[2013-01-31 21:59:47 -0500] sn0wb1rd: ?
[2013-01-31 22:07:56 -0500] spheromak: so you don't know the filename ahead of time ? you cant use a variable in your resorce declaration (step2 ) ?
[2013-01-31 22:08:20 -0500] spheromak: assuming its in the same recipe scope (or you could just write a helper lib for this?)
[2013-01-31 22:09:25 -0500] spheromak: or i guess your downloading the file and such in a block right now. which is causingyour issue ?
