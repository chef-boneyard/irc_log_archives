[2013-01-20 20:09:34 -0500] sascha_d: Can someone tell me what the opposite of must_exist would be with chef minitest? Is it wont_be?
[2013-01-20 20:17:04 -0500] sascha_d: nvm, I finally found the wont_exist
[2013-01-20 20:17:05 -0500] sascha_d: phew
[2013-01-20 22:55:11 -0500] fnichol: sascha_d: that's right, in minitest spec style you'll usually have must_* for positive assertions and wont_* for the negatives. In the test unit style postive is assert_* and negative is refute_*.

[2013-01-20 22:58:05 -0500] sascha_d: and it's not very reliable for letting me know what i can do
[2013-01-20 22:58:08 -0500] sascha_d: I had to resort to pry
