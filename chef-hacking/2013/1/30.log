[2013-01-30 05:42:13 -0500] BryanWB__: ohai chefs
[2013-01-30 05:42:14 -0500] BryanWB__: !
[2013-01-30 05:42:20 -0500] jtimberman: ohai!!
[2013-01-30 05:42:42 -0500] BryanWB__: hope i can spend most of today working w/ test-kitchen-NG
[2013-01-30 05:42:53 -0500] jtimberman: BryanWB__: :D
[2013-01-30 05:43:07 -0500] jtimberman: did you see my gist for a converter?
[2013-01-30 05:43:20 -0500] jtimberman: https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen/issues/19
[2013-01-30 05:43:24 -0500] fnichol: BryanWB__: hey! great!
[2013-01-30 05:43:51 -0500] BryanWB__: fnichol: hey buddy :)  any parts of the code i should avoid playing w/? as they are in too much flux?
[2013-01-30 05:44:17 -0500] c_t: I really ought to get up to speed on test-kitchen
[2013-01-30 05:44:38 -0500] jtimberman: BryanWB__: the vagrant driver appears to be working now
[2013-01-30 05:46:25 -0500] BryanWB__: awesome
[2013-01-30 05:46:51 -0500] fnichol: BryanWB__: that's right, vagrant looks to be going again with its name change. we'll probably be combining -ec2 and -bluebox into a kitchen-fog gem that'll contain both drivers and more as they get developed.
[2013-01-30 05:47:35 -0500] fnichol: the jamie-* codebases are still there and still working but i suspect the test-kitchen/1.0 branch will start to diverge in the next few days
[2013-01-30 05:48:18 -0500] fnichol: BryanWB__: what day was your talk again? hopefully we can leave you with something stable a demoable :) if it's still too crzay i'm happy to help with some Gemfile lock downs
[2013-01-30 05:48:51 -0500] BryanWB__: fnichol: it doesn't have to be demoable, i just have to get a clear idea of how it works to convey it to others
[2013-01-30 05:48:56 -0500] fnichol: c_t: hopefully we'll be getting some real documentation coming along soon which will help.
[2013-01-30 05:49:30 -0500] c_t: fnichol: I've been pretty busy as of late (but much of that neck deep in chef goodies)
[2013-01-30 05:49:31 -0500] fnichol: BryanWB__: even better! cause i can always help with handwaving and wild speculation :)
[2013-01-30 05:49:41 -0500] c_t: but being able to test cookbooks seems rather useful
[2013-01-30 05:49:42 -0500] BryanWB__: fnichol: the committee for fosdem chose my talk cuz they wanted to learn how they could apply integration testing as done w/ chef to puppet, cfengine, and others
[2013-01-30 05:49:51 -0500] c_t: testing beyond "well, let's deploy and see what happens"
[2013-01-30 05:50:10 -0500] fnichol: c_t: which is how so many of us develop currently, i'd bet
[2013-01-30 05:50:33 -0500] jtimberman: i totally test things!
[2013-01-30 05:50:38 -0500] jtimberman: in a vm
[2013-01-30 05:50:39 -0500] fnichol: BryanWB__: that's great, cause i suspect everyone is struggling with this right now
[2013-01-30 05:50:40 -0500] jtimberman: ;)
[2013-01-30 05:50:42 -0500] fnichol: haha
[2013-01-30 05:51:28 -0500] c_t: TEST IT ON PRODUCTION OR DON'T DO IT AT ALL
[2013-01-30 05:51:30 -0500] c_t: *ahem*
[2013-01-30 05:52:21 -0500] jtimberman: BryanWB__: vagrant's pretty good i hear.
[2013-01-30 05:55:26 -0500] fnichol: BryanWB__: don't hesitate to ping me for quick skype call in the next few days if that's easier
[2013-01-30 05:56:02 -0500] BryanWB__: fnichol: i'll let u know, and i'll send u my slides for review if u don't mind
[2013-01-30 05:56:24 -0500] fnichol: BryanWB__: no don't mind at all, flattered if anything :)

[2013-01-30 07:10:51 -0500] lnxchk: lol

[2013-01-30 07:11:58 -0500] jtimberman: cheers
[2013-01-30 13:28:20 -0500] BryanWB__: do i have to submit a ticket in jira for kitchen-vagrant?
[2013-01-30 13:56:06 -0500] BryanWB__: submitted http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KITCHEN-68#comment-31841
[2013-01-30 15:14:57 -0500] fnichol: BryanWB__: sweet, reading now
[2013-01-30 15:15:16 -0500] BryanWB__: fnichol: argh but for reason it's not working now 30 mins later
[2013-01-30 15:17:10 -0500] fnichol: BryanWB__: that's okay, it's still worth a look. Chris Lundquist added support for a :customize subhash. anything that would be passed down to VirtualBox is supported: https://github.com/opscode/kitchen-vagrant/blob/master/lib/kitchen/driver/vagrant.rb#L30
[2013-01-30 15:17:35 -0500] BryanWB__: fnichol: afaict the network type can't be changed w/ it
[2013-01-30 15:17:59 -0500] BryanWB__: or i could be wrong, spent around 60mins trying to find the right options w/ no luck
[2013-01-30 15:18:29 -0500] fnichol: BryanWB__: i bet you're right there, we'd need something different to get access to forward_port
[2013-01-30 15:23:55 -0500] BryanWB__: fnichol: now it works again, odd
[2013-01-30 15:24:44 -0500] fnichol: BryanWB__: so from what I gather you'd like access to vm.forward_port and vm.network?
[2013-01-30 15:24:55 -0500] BryanWB__: fnichol: yup
[2013-01-30 15:25:04 -0500] BryanWB__: fnichol: so that the nodes can communicate
[2013-01-30 15:26:01 -0500] BryanWB__: fnichol: and so that i have at least one way to communicate w/ them to run and integration test from outside any of the nodes
[2013-01-30 15:43:00 -0500] jtimberman: BryanWB__: we're using GH issues on test-kitchen until 1.0
[2013-01-30 15:43:43 -0500] BryanWB__: jtimberman: weird, i looked and didtn' see them, perhaps i was looking at kitchen-vagrant
[2013-01-30 15:43:44 -0500] jtimberman: BryanWB__: can you not customize the Vagrantfile?
[2013-01-30 15:44:09 -0500] BryanWB__: jtimberman: i could, tho this is per node that i want to create
[2013-01-30 15:44:13 -0500] jtimberman: oh - yeah.. uh, dunno which is going to be easier to manage - fnichol?
[2013-01-30 15:44:19 -0500] BryanWB__: jtimberman: also this feature is almost there now w/ customize
[2013-01-30 15:44:25 -0500] jtimberman: ah
[2013-01-30 15:44:36 -0500] jtimberman: is customize a hash put into the yml?
[2013-01-30 15:44:41 -0500] BryanWB__: yup
[2013-01-30 15:45:15 -0500] jtimberman: word
[2013-01-30 15:45:20 -0500] jtimberman: i can dig it
[2013-01-30 16:16:45 -0500] BryanWB__: fml, a reboot fixed my vbox issues
[2013-01-30 16:19:12 -0500] jtimberman: BryanWB__: Been there :-|
[2013-01-30 16:28:22 -0500] BryanWB__: can centos 6.3 run w/ only 256 of ram?
[2013-01-30 16:28:28 -0500] BryanWB__: gosh i hope so
[2013-01-30 16:28:52 -0500] jtimberman: can anything?
[2013-01-30 16:29:29 -0500] fnichol: BryanWB__: good question, so far it's working for me but no way for anything running a jvm
[2013-01-30 16:31:56 -0500] BryanWB__: it worked! my preso is saved
[2013-01-30 17:15:39 -0500] jtimberman: thoughts? https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen/issues/40
[2013-01-30 17:26:26 -0500] c_t: hmmm
[2013-01-30 18:52:41 -0500] miketheman: is the status.opscode.com hosted via tumblr?
[2013-01-30 19:02:06 -0500] jtimberman: miketheman: yes
[2013-01-30 19:02:14 -0500] miketheman: thanks
[2013-01-30 19:22:23 -0500] BryanWB: sethvargo, congrats!
[2013-01-30 19:22:39 -0500] sethvargo: BryanWB - thanks!
[2013-01-30 19:28:03 -0500] BryanWB: sethvargo, have a few mins?
[2013-01-30 19:28:55 -0500] sethvargo: For Skype?
[2013-01-30 19:29:26 -0500] BryanWB: no, irc
[2013-01-30 19:29:46 -0500] BryanWB: sethvargo, i am doing something to jamie/test-kitchen that it wasn't intended to https://github.com/bryanwb/tk-demo/blob/master/.kitchen.yml
[2013-01-30 19:29:48 -0500] sethvargo: sure, whats up?
[2013-01-30 19:30:17 -0500] BryanWB: and am curious how i could extend jamie-tk to meet it
[2013-01-30 19:30:50 -0500] BryanWB: am trying to do multi-vm integration tests, and the platforms stanza adds a lot of confusion
[2013-01-30 19:31:19 -0500] miah: i think the haproxy or whatever on hosted api neeeds some queue adjustments
[2013-01-30 19:31:24 -0500] miketheman: BryanWB: somewhat not the intention
[2013-01-30 19:31:37 -0500] BryanWB: miketheman, but it is my need :)
[2013-01-30 19:31:47 -0500] BryanWB: and for others
[2013-01-30 19:32:03 -0500] miketheman: sure - I understand the need, I have it as well
[2013-01-30 19:32:20 -0500] sethvargo: lol jamie-tk
[2013-01-30 19:32:36 -0500] jtimberman: miah: we use nginx :)
[2013-01-30 19:32:44 -0500] miah: ok. well..
[2013-01-30 19:32:49 -0500] sethvargo: so are you trying to spin up multiple vms for a single test?
[2013-01-30 19:32:51 -0500] miah: api timeouts. every day
[2013-01-30 19:32:56 -0500] jtimberman: miah: :-|
[2013-01-30 19:33:19 -0500] BryanWB: sethvargo, yup, w/ communication b/w
[2013-01-30 19:33:40 -0500] BryanWB: by having on common subnet, apache => load_balancer => app
[2013-01-30 19:33:52 -0500] sethvargo: hmmm. I think it's possible, but I haven't had it yet succeed :(
[2013-01-30 19:33:55 -0500] schisamo: sethvargo: BryanWB you might want to chat with reset ...he is working on multi-vm stuff with tk/jamie already.
[2013-01-30 19:34:02 -0500] sethvargo: fnichol: might know better
[2013-01-30 19:34:07 -0500] sethvargo: or reset
[2013-01-30 19:34:10 -0500] BryanWB: schisamo, neat
[2013-01-30 19:34:20 -0500] miah: https://gist.github.com/c74ab98da82c3f7e8587
[2013-01-30 19:34:23 -0500] sethvargo: I've been working mostly with single-vagrant and ec2 stuffs
[2013-01-30 19:35:12 -0500] jtimberman: miah: (sadpanda)
[2013-01-30 19:35:16 -0500] miah: i can open a ticket.. but looking at status site its obvious api queuing issues have been around and known for a while
[2013-01-30 19:35:31 -0500] miah: many #hugops in your direction
[2013-01-30 19:36:20 -0500] miah: seems like if youre getting badgateway that whatever your forwarding to is denying connections as its full and maybe nginx isnt detecting that properly or the queues aren't equal on your lb vs your app
[2013-01-30 19:36:44 -0500] miah: i tried using nginx to lb a bunch.. it has fun issues.
[2013-01-30 19:42:33 -0500] miah: yay cooks uploaded
[2013-01-30 19:45:05 -0500] jtimberman: yey
[2013-01-30 19:49:41 -0500] miah: one of those days where im wishing i wasnt the only ops
[2013-01-30 19:50:10 -0500] jtimberman: I don't understand why companies don't hire operations people in pairs.
[2013-01-30 19:50:26 -0500] whilp: because hiring is hard ;)
[2013-01-30 19:50:53 -0500] jtimberman: whilp: i'd argue that it's still not common, they don't see the position as requiring multiple people :/
[2013-01-30 19:51:30 -0500] whilp: ah, for sure -- it's not healthy to have ops < 2
[2013-01-30 19:51:37 -0500] whilp: we have three, and that's about as low as i think we could go
[2013-01-30 19:51:45 -0500] miketheman: I vote for at least 3, then you have quorom
[2013-01-30 19:51:54 -0500] miketheman: we could call such teams 'zookeepers"
[2013-01-30 19:52:31 -0500] miah: well. we did have another ops person
[2013-01-30 19:52:38 -0500] whilp: yeah :/
[2013-01-30 19:53:01 -0500] miah: that whole situation is a bit fubar and frustrating
[2013-01-30 19:53:20 -0500] miah: now my problem is that stupid ohai isn't providing a ec2 private_ip key
[2013-01-30 19:53:54 -0500] miah: ah
[2013-01-30 19:53:58 -0500] miah: broken code is broken
[2013-01-30 19:54:33 -0500] miah: did it change from private_ipv4 to local_ipv4 or what?
[2013-01-30 19:56:36 -0500] miketheman: secret arcane stuff
[2013-01-30 19:56:58 -0500] miah: apparently
[2013-01-30 19:57:14 -0500] miah: owell. bug found, code changed, testing fix.
[2013-01-30 19:57:21 -0500] miah: such is life
[2013-01-30 20:18:54 -0500] BryanWB: the suite + platforms stanzas don't really fit integration testing
[2013-01-30 20:20:15 -0500] BryanWB: if i could just have a nodes stanza in .kitchen.yml that jamie-tk cud consume like it does suite+platform
[2013-01-30 22:41:19 -0500] spheromak: bradgignac: "cluster" :)
[2013-01-30 22:41:40 -0500] spheromak: woa.. BryanWB was the intent there
