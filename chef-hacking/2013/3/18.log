[2013-03-18 08:48:44 -0400] st0ne2thedge: Hello all, any resource i can use to learn how to use testkitchen to run the proper tests? looking for the right way to do it ^^
[2013-03-18 08:56:38 -0400] st0ne2thedge: The documentation isn't really straightforward about it :D
[2013-03-18 08:57:08 -0400] st0ne2thedge: i am talking about version 1.0 btw
[2013-03-18 09:27:28 -0400] clundquist: st0ne2thedge: sure
[2013-03-18 09:27:39 -0400] clundquist: I have some examples
[2013-03-18 09:28:29 -0400] clundquist: https://github.com/miah/chef-redis/tree/master/test/integration
[2013-03-18 09:29:29 -0400] clundquist: https://github.com/bbg-cookbooks/openvz/blob/master/test/integration/default/bats/default.bats
[2013-03-18 09:32:59 -0400] clundquist: st0ne2thedge: jamie the precursor to test-kitchen 1.0
[2013-03-18 09:33:07 -0400] clundquist: fwiw
[2013-03-18 09:38:20 -0400] st0ne2thedge: clundquist: Thank you, I'll look into them right now!
[2013-03-18 09:42:26 -0400] st0ne2thedge: so test-kitchen 1.0 would use the same methods to include testing?
[2013-03-18 09:42:38 -0400] st0ne2thedge: as the jamie project?
[2013-03-18 09:55:47 -0400] st0ne2thedge: So if I would like to run integration tests, I'd only need to put those into the ./test/integration/ folder?
[2013-03-18 10:34:21 -0400] clundquist: st0ne2thedge: yeah they look in test/integration/<plugin>
[2013-03-18 10:34:57 -0400] clundquist: https://github.com/opscode/
[2013-03-18 10:35:08 -0400] clundquist: kb-* repos there
[2013-03-18 10:35:19 -0400] clundquist: bats, minitest, bash, and shunit2
[2013-03-18 10:36:29 -0400] clundquist: test kitchen 1.0 can use a variety of backends, basically anything Vagrant can use, and anything Fog can use
[2013-03-18 10:36:43 -0400] clundquist: you can specify api credentials or what not in kitchen.local.yml
[2013-03-18 10:36:55 -0400] clundquist: which will override merge with kitchen.yml
[2013-03-18 10:41:55 -0400] clundquist: test-kitchen 1.0 can also beabused? to do infrastructure integration testing as well
[2013-03-18 10:42:11 -0400] clundquist: originally it was designed for cookbook testing
[2013-03-18 10:42:22 -0400] clundquist: but I added role support since data_bag support was there
[2013-03-18 10:43:36 -0400] clundquist: the above can be used with knife solo to make a pretty sweet set up which is what we do at bluebox
[2013-03-18 10:46:18 -0400] st0ne2thedge: me and rapsey created a xen driver, trying to make a stable project where we run some tests
[2013-03-18 10:46:34 -0400] st0ne2thedge: so we can start making it faster and more reliable
[2013-03-18 10:46:43 -0400] clundquist: the is an LXC driver
[2013-03-18 10:46:47 -0400] clundquist: by sean porter I believe
[2013-03-18 10:46:50 -0400] clundquist: but that is container based
[2013-03-18 10:47:11 -0400] clundquist: https://github.com/portertech/kitchen-lxc
[2013-03-18 10:47:30 -0400] clundquist: might be at least a useful reference
[2013-03-18 10:47:49 -0400] rapsey: we've used it as an example for our driver
[2013-03-18 10:47:53 -0400] st0ne2thedge: I remember looking into the code of that repository indeed
[2013-03-18 10:48:03 -0400] clundquist: step ahead then :)
[2013-03-18 10:48:17 -0400] clundquist: anywhere in particular I can help with?
[2013-03-18 10:48:48 -0400] clundquist: on a tangent, did you use libvirt for kvm support as well?
[2013-03-18 10:50:35 -0400] rapsey: not yet, but we intend to rewrite the driver entirely
[2013-03-18 10:50:45 -0400] rapsey: right now all it does is give commands over SSH :$
[2013-03-18 10:50:47 -0400] clundquist: fair enough, step one, make it work :)
[2013-03-18 10:50:53 -0400] st0ne2thedge: jeap :D
[2013-03-18 10:51:14 -0400] rapsey: but we've been having a hard time figuring out what is or is not supported in test kitchen 1.0
[2013-03-18 10:51:25 -0400] rapsey: especially when it comes to the actual tests
[2013-03-18 10:53:14 -0400] clundquist: driver just has to create and destroy instances I think
[2013-03-18 10:53:46 -0400] clundquist: "kb" short for Kitchen Busser, handles all the plugins and tests
[2013-03-18 10:53:47 -0400] rapsey: yes :P unrelated to the driver I mean
[2013-03-18 10:54:24 -0400] rapsey: figuring out how the drivers work was a lot easier than finding where to put the tests
[2013-03-18 10:54:42 -0400] clundquist: fair enough
[2013-03-18 10:54:52 -0400] clundquist: sounds like you should explore kb then
[2013-03-18 10:55:11 -0400] rapsey: definitely, thanks :)
[2013-03-18 10:55:20 -0400] clundquist: so far I think there are two, going on 4 plugin authors
[2013-03-18 10:55:26 -0400] clundquist: https://github.com/opscode/kb
[2013-03-18 10:56:05 -0400] clundquist: https://github.com/ChrisLundquist/chef-commando < you might care about the install section hack there, for at least a place to start
[2013-03-18 10:56:26 -0400] clundquist: currently fnichol is swapping kb to ruby
[2013-03-18 10:57:42 -0400] rapsey: but the functionality should remain the same?
[2013-03-18 10:57:47 -0400] clundquist: yeah
[2013-03-18 10:58:08 -0400] rapsey: ok, great
[2013-03-18 10:58:32 -0400] rapsey: does kb also do the other tests like foodcritic, rspec, cucumber etc?
[2013-03-18 10:59:35 -0400] clundquist: not yet
[2013-03-18 10:59:53 -0400] clundquist: basically all a plugin needs to do is return an exit code and run things in test/integration/<plugin>
[2013-03-18 11:00:06 -0400] clundquist: so wouldn't be hard to add
[2013-03-18 11:00:32 -0400] rapsey: so a kb plugin would be the correct place to implement this
[2013-03-18 11:01:01 -0400] clundquist: to add rspec and cucumber? yes, kb-rspec would be my go-to name
[2013-03-18 11:01:12 -0400] clundquist: foodcritic is a little trickier
[2013-03-18 11:01:26 -0400] clundquist: since it doesn't actually need different files to run
[2013-03-18 11:07:32 -0400] clundquist: up to anything else other than new drivers, and plugins? :)
[2013-03-18 11:12:37 -0400] rapsey: mostly just getting familiar with test kitchen and implementing functionality we need
[2013-03-18 11:12:45 -0400] rapsey: hopefully we'll be able to contribute
[2013-03-18 11:12:57 -0400] clundquist: looking forward to it, sounds promising
[2013-03-18 11:13:30 -0400] rapsey: are you one of the "core devs" behind the project?
[2013-03-18 11:14:10 -0400] clundquist: fnichol is, we work at the same place.
[2013-03-18 11:15:04 -0400] st0ne2thedge: clundquist: Seems like a nice project to be a part of
[2013-03-18 11:16:14 -0400] clundquist: yeah, we have high hopes for it, a xen driver and some new plugins would be nice additions
[2013-03-18 11:16:59 -0400] rapsey: st0ne and I are doing internship, it's our project to set up a fully automated testing environment
[2013-03-18 11:17:07 -0400] rapsey: so test kitchen is like a gift from above to us ;)
[2013-03-18 11:17:23 -0400] clundquist: I'm guessing you have looked at travis ci right
[2013-03-18 11:18:09 -0400] rapsey: we're using jenkins ci (for now)
[2013-03-18 11:18:29 -0400] clundquist: *nod*

[2013-03-18 14:44:34 -0400] st0ne2thedge: It seems I am unable to make test-kitchen 1.0 execute any tests, this time i tried placing a simple minitest (which should fail) into  ./test/integration/default/. The test is a file named test_apache2.rb, as this is the way I thought busser.rb looks for tests :D
[2013-03-18 15:44:33 -0400] gondoi: the default kitchen.yml file that is created has apt in the run list, and my metadata has 'apt' as a dep, but it's not being pulled in.. i don't see any deps being pulled in anywhere.
[2013-03-18 15:44:44 -0400] gondoi: is there something else I need to do?
[2013-03-18 15:47:53 -0400] jtimberman: gondoi: use berkshelf.
[2013-03-18 15:48:12 -0400] gondoi: how so though? just add a Berksfile and test-kitchen will see it and run it for me?
[2013-03-18 15:48:29 -0400] jtimberman: gondoi: create a Berksfile like this: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/logrotate/blob/master/Berksfile
[2013-03-18 15:48:47 -0400] jtimberman: this vagrantfile will do all the magical things: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/logrotate/blob/master/Vagrantfile
[2013-03-18 15:49:11 -0400] gondoi: so I need both then
[2013-03-18 15:49:12 -0400] gondoi: ?
[2013-03-18 15:49:35 -0400] gondoi: bit of a bike shed here, but would those not belong in the test dir?
[2013-03-18 15:55:10 -0400] gondoi: jtimberman: nvm on how.. i see that I need the requires too  :D
[2013-03-18 15:55:52 -0400] gondoi: jtimberman: how would that work with ec2 or rackspace though?
[2013-03-18 16:02:11 -0400] miketheman: jtimberman: is the current version of berks still meant to include line #2?
[2013-03-18 16:02:23 -0400] miketheman: b ecause then you have to gem install berks && vagrant gem install berks...
[2013-03-18 16:02:28 -0400] miketheman: or something like that
[2013-03-18 16:02:44 -0400] miketheman: there were all sorts of confusing failure modes a little while ago

[2013-03-18 16:35:39 -0400] c_t: ohai and good morning, all
[2013-03-18 16:36:44 -0400] miketheman: hi
[2013-03-18 16:36:52 -0400] miketheman: curious if anyone else has this.
[2013-03-18 16:37:21 -0400] miketheman: run a `knife node show <somenode> -a block_device.sda` and see the 'size' field
[2013-03-18 16:37:34 -0400] miketheman: then run `knife node show <somenode> -a block_device.sda.size` and see the difference
[2013-03-18 16:38:54 -0400] miketheman: I consistently get a size: 7, which is the size of the list returned in block_device.sda
[2013-03-18 16:39:17 -0400] cwj: miketheman: hah
[2013-03-18 16:39:20 -0400] miketheman: is knife allowing me to execute ruby methods on the return value?
[2013-03-18 16:39:21 -0400] cwj: i seem to be seeing that also
[2013-03-18 16:39:50 -0400] cwj: try .count instead of .size, same result
[2013-03-18 16:40:00 -0400] miketheman: .class also intersting
[2013-03-18 16:40:14 -0400] miketheman: so it IS allowing non-dsl, ruby methods
[2013-03-18 16:40:26 -0400] miketheman: so anyhting that has a "size" sub-attribute is fucked.
[2013-03-18 16:40:28 -0400] cwj: sure looks that way
[2013-03-18 16:41:32 -0400] miketheman: heh. .inspect is now most awesome
[2013-03-18 16:43:36 -0400] hikeit: can't use the braces to find things (block_device['sda']['size']) i take it?
[2013-03-18 16:43:47 -0400] miketheman: cwj: what ver you on?
[2013-03-18 16:43:55 -0400] miketheman: hikeit: tried that, no go
[2013-03-18 16:44:04 -0400] cwj: miketheman: 10.22.0
[2013-03-18 16:44:22 -0400] miketheman: can ony one on 11.x confirm this as well? filing ticket
[2013-03-18 16:46:33 -0400] hikeit: $ knife node show sam-admin01.qa -a block_device.sda.size
[2013-03-18 16:46:33 -0400] hikeit: sam-admin01.qa:

[2013-03-18 17:07:04 -0400] spox: is there any reason the latest chef omnibus version isn't listed in the bucket contents?
[2013-03-18 17:44:24 -0400] miketheman: cwj, hikeit : http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4012

[2013-03-18 19:41:16 -0400] clundquist: any thoughts on minitest test-kitchen?
[2013-03-18 19:41:33 -0400] clundquist: re st0ne2edge
[2013-03-18 19:42:44 -0400] fnichol_: yes, if it's minitest-chef-handler you're looking to use, the best way to get started is ignore the kitchen busser (kb) plugins and, the minitest-chef-handler cookbook to your Berksfile/Cheffile, and add the recipe to your suite's run_list
[2013-03-18 19:43:13 -0400] fnichol_: that would give you functionality just like the original test-kitchen; chef does all the heavy lifting :)
[2013-03-18 19:43:24 -0400] clundquist: :/
[2013-03-18 19:43:26 -0400] miketheman: blech.
[2013-03-18 19:44:01 -0400] miketheman: fnichol_: tk1 needs a good "here's a good reference to follow for testing your cookbook with kb"
[2013-03-18 19:44:28 -0400] miketheman: and replace cookbook with "desired outcome of stack of cookbooks"
[2013-03-18 19:45:46 -0400] clundquist: testing a stack of cookbooks is the same deal
[2013-03-18 19:47:30 -0400] fnichol_: well i started work again on the docs site over the weekend, then circled back on a couple if `kitchen init` usability quirks
[2013-03-18 19:48:57 -0400] fnichol_: i've got 3 subtopics on testing "strategies" so far: 1) none (convergence only, and it's a legit option), 2) minitest chef handler, 3) use a test runner plugin with kitchen busser (kb)
[2013-03-18 19:50:16 -0400] jdsiegel: *cough*kb-shunit2*cough* ;)
[2013-03-18 19:50:27 -0400] fnichol_: if there's a silver lining, fully fleshed out docs are a prereq. for test-kitchen 1.0
[2013-03-18 19:50:39 -0400] fnichol_: ack, jdsiegel i owe you drinks now!
[2013-03-18 19:50:56 -0400] jdsiegel: haha
[2013-03-18 19:51:05 -0400] clundquist: we could push our docs repo and example repo. that would show a few nodes with mysql, nginx, unicorn, redis, etc
[2013-03-18 19:51:15 -0400] jdsiegel: fnichol_: scotch+hack night?
[2013-03-18 19:52:22 -0400] github-bawt: [omnibus-chef] danielsdeleo pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/YWun7A
[2013-03-18 19:52:22 -0400] github-bawt: omnibus-chef/master dc8613e danielsdeleo: Merge branch 'configurable-pkg-creds'
[2013-03-18 19:52:34 -0400] fnichol_: jdsiegel: now that i have you around here, interested in taking a look at a new implementation of kitchen busser? same problem its solving, except it's in Ruby :) there are a few reasons for this, one of which being that the runner plugins can be shipped as rubygems, solving the discovery/packaging/indexing issues
[2013-03-18 19:52:39 -0400] fnichol_: jdsiegel: good idea!
[2013-03-18 19:54:11 -0400] jdsiegel: fnichol_: sure! Is there something to look at?
[2013-03-18 19:55:38 -0400] fnichol_: jdsiegel: there sure is, currently in my account https://github.com/fnichol/kb-ruby . i'm sure we'll move it if/once this proves itself.
[2013-03-18 19:56:20 -0400] fnichol_: jdsiegel: at the moment, i drove out the `kb test` using the bash runner plugin which is here: https://github.com/fnichol/kb-bash-ruby
[2013-03-18 19:56:37 -0400] jdsiegel: ok, sweet
[2013-03-18 19:56:46 -0400] fnichol_: jdsiegel: turns out it's just as small as the shell-based solution: https://github.com/fnichol/kb-bash-ruby/blob/master/lib/kb/runner_plugin/bash.rb
[2013-03-18 19:56:49 -0400] jdsiegel: maybe I'll take a look when I'm done futzing with rails security patches. :)
[2013-03-18 19:57:08 -0400] fnichol_: gar, yes i saw those emails come in during my standup today
[2013-03-18 19:57:26 -0400] fnichol_: at least they are being caught, reported, and patched though
[2013-03-18 19:57:32 -0400] jdsiegel: yep
[2013-03-18 20:00:39 -0400] clundquist: https://github.com/fnichol/kb-ruby/blob/master/lib/kb/plugin.rb#L30 (runner_plugin) thank you
[2013-03-18 20:01:50 -0400] fnichol_: clundquist: thus leaving the door open for other kinds of plugins, if needed. and i know you have some in mind :)
[2013-03-18 20:02:12 -0400] clundquist: yep yep :)
[2013-03-18 20:02:37 -0400] fnichol_: clundquist: i'm thinking of the same install process, but maybe a "core" plugin gets require'd early so that its behavior is available
[2013-03-18 20:02:51 -0400] clundquist: makes sense
[2013-03-18 20:03:33 -0400] clundquist: most the things I could dream up were either in the "prepare_recipe.rb" phase or after verify
[2013-03-18 20:03:39 -0400] fnichol_: clundquist: i guess a responsible sol'n could be to have a couple of defined hook or callback locations for code to register themselves with
[2013-03-18 20:03:48 -0400] fnichol_: ah, good to know
[2013-03-18 20:04:27 -0400] clundquist: after verify I could only think of report handlers which you could do another way
[2013-03-18 20:05:34 -0400] clundquist: but there are things like foodcritic, tailor, code climate, that are running plugins that don't need files so you could do those at the end

[2013-03-18 20:38:18 -0400] clundquist: are nested LWRPs a good idea? if so, where is a good example?
[2013-03-18 20:39:08 -0400] cwj: clundquist: the application and application_* cookbooks are the only example i am aware of
[2013-03-18 20:40:09 -0400] clundquist: cwj: I have never used those cookbooks directly, is that pattern intuitive and easy to work with?
[2013-03-18 20:41:19 -0400] spox: clundquist: the usage is okay. extending/hacking is a bit clunky. i'm on the fence on if it would have been better to just have them be heavyweight resource/providers
[2013-03-18 20:41:38 -0400] cwj: i dont think i would describe it as intuitive, but moving to the application_python approach to deploying apps did enable me to throw away a bunch of code i was maintaining
[2013-03-18 20:42:08 -0400] clundquist: so really I am trying to make multiple redis instances with sentinel and replication sexy
[2013-03-18 20:42:30 -0400] spox: clundquist: hi! i'm making time this week to finally get to that branch :D
[2013-03-18 20:42:38 -0400] clundquist: and it feels like I can make one giant redis_instance lwrp that does it all
[2013-03-18 20:42:49 -0400] clundquist: or use a redis_sentinel nested lwrp
[2013-03-18 20:43:27 -0400] clundquist: spox == croberts?
[2013-03-18 20:43:30 -0400] spox: aye
[2013-03-18 20:43:35 -0400] clundquist: :)
[2013-03-18 20:44:28 -0400] spox: i think i would probably lean towards using real resource/providers over lwrps for nesting, just because i think it stays a little cleaner.
[2013-03-18 20:44:56 -0400] spox: but i've been having fun using multi lwrps, and letting them search for each other based on names.
[2013-03-18 20:46:27 -0400] spox: fnichol_: if you could provide me a cheat, i'm looking through t-k, and trying to see how the tests get run. are they always defined within the suite itself, or is anything implicitly provided?
[2013-03-18 20:47:05 -0400] clundquist: implicitly by suite
[2013-03-18 20:47:14 -0400] clundquist: test/kitchen/<suite>/<plugin>
[2013-03-18 20:47:20 -0400] clundquist: errr
[2013-03-18 20:47:22 -0400] clundquist: test/integration
[2013-03-18 20:48:32 -0400] spox: okay, so how do they get run then? based on driver? ssh would connect to node and run commands?
[2013-03-18 20:49:14 -0400] clundquist: t-k looks for those things, then uploads them to the remote by base64 encoding them, remote node installs kitchen-busser
[2013-03-18 20:49:38 -0400] clundquist: kitchen busser looks for what plugins are there, downloads those plugins, runs kb test
[2013-03-18 20:50:23 -0400] clundquist: kb test roughly does "plugins.each do |plugin| plugin.prepare! plugin.run! plugin.cleanup! end" except really it is bash
[2013-03-18 20:53:08 -0400] clundquist: but to really answer the last part of your question, yes, ssh.
[2013-03-18 20:54:02 -0400] clundquist: you can have a non-ssh driver, and then you have to implement the "how do I run command over there?" method iirc
[2013-03-18 20:54:51 -0400] spox: cool, thank you. that was what i was digging around for and was completely missing the busser.rb file
[2013-03-18 20:55:41 -0400] clundquist: yeah, busser.rb is the kitchen half, the half that runs on the local host, https://github.com/opscode/kb is the remote half
[2013-03-18 20:56:31 -0400] spox: yeah, perfect.
[2013-03-18 20:56:43 -0400] clundquist: what are you really trying to do?
[2013-03-18 20:56:58 -0400] spox: i want the test stuffs, minus the kitchen
[2013-03-18 20:57:49 -0400] clundquist: ah, I'll have to ponder that a bit
[2013-03-18 20:58:17 -0400] spox: i'm mostly just looking to stay consistent, and not duplicate bits if they are already there and reusable
[2013-03-18 20:59:38 -0400] clundquist: *nod* most the bits feel pretty reusable to me, but the details are what really determine that. keep in mind, as you probably saw earlier, fnichol is working on a ruby version of kb.
[2013-03-18 21:03:18 -0400] spox: yeah, but for the local host side, things should be mostly indifferent about that i would think
[2013-03-18 21:05:19 -0400] clundquist: yep yep, just didn't want you to pull request the bash side to have it be a moving target

[2013-03-18 22:26:54 -0400] github-bawt: chef/file-refactor 1f8f019 Lamont Granquist: windows needs an explicit close before unlink
[2013-03-18 22:46:20 -0400] gondoi: Has anyone used build essentials and compile time with test kitchen 1.0?
[2013-03-18 22:46:52 -0400] clundquist: I have used it to build redis from source if that is what you mean
[2013-03-18 22:47:12 -0400] clundquist: https://github.com/miah/chef-redis/blob/master/.jamie.yml#L49-L57
[2013-03-18 22:49:04 -0400] clundquist: likewise with the nodejs recipe and nginx passenger recipe
[2013-03-18 22:49:09 -0400] gondoi: Hmm I don't see compile time in there
[2013-03-18 22:49:44 -0400] clundquist: I guess I am not familiar with what you mean by compile time, is it another cookbook? link?
[2013-03-18 22:51:16 -0400] gondoi: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/build-essential
[2013-03-18 22:51:20 -0400] clundquist: I was thinking you meant ./configure , make, gcc and all that getting called when you said compile time
[2013-03-18 22:51:32 -0400] gondoi: The compiletime attribute
[2013-03-18 22:51:46 -0400] gondoi: Sorry. I
[2013-03-18 22:52:07 -0400] gondoi: On my phone so auto complete is killing me
[2013-03-18 22:52:51 -0400] clundquist: no I haven't played with that attribute, I've always just done cookbook dependencies, but I could see where that might not work
[2013-03-18 22:53:19 -0400] clundquist: does it seem to be behaving differently in test kitchen?
[2013-03-18 22:58:04 -0400] gondoi: Yeah it appears the attribute is not populating correctly
[2013-03-18 22:58:21 -0400] clundquist: how are you setting it?
[2013-03-18 22:58:59 -0400] gondoi: I need to play with the yaml syntax some more. But thought I'd ask while I had some time here with no computer
[2013-03-18 22:59:33 -0400] gondoi: In the attributes section   let me try to gist
[2013-03-18 22:59:33 -0400] clundquist: you can override it in two places in kichen.yml
[2013-03-18 22:59:38 -0400] clundquist: in the platform or suite
[2013-03-18 22:59:52 -0400] gondoi: Mine is at the bottom in the suite
[2013-03-18 23:00:09 -0400] clundquist: should be under the attributes key in the suite
[2013-03-18 23:28:09 -0400] gondoi: clundquist: here is what I have https://gist.github.com/gondoi/5191945
[2013-03-18 23:28:20 -0400] gondoi: running the test again to get the error to go along with it
[2013-03-18 23:28:40 -0400] clundquist: is that under a suite?
[2013-03-18 23:30:51 -0400] gondoi: clundquist: okay refresh it
[2013-03-18 23:30:53 -0400] gondoi: that's what i have
[2013-03-18 23:31:17 -0400] clundquist: doesn't the dash on line 7 make it an array?
[2013-03-18 23:32:09 -0400] gondoi: hrm.. i think so, but i was going off of the example in the docs
[2013-03-18 23:32:11 -0400] gondoi: i'll try without
[2013-03-18 23:32:13 -0400] gondoi: makes sense
[2013-03-18 23:37:44 -0400] gondoi: clundquist: I got past that error.. :D thanks we'll see how far it gets this time
[2013-03-18 23:37:52 -0400] clundquist: sure thing
[2013-03-18 23:38:42 -0400] clundquist: I am unofficial test-kitchen 1.0 resource :_
[2013-03-18 23:40:34 -0400] gondoi: you seen any way to simulate data bags in the code?
[2013-03-18 23:41:05 -0400] clundquist: we have support
[2013-03-18 23:41:15 -0400] clundquist: with varying levels of precedence
[2013-03-18 23:42:08 -0400] gondoi: is it defined in the yaml file as well?
[2013-03-18 23:42:11 -0400] clundquist: we honor, in this order, "test/integration/<suite>/<plugin>/data_bags, test/integration/<suite/data_bags, test/integration/data_bags, ./data_bags
[2013-03-18 23:42:19 -0400] clundquist: likewise with roles
[2013-03-18 23:42:46 -0400] clundquist: https://github.com/miah/chef-redis/tree/master/test/integration < contrete example
[2013-03-18 23:43:07 -0400] clundquist: there is a "data_bag" recipe which uses the "data_bags" folder.
[2013-03-18 23:43:42 -0400] gondoi: ahhh
[2013-03-18 23:45:23 -0400] clundquist: by leveraging the above, you can do integration testing on clusters that use roles, data_bags, and multiple cookbooks
[2013-03-18 23:56:43 -0400] gondoi: very cool, i'll need that for some of the cookbooks i'm writing
[2013-03-18 23:56:58 -0400] gondoi: although i'll still need to figure out how to build a multi node cluster test
[2013-03-18 23:57:31 -0400] clundquist: yeah, that is one thing we haven't quite figured out
[2013-03-18 23:57:51 -0400] clundquist: our short term answer has been to do, kitchen converge /regexp/
[2013-03-18 23:57:51 -0400] gondoi: :D
[2013-03-18 23:57:54 -0400] clundquist: to bring them all up
[2013-03-18 23:58:00 -0400] clundquist: then run kitchen verify
