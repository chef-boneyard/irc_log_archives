[2013-03-11 09:15:13 -0400] st0ne2thedge: What is the use on the suites: resourse in the kitchem.yml file in the new branch of test kitchen?
[2013-03-11 09:20:05 -0400] st0ne2thedge: It doesn't seem to be documented anywhere, might prove to be usefull?
[2013-03-11 09:26:57 -0400] spheromak: st0ne2thedge: they talk about it on the readme in the 1.0 branch
[2013-03-11 09:26:59 -0400] spheromak: The suites stanza defines sets of tests that you intend to be run on each platform. A run_list and node attributes can be defined for each suite. The run_list and node attributes will be merged with that of each platform. In case of the conflict, the attributes defined on the suite will triumph.
[2013-03-11 09:32:26 -0400] st0ne2thedge: spheromak: i'll take another look at the readme, thanks for the heads up!

[2013-03-11 14:02:08 -0400] st0ne2thedge: Next problem i'm encountering setting up a new project using the Test-Kitchen 1.0
[2013-03-11 14:04:04 -0400] st0ne2thedge: i'm using bundle to guide it into the proper direction
[2013-03-11 14:04:22 -0400] st0ne2thedge: though the gems required for the project seem to contradict
[2013-03-11 14:20:35 -0400] st0ne2thedge: SOLVED
[2013-03-11 14:20:42 -0400] st0ne2thedge: oldest version somehow is good enough
[2013-03-11 14:21:58 -0400] st0ne2thedge: I'd like to clear up some confusion i have regarding the testkitchen suite
[2013-03-11 14:22:36 -0400] st0ne2thedge: does it actually test using a combination of suites before and after spinning up vagrant boxes
[2013-03-11 14:22:48 -0400] st0ne2thedge: or does it just spin up the boxes and run minitest?
[2013-03-11 16:04:16 -0400] st0ne2thedge: how does one go about adding a custom plugin for test-kitchen?

[2013-03-11 19:06:27 -0400] hikeit: btm: are the remote_file changes waiting for the file code refactor?
[2013-03-11 19:09:03 -0400] btm: hikeit: you mean CHEF-1031?
[2013-03-11 19:09:12 -0400] hikeit: yeah, looks like you're reviewing now
[2013-03-11 19:09:25 -0400] hikeit: (i'm watching, but not participating)
[2013-03-11 19:09:36 -0400] btm: hikeit: yeah, we just need to look at CHEF-1031, file code refactor is waiting on it. :)
[2013-03-11 19:12:55 -0400] hikeit: there's a new remote_file/http
[2013-03-11 20:01:52 -0400] geekbri: boo to the knife centric code review ;)
[2013-03-11 20:03:33 -0400] btm: geekbri: knife projects don't get their own code review so they need some love sometimes too :)
[2013-03-11 20:05:38 -0400] geekbri: btm: I suppose so, I am more than happy to wait for my ticket to get reviewed anyway as I've just monkey patched for the time being :)
[2013-03-11 20:05:59 -0400] geekbri: Although I do think any pull request that provides unit tests should be treated with tender tender love

[2013-03-11 20:34:31 -0400] hikeit: the etag / last modified support will also come in handy
