[2013-03-07 11:53:52 -0500] rapsey: anyone here using test kitchen 1.0?
[2013-03-07 18:54:24 -0500] github-bawt: [knife-hp] mattray tagged 0.3.0 at 441cc1c: http://git.io/-_1rhw
[2013-03-07 18:55:18 -0500] miketheman: oh snap. mattray's commit messages are excited.
[2013-03-07 18:55:56 -0500] mattray: miketheman: I've been waiting on the new fog release for quite awhile
[2013-03-07 18:56:25 -0500] mattray: revving knife-openstack shortly as well
[2013-03-07 19:03:13 -0500] miketheman: mattray: would it make sense to use '~> 1.10' constrians instead?
[2013-03-07 19:03:26 -0500] miketheman: so as to save you this particular hassle?
[2013-03-07 19:03:28 -0500] mattray: miketheman: you know, I don't know
[2013-03-07 19:03:38 -0500] mattray: Fog has a mixed history with that
[2013-03-07 19:04:25 -0500] mattray: we kinda want lenient constraints so multiple knife cloud plugins get along better
[2013-03-07 19:04:34 -0500] miketheman: one of my commits made it into fog - I got the t-shiurt! :)
[2013-03-07 19:05:50 -0500] mattray: we're slowly getting a better plan together for knife cloud plugins, eventually we'll have automated testing and some commonality
[2013-03-07 19:06:22 -0500] mattray: so we can give Fog better feedback and keep them in better sync
[2013-03-07 19:07:27 -0500] miketheman: that's awesome news
[2013-03-07 19:07:51 -0500] miketheman: I think the whole gem dependency hell as a whole is a hard problem, and something to address.
[2013-03-07 19:08:19 -0500] mattray: agreed
