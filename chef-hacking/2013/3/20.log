[2013-03-20 09:34:35 -0400] nacer: hi all
[2013-03-20 09:35:12 -0400] nacer: do you known if there is a way to add proxy settings to kitchen_vagrant provisioning ?
[2013-03-20 10:35:29 -0400] iartarisi: Hi! What's the preferred way to call external commands from package providers? I see a mix of shellout/run_command/run_command_with_systems_locale being used in the existing code.
[2013-03-20 10:52:34 -0400] nkrinner: iartarisi, this is a rather low-traffic channel. your chances are probably higher in #chef or on the mailing list
[2013-03-20 10:53:56 -0400] iartarisi: thanks, nkrinner :)
[2013-03-20 15:39:27 -0400] rteabeault: The docs state the following "When an attribute is of the same type of data, such as a hash or an array, the contents are merged. This is true even with different levels of precedence, such as default and override attributes."
[2013-03-20 15:39:37 -0400] rteabeault: However I am not seeing this behavior for arrays
[2013-03-20 15:39:50 -0400] rteabeault: If the precedence is the same they are merged but if the precedence is different the resulting value is that of the higher precedence.
[2013-03-20 15:39:59 -0400] rteabeault: So are the docs wrong or is this a bug?
[2013-03-20 17:28:28 -0400] kallistec: rteabeault: doc bug. Link?
[2013-03-20 18:14:19 -0400] rteabeault: Here is the link http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_node_object_deep_merge.html
[2013-03-20 18:14:39 -0400] rteabeault: " When an attribute is of the same type of data, such as a hash or an array, the contents are merged. This is true even with different levels of precedence, such as default and override attributes."

[2013-03-20 23:02:15 -0400] fujin: yo fnichol_ is there anyway to use t-k etc to run in chef client mode, talking to a server? want to make like an isolated chef-server per-workstation for this monolithic chef-repo
[2013-03-20 23:18:58 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: "not at this time"
[2013-03-20 23:19:02 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: "pull requests accepted"
[2013-03-20 23:19:38 -0400] jtimberman: I could have sworn we had an issue open to add that but I might be imagining things
[2013-03-20 23:20:11 -0400] spox: jtimberman: hi
[2013-03-20 23:20:17 -0400] jtimberman: spox: hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[2013-03-20 23:20:17 -0400] spox: can i bug you for a second?
[2013-03-20 23:20:21 -0400] jtimberman: only a second ;)
[2013-03-20 23:20:24 -0400] spox: :P
[2013-03-20 23:20:27 -0400] jtimberman: hehehehehe
[2013-03-20 23:20:29 -0400] jtimberman: whatsu p
[2013-03-20 23:20:40 -0400] spox: so, omnitruck bucket on s3, content listing has package builds
[2013-03-20 23:20:46 -0400] spox: last package is available via bucket
[2013-03-20 23:20:51 -0400] spox: but not listed in contents
[2013-03-20 23:20:57 -0400] spox: was wondering if something has changed
[2013-03-20 23:21:08 -0400] spox: it killed the omnibus_updater cookbook searching :(
[2013-03-20 23:21:48 -0400] jtimberman: uhm, not sure offhand, I'll ask.
[2013-03-20 23:22:06 -0400] spox: cool, i would really appreciate it. thanks! :)
[2013-03-20 23:22:26 -0400] spox: also, kb, and ruby-kb for t-k 1.0
[2013-03-20 23:22:35 -0400] spox: all that testing happens outside of chef, right?
[2013-03-20 23:23:08 -0400] jtimberman: i'm not sure how those pieces fit together yet
[2013-03-20 23:23:17 -0400] jtimberman: best to ask fnichol_ on that
[2013-03-20 23:23:52 -0400] spox: okay, cool. i've been messing around with it lately and wanted to be sure. will the pre-1.0 setups continue to be supported/used?
[2013-03-20 23:24:06 -0400] spox: or are people going to be encouraged off that setup?
[2013-03-20 23:24:58 -0400] jtimberman: supported as far as I can answer questions about it, but I encourage anyone using TK 0.7 to upgrade as soon as possible, even the alpha, it's so much nicer :)
[2013-03-20 23:25:08 -0400] jtimberman: And I <3 TK 0.7
[2013-03-20 23:25:19 -0400] spox: okay, cool. wasn't sure if i should put the work in for it
[2013-03-20 23:25:24 -0400] spox: you convinced me not too :P
[2013-03-20 23:25:27 -0400] jtimberman: spox: on the bucket/contents issue
[2013-03-20 23:25:35 -0400] jtimberman: what do you mean?
[2013-03-20 23:25:35 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2013-03-20 23:25:53 -0400] spox: if you hit the bucket directly, you'll get an xml listing of the contents
[2013-03-20 23:26:17 -0400] spox: i've been using that to do searches for latest releases, or latest patch bits
[2013-03-20 23:26:25 -0400] jtimberman: ooh
[2013-03-20 23:26:27 -0400] spox: the last one doesn't show up in there
[2013-03-20 23:26:39 -0400] jtimberman: you might want: http://www.opscode.com/chef/full_client_list
[2013-03-20 23:26:52 -0400] spox: there's json files i see that may have the package listings, but they are 403
[2013-03-20 23:26:59 -0400] spox: yeah, i saw that in the chef-server cookbook
[2013-03-20 23:27:22 -0400] kallistec: spox: you don't want to list the bucket directly
[2013-03-20 23:27:23 -0400] spox: but hitting s3 directly is nice, since it's less hopping around :P
[2013-03-20 23:27:34 -0400] jtimberman: ha
[2013-03-20 23:27:38 -0400] kallistec: I can change the world out from under you if you do that
[2013-03-20 23:27:47 -0400] kallistec: and I will, soon :P
[2013-03-20 23:28:34 -0400] kallistec: seriously though, we're changing buckets soon
[2013-03-20 23:28:38 -0400] jtimberman: the most epic form of trolling.
[2013-03-20 23:28:54 -0400] jtimberman: kallistec: is full_client_list canonical?
[2013-03-20 23:28:58 -0400] kallistec: omnitruck apis will work
[2013-03-20 23:28:59 -0400] jtimberman: like, that won't change?
[2013-03-20 23:29:06 -0400] spox: ^^
[2013-03-20 23:29:11 -0400] kallistec: yeah, that will have the same format
[2013-03-20 23:29:13 -0400] spox: if that's the case, i'll migrate over to it
[2013-03-20 23:29:29 -0400] spox: kallistec: okay, cool. then i'll head down that road then
[2013-03-20 23:29:30 -0400] jtimberman: plus its json vs xml :)
[2013-03-20 23:29:35 -0400] kallistec: there will probably be a v2/ version at some point soon
[2013-03-20 23:29:42 -0400] jtimberman: <ns:known-an-namespace />
[2013-03-20 23:29:49 -0400] kallistec: but the old one will stay
[2013-03-20 23:29:56 -0400] kallistec: same URL and such
[2013-03-20 23:30:20 -0400] spox: awesome. thanks guys :)
[2013-03-20 23:30:38 -0400] c_t: so i herd u like xml
[2013-03-20 23:31:19 -0400] spox: ha, i felt like i should have been staring at a crt as i was loading up rexml :(
[2013-03-20 23:31:53 -0400] c_t: I just got a super bullshit XML-related reply from a vendor
[2013-03-20 23:32:37 -0400] c_t: me: "Hey, while I'm running this script to back <things> up, at <offset> it blows up with this error about some chars being invalid XML. Our query string is fine, what's up?"
[2013-03-20 23:33:04 -0400] c_t: them: "Oh yeah, some invalid data got in there. You'll have to program around it or find it by hand and remove it or something."
[2013-03-20 23:33:21 -0400] c_t: Heaven forbid they do some checking in there somewhere
