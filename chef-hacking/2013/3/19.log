[2013-03-19 00:00:32 -0400] gondoi: hrm looks like i'm running into an old cookbook being used.
[2013-03-19 00:00:53 -0400] gondoi: if i had previously used librarian in this repo, would it be using the cookbooks dir somehow?
[2013-03-19 00:00:53 -0400] clundquist: in the berksfile you can specify source
[2013-03-19 00:00:59 -0400] gondoi: yeah
[2013-03-19 00:01:07 -0400] clundquist: yes, it would be
[2013-03-19 00:01:14 -0400] gondoi: i specified upstream, but for some reason it's still finding our internall written one
[2013-03-19 00:01:15 -0400] gondoi: okay
[2013-03-19 00:01:19 -0400] gondoi: i removed that dir just now
[2013-03-19 00:01:22 -0400] clundquist: we use :git => '...
[2013-03-19 00:01:26 -0400] clundquist:  and :path => '...
[2013-03-19 00:01:27 -0400] gondoi: yeah
[2013-03-19 00:01:41 -0400] gondoi: i had just done cookbook "mysql"
[2013-03-19 00:02:09 -0400] gondoi: but librarian had pointed at an internal one

[2013-03-19 10:10:06 -0400] nacer: hi
[2013-03-19 10:10:28 -0400] nacer: test-kitchen is still the good way to test cookbooks ?
[2013-03-19 10:20:17 -0400] rapsey: depends what kind of tests you want I suppose
[2013-03-19 10:20:18 -0400] st0ne2thedge: nacer: what version are you using?
[2013-03-19 10:20:18 -0400] st0ne2thedge: version 1.0 is under heavy development ^^
[2013-03-19 10:20:18 -0400] st0ne2thedge: integration testing is extremely important for cookbooks
[2013-03-19 10:28:19 -0400] nacer: st0ne2thedge: yeah i try to install the new kitchen version with bundler
[2013-03-19 10:28:29 -0400] nacer: st0ne2thedge: bundler is running for 15minnutes now
[2013-03-19 10:28:38 -0400] nacer: st0ne2thedge: not installed yet
[2013-03-19 10:29:02 -0400] nacer: rapsey: i want to test what my cookbook should do :)
[2013-03-19 10:35:46 -0400] st0ne2thedge: nacer: I installed it using bundler 2 did not take that long at all
[2013-03-19 10:36:05 -0400] st0ne2thedge: did you use the git parameters etc?
[2013-03-19 10:36:16 -0400] nacer: st0ne2thedge: yeah that's because 1.0 use git and not rubygems repository
[2013-03-19 10:36:22 -0400] nacer: st0ne2thedge: i have installed 1.0dev now
[2013-03-19 10:38:10 -0400] st0ne2thedge: now i suppose you need to look into kb: https://github.com/opscode/kb
[2013-03-19 10:47:44 -0400] rapsey: nacer: if you want to spawn actual VM's to perform tests on then Test Kitchen is definitely the way to go ;)
[2013-03-19 10:48:16 -0400] nacer: st0ne2thedge: it's okay now
[2013-03-19 10:48:16 -0400] rapsey: if you just want to run RSpec/Cucumber/... tests then it's a bit unnecessary
[2013-03-19 10:48:22 -0400] nacer: st0ne2thedge: test env is setup
[2013-03-19 10:51:58 -0400] nacer: st0ne2thedge: suites is where you put your recipe de be run ?
[2013-03-19 10:52:00 -0400] st0ne2thedge: i'm glad it worked out ^^
[2013-03-19 10:52:09 -0400] nacer: st0ne2thedge: documentation seem to be in progress :)
[2013-03-19 10:52:24 -0400] nacer: s/de/to
[2013-03-19 10:52:29 -0400] rapsey: yup :P
[2013-03-19 10:52:34 -0400] st0ne2thedge: nacer: exactly XD
[2013-03-19 10:52:57 -0400] nacer: st0ne2thedge: do i still need to put all my cookbooks dep in a .kitchen/cookbooks ?
[2013-03-19 10:52:58 -0400] rapsey: in platforms you define the basic state your machine should be in before tests
[2013-03-19 10:53:15 -0400] rapsey: and in suites you choose which recipes etc to run before testing
[2013-03-19 10:53:25 -0400] rapsey: by default you have to put them there yes
[2013-03-19 10:53:40 -0400] nacer: rapsey: can i set it otherwise ?
[2013-03-19 10:54:12 -0400] nacer: rapsey: can he fetch dep cookbook in my local folder ?
[2013-03-19 10:54:19 -0400] nacer: rapsey: and keep them updated ?
[2013-03-19 10:55:20 -0400] nacer:  i'am looking for a settings like "cookbook_source" :)
[2013-03-19 10:57:43 -0400] rapsey: what test kitchen will do is upload the cookbooks from that directory to your node, then it will run chef-solo on the node
[2013-03-19 10:58:08 -0400] rapsey: config[:kitchen_root]
[2013-03-19 10:58:19 -0400] rapsey: is where it searches for data to upload
[2013-03-19 10:58:35 -0400] rapsey: although I don't know if you can change just the cookbook path
[2013-03-19 10:59:56 -0400] nacer: rapsey: TY
[2013-03-19 11:01:44 -0400] rapsey: nacer: it's hardcoded to look for a "cookbooks" dir in your kitchen_root
[2013-03-19 11:01:54 -0400] nacer: okay
[2013-03-19 11:02:25 -0400] rapsey: nacer: if you want to change it or know exactly what it does, take a look at lib/kitchen/chef_data_uploader.rb
[2013-03-19 11:02:56 -0400] nacer: rapsey: i will pass for this time
[2013-03-19 11:03:18 -0400] st0ne2thedge: haha
[2013-03-19 11:05:04 -0400] nacer: :)
[2013-03-19 11:13:55 -0400] nacer: mmmm
[2013-03-19 11:13:56 -0400] nacer: [2013-03-19T11:12:51+00:00] FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::CookbookNotFound: Cookbook apt not found. If you're loading apt from another cookbook, make sure you configure the dependency in your metadata
[2013-03-19 11:14:25 -0400] nacer: ls -l .kitchen/cookbooks apt is here
[2013-03-19 11:19:52 -0400] rapsey: .kitchen is your working directory when you run bundle exec kitchen test?
[2013-03-19 11:20:32 -0400] nacer: ohh okay
[2013-03-19 11:20:59 -0400] rapsey: give it a try ;) I think if you don't manually specify your kitchen_root it takes your working directory
[2013-03-19 11:21:38 -0400] nacer: yeah previous version had test folder at root dir
[2013-03-19 11:23:58 -0400] rapsey: test kitchen 1.0 is quite different from 0.7
[2013-03-19 11:25:56 -0400] nacer: rapsey: yeah
[2013-03-19 11:26:07 -0400] nacer: rapsey: so by default where my cookbooks folder hsould be ?
[2013-03-19 11:26:43 -0400] rapsey: right next to your .kitchen.yml I suppose
[2013-03-19 13:02:52 -0400] st0ne2thedge: is there another way besides monkey-patching busser to install a plugin from url?
[2013-03-19 13:03:00 -0400] st0ne2thedge: for testkitchen 1.0
[2013-03-19 13:30:10 -0400] nacer: ok
[2013-03-19 13:31:08 -0400] nacer: now he say that he can find the cookbook i want to test
[2013-03-19 13:31:09 -0400] nacer: Chef::Exceptions::CookbookNotFound: Cookbook go not found.
[2013-03-19 13:53:22 -0400] rapsey: nacer: you're certain it's in kitchen's cookbook dir?
[2013-03-19 14:05:19 -0400] nacer: rapsey: no it's not
[2013-03-19 14:06:10 -0400] nacer: rapsey: oh, so you don't have to put your .kitchen stuff inside you cookbook anymore , it should be outside the coookbook ?
[2013-03-19 14:07:43 -0400] nacer: rapsey: and then put the cookbook you want to test inside cookbooks folder ?
[2013-03-19 14:09:41 -0400] rapsey: nacer: afaik kitchen doesn't expect you to put anything special inside your cookbooks
[2013-03-19 14:10:03 -0400] rapsey: nacer: you just put your cookbooks in the "cookbooks" folder in test kitchen
[2013-03-19 14:10:18 -0400] nacer: rapsey: yes even the cookbook i want to tesT ?
[2013-03-19 14:10:46 -0400] rapsey: yep. kitchen only uses the cookbooks in that folder
[2013-03-19 14:10:56 -0400] nacer: weird
[2013-03-19 14:11:37 -0400] rapsey: if you want to run integration tests, put them in [kitchen_root]/test/integration/[suite_name]/[kb_plugin_name]
[2013-03-19 14:12:27 -0400] rapsey: for example: kitchen/test/integration/default/minitest/test_apache2.rb
[2013-03-19 14:15:54 -0400] rapsey: the cookbooks dir is just default implementation I guess.. we hacked it to provision the VM's from our chef server
[2013-03-19 14:16:11 -0400] rapsey: I guess they just wanted to go with a way that everyone can use easily
[2013-03-19 14:17:18 -0400] st0ne2thedge: ofcourse without the documentation atm that makes it quite abstract
[2013-03-19 14:31:04 -0400] nacer: st0ne2thedge: yes i will stick with the old version of kitchen
[2013-03-19 14:31:38 -0400] nacer: st0ne2thedge: with no doc it will take too much time
[2013-03-19 14:32:41 -0400] Mithrandir: coderanger: any chance of you adding a license/copyright file to pychef?  pypi says bsd, but the files themselves don't say anything.
[2013-03-19 14:35:21 -0400] jtimberman: test kitchen is something set up in the cookbook itself.
[2013-03-19 14:38:54 -0400] st0ne2thedge: jtimberman where would one initiate a combination of tests on several cookbooks then?
[2013-03-19 14:40:17 -0400] jtimberman: st0ne2thedge: a staging environment?
[2013-03-19 14:40:57 -0400] jtimberman: test kitchen is for isolated cross platform integration testing for a single project (one cookbook, one erlang library, one ruby on rails app)
[2013-03-19 14:42:09 -0400] st0ne2thedge: jtimberman: we kind of were intending to use test-kitchen for cross-platforn cross-cookbook testing
[2013-03-19 14:42:21 -0400] st0ne2thedge: covering all bases :O
[2013-03-19 14:42:45 -0400] nacer: a example for running test kitchen 1.0 would be nice , i did not understand a thing of the change between 0.6 and 1.0alpha :)
[2013-03-19 14:43:09 -0400] jtimberman: nacer: bluepill cookbook has 1.0alpha support
[2013-03-19 14:43:16 -0400] nacer: jtimberman: cool
[2013-03-19 14:43:20 -0400] jtimberman: so does logrotae
[2013-03-19 14:43:20 -0400] jtimberman: logrotate
[2013-03-19 14:43:22 -0400] jtimberman: a couple others.
[2013-03-19 14:43:25 -0400] jtimberman: that i dont' remember off hand
[2013-03-19 14:44:51 -0400] rapsey: would you suggest another tool for testing multiple cookbooks together?
[2013-03-19 14:45:19 -0400] jtimberman: i don't know
[2013-03-19 14:45:41 -0400] jtimberman: launch ec2 instances?
[2013-03-19 14:45:56 -0400] jtimberman: i mean, if you really want to test that shit works, you have to actually run it in an environment that looks like production, right?
[2013-03-19 14:46:00 -0400] st0ne2thedge: we are currently launching xen instances
[2013-03-19 14:46:04 -0400] jtimberman: sure
[2013-03-19 14:46:15 -0400] jtimberman: xen, ec2, rackspace cloud, lxc, lots of options.
[2013-03-19 14:46:40 -0400] rapsey: but there's no other tool out there that is better fit for this job than test kitchen?
[2013-03-19 14:50:11 -0400] fnichol_: mornig all!
[2013-03-19 14:50:21 -0400] rapsey: morning :)
[2013-03-19 14:50:25 -0400] st0ne2thedge: fnichol_: morning
[2013-03-19 14:50:26 -0400] fnichol_: rapsey: when you say multiple cookbooks together do you mean multiple nodes?
[2013-03-19 14:50:49 -0400] st0ne2thedge: fnichol_: he means both
[2013-03-19 14:50:50 -0400] fnichol_: st0ne2thedge, rapsey: good morning to you both and apologies for *always* missing the conversation in here :)
[2013-03-19 14:51:00 -0400] st0ne2thedge: haha no problem
[2013-03-19 14:51:09 -0400] st0ne2thedge: we ask too many questions anyways :D
[2013-03-19 14:51:44 -0400] fnichol_: no, no, it's all really good. once we get docs fleshed out I'm hoping this'll be easier on everyone
[2013-03-19 14:51:44 -0400] rapsey: fnichol_: our plan is to pretty much try all possible combinations of cookbooks on various nodes
[2013-03-19 14:52:25 -0400] spheromak: fnichol_: Im back in the states again we should skype sometime this week :D
[2013-03-19 14:54:12 -0400] fnichol_: at the moment tk1 is really good a converging single node systems for testing. you could layer multiple cookbooks on a node if you want though. if you're looking for multi-node testing that requires some orchestration i'd nudge you towards chef-workflow and/or cucumber-chef. both of these are also working with chef-client out of the box
[2013-03-19 14:54:40 -0400] spheromak: +1 for chef-workflow
[2013-03-19 14:54:52 -0400] fnichol_: spheromak: yes, let's do that!
[2013-03-19 14:56:14 -0400] rapsey: fnichol_: thanks :) will look into those right away
[2013-03-19 14:58:07 -0400] fnichol_: rapsey: nice! not that i want to scare you off test-kitchen :) i'm hoping we can get it running well for its core competency first then see if it needs to grow or change
[2013-03-19 14:58:33 -0400] fnichol_: rapsey: and any other questions about this or others, don't hesitate to bring em up in here :)
[2013-03-19 14:58:43 -0400] st0ne2thedge: Our xen-driver has been rendered useless XD
[2013-03-19 14:58:57 -0400] jtimberman: at the core of it, test kitchen is for testing projects in isolation, so *not* with other cookbooks.
[2013-03-19 14:59:08 -0400] fnichol_: st0ne2thedge: yeah? how so?
[2013-03-19 15:00:02 -0400] rapsey: we spent an entire week trying to mold test kitchen into what we need :P I think he means that was a bit of wasted effort
[2013-03-19 15:00:34 -0400] st0ne2thedge: rapsey, fnichol_ nothing is ever a waste though ^^
[2013-03-19 15:00:40 -0400] st0ne2thedge: we learned a lot ^^
[2013-03-19 15:02:06 -0400] fnichol_: ah, now i see! do you have any code that came out of working with xen? i can bet others would be really interested
[2013-03-19 15:03:40 -0400] rapsey: we got it to work fine with xen, but we were working on rewriting it "properly" (that is to say, using Fog instead of SSH commands.. :$)
[2013-03-19 15:19:08 -0400] st0ne2thedge: chef-workflow looks promising
[2013-03-19 15:19:36 -0400] st0ne2thedge: thx for that
[2013-03-19 15:19:57 -0400] st0ne2thedge: we'll be providing our code for the xen driver as soon as we refactored it though
[2013-03-19 15:44:57 -0400] iartarisi: where does chef decide what provider it's going to use on a specific platform? I want to modify chef itself to choose something else depending on the OS version.
[2013-03-19 15:45:12 -0400] clundquist: oh you ask a hard question sir
[2013-03-19 15:45:30 -0400] clundquist: you can override lwrp_base.rb in an lwrp
[2013-03-19 15:45:37 -0400] clundquist: let me look up the rumplestiltskin name
[2013-03-19 15:46:34 -0400] clundquist: private def set_platform_default_providers
[2013-03-19 15:47:00 -0400] geekbri: Isn't there a hash that determines what the default providers are?
[2013-03-19 15:47:17 -0400] clundquist: gisting
[2013-03-19 15:47:27 -0400] iartarisi: hm... I can't find set_platform_default_providers with grep
[2013-03-19 15:47:37 -0400] clundquist: https://gist.github.com/ChrisLundquist/5197210
[2013-03-19 15:47:37 -0400] iartarisi: what file is that in?
[2013-03-19 15:48:34 -0400] clundquist: Portertech showed me this several months back, let me see if I can find something like this in sensu
[2013-03-19 15:51:43 -0400] clundquist: hmm, all I can seem to find at the moment is, https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/resource.rb#L711-L745
[2013-03-19 15:53:07 -0400] clundquist: oh>.> I call the method I referenced in def initialize in the resource after setting @action
[2013-03-19 15:53:29 -0400] clundquist: sorry, I haven't thought about this detail for a while
[2013-03-19 15:53:50 -0400] iartarisi: oh, right. But I want to change chef upstream :).
[2013-03-19 15:55:03 -0400] clundquist: I would start with that link about, resource.rb#self.provides
[2013-03-19 15:55:17 -0400] iartarisi: yeah, that's where I am right now, thanks!
[2013-03-19 15:58:12 -0400] iartarisi: ah, there we go: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/platform.rb#L40
[2013-03-19 15:58:32 -0400] geekbri: i knew there was a big hash for it somewhere :_
[2013-03-19 15:58:33 -0400] geekbri: :)
[2013-03-19 15:58:37 -0400] iartarisi: yeah :)
[2013-03-19 16:01:34 -0400] iartarisi: now I'll put a conditional in that hash and make everyone hate me
[2013-03-19 16:01:46 -0400] clundquist: iartarisi: you have me curious, what are you trying to do?
[2013-03-19 16:01:52 -0400] clundquist: heh
[2013-03-19 16:03:09 -0400] iartarisi: clundquist: basically this:
[2013-03-19 16:03:09 -0400] iartarisi: :suse => {:default => {:group => Chef::Provider::Group::Suse if self[:platform_version].to_f < 12.3 else Chef::Provider::Group::UserMod } }
[2013-03-19 16:03:44 -0400] iartarisi: or rather s/self/node/
[2013-03-19 16:04:58 -0400] clundquist: solaris2 does something similar
[2013-03-19 16:05:09 -0400] clundquist: yeah there doesn't seem to be good support for ranges since keys are strings
[2013-03-19 16:06:03 -0400] clundquist: the baller patch would be to make those hash keys range objects, at least in my mind, but that is probably a lot of work
[2013-03-19 16:06:17 -0400] iartarisi: heh, yeah
[2013-03-19 16:06:46 -0400] c_t: iartarisi: that looks like an excellent case for using ternary operator
[2013-03-19 16:07:12 -0400] c_t: I think that might be one of the relatively few cases where ?: is *more* readable
[2013-03-19 16:07:14 -0400] iartarisi: c_t: true that
[2013-03-19 16:20:45 -0400] geekbri: I think in that particular case the ternery won't make it any LESS readable so its probably a good spot to use it
[2013-03-19 16:23:23 -0400] c_t: indeed
[2013-03-19 16:23:37 -0400] c_t: I've engaged in some very terrible ternary abuse in the past, but this wouldn't be
[2013-03-19 16:25:38 -0400] clundquist: Lately, there have been a lot of test kitchen 1.0 questions. I was hoping to write a guide or docs or something on the least clear part. Any suggestions of what part that is, or the best overall approach?
[2013-03-19 16:27:34 -0400] jtimberman: I'm writing some things *right now* :)
[2013-03-19 16:27:48 -0400] clundquist: awesome :)
[2013-03-19 16:28:50 -0400] jtimberman: not a guide or documentation by any means.
[2013-03-19 16:28:57 -0400] jtimberman: but some information for people to read and consider :)
[2013-03-19 16:29:08 -0400] clundquist: *nod*
[2013-03-19 16:30:11 -0400] c_t: I need to find some time to look closer at test-kitchen
[2013-03-19 16:32:11 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: if you look closely and squint, you can see a schooner.
[2013-03-19 16:32:33 -0400] c_t: it had better not be one of those stupid Magic Eye things
[2013-03-19 16:32:41 -0400] c_t: I could never see anything with those
[2013-03-19 16:33:06 -0400] c_t: wtf
[2013-03-19 16:33:12 -0400] c_t: is someone using a jackhammer outside?!
[2013-03-19 16:34:02 -0400] clundquist: I see you have never worked in pioneer square. Where they tear up the street every other month to lay one new cable
[2013-03-19 16:36:25 -0400] c_t: someone is, in fact, using a jackhammer
[2013-03-19 16:36:54 -0400] c_t: clundquist: for good or ill, I've never worked in Pioneer Square, no
[2013-03-19 16:37:18 -0400] clundquist: c_t: probably for the better
[2013-03-19 16:37:45 -0400] c_t: I'm familiar enough with it, but haven't spent tons of time there
[2013-03-19 16:39:07 -0400] clundquist: isn't `creates` supposed to act as a not_if? https://github.com/mdxp/nodejs-cookbook/pull/34 (for bash resource)
[2013-03-19 16:40:39 -0400] c_t: I had to meet someone in Pioneer Square once and had to wait around for a long time
[2013-03-19 16:40:53 -0400] c_t: so I was convinced I was going to get picked up by the cops because I so clearly didn't belong there
[2013-03-19 16:41:09 -0400] clundquist: that sounds like the daily experience
[2013-03-19 16:41:19 -0400] clundquist: that and fretting about parking tickets
[2013-03-19 16:41:36 -0400] c_t: I looked like neither a young professional nor, erm, the other folks in Pioneer Square in the daytime
[2013-03-19 16:42:21 -0400] clundquist: on the plus side, there are great sandwiches
[2013-03-19 16:42:52 -0400] c_t: indeed
[2013-03-19 16:43:11 -0400] c_t: there's a great sandwich place down here in Tacoma, but it's a bit far to haul myself over there
[2013-03-19 16:43:21 -0400] c_t: I keep meaning to, but put it off until it's really too late in the day
[2013-03-19 16:43:23 -0400] clundquist: MSM deli you mean?
[2013-03-19 16:43:27 -0400] c_t: yes!
[2013-03-19 16:43:44 -0400] clundquist: so you're saying you live in north tacoma where it isn't ghetto
[2013-03-19 16:43:57 -0400] c_t: nope, I live in the "South End" according to the map
[2013-03-19 16:44:07 -0400] c_t: which is "up and coming" as they say
[2013-03-19 16:44:15 -0400] clundquist: fearless
[2013-03-19 16:44:21 -0400] c_t: turns out that's different than "South Tacoma", which I didn't know until moving up here
[2013-03-19 16:44:31 -0400] c_t: my block's actually pretty nice
[2013-03-19 16:44:39 -0400] jtimberman: okay, nacer clundquist fnichol_ (and anyone else really): posts about "the anatomy of a test kitchen 1.0 cookbook": part 1, http://bit.ly/ZHl1xJ and part 2, http://bit.ly/ZXVgZZ
[2013-03-19 16:44:59 -0400] clundquist: jtimberman: charging mah lazers
[2013-03-19 16:45:10 -0400] c_t: I'm about 5 blocks or so from Pac Ave, but not a part of Pac Ave filled with prostitutes
[2013-03-19 16:45:10 -0400] nacer: jtimberman: tks :)
[2013-03-19 16:45:34 -0400] nacer: jtimberman: ou did that in two jours ?
[2013-03-19 16:45:41 -0400] nacer: hours
[2013-03-19 16:45:59 -0400] clundquist: I was about 5 blocks from hill top
[2013-03-19 16:46:34 -0400] c_t: way better than it used to be
[2013-03-19 16:46:56 -0400] c_t: I remember Hilltop being very bad indeed in the late 80s/early 90s
[2013-03-19 16:47:09 -0400] c_t: (lived in Oly then, not Tacoma, but still)
[2013-03-19 16:48:55 -0400] clundquist: jtimberman: I didn't even know you could use TK1.0 like that. Is that how you get classic TK functionality?
[2013-03-19 16:51:21 -0400] clundquist: I also didn't know,  `attributes: {bluepill: { bin: "/opt/chef/embedded/bin/bluepill" } }` would work, but that is cool that I can embed json, I dislike yaml
[2013-03-19 16:51:35 -0400] clundquist: I'm guessing it handles it as a string?
[2013-03-19 16:57:01 -0400] clundquist: having never used mini-test with chef, are node attributes evaluated on the remote host? E.G. https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/bluepill/blob/master/test/cookbooks/bluepill_test/files/default/tests/minitest/default_test.rb#L7
[2013-03-19 17:04:32 -0400] jtimberman: nacer: uhm, little less than 2 hrs :)
[2013-03-19 17:07:28 -0400] nacer: jtimberman: good ! :)
[2013-03-19 17:12:49 -0400] jtimberman: clundquist: that's yaml hash
[2013-03-19 17:13:09 -0400] jtimberman: clundquist: i dislike yaml, so i write it a little more sane than the normal way :)
[2013-03-19 17:15:01 -0400] nacer: jtimberman: i must be slow for doing this kind of stuff :)
[2013-03-19 17:15:19 -0400] jtimberman: nacer: what do you mean?
[2013-03-19 17:15:30 -0400] nacer: jtimberman: write documentation or example
[2013-03-19 17:15:39 -0400] jtimberman: ah
[2013-03-19 17:15:46 -0400] jtimberman: well, this isn't, strictly speaking, documentation.
[2013-03-19 17:16:00 -0400] jtimberman: it's "here's some information that you might (or might not) find helpful)" :)
[2013-03-19 17:24:57 -0400] c_t: sometimes documentation isn't real helpful anyway
[2013-03-19 17:25:24 -0400] c_t: I have some very dense and thorough MVS JCL documentation that manages to be completely obtuse
[2013-03-19 17:25:48 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: I'd argue that JCL is the thing that is obtuse.
[2013-03-19 17:25:53 -0400] jtimberman: I got a "D" in that class.
[2013-03-19 17:26:03 -0400] c_t: these docs somehow make it worse
[2013-03-19 17:26:07 -0400] jtimberman: got "A" in all my other CIS classes.
[2013-03-19 18:07:43 -0400] KarlHungus: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-ruby/blob/master/bin/makeself.sh#L360-L362
[2013-03-19 18:08:20 -0400] KarlHungus: am i crazy, or should lines 361 and 362 be an &&, not a || ?
[2013-03-19 18:12:46 -0400] KarlHungus: oh. its right, but there is a bug
[2013-03-19 18:15:14 -0400] KarlHungus: 'text -x $foo' returns true when $foo is unset
[2013-03-19 18:15:30 -0400] KarlHungus: at least on my bash and /bin/sh
[2013-03-19 18:15:37 -0400] clundquist: [ -x "$foo" ]
[2013-03-19 18:15:46 -0400] clundquist: right?
[2013-03-19 18:15:58 -0400] KarlHungus: yeah, thats exactly the correct fix
[2013-03-19 18:15:59 -0400] KarlHungus: ;)
[2013-03-19 18:16:11 -0400] clundquist: fnichol_: has taught me well
[2013-03-19 18:18:41 -0400] fnichol_: jtimberman: woot! nice writeups!
[2013-03-19 18:22:13 -0400] fnichol_: jtimberman: yes, the berkshelf middleware gets called on every vagrant command. i think we can get that optimized upstream
[2013-03-19 18:27:18 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol_: *nods* I figured something like that.
[2013-03-19 20:59:46 -0400] KarlHungus: btm_: ping =)

[2013-03-19 22:34:59 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: around?
[2013-03-19 22:35:14 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: trying to get started wit the new librarian /librarian-chef, but I don't see any binaries installed anymore
[2013-03-19 22:35:22 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: am I meant to rig this into Rake or Thor or something?
[2013-03-19 22:36:41 -0400] fujin: ah, there we go. neat
[2013-03-19 22:36:42 -0400] fujin: hooked into thor
[2013-03-19 22:36:44 -0400] fnichol_: fujin: I believe yfeldblum has extracted the chef parts out of the librarian gem proper. Should be in librarian-chef now
[2013-03-19 22:37:10 -0400] fnichol_: fujin: ...although the gem's been yanked :)
[2013-03-19 22:37:44 -0400] fujin: fnichol_: yeah, that's what I'm working with, but it doesn't look like it's all working right.
[2013-03-19 22:39:11 -0400] yfeldblum: fujin, install "librarian" v0.0.26, since that's the last released
[2013-03-19 22:39:24 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: is the new stuff not working yet?
[2013-03-19 22:39:43 -0400] yfeldblum: fujin, in the future, once "librarian-chef" is released (it's currently pre-released as v0.1.0.beta.1), that's the gem you'll install
[2013-03-19 22:39:58 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: that's what I have installed here; came down from rubygems via bundler
[2013-03-19 22:40:05 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: the pre-release librarian-chef, I'm talking about
[2013-03-19 22:40:51 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: how does one make use of that? I've tried adding 'librarian/cli' to my Thorfile, but seem sto bomb out here: https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian/blob/master/lib/librarian/cli.rb#L56
[2013-03-19 22:40:57 -0400] github-bawt: [test-kitchen] fnichol pushed 1 new commit to init-driver-flag: http://git.io/S2yuRg

[2013-03-19 22:41:18 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: happy to test :)
[2013-03-19 22:42:32 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: https://gist.github.com/3b599e6f5cef1a5988da
[2013-03-19 22:42:42 -0400] yfeldblum: fujin, i don't test using the CLI from a custom Thorfile
[2013-03-19 22:43:15 -0400] yfeldblum: fujin, also you can't use the abstract CLI class directly
[2013-03-19 22:43:35 -0400] yfeldblum: fujin, you would need to use the CLI class from librarian-chef instead
[2013-03-19 22:43:44 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: oh, that makes sense..
[2013-03-19 22:45:07 -0400] yfeldblum: fujin, unfortunately none of this is really documented
[2013-03-19 22:45:47 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: no worries, it's pre-release! gotta shake it out somehow
[2013-03-19 22:45:48 -0400] yfeldblum: fujin, mostly because i don't quite know what people are doing that needs documentation :D
[2013-03-19 22:47:15 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: I was expecting either a librarian-chef binary (that does all this cli stuff) or a Thorfile example
[2013-03-19 22:47:21 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: if that is a hint for your docs :)
[2013-03-19 22:47:21 -0400] yfeldblum: fujin, why are you pulling in librarian/chef/cli into a custom Thorfile?
[2013-03-19 22:48:02 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: there is no binary? how the hex are you supposed to use it!
[2013-03-19 22:48:45 -0400] yfeldblum: fujin, DOH
[2013-03-19 22:48:50 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: would have assumed add to Gemfile, bundle, create Cheffile, 'librarian-chef init' etc, would just work!
[2013-03-19 22:48:57 -0400] fujin: but there is no 'librarian-chef', so I was  digging in.
[2013-03-19 22:49:06 -0400] yfeldblum: fujin, yeah that's my mistake!
[2013-03-19 22:49:10 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: AH!
[2013-03-19 22:49:12 -0400] fujin: Brilliant.
[2013-03-19 22:49:27 -0400] fujin: yfeldblum: if you'd like, let me know when you have a fix I can test!

[2013-03-19 23:12:22 -0400] sascha_d: way just happened here with my test kitchen init?

[2013-03-19 23:13:32 -0400] fujin: sascha_d: looks like a bug in the adapter finder code ;(
[2013-03-19 23:14:11 -0400] sascha_d: what is that question asking?
[2013-03-19 23:14:15 -0400] sascha_d: I guessed "y"
[2013-03-19 23:14:29 -0400] sascha_d: is that a vagrant plugin question?
