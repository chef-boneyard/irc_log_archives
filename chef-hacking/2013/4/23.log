[2013-04-23 16:21:41 -0400] fnichol: jamesturnbull: wow, that's awesome! we're going to have to have a chat about this, free later this week or next?
[2013-04-23 16:22:08 -0400] fnichol: miketheman: ah you found the missing docs :) hopefully we can get to that tomorrow?
[2013-04-23 16:22:26 -0400] miketheman: maybe. I'd LOVE to spend some time with you and draft up some better docs
[2013-04-23 16:22:36 -0400] miketheman: and hammer out a workable workflow
[2013-04-23 16:22:39 -0400] miketheman: (s)
[2013-04-23 16:23:04 -0400] fnichol: sounds good with me!
[2013-04-23 16:24:35 -0400] miketheman: fnichol: kitchen init appends "gem 'test-kitchen', :group => :integration" to Gemfile
[2013-04-23 16:24:56 -0400] miketheman: how would that work, if I needed test-kitchen to run kitchen-init?
[2013-04-23 16:25:17 -0400] miketheman: or, is that just a "hey, we're doing some stuff, organize your Gemfile however you like"?
[2013-04-23 16:26:32 -0400] fnichol: miketheman: yeah, there's a good chance if you have a Gemfile then you already have test-kitchen in there. otherwise if you don't have one, `kitchen init` should install the driver gems for you
[2013-04-23 16:26:53 -0400] miketheman: it doesn't install them , only sets them up for me to install
[2013-04-23 16:27:33 -0400] fnichol: does it ask you to bundle install?
[2013-04-23 16:27:59 -0400] miketheman: it does. :)
[2013-04-23 16:29:17 -0400] fnichol: you can try to move your Gemfile out of the way and re-try `kitchen init`. it should run the `gem install kitchen-<driver>` bits for you in that case
[2013-04-23 16:29:31 -0400] miketheman: interesting
[2013-04-23 16:29:41 -0400] miketheman: I'll give that a shot on a diff. cookbook
[2013-04-23 16:29:43 -0400] fnichol: i was trying to strike a balance btw the bundler workflow and a gem-based one. maybe that's surprising
[2013-04-23 16:29:52 -0400] miketheman: but for now, want to focus on delivering 1 integration test
[2013-04-23 16:31:52 -0400] jamesturnbull: fnichol: sure
[2013-04-23 16:32:38 -0400] jamesturnbull: fnichol: just ping me here
[2013-04-23 16:33:02 -0400] miketheman: fnichol: docs show how to get test-kitchen running, need an example of tests - any current pointers?
[2013-04-23 16:33:04 -0400] fnichol: jamesturnbull: awesome, i really want to dig into the puppet support side, just need a few sherpas to help.
[2013-04-23 16:33:27 -0400] jamesturnbull: fnichol: with the right abatraction I am happy to do all the heavy lifting
[2013-04-23 16:33:53 -0400] fnichol: miketheman: what kind of tests are you interested in? minitest-chef-handler style, or something post-chef like straight up minitest, bash, bats, etc?
[2013-04-23 16:34:32 -0400] fnichol: jamesturnbull: that's great, count me in :)
[2013-04-23 16:34:46 -0400] miketheman: probably the latter, since that's probably going to be easiest to grok from someone new to chef (much less testing). bash, bats and minitest I think are the first candidates
[2013-04-23 16:35:26 -0400] miketheman: also, minitest-chef-handler is under changes right now, I think trying to write to that and then chanigng might be painful for newbies
[2013-04-23 16:36:39 -0400] miketheman: fnichol: the next part I'm going to be interested in is testing via the vagrant vmware fusion provider, is that 'done' yet?
[2013-04-23 16:42:07 -0400] fnichol: miketheman: ok, something like this may help get you going https://gist.github.com/fnichol/5445260
[2013-04-23 16:42:47 -0400] fnichol: miketheman: currently i haven't worred about alt. provisioners with vagrant because the config diverges so much btw. them. having said that, i want the vmware fusion provider so...
[2013-04-23 16:42:50 -0400] miketheman: fnichol: awesome, especially the links to bats
[2013-04-23 16:44:00 -0400] miketheman: how would the `kitchen verify` translate into the .kitchen.yaml file? is that a 'suite'?
[2013-04-23 16:45:44 -0400] fnichol: miketheman: sort of, in .kitchen.yml under suites you most likely have a 'default' key (the init generator will make you one). that's your default test suite/chef config. setup and verify take these test/integration/** test files and run them on the remote nodes
[2013-04-23 16:46:11 -0400] miketheman: gotcha
[2013-04-23 16:46:17 -0400] fnichol: miketheman: but only those test files that pertain to the suite you are testing. that way you can have tests for a 'server_mode' suite, a 'client_mode' suite, etc.
[2013-04-23 16:46:24 -0400] miketheman: so the setup will build out all the boxen I need, and bring them up?
[2013-04-23 16:46:38 -0400] miketheman: and verify will ship & test
[2013-04-23 16:46:47 -0400] miketheman: for fast iteration
[2013-04-23 16:46:58 -0400] fnichol: miketheman: i'm checking to see if my test kitchen talk will be recorded/streamed. i'm hoping to blaze through an example or two and explain a lot of the jargon
[2013-04-23 16:48:07 -0400] miketheman: ok, hoping to be able to sit in on it
[2013-04-23 16:48:12 -0400] fnichol: miketheman: yes, the converge, setup, and verify actions will step through all prior actions (including create). that way you can hit verify directly if you want to without destroying your instance every single time
[2013-04-23 16:48:40 -0400] fnichol: miketheman: sweet :) ok, better go finish a few slides now on something related...
[2013-04-23 16:49:56 -0400] miketheman: fnichol: do that. see you tomorroew
[2013-04-23 17:12:59 -0400] miketheman: fnichol: I think it might be time to close https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen/issues/40
[2013-04-23 17:19:31 -0400] miketheman: fnichol: I don't think I understand the semantic difference between `test` and `verify`
[2013-04-23 17:21:12 -0400] miketheman: fnichol: or better yet, how do show that the last test resulted in a "green" passing mode
[2013-04-23 18:37:00 -0400] josephholsten: is anyone working on getting partial_search into mainline chef? http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3878
[2013-04-23 19:13:39 -0400] miketheman: josephholsten:
[2013-04-23 19:13:56 -0400] miketheman: josephholsten: it looks like the feedback from kallistec was to add tests, add dsl, etc
[2013-04-23 19:35:40 -0400] josephholsten: yeah, just wondering if anyone is actively working to make kallistec happy
