[2013-04-29 08:41:41 -0400] GreatSUN: hi all
[2013-04-29 12:52:17 -0400] laurent\: is there a way to detect an data bag item is encrypted ?
[2013-04-29 12:52:26 -0400] laurent\: chef > Chef::DataBagItem.methods.grep(/encrypt/) => []
[2013-04-29 13:34:17 -0400] yfeldblum: laurent\, there's no built-in way; you're supposed to know which ones are encrypted and which not - possibly with some naming convention you set up for yourself
[2013-04-29 13:38:06 -0400] laurent\: yfeldblum: ok thanks, that's what i guessed
[2013-04-29 13:39:15 -0400] laurent\: i'm using the nagios cookbook and it's nagios_services databag logic, i'm just wondering how to deal with passwords
[2013-04-29 13:41:07 -0400] laurent\: of course i can do what I want but i'd rather have only one source to configure nagios services. the quick workaround would be to use a recipe to deal with the checks that need passwords

[2013-04-29 17:52:41 -0400] atomic-penguin: fnichol, looks like test-kitchen (1.0alpha5) does not resolve dependencies on cb metadata alone, I had to berks init to resolve depends
[2013-04-29 17:52:53 -0400] atomic-penguin: fnichol, feature, or bug?
[2013-04-29 18:09:05 -0400] miketheman: atomic-penguin: I don't think tk is meant to do that
[2013-04-29 18:11:05 -0400] miketheman: I think there's a plugin for vagrant-berkshelf (if you've got it)
[2013-04-29 18:11:54 -0400] atomic-penguin: miketheman, yes I had to install that.  I asked fnichol about it at chefconf, he wasn't sure if bare metadata would work or not.
[2013-04-29 18:13:27 -0400] atomic-penguin: miketheman, it looks like there is a condition for just metadata.rb, but test-kitchen bails out unable to resolve the cb name, even though it is in the metadata
[2013-04-29 18:13:36 -0400] miketheman: hm.
[2013-04-29 18:13:53 -0400] miketheman: atomic-penguin: I'm running my test right now, tossing the Berksfile aside to see what's going to happen.
[2013-04-29 18:17:43 -0400] miketheman: atomic-penguin: interesting. I get the same. this might be a logic bug, i.e. if you don't use Berks then it should work in a "normal" fashion
[2013-04-29 18:33:18 -0400] jtimberman: miketheman: :D
[2013-04-29 18:33:38 -0400] jtimberman: atomic-penguin: yeah, test kitchen doesn't do the dependency resolution, that's waht berkshelf is for.
[2013-04-29 18:33:53 -0400] jtimberman: er, that's what it uses berkshelf for
[2013-04-29 18:34:05 -0400] miketheman: jtimberman: I think what atomic-penguin is mentioning that even if there are no dependencies, tk doesn't pick up the cookbook.
[2013-04-29 18:39:22 -0400] atomic-penguin: miketheman, right
[2013-04-29 18:40:31 -0400] atomic-penguin: kind of the same thing that happened with earlier versions of foodcritic, couldn't resolve the cb name
[2013-04-29 18:45:17 -0400] miketheman: atomic-penguin: https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen/issues/92
[2013-04-29 18:45:32 -0400] atomic-penguin: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KITCHEN-72
[2013-04-29 18:45:57 -0400] miketheman: bwahahaha
[2013-04-29 18:46:12 -0400] atomic-penguin: jinx, you owe me a coke
[2013-04-29 18:46:40 -0400] miketheman: jtimberman, fnichol : which place should tickets for tk1.0 be going?
[2013-04-29 18:46:48 -0400] miketheman: gh issues or jira(blech)
[2013-04-29 18:58:36 -0400] petecheslock: ohai schisamo
[2013-04-29 19:12:13 -0400] atomic-penguin: miketheman, I think the answer to that is that Jira is Opscode's ticketing system
[2013-04-29 19:12:37 -0400] miketheman: yes, but the primary dev right now isn't an opscoder
[2013-04-29 19:12:43 -0400] atomic-penguin: Unless fnichol wants to keep it all on gh issues for one big merge later
[2013-04-29 19:28:05 -0400] jtimberman: miketheman: test-kitchen tickets go in gh issues for now.
[2013-04-29 19:28:22 -0400] jtimberman: after the 1.0 release is done, we'll evaluate using jira (the KITCHEN project)
[2013-04-29 19:28:54 -0400] miketheman: jtimberman: thanks. Any chance we can raise the visibility of that in CONTRIBUTING.md on tk1.0 branch for now?
[2013-04-29 19:29:26 -0400] jtimberman: miketheman: when we move it over to master
[2013-04-29 19:29:49 -0400] miketheman: welp, you _could_ put a note in the README.md of the branch, too
[2013-04-29 19:30:02 -0400] miketheman: raise visibility, make it easier for people to know where to go
[2013-04-29 21:14:08 -0400] schisamo: petecheslock and KarlHungus: updated freebsd-related PRs https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-ruby/pull/49, https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-software/pull/20 and https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/omnibus/pull/2
[2013-04-29 21:16:19 -0400] schisamo: please to do final look over.
[2013-04-29 21:16:24 -0400] schisamo: will probably merge in the AM.
[2013-04-29 21:16:59 -0400] petecheslock: schisamo - nice!  I'll point my berks/gemfile to those changes and can run a build test on freebsd 9.1 box - Probably later today or tomorrow.
[2013-04-29 21:17:09 -0400] jfoy: I have a contribution I'd like to make, but it's slightly more complicated than just a pull request. I've broken Chef::Cookbook::Chefignore out into a separate gem so Ridley (and eventually Berkshelf) can consume it. I don't want to own this gem; how can I ask Opscode to pick it up?
[2013-04-29 21:20:05 -0400] schisamo: petecheslock: yeah I have an updated Vagrantfile also: https://gist.github.com/schisamo/14630f462804fd053d8f
[2013-04-29 21:20:35 -0400] schisamo: petecheslock KarlHungus we also need to get a PR opened in Vagrant for this fix: https://gist.github.com/schisamo/14630f462804fd053d8f#file-vagrantfile-L12-L20
[2013-04-29 21:20:50 -0400] petecheslock: oh sweet - was wondering if you had a fix for that vagrant bug with bsd.
[2013-04-29 21:21:10 -0400] petecheslock: i think KarlHungus has a couple other freebsd fixes IIRC - maybe we can put them into one single "freebsd" fix branch for vagrant
[2013-04-29 21:22:53 -0400] schisamo: yes plz
[2013-04-29 21:23:06 -0400] schisamo: for now TO THE MONKEY PATCH
[2013-04-29 21:57:45 -0400] KarlHungus: petecheslock: all my vagrant fixes are merged
[2013-04-29 21:57:57 -0400] KarlHungus: the -alldirs is hanging out, but its less of a fix than an ugly hack
[2013-04-29 22:00:32 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - did you have a line(s) in your vagrant file to get around the -alldirs thing?
[2013-04-29 22:00:53 -0400] petecheslock: i'll nuke my vagrant install and reinstall before testing to make sure I have a "clean" build
[2013-04-29 22:01:03 -0400] petecheslock: before i test later
[2013-04-29 22:28:29 -0400] github-bawt: [kitchen-vagrant] TheDude05 opened pull request #18: Add VMware Fusion/Workstation support (master...add-vmware-support)  http://git.io/ppt6mA
