[2013-04-12 21:41:03 -0400] dougnukem: I'm impatiently trying to use the pull request that allows chef-solo to use environments https://github.com/nstielau/chef/tree/CHEF-3356
[2013-04-12 21:41:19 -0400] dougnukem: I'm looking to build a debian package for that branch to install on an Ubuntu system
[2013-04-12 21:41:44 -0400] dougnukem: are there instructions on building a debian package for chef?
[2013-04-12 21:41:50 -0400] dougnukem: like what you can download from https://opscode-omnitruck-release.s3.amazonaws.com/ubuntu/11.04/x86_64/chef_11.4.0-1.ubuntu.11.04_amd64.deb
[2013-04-12 21:43:25 -0400] btm: dougnukem: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-ruby
[2013-04-12 21:46:09 -0400] btm: javmorin: easier talking about development stuff in here than the help channel. I'm trying to write a couple tests but getting into ruby/rspec stuff I'm not sure about. stay tuned.
[2013-04-12 21:46:28 -0400] javmorin: ok
[2013-04-12 21:46:35 -0400] javmorin: did  you see my comments in the other channel?
[2013-04-12 21:47:46 -0400] javmorin: basically that first test is the bare minimum to verify proper version detection. Another way to go about it would be to add a 'instance metadata api version' variable to the metadata result that can be checked
[2013-04-12 21:48:24 -0400] javmorin: so the fact that the .should_not be_empty fails is just because it's not set up with enough mocked details to provide that
[2013-04-12 21:56:31 -0400] miketheman: anyone running a recent chef-server that could test something in the ui real quick?
[2013-04-12 21:56:44 -0400] miketheman: want to know if its only on hosted or a general bug
[2013-04-12 21:57:06 -0400] miketheman: run: `knife tag create <somenode> newtag`
[2013-04-12 21:57:36 -0400] miketheman: visit node in ui, see section titled "Tags" and see if it shows.
[2013-04-12 21:57:58 -0400] miketheman: if not, examine attributes for the 'tags' attribute and it should show up there.
[2013-04-12 22:08:42 -0400] btm: javmorin: I saw. getting advice from our rspec ninja right now.
[2013-04-12 22:09:13 -0400] javmorin: just making sure :-)
[2013-04-12 22:31:56 -0400] btm: javmorin: cherry pick https://github.com/btm/ohai/commit/b63509af18cf725f3209fbbce90f7eb5e808353c into your branch and work on getting those to pass.
[2013-04-12 22:32:03 -0400] btm: javmorin: I'm gonna head out for the weekend shortly.
[2013-04-12 22:33:41 -0400] javmorin: ok.. I'll take a crack at it
[2013-04-12 22:33:53 -0400] javmorin: what exceptions should I be raising?
[2013-04-12 22:34:37 -0400] javmorin: I see a catch-all "raise_error" check, but not specific exceptions
[2013-04-12 22:35:18 -0400] javmorin: and unfortunately one of the tests is not really possible
[2013-04-12 22:35:31 -0400] javmorin: (the mis-ordering one)
[2013-04-12 22:35:50 -0400] javmorin: ec2 has dated and non-dated versions
[2013-04-12 22:36:16 -0400] javmorin: they should be returned in historic order
[2013-04-12 22:36:33 -0400] btm: javmorin: yeah, I'd probably just raise (RuntimeError). We don't have many specific exceptions in Ohai.
[2013-04-12 22:37:49 -0400] btm: javmorin: That's fine, except that a number of other clouds emulate the ec2 metadata service and I'm not sure those folks always act the same way. That given, we might be screwed anyway, but we should at least think about potential order issues, even if our answer is that we can't do anything about them.
[2013-04-12 22:37:52 -0400] javmorin: in any case I will do what I can with this over the weekend. Can I presume there isn't going to be an ohai release till next week then?
[2013-04-12 22:40:49 -0400] btm: javmorin: yeah, I'll make sure this gets in. we're not shipping ohai or a chef-client within a week or two.
[2013-04-12 22:41:01 -0400] btm: getting merge passes done now..
[2013-04-12 22:41:32 -0400] javmorin: ok.. just trying to figure out if I need to drop everything and get this done in the next 20 minutes or if it can wait till later tonight
[2013-04-12 22:42:19 -0400] javmorin: I'll re-open the issue, and will mark it fixed when everything is pushed/updated
[2013-04-12 22:48:40 -0400] btm: javmorin: it can wait a bit, I'll make sure it gets in.
[2013-04-12 22:49:08 -0400] javmorin: understood, thanks for taking the time to sync up on this
[2013-04-12 23:32:58 -0400] javmorin: btm: in case you are still around, I've updated the pull request with all specs passing
[2013-04-12 23:33:11 -0400] javmorin: enjoy your weekend
