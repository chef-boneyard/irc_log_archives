[2013-04-26 05:14:14 -0400] github-bawt: chef/mm/reporting-client-update/rename-action 0fdfb36 mmzyk: Rename action from begin to start
[2013-04-26 16:55:39 -0400] migrane: :)
[2013-04-26 16:56:55 -0400] migrane: how does one run a recipe from a cookbook after the initial bootstrap ? got a recipe that does some maintenance on a bunch of files that would need to be run from time to time
[2013-04-26 16:57:38 -0400] migrane: I should say I would like to see if one would be able to run this from a chef workstation via knife or something similar
[2013-04-26 17:02:17 -0400] juliancdunn: migrane: you mean like chef-apply?
[2013-04-26 17:04:31 -0400] migrane: juliancdunn: I guess as long as I can run it from the chef workstation  running it manually on the host does not work as it cannot access the data bag thats hosted on the chef server
[2013-04-26 17:08:06 -0400] jcampbell: migrane: missed the first half of this is the idea that you're running chef-apply on a recipe on the your workstation rather than the target node? (i was asking about this earlier)
[2013-04-26 17:11:26 -0400] migrane: jcampbell: so here is the scenario  I have 3 web servers web01/02/03  I bootstrap them from them using knife from my chef workstation and assign them a role etc  all is well they get bootstrapped and the cookbooks recipes run appropriately  now  after I have bootstrapped these I want to re-run a recipe from my cookbook  so what I am looking for is a way to run a command or do something on my chef workstation to rerun
[2013-04-26 17:12:11 -0400] jcampbell: ah
[2013-04-26 17:12:21 -0400] jcampbell: could maybe use a combination of knife ssh and chef-apply
[2013-04-26 17:13:48 -0400] migrane: jcampbell: thought of that as well but the challenge there is how to make chef-apply aware of the remote data bag  if i go in the chef cache on say web01 and find the particular recipe and then run chef-apply recipe.rb  its telling me it cannot access the data bag and crashes
[2013-04-26 17:14:30 -0400] jcampbell: migrane: maybe chef-apply is not server aware
[2013-04-26 17:16:46 -0400] jcampbell: migrane: you could knife ssh chef-client -o "recipe[mycookbook::myrecipe]", replacing the current run list with just the recipe you need, then set it back again with node edit
[2013-04-26 17:19:52 -0400] migrane: jcampbell: so you mean do a knife node run_list remove web01 role[web-server]
[2013-04-26 17:20:24 -0400] jcampbell: if you run chef-client -o <run_list> it will replace the current run list with what you pass in to the argument and just run that
[2013-04-26 17:20:25 -0400] migrane: then do a knife node run_list add web01 recipe[mycookbook::myrecipe]
[2013-04-26 17:20:39 -0400] migrane: aha
[2013-04-26 17:20:39 -0400] migrane: ok
[2013-04-26 17:22:42 -0400] migrane: well that should do it :)
[2013-04-26 17:23:30 -0400] migrane: thanks jcampbell
[2013-04-26 17:23:51 -0400] jcampbell: the purist in me asks why not just re-run chef-client with the full run list, but :)
[2013-04-26 17:24:20 -0400] migrane: well the full runlist contains the initial bootstrap recipes meaning reinstall apache etc
[2013-04-26 17:25:19 -0400] migrane: and this particular recipe just does maintenance on some config files  so its ok to run it at bootstrap and any time something changes with the web cluster
[2013-04-26 17:25:22 -0400] migrane: makes sense ?
[2013-04-26 17:25:47 -0400] jcampbell: one solution to that would be to have the initial bootstrap recipes remove themselves from the run list
[2013-04-26 17:26:06 -0400] migrane: how would one do that ?
[2013-04-26 17:26:25 -0400] jcampbell: i haven't done it, i've heard others do it though
[2013-04-26 17:26:48 -0400] jcampbell: another option is to write those bootstrap recipes to check before doing, we call it idempotency
[2013-04-26 17:26:51 -0400] migrane: hmm worth looking into that  since I will never really need to rerun those initial bootstrap recipes
