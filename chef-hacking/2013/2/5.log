[2013-02-05 00:10:42 -0500] mpatel: Anyone here observed chef-solo create multiple <defunct> zombie processes after each run?  I sure could use help figuring why my very simple configuration causes this.
[2013-02-05 00:11:25 -0500] ranjibd: kallistec, c_t there was a pull request to get it working
[2013-02-05 00:12:15 -0500] ranjibd: may be ohai, not chef.. need to confirm
[2013-02-05 00:13:58 -0500] mpatel: i see.  in my case i the <defunct> processes are definitely identified as chef-solo.  I think i remember reading about ohai creating a similar issue.
[2013-02-05 00:32:17 -0500] c_t: ranjibd: in re: Linux/390 or VMS?
[2013-02-05 00:32:34 -0500] ranjibd: linux
[2013-02-05 00:32:39 -0500] c_t: hmm
[2013-02-05 00:32:51 -0500] c_t: I got it working with Debian/390 without any trouble
[2013-02-05 00:32:55 -0500] c_t: under hercules
[2013-02-05 00:32:58 -0500] c_t: had to build from source though
[2013-02-05 00:39:27 -0500] mpatel: hmmm...i am on a fedora box.  i did the install using omnibus packaging.  my node file has one recipe that installs one yum_package: unzip.  invocation of chef-solo works and correctly installs package but leaves behind multiple zombies.
[2013-02-05 00:40:14 -0500] mpatel: on another instance, i installed the chef gem directly with identical results.
[2013-02-05 03:28:55 -0500] mpatel: Resolved!  I brought up a new clean instance.  Did the recommended omnibus package install on a Fedora17 system.  Ran chef-solo against a smoke test config and everything ran fine.  No more defunct zombie processes.  Must've gotten something crossed during the initial install.
[2013-02-05 03:28:55 -0500] mpatel: d
[2013-02-05 05:31:21 -0500] spheromak: looks like knife configure --defaults  is looking for old gem paths. I'll open a ticket if its not already tracked
[2013-02-05 06:05:45 -0500] BryanWB__: ohai chefs!
[2013-02-05 06:14:22 -0500] c_t: ohai, BryanWB__
[2013-02-05 06:14:35 -0500] BryanWB__: hey dude
[2013-02-05 06:14:59 -0500] zpatten: congrats!
[2013-02-05 06:15:05 -0500] c_t: decided to play some of the ol' Doom II
[2013-02-05 06:15:14 -0500] zpatten: mmmm nom nom
[2013-02-05 07:37:30 -0500] github-bawt: [test-kitchen] bryanwb opened pull request #54: add basic instructions (1.0...update_readme)  http://git.io/O6-s7g
[2013-02-05 17:55:17 -0500] c_t: question:
[2013-02-05 17:55:45 -0500] c_t: is there some built-in chef thing for determining the code name of some version of Linux?
[2013-02-05 17:56:53 -0500] jtimberman: c_t: node['lsb']['codename']
[2013-02-05 17:56:55 -0500] jtimberman: iirc
[2013-02-05 17:57:30 -0500] c_t: awezzome
[2013-02-05 17:59:28 -0500] c_t: that simplifies a bunch of stuff
[2013-02-05 18:14:20 -0500] miketheman: github status page is lying right now.
[2013-02-05 18:21:28 -0500] jtimberman: totally
[2013-02-05 18:33:07 -0500] c_t: anyone have a CentOS/RHEL machine handy for a quick question/
[2013-02-05 18:33:08 -0500] c_t: ?
[2013-02-05 18:47:06 -0500] alop: c_t: sure
[2013-02-05 18:50:07 -0500] c_t: alop: curious what node['lsb']['version'] and node['lsb']['codename'] return
[2013-02-05 18:50:21 -0500] c_t: shef will certainly happily tell you
[2013-02-05 18:51:17 -0500] alop: hrm, looks like my JeOS image doesn't include lsb
[2013-02-05 18:51:19 -0500] alop: one sec
[2013-02-05 18:52:06 -0500] c_t: eh, I should just get a VM fired up
[2013-02-05 18:52:13 -0500] c_t: found the CentOS disk
[2013-02-05 18:52:18 -0500] c_t: (image)
[2013-02-05 18:54:03 -0500] alop: sorry, yeah, my lsb version is 'nil' and my codename is 'Final'
[2013-02-05 18:54:06 -0500] alop: not much help there
[2013-02-05 19:00:36 -0500] c_t: no prob
[2013-02-05 19:22:48 -0500] BryanWB: ohai chefs
[2013-02-05 19:24:44 -0500] btm: ohai other Bryan
[2013-02-05 19:27:51 -0500] c_t: ohai
[2013-02-05 19:34:50 -0500] igor_afonov: hi everyone, I've submitted a pull request with fix to an existing ticket, I've added a comment with pull request link, I'm completely lost with JIRA, what should I do next to get it reviewed? Should I mark story as 'Fix Provided'?
[2013-02-05 19:37:10 -0500] BryanWB: igor_afonov, y,  do fix provided
[2013-02-05 19:37:19 -0500] BryanWB: igor_afonov, zdracte btw :)
[2013-02-05 19:40:15 -0500] igor_afonov: thanks Bryan, done
[2013-02-05 19:42:34 -0500] BryanWB: has anyone written a tool or script to catch incompatibility w/ chef 11?
[2013-02-05 19:43:27 -0500] mting923: Hi everyone, I have a stupid question..
[2013-02-05 19:43:32 -0500] mting923: since chef 11 is released
[2013-02-05 19:43:44 -0500] mting923: do I need to login each node and upgrade the client ?
[2013-02-05 19:43:49 -0500] mting923: I am using Windows btw
[2013-02-05 19:47:20 -0500] mattray: BryanWB: chef-client and foodcritic have been complaining for awhile, but I found additional stuff when i started using 11
[2013-02-05 19:47:48 -0500] BryanWB: mattray, additional stuff that broke?
[2013-02-05 19:48:14 -0500] mattray: Chef::ShellOut being replaced by Mixlib::ShellOut
[2013-02-05 19:48:32 -0500] BryanWB: argh
[2013-02-05 19:48:59 -0500] mattray: btm: was that in the release notes?
[2013-02-05 19:50:00 -0500] mattray: I had another recipe where I set foo = node['a']['b'] and then tried to append stuff to foo
[2013-02-05 19:50:01 -0500] BryanWB: i really wish i could clone right fnichol now
[2013-02-05 19:50:13 -0500] mattray: that wasn't kosher, but uncaught by previous warnings
[2013-02-05 19:51:55 -0500] btm: BryanWB: I taked to Andrew Crump a few minutes ago. He's planning on doing some work on foodcritic to catch things, but could really use patches/help.
[2013-02-05 19:52:12 -0500] BryanWB: that would be f'ing great
[2013-02-05 19:53:22 -0500] btm: mattray: Chef::Shellout -> Mixlib::Shellout isn't in the breaking changes list: http://docs.opscode.com/breaking_changes_chef_11.html
[2013-02-05 19:55:03 -0500] mattray: ahh, I guess technically it's just a warning
[2013-02-05 19:55:03 -0500] mattray: [2013-02-04T10:33:04-06:00] WARN: Chef::ShellOut is deprecated, please use Mixlib::ShellOut
[2013-02-05 20:03:47 -0500] BryanWB: mattray, how to u append to an array that is a node attribute?
[2013-02-05 20:04:12 -0500] BryanWB: node.set[:foo] = [1,2]
[2013-02-05 20:04:23 -0500] jtimberman: BryanWB: i just did this recently
[2013-02-05 20:04:30 -0500] mattray: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nova/commit/7c7da3f27378daa028e008a4db248682555b71f2
[2013-02-05 20:04:31 -0500] jtimberman: let me find it
[2013-02-05 20:04:57 -0500] mattray: BryanWB: I went from monkeying with it in the recipe to doing it in the attributes file
[2013-02-05 20:05:25 -0500] mattray: the recipe technique didn't add it to the node, just to the runtime
[2013-02-05 20:05:38 -0500] mattray: so now when I knife node show on that attribute it comes up right
[2013-02-05 20:06:18 -0500] BryanWB: hmm, this could get complicated
[2013-02-05 20:06:48 -0500] BryanWB: node.append  could be a useful helper in cases like this
[2013-02-05 20:06:57 -0500] BryanWB: would be more intutiive
[2013-02-05 20:07:33 -0500] jtimberman: BryanWB: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/openvpn/blob/master/recipes/default.rb#L20-L22
[2013-02-05 20:07:40 -0500] BryanWB: or would `node.set[:foo] << [3,4] ` have the desired affect?
[2013-02-05 20:09:48 -0500] atomic-penguin: Is this a bug or a feature of Chef 11? https://gist.github.com/atomic-penguin/4717224
[2013-02-05 20:14:51 -0500] btm: atomic-penguin: hah. that's a feature. the method is called has_key? calling has_key just creates an attribute called 'has_key'.
[2013-02-05 20:15:09 -0500] btm: atomic-penguin: see the example of that exact thing under 'Attribute mishaps' http://www.opscode.com/blog/2013/02/05/chef-11-in-depth-attributes-changes/
[2013-02-05 20:15:42 -0500] btm: atomic-penguin: Chef 11 no longer creates attributes on the node object via method_missing to avoid that from happening.
[2013-02-05 20:16:42 -0500] BryanWB: jtimberman, argh that's a little tricky but tks for the tip
[2013-02-05 20:18:46 -0500] c_t: well, I can now no longer say I haven't tried using chef-solo
[2013-02-05 20:19:56 -0500] jtimberman: c_t: I've really only used it for setting up Chef Servers :/
[2013-02-05 20:20:17 -0500] jtimberman: and indirectly for vagrant+test kitchen
[2013-02-05 20:20:36 -0500] c_t: jtimberman: I wanted to test a small recipe, without the hassle of digging up the stuff for my hosted chef stuff
[2013-02-05 20:20:42 -0500] c_t: (and doing the needed node pruning)
[2013-02-05 20:21:35 -0500] jtimberman: c_t: chef-apply!
[2013-02-05 20:21:53 -0500] c_t: hmm?
[2013-02-05 20:22:04 -0500] jtimberman: c_t: new in chef 11
[2013-02-05 20:25:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: btm, right-o, the problem seems obvious now.
[2013-02-05 20:31:17 -0500] BryanWB: atomic-penguin, apparently written up here http://www.opscode.com/blog/2013/02/05/chef-11-in-depth-attributes-changes/
[2013-02-05 20:31:23 -0500] BryanWB: the has_key issue
[2013-02-05 20:39:27 -0500] c_t: ahhh
[2013-02-05 20:39:41 -0500] c_t: the apt cookbook's behavior changed a little somewhere along the line
[2013-02-05 22:18:28 -0500] cwj: schisamo: i hear tell that you are sprucing up the jenkins cookbook, do you think it would be interesting/neat/good to integrate the stuff i wrote here? https://github.com/needle-cookbooks/chef-jenkins-job-builder
[2013-02-05 22:23:47 -0500] schisamo: cwj: I wil take a look later today.
[2013-02-05 22:24:06 -0500] schisamo: I'm gonna get my WIP stuff pushed to the actual opscode-cookbooks repo tomorrow probably.
[2013-02-05 22:24:09 -0500] cwj: ok
[2013-02-05 23:43:51 -0500] leifmadsen: w00t! Looking forward to changed to jenkins cookbooks
[2013-02-05 23:44:01 -0500] leifmadsen: I should probably clean up and get my gerrit cookbook published
[2013-02-05 23:44:26 -0500] leifmadsen: cwj: oh nice, I want to get jenkins-job-builder going soon too
[2013-02-05 23:46:50 -0500] cwj: leifmadsen: it is pretty nice
[2013-02-05 23:47:12 -0500] leifmadsen: I've finally just gotten my gerrit cookbook working with ldap integration; was a bit of a pain
[2013-02-05 23:47:27 -0500] leifmadsen: but got it all figured out, and think it's probably pretty generic, so should get it loaded out for public consumption
[2013-02-05 23:47:32 -0500] leifmadsen: I'm sure there are things people could add to it
[2013-02-05 23:47:55 -0500] leifmadsen: then next up is zuul
