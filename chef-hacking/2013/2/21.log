[2013-02-21 11:58:07 -0500] liku: Hello all. I have a node and need t  bootstrap chef-client there. For connection I use user1 with key-based auth but problem is in that that I have a password for sudo execution. The question is how can I set in bootstrap command key for connection to the node and password for using sudo?
[2013-02-21 12:00:14 -0500] liku: using both -i and -P options gives:
[2013-02-21 12:00:14 -0500] liku: bash: /dev/fd/63: No such file or directory
[2013-02-21 12:00:15 -0500] liku: --2013-02-21 11:50:06--  http://opscode.com/chef/install.sh
[2013-02-21 12:00:16 -0500] liku: Resolving opscode.com...
[2013-02-21 12:00:18 -0500] liku: bash: line 74: chef-client: command not found
[2013-02-21 12:01:01 -0500] liku: any thoughts?
[2013-02-21 12:04:24 -0500] liku: @fnichol @jtimberman maybe you could advice something please?
[2013-02-21 12:47:59 -0500] kisoku: l
[2013-02-21 15:32:46 -0500] fnichol: liku_: typically I'll have nodes that I can connect to as root (with `PermitRootLogin without-password` set in sshd_config for key-based auth) or as a user with a passwordless sudo setup. `knife bootstrap` will run 'sudo bash -c '<bootstrap template>' over the ssh connection via Chef::Knife::SSH under the covers. `knife ssh` does have logic to prompt for a password if it detects a sudo password challenge (https://github.com/opscode/chef
[2013-02-21 15:34:24 -0500] fnichol: liku_: if you're getting as far as the omnibus installer and looking for chef-client then it looks like you're getting past the sudo password challenge
[2013-02-21 15:35:36 -0500] liku_: @fnichol so as I understand you I need to change sudoers or sshd settings.
[2013-02-21 15:35:57 -0500] liku_: @fnichol yes, I'm using omnibus installer
[2013-02-21 15:36:27 -0500] fnichol: liku_: I don't think it's required, but I usually go for those simpler cases--gives `knife bootstrap` less hurdles to overcome
[2013-02-21 15:37:25 -0500] liku_: @fnichol got it. thank you
[2013-02-21 15:37:26 -0500] fnichol: liku_: if you still have a failed node that you can log into, do you have a /tmp/stderr file? it might have some more details (the curl progress meter gets sent there by default)
[2013-02-21 15:39:36 -0500] liku_: @fnichol my issue is that user1 needs a password for sudo and I connect using key. So when I run knife with 2 options -i and -P, I get an error
[2013-02-21 15:45:57 -0500] fnichol: liku_: hm, i thought that the ssh knife plugin would throw up a "sudo -p knife sudo password: "
[2013-02-21 15:48:20 -0500] fnichol: schisamo_: morning! would you have a link/ref where i could go to see about generating my own public/private key pair when issuing `knife user --user-key <file>`?
[2013-02-21 15:50:44 -0500] liku_: @fnichol once I got knife sudo password: Enter your password:  but rest of times bash: /dev/fd/63: No such file or directory
[2013-02-21 15:52:38 -0500] fnichol: liku_: ah, in that case there might be something going on with the bootstrap template. by default you get the chef-full "distro" which is https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/bootstrap/chef-full.erb
[2013-02-21 15:57:07 -0500] fnichol: liku_: it's not pretty, but you could copy that erb template into your own chef repo (under .chef/bootstrap/my-chef-full.erb) and add 'set -x' just inside the bash -c '...' block. you can use that "distro" instead by adding `--distro my-chef-full` to your `knife bootstrap` command
[2013-02-21 15:58:38 -0500] fnichol: liku_: that will echo all the commands it's running so maybe we can see where it's failing
[2013-02-21 15:59:41 -0500] liku_: @fnichol ok
[2013-02-21 16:01:34 -0500] spheromak: fnichol: i know doing full infra buildouts ala chef-workflow is out of scope for tk, but is that someting on peoples minds right now ?  I've got some thinly wired together sauce with thor running vagrant/spiceweasel to do full build regressions and dev workstation environments. I am really liking TK, and sorta wondering how i might go about adding the functions i need. Looking for direction/ideas
[2013-02-21 16:04:00 -0500] liku_: @fnichol I get bash: /dev/fd/63: No such file or directory
[2013-02-21 16:04:38 -0500] liku_: @fnichol http://d.pr/i/2JPG
[2013-02-21 16:05:21 -0500] liku_: @fnichol seems now some problems with my node. http://www.ducea.com/2009/02/18/linux-tips-bash-completion-devfd62-no-such-file-or-directory/
[2013-02-21 16:13:14 -0500] liku_: @fnichol thank you for helping. Will try to solve it and the try again

[2013-02-21 17:19:52 -0500] spheromak: hrm im making erchef sit and spin via trying  to use  a single cook on my run_list (glance/master from rcbops).. any way to get more info out of erchef ?
[2013-02-21 17:21:03 -0500] fnichol: liku_, no problem!
[2013-02-21 17:22:47 -0500] fnichol: spheromak, bigger-than-one-node runs in test kitchen are for sure of interest to others. for the moment this would be bitting off a bit too much for a 1.0, but never rule anything out, right?
[2013-02-21 17:23:02 -0500] spheromak: yea for sure.
[2013-02-21 17:23:12 -0500] spheromak: im interested in helpoing make it happen
[2013-02-21 17:23:32 -0500] spheromak: i guess tho prob need to wait a bit for things to settle down before start talking modules ?
[2013-02-21 17:23:34 -0500] fnichol: spheromak, if you're interested we could schedule a quick hangout/skype call to discuss--i'm interested in concrete use cases so this seems right in line
[2013-02-21 17:23:44 -0500] spheromak: yea im down
[2013-02-21 17:24:09 -0500] spheromak: right now i am interested in why erchef is blowing up on a single cooks dep solving.
[2013-02-21 17:24:12 -0500] spheromak: :D
[2013-02-21 17:24:15 -0500] fnichol: spheromak, ya that's what i'm thinking (re: modules). just make sure it's a solid little tool then stretch it a bit more
[2013-02-21 17:24:29 -0500] spheromak: yeap
[2013-02-21 17:25:19 -0500] spheromak: seems like a server module would make sense. like i said already doing alot of that with just vagrant/thor/spice (was uisng chef-workflow)
[2013-02-21 17:25:36 -0500] fnichol: spheromak, would running `chef-server-ctl tail` on the server scare up more details? that's been my favorite lately
[2013-02-21 17:25:44 -0500] spheromak: i like how workflow has abstracted stuff for testing, but for a dev environment i want to get at those boxes/instances a bit more direct
[2013-02-21 17:25:58 -0500] spheromak: fnichol: i love tail, but its not giving me much
[2013-02-21 17:26:07 -0500] spheromak: seems like the calls out to the depsolver are timing out.
[2013-02-21 17:26:15 -0500] fnichol: spheromak, dang :(
[2013-02-21 17:26:16 -0500] spheromak: I belive (hunch) that the server is in a loop
[2013-02-21 17:26:26 -0500] spheromak: due to the fact that cpu is going through the roof
[2013-02-21 17:26:39 -0500] fnichol: haha
[2013-02-21 17:26:44 -0500] spheromak: my laptop has gone thermo
[2013-02-21 17:26:54 -0500] spheromak: so just trying to see if i can get it to run in debug
[2013-02-21 17:26:58 -0500] spheromak: so i can see whats spinning
[2013-02-21 17:27:42 -0500] spheromak: setting up another non-vagrant chef-server right now to see if its reproducable
[2013-02-21 17:28:26 -0500] spheromak: the timeout is apearing as trying to get versions from environemnts..
[2013-02-21 17:28:53 -0500] spheromak: but that works with other stuff. It's def this cook..
[2013-02-21 17:32:50 -0500] spheromak: and continues to spin the beam after the run fails. something is stuck
[2013-02-21 17:38:37 -0500] spheromak: https://gist.github.com/spheromak/f5ad04d21cbdd0a60177 if anyone is interested.
[2013-02-21 17:38:49 -0500] jtimberman: spheromak: you might be interested in Erik H's chef-workflow project if you need something for multiple systems.
[2013-02-21 17:39:50 -0500] spheromak: jtimberman: i used it
[2013-02-21 17:39:59 -0500] jtimberman: well then!
[2013-02-21 17:40:32 -0500] spheromak: and i think its neet, doesn't have chef11 supp, and its a bit of work to make it possible for my developers to hop on the vagrants. Also I want to target openstack/vagrant as the 2 platforms for buildout
[2013-02-21 17:41:03 -0500] spheromak: jtimberman: my 2 cases are build dev environemnts, and build regression automation.
[2013-02-21 17:41:24 -0500] spheromak: dev env can be vagrant or ontop of ostack
[2013-02-21 17:42:27 -0500] spheromak: i've gone back and forth with chef-workflow. I really like it, but I am hoping we can end up with somehting that can cover it all :D
[2013-02-21 17:45:19 -0500] spheromak: ok figured it out
[2013-02-21 17:45:56 -0500] spheromak: this is def a bug. Had a keystone cook, but not the right version for the dep called out in glance metadata. causees the behavior i laid out in the gist.
[2013-02-21 17:46:15 -0500] spheromak: seems like server should be kicking back an error, but iinstead its just spinning
[2013-02-21 18:00:26 -0500] spheromak: CHEF-3921 created.
[2013-02-21 19:02:30 -0500] josephholsten: oi, anyone using data bags with jamie/tk-1.0?
[2013-02-21 19:10:03 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: yes I am! if you have a test/integration/data_bags directory, it'll be used. for example: https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm/tree/master/test/integration/data_bags
[2013-02-21 19:10:23 -0500] josephholsten: ooo
[2013-02-21 19:10:47 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: and if a suite needs a specialized data bags setup, it'll also be picked up under test/integration/my_suite/data_bags (the common one will be ignored then)
[2013-02-21 19:11:02 -0500] josephholsten: I'm getting all our internal cbs on test-kitchen 1.0 nao.
[2013-02-21 19:11:08 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: and same trick for test/integration/roles and test/integration/my_suite/roles
[2013-02-21 19:11:15 -0500] josephholsten: it's annoying. I don't have any bugs to file.
[2013-02-21 19:11:38 -0500] fnichol: against tk-1.0?
[2013-02-21 19:11:43 -0500] josephholsten: ;-p
[2013-02-21 19:11:53 -0500] josephholsten: yep. working perfectly.
[2013-02-21 19:12:27 -0500] josephholsten: just needs docs. which I ought to be helping with after giving seth a hard time.
[2013-02-21 19:13:50 -0500] josephholsten: should I put those in patches to https://github.com/jamie-ci/jamie-ci.github.com?
[2013-02-21 19:15:29 -0500] schisamo_: josephholsten: actual no. sethvargo is working on new test-kitchen docs
[2013-02-21 19:15:38 -0500] schisamo_: I would ask him where he wants patches
[2013-02-21 19:16:16 -0500] josephholsten: ah
[2013-02-21 19:24:33 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten, but yes if you're willing to help we'll make sure there's a place to submit! we're hoping for something just like the jamie-ci.github.com repo (possibly rename it and move).
