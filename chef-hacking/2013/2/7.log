[2013-02-07 00:03:33 -0500] josephholsten: fnichol: any tips on running test-kitchen from your branch?
[2013-02-07 00:04:30 -0500] josephholsten: I'm just using jamie and jamie-vagrant gems atm. I assume the jr-bats bit should work out of the box.
[2013-02-07 00:05:06 -0500] josephholsten: oh, cute. kitchen busser.
[2013-02-07 00:08:07 -0500] fnichol: josephholsten: that's right the jamie-* and jr-* repos and gems seem to be working for now. i'm working to get these projects ported over and renamed in some cases. then if we can get a gem release of test-kitchen v1.0.0.??? the 1.0 branch code should be just as easy to use as the jamie code

[2013-02-07 00:09:09 -0500] josephholsten: something like `gem 'test-kitchen', github: 'opscode/test-kitchen', ref: '1.0'` for testing then?

[2013-02-07 00:10:29 -0500] schisamo: fnichol: let's try to chat tomorrow (it's getting late here)

[2013-02-07 00:10:56 -0500] github-bawt: [chef] btm merged 11.2.0 into master: http://git.io/s4snVA
[2013-02-07 00:11:18 -0500] fnichol: schisamo: sounds good to me, almost have all the projects renamed and ready to go. then i'll switch most of my projects over to kitchen commands
[2013-02-07 00:13:38 -0500] schisamo: \o/

[2013-02-07 20:22:00 -0500] fnichol: btm: congrats on these rapid releases, your release workflow must be getting pretty awesome
[2013-02-07 20:23:13 -0500] btm: fnichol: sort of. I've actually spent the last 24 hours trying to get our omnibus build cluster to get those out. It's awesome in that it's basically one click, but when the build servers have an intermittant problem you have to start over.
[2013-02-07 20:23:29 -0500] btm: but we are definitely almost in awesometown.
[2013-02-07 20:24:11 -0500] fnichol: btm: very exciting. i much prefer visiting awesometown to crazytown any day
[2013-02-07 20:24:29 -0500] btm: H/T schisamo, kallistec and others.
[2013-02-07 20:40:13 -0500] c_t: I was just wondering this morning if omnibus used some sort of prebuilt stuff or built from source
[2013-02-07 20:50:07 -0500] BryanWB: fnichol, np homez we'll work it out, been giving me a chance to dive into the source
[2013-02-07 21:21:13 -0500] yfeldblum: fnichol, btm, sounds too devopsy to be real
[2013-02-07 21:21:53 -0500] yfeldblum: fnichol, btm, pretty sure btm spent the last 24 hours copying files around and running `make` by hand, and forgetting one file or another because he forgot about using git
[2013-02-07 21:26:36 -0500] miketheman: yfeldblum: bwahaha
[2013-02-07 21:27:02 -0500] miketheman: btm: what's up with the revison cycle? we're getting version churn
[2013-02-07 21:27:10 -0500] miketheman: 11, 11.0.2, 11.0.4, etc
[2013-02-07 21:27:14 -0500] miketheman: why so many releases?
[2013-02-07 21:28:09 -0500] miketheman: btm: I did, that sucked truly. But since it was promptly handled on net-ssh end with yanking, did that justify moar releases?
[2013-02-07 21:31:03 -0500] jtimberman: miketheman: they yanked after we were already releasing.
[2013-02-07 21:31:14 -0500] jtimberman: like, 11.2.0 rubygem was live before the versions were yanked.
[2013-02-07 21:31:21 -0500] jtimberman: if i recall the timing correctly
[2013-02-07 21:32:05 -0500] yfeldblum: jtimberman, are you taking into account relativistic light-cones and how that impacts correct interpretations of "past" and "future"?
[2013-02-07 21:33:23 -0500] jtimberman: yfeldblum: that was not part of my time criteria
[2013-02-07 21:35:10 -0500] btm: miketheman: prompt is relative. briefly looking at the irc logs, there was four hours between net-ssh breakage and the beginning of yanking. the chef gem alone gets thousands of installations a day, which means a 1000+ installations were failing before the net-ssh author did anything about it.
[2013-02-07 21:36:09 -0500] fnichol: yeah, that was a shame. glad they resolved it a bit better upstream
[2013-02-07 21:36:11 -0500] btm: miketheman: I'm glad mitchellh got him to do the right thing, but that's not common in my/our experience with rubygems.org. we built, tested and released new versions as soon as we could to unblock those people.
[2013-02-07 21:36:27 -0500] yfeldblum: or maybe it's just 10 installations per day, plus a badly-written curl-bot?
[2013-02-07 21:38:09 -0500] btm: given the information we had, I stand behind my call to release new versions with relaxed gem constraints. if you don't want the latest version, there are many facilities in chef and patterns out there to build using a version of your choice.
[2013-02-07 21:38:49 -0500] ranjibd: +1 for relaxed gem constraints
[2013-02-07 21:45:38 -0500] kallistec: miketheman: also, the server and client versions are uncoupled. server version 11.0.0 was yanked before it was live, 11.0.4 was a security fix on top of 11.0.2
