[2013-05-22 01:58:35 -0400] github-bawt: [kitchen-vagrant] josephholsten opened pull request #25: add rackspace support (master...add-rackspace)  http://git.io/Igcwvw
[2013-05-22 12:43:16 -0400] jwitrick: Can anyone help me with a mocking question relating to chefspec and Mixlib?
[2013-05-22 12:47:14 -0400] Cope: jwitrick: Is that actually the question you want to ask? ;)
[2013-05-22 12:47:58 -0400] jwitrick: How can I stub out Mixlib::ShellOut.new("test123").run_command to return "some value"
[2013-05-22 14:06:07 -0400] RoboticCheese: jwitrick: Something like https://gist.github.com/RoboticCheese/5627750 ?
[2013-05-22 14:09:53 -0400] jwitrick: Perfect. thanks
[2013-05-22 14:11:31 -0400] RoboticCheese: NP
[2013-05-22 14:19:04 -0400] jwitrick: Is there a way to verify that a 'Chef::Application.fatal!' command is executed with out killing hte chefspec test ?
[2013-05-22 15:30:43 -0400] ctracey: there may be a simple answer to this, but having trouble coming up with a viable solution. trying to get some chefspec coverage on a LWRP that makes successive calls to shell_out - i know, it sounds weird, but it makes sense.  Perfectly capable of writing a custom matcher to handle the validation, but having difficulty finding a place where I could store intermediate state within the resource in order to verify these commands be
[2013-05-22 15:30:43 -0400] ctracey: ing run.
[2013-05-22 15:31:26 -0400] ctracey: thought about using execute, but that will not suit my needs here
[2013-05-22 15:32:51 -0400] ctracey: im sure I could cover this with an integration test/kitchen, but looking for something different.
[2013-05-22 15:35:51 -0400] rayrod2030: Anyone using test-kitchen and vagrant for windows vm instances?
[2013-05-22 17:33:40 -0400] atomic-penguin: fnichol, is there a way to specify 'destroy=never' and 'parallel' in the kitchen.yml?
[2013-05-22 17:40:25 -0400] ssd7: atomic-penguin: That should be fixed on master but I'm not sure if it has been released yet
[2013-05-22 18:04:47 -0400] atomic-penguin: ssd7, its not on the master README
[2013-05-22 18:06:17 -0400] ssd7: atomic-penguin: https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen/commit/43aa9837b34d5209ab7f6872d269c0d378b2980e
[2013-05-22 18:06:33 -0400] ssd7: you should just be able to use -d never if you have that commit
[2013-05-22 18:15:27 -0400] atomic-penguin: ssd7, I wasn't wondering if it would honor the option on the command line.  Was wondering if I could specify those options in the YAML, like https://gist.github.com/atomic-penguin/5629656#file-kitchen-yml-L4
[2013-05-22 18:16:21 -0400] atomic-penguin: ssd7, for all I know that gets passed on to kitchen/cli.rb though
[2013-05-22 18:17:01 -0400] ssd7: ahh
[2013-05-22 18:17:15 -0400] ssd7: wow
[2013-05-22 18:17:19 -0400] ssd7: I fail at reading today
[2013-05-22 18:20:08 -0400] atomic-penguin: :)
[2013-05-22 18:45:35 -0400] kisoku: suppose I have a LWRP or HWRP that absolutely must include_recipe on something
[2013-05-22 18:45:53 -0400] kisoku: what would be the least offensive way to go about doing it
[2013-05-22 18:46:39 -0400] kisoku: run_context.include_recipe ?
[2013-05-22 18:48:13 -0400] kisoku:  jwitrick: I have an example of stubbing shell_out somewhere
[2013-05-22 18:48:17 -0400] kisoku: give me a second
[2013-05-22 18:49:38 -0400] jwitrick: kisoku: I followed this example: https://gist.github.com/RoboticCheese/5627750
[2013-05-22 18:51:12 -0400] kisoku: good thing because I can't find my code anymore :-P
[2013-05-22 18:51:21 -0400] kisoku: and it probably wasn't very good to begin with
[2013-05-22 18:51:23 -0400] kisoku: :-)
[2013-05-22 20:18:27 -0400] fnichol_: ggolin, yes data bags are supported in Test Kitchen. If you make a `test/integration/data_bags` directory, Test Kitchen will use that. Similar for roles (in `test/integration/roles`)
[2013-05-22 20:19:22 -0400] fnichol_: bloudermilk, Test Kitchen is most helpful if you are writing a Chef cookbook and want to run it across more than one platform/version in an automated way
[2013-05-22 20:20:24 -0400] fnichol_: bloudermilk, additionally, Test Kitchen gives you a way to run verification tests after Chef is finished. it's optional, but very handy
[2013-05-22 20:22:02 -0400] fnichol_: rayrod2030, full support for Test Kitchen running on Windows nodes is still coming and i'll need help on that for sure. it's looking like we'll get tk running on windows workstations first as it is really close
[2013-05-22 20:23:36 -0400] fnichol_: atomic-penguin, at the moment those aren't things options available in the kitchen.yml. the reasoning being that both of those strategies could vary on each invocation (sometimes it's nice to run a few in serial, etc)
[2013-05-22 20:24:30 -0400] fnichol_: atomic-penguin, having said that, the destroy strategy could be added in the kitchen.yml so that you could drop a default into your "global" config in ~/.kitchen/config.yml. that's still in master, so guess we better get a new gem release :)
[2013-05-22 21:28:02 -0400] github-bawt: [omnibus-chef] lamont-granquist force-pushed lcg/AIX from 00e23d5 to fa7819e: http://git.io/vnTRUQ
[2013-05-22 21:28:03 -0400] github-bawt: omnibus-chef/lcg/AIX fa7819e Lamont Granquist: pull deps from lcg/AIX branches
[2013-05-22 21:32:24 -0400] eliklein: hm, does the template search path use platform_family yet? :)
[2013-05-22 22:41:27 -0400] moxford: Does Chef11 has an Erlang-style DSL, or does it still have to use the Ruby-based DSL?
[2013-05-22 22:46:06 -0400] coderanger: moxford: Its all still ruby
[2013-05-22 22:46:21 -0400] coderanger: moxford: Only the server is in Erlang, chef-client and friends are still Ruby
[2013-05-22 22:52:41 -0400] moxford: Any plans to move away from Ruby that anyone knows?
[2013-05-22 22:52:48 -0400] coderanger: Nope
[2013-05-22 22:53:01 -0400] moxford: Bummer.  :P
[2013-05-22 22:53:04 -0400] moxford: okay, thank you!
[2013-05-22 22:53:12 -0400] coderanger: Though I've threatened to embed Python as a library and try and make a Python recipe loader somehow
[2013-05-22 22:53:23 -0400] coderanger: it would be for fun though, not an actual suggestion someone use such madness
[2013-05-22 22:54:03 -0400] moxford: Some of the best project are born of madness :)
[2013-05-22 22:54:12 -0400] coderanger: Pretty sure 'Erlang DSL' is a contradiction in terms anyway
[2013-05-22 22:54:44 -0400] moxford: I actually said "Erlang-style DSL"
[2013-05-22 22:55:11 -0400] moxford: So I don't have to go learn Ruby just for the Chef syntax.  I'm lazy.
[2013-05-22 22:55:30 -0400] coderanger: http://docs.opscode.com/just_enough_ruby_for_chef.html
[2013-05-22 22:55:31 -0400] moxford: Was hoping that with the shift to Erlang, maybe there's a more familiar syntax for the recipes.
[2013-05-22 22:55:33 -0400] coderanger: You aren't that lazy, trust me
[2013-05-22 22:56:00 -0400] coderanger: The amount of Ruby you need to know fits on a single 8.5x11 sheet
[2013-05-22 22:56:20 -0400] moxford: Interesting.  Thanks for that link missed it somehow in exploring the website.
[2013-05-22 22:56:47 -0400] coderanger: This channel is generally about questions when working on the chef codebase itself
[2013-05-22 22:56:55 -0400] coderanger: If you have questions about using Chef, you are better off in #chef
[2013-05-22 22:57:09 -0400] moxford: No one in there answered the question, so I jumped in here.
[2013-05-22 22:57:29 -0400] moxford: Sorry if it's the wrong space to ask that one.
[2013-05-22 22:57:39 -0400] coderanger: Consider it an anomaly that anyone is watching for questions in here ;-)
[2013-05-22 22:57:48 -0400] moxford: Noted.
[2013-05-22 22:58:07 -0400] moxford: Will bail out to keep SN-ratios good.  Thanks again for the info!
