[2013-05-09 14:02:59 -0400] jwitrick: BryanWB: Im looking at the kitchen-xlc project now. And I am running into a few issues. Specifically: https://gist.github.com/jwitrick/5547609
[2013-05-09 14:29:16 -0400] gchristensen: is there a way to indicate to test-kitchen not to destroy the boxes after a successful build?
[2013-05-09 14:46:00 -0400] BryanWB: jwitrick: will have to get back to you doing podcast now
[2013-05-09 14:47:10 -0400] jwitrick: no worries. I think the issue is I dont have xlc on my mac. Im trying to install it now
[2013-05-09 15:13:25 -0400] gchristensen: is there a way to indicate to test-kitchen v1 to run chef with a log-level of debug?

[2013-05-09 16:22:22 -0400] potatosalad: does anyone happen to know why Chef::Provider::Service::Solaris would throw a Chef::Exceptions::UnsupportedAction when trying to use the reload action on a service?
[2013-05-09 16:22:32 -0400] potatosalad: it looks as though it's supported to me: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/11.4.4/lib/chef/provider/service/solaris.rb#L57-L59
[2013-05-09 17:28:08 -0400] ccasey: schisamo: the smartos build lab stuff looks like it expects your using SDC? not just a standalone smartos env?
[2013-05-09 17:29:49 -0400] podz: hi, where can i find the source code for erchef?
[2013-05-09 17:30:20 -0400] podz: all sorts of opscode github repos spread about, i couldn't find one of them with actual erlang source code
[2013-05-09 17:31:53 -0400] ccasey: the readme at https://github.com/opscode/erchef talks about getting the source to build it

[2013-05-09 18:31:12 -0400] podz: browing that site with a web browser - there are no erlang source files
[2013-05-09 18:35:32 -0400] ccasey: i didnt try it, just saw that had potential to be what you were after
[2013-05-09 18:38:58 -0400] spox: podz: you just need to use the public end point

[2013-05-09 18:44:20 -0400] fnichol: gchristensen, re tk/destroy: yes the kitchen CLI has 3 different destroy modes for the 'test' action. --destroy=passing is the default
[2013-05-09 18:44:46 -0400] spox: podz: look at the reltool file. it has the list of packages it builds
[2013-05-09 18:44:51 -0400] fnichol: gchristensen: --destroy=always will always nuke an instance when it's done (errors or not)
[2013-05-09 18:44:55 -0400] spox: the chef specific ones you can find in the org
[2013-05-09 18:45:09 -0400] spox: chef_wm, for example
[2013-05-09 18:45:10 -0400] gchristensen: excellent. I've found my way out of the terrible nightmare I was in yesterday, and now test-kitchen is a pleasure :P
[2013-05-09 18:45:12 -0400] fnichol: gchristensen: --destroy=never will never destroy (errors or not)
[2013-05-09 18:46:25 -0400] fnichol: gchristensen, re: log levels: yes, you can pass '--log-level debug' on any of the action commands (create, converge, setup, verify, test, even login). chef's log levels will be set properly as well
[2013-05-09 18:48:01 -0400] gchristensen: is test-kitchen under the OpsCode CLA?
[2013-05-09 18:48:57 -0400] fnichol: gchristensen: currently yes, but we'll see if it stays that way long term. are you signed up by chance?
[2013-05-09 18:49:41 -0400] gchristensen: I am :) to send a PR does it need to go through the Jira ticket business?
[2013-05-09 18:53:08 -0400] fnichol: gchristensen: hehe, thankfully no :) we're using straight up github issues and pull requests at least
[2013-05-09 18:53:39 -0400] gchristensen: cool. the Jira workflow is 99% of the time more than I want to figure out
[2013-05-09 19:02:20 -0400] github-bawt: [test-kitchen] grahamc opened pull request #105: Expand documentation around run-time switches. (1.0...patch-1)  http://git.io/Kg3KbA
[2013-05-09 19:02:22 -0400] gchristensen: there you are fnichol
[2013-05-09 19:29:42 -0400] schisamo: ccasey: re: smartos build stuff. yeah for now it made that assumption. if we have a stable smartos basebox we can switch that up. feel free to open a PR.
[2013-05-09 19:30:25 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol: heyyyyyyyyyy
[2013-05-09 19:30:31 -0400] jtimberman: schisamo: heyyyyyyyyyy
[2013-05-09 19:31:11 -0400] ccasey: can you explain the "stable smartos basebox" a bit more
[2013-05-09 19:32:18 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol, schisamo: so, for the generated .kitchen.yml, the canonical image has provisoners installed, which we probably don't want.
[2013-05-09 19:33:07 -0400] jtimberman: julian is working making bento "provionerless" definitions and will be building boxes that don't have anything, so the omnibus plugin or kitchen.yml directive can be used to get the omnibus install
[2013-05-09 19:47:20 -0400] cwj: jtimberman: is bento assumed to work for generating vmware fusion boxes with vmware fusion 5? i did not have success with it on first try
[2013-05-09 19:48:07 -0400] cwj: assumed/thought to be/known to be even
[2013-05-09 19:56:18 -0400] podz: i thought chef 11 was totally rewritten in erlang, yet i got the source code and it seems that chef-expander is still written in ruby
[2013-05-09 19:58:19 -0400] cwj: podz: only the API service was rewritten in erlang
[2013-05-09 19:58:24 -0400] cwj: http://www.opscode.com/blog/2013/02/15/the-making-of-erchef-the-chef-11-server/
[2013-05-09 20:01:23 -0400] podz: ok, thanks cwj
[2013-05-09 20:02:15 -0400] podz: i think i will try porting chef-expander from ruby to erlang
[2013-05-09 20:03:07 -0400] schisamo: podz: to be honest eliminating chef-expander completely is probably the right approach.
[2013-05-09 20:03:42 -0400] schisamo: we may not need the rabbitmq layer now that the API is written in Erlang. we haven't had much time to dig into that theory though.
[2013-05-09 20:04:44 -0400] podz: solr is not as fast as rabbit
[2013-05-09 20:05:25 -0400] jtimberman: cwj: i don't think it is.
[2013-05-09 20:05:49 -0400] cwj: ok, thanks :)
[2013-05-09 20:05:53 -0400] Mithrandir: dropping rabbit would make me very happy.
[2013-05-09 20:05:56 -0400] schisamo: sure...but Erlang can handle lots of processes and concurrency well (unlike Ruby).
[2013-05-09 20:06:18 -0400] schisamo: Rabbit was there to help the Ruby...
[2013-05-09 20:06:46 -0400] schisamo: anyway nothing has been decided...just wanted to throw that out there.
[2013-05-09 20:06:47 -0400] Mithrandir: if we could also drop solr and just use the search in postgres, that would make me even happier.
[2013-05-09 20:07:29 -0400] podz: postgres is pretty slow compared to solr, and solr is pretty slow compared to rabbit
[2013-05-09 20:07:50 -0400] schisamo: sort of now comparing apples
[2013-05-09 20:07:54 -0400] schisamo: s/now/not/
[2013-05-09 20:08:16 -0400] schisamo: different tools that serve very different jobs
[2013-05-09 20:08:24 -0400] podz: it's a sequential comparison
[2013-05-09 20:08:42 -0400] Mithrandir: except rabbitmq doesn't solve any of the problems that solr or postgres do?
[2013-05-09 20:09:00 -0400] Mithrandir: and tbh, I'd happily trade speed for not having Yet Another Service That Breaks on my system.
[2013-05-09 20:09:18 -0400] podz: rabbitmq is there for one reason - to handle load spikes - solr can not write that fast
[2013-05-09 20:09:38 -0400] podz: it gives solr the time to do it's work at it's own pace
[2013-05-09 20:09:53 -0400] schisamo: But the Erlang process could also handle that same load spike....
[2013-05-09 20:10:06 -0400] schisamo: again...Rabbit is from a time when the API was in Ruby
[2013-05-09 20:10:24 -0400] podz: rabbit is erlang
[2013-05-09 20:10:43 -0400] schisamo: podz: yeah I know :)
[2013-05-09 20:10:53 -0400] podz: going to have a smoke...
[2013-05-09 20:41:58 -0400] podz: i quite like rabbitmq for several reasons
[2013-05-09 20:43:04 -0400] podz: polyglot message mediation is one strong reason, that and being implemented in erlang
[2013-05-09 21:32:38 -0400] fnichol: jtimberman: heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[2013-05-09 21:34:34 -0400] fnichol: jtimberman, re: canonical images: ah crap, thiner is what we want!
[2013-05-09 21:35:25 -0400] spox: i saw that story and had quite the laugh

[2013-05-09 22:02:13 -0400] jtimberman: spox: yeah it had promise at first, they were going to be provisoner-less like the EC2 images they provide.
[2013-05-09 22:26:15 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol: this seems like a crazy amount of output: https://gist.github.com/jtimberman/5551083
[2013-05-09 23:37:39 -0400] gchristensen: fnichol: is my PR on the right track on those docs? Or would there be a better place to put them?
