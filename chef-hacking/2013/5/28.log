[2013-05-28 05:43:41 -0400] BryanWB: is there an easy way to add deprecation warnings inside an lwrp?

[2013-05-28 05:56:39 -0400] BryanWB: jtimberman: i was aware of that, and was hoping for something more elegant :(
[2013-05-28 06:02:31 -0400] jtimberman: BryanWB: i don't know of something more elegant.
[2013-05-28 06:02:41 -0400] jtimberman: BryanWB: other than making a halper method
[2013-05-28 06:02:53 -0400] BryanWB: jtimberman: oh vell, may have to do that some time
[2013-05-28 06:04:17 -0400] jtimberman: unrelated, my least favorite thing when waiting for long-running test-kitchen suites to finish is abrupt endings from virtual box errors

[2013-05-28 19:48:30 -0400] btm: petecheslock: I'm having problems getting the 9.1-amd64 image to boot in anything. kvm gives me an error about it not being a bootable disk.
[2013-05-28 19:49:08 -0400] petecheslock: btm - hmm, let me check that out.  were the other ones able to boot, or similar issue there?
[2013-05-28 19:51:47 -0400] btm: petecheslock: I haven't tried any others yet. I started by importanting that one into Glance but got nothing when I started an instance on it, so I carefully downloaded it to the edge of the world out here and it won't boot on my kvm box either.
[2013-05-28 19:52:28 -0400] btm: I'll try dyn-virtualbox-freebsd-8.3-i386.box.
[2013-05-28 20:03:11 -0400] btm: petecheslock: VirtualBox reports "Could not get the storage format of the medium '/path/to/foo.box' (VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED)." when I try to create a VM with the 9.1 virtualbox image.
[2013-05-28 20:04:05 -0400] petecheslock: btm - Oh! my bad - I should have been more explicit.  those are vagrant boxes.  if you want the pure ovf's and vmdk's - you just have to tar zxvf them
[2013-05-28 20:04:42 -0400] petecheslock: when you untar them you'll end up with 3 files, box-disk1.vmdk, box.ovf, and Vagrantfile (which you can nuke)
[2013-05-28 20:05:22 -0400] petecheslock: i *think* from there you can register the ovf with virtualbox, or convert to raw to import into openstack (although I haven't done that part, schisamo mentioned it was easy to do).
[2013-05-28 20:06:01 -0400] petecheslock: going to test import that into fusion and see what it looks like
[2013-05-28 20:09:02 -0400] petecheslock: btm - ok, imported into vmware - only complained about the vbox service.  http://pete.io/p8e7/1jdh3DvA
[2013-05-28 20:09:16 -0400] petecheslock: after untaring it from the .box file.
[2013-05-28 20:12:50 -0400] btm: gah. openstack master has a buggy version of kvm-img.
[2013-05-28 20:13:19 -0400] btm: petecheslock: do you know if these images have virtio drivers on them?
[2013-05-28 20:14:07 -0400] petecheslock: btm probably not - but I could pull them down, add that and repackage them just for import for you guys.
[2013-05-28 20:14:23 -0400] petecheslock: if we need the guests to have them of course
[2013-05-28 20:16:54 -0400] btm: petecheslock: I read on a forum that it was needed for OS but not for kvm, which was what prompted me to try them locally on kvm.
[2013-05-28 20:17:25 -0400] btm: petecheslock: http://cssoss.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/bundling-freebsd-image-for-openstack/
[2013-05-28 20:20:31 -0400] petecheslock: btm: gotcha.  Let me repackage the 9.1 64bit build with the drivers.  I don't have a kvm or openstack here to test with - so i think we just need to convert the ovf/vmdk over after it's packaged.
[2013-05-28 20:31:03 -0400] btm: I'm working on adding Ubuntu Raring to our openstack cluster so I can start an instancein Seattle that doesn't have these qemu-img bugs to use for converting.
[2013-05-28 20:38:51 -0400] s2r2: btm:  What are you starting with?  using the images from uec-images.ubuntu.com things work totally seamless
[2013-05-28 20:39:29 -0400] s2r2: (but I haven't read the log, so this might be a totally useless comment)
[2013-05-28 20:40:37 -0400] btm: s2r2: http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/raring/current/, just playing with glance conventions until it works.
[2013-05-28 20:41:40 -0400] s2r2: bare/bare with the -disk1.img works for me
[2013-05-28 20:41:52 -0400] s2r2: bare/qcow2, sorry
[2013-05-28 20:41:57 -0400] s2r2: (container/disk)
[2013-05-28 20:45:09 -0400] btm: turns out I'm wasting my time anyway and they're already there.
