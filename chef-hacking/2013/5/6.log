[2013-05-06 10:31:35 -0400] BryanWB: jtimberman: i was thinking of extending ark to allow downloading from s3, as the upstream, would u be amenable to that?
[2013-05-06 14:11:12 -0400] jtimberman: BryanWB_: there's some changes coming to the underlying file provider that will make an s3_remote_file a lot easier to do.
[2013-05-06 14:11:52 -0400] BryanWB_: jtimberman: kewl, how soon coming? next week or in a couple months?
[2013-05-06 14:12:13 -0400] BryanWB_: no rush, just if in few months then i need to hack something myself
[2013-05-06 14:31:51 -0400] jtimberman: BryanWB_: i don't really have an approximation on timeframe. WIP is in this branch: https://github.com/opscode/chef/tree/file-refactor
[2013-05-06 14:32:10 -0400] jtimberman: there may be incompatibilities that wait for chef 12, but lamont is the best to ask.
[2013-05-06 14:45:45 -0400] BryanWB_: jtimberman: tks, that the code is already public is helpful
[2013-05-06 15:30:51 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, why not do a fog_remote_file instead?
[2013-05-06 15:46:44 -0400] jtimberman: yfeldblum: sure, someone could write that.

[2013-05-06 19:16:30 -0400] schisamo: petecheslock: drat! I was able to recreate locally. Will try to get that fixed later today.
[2013-05-06 19:17:02 -0400] petecheslock: schisamo - cool, sounds good - working around it for now - so it's not major - trying to build some 8.1/8.2/8.3 bento boxes for testing more builds
[2013-05-06 19:20:57 -0400] chris---: it looks like the same flags are used to build ruby, but i'm guessing it doesnt link the same way because it works, didnt dig
[2013-05-06 19:43:03 -0400] schisamo: petecheslock: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4163
[2013-05-06 19:44:56 -0400] schisamo: yeah it's the "-Wl,-rpath" in LDFLAGS in the ncurses software def. FreeBSD will want a "-R" instead.
[2013-05-06 19:46:41 -0400] chris---: i've got another fbsd question for you
[2013-05-06 19:47:07 -0400] chris---: i hit this trying to make a omnibus install for jails
[2013-05-06 19:47:21 -0400] chris---: and using ezjails /usr isnt writable
[2013-05-06 19:47:43 -0400] chris---: so once you get the omnibus to build, its no good for install in an ezjails based jail
[2013-05-06 19:47:57 -0400] chris---: it could be done into the basejail i suppose
[2013-05-06 19:48:53 -0400] chris---: but i wonder what the feeling would be about /usr/local/bin rather than /usr/bin based install from the omnibus installer
[2013-05-06 19:55:55 -0400] KarlHungus: hey!
[2013-05-06 19:57:13 -0400] KarlHungus: chris---: it would be preferred, imho. though, you could always assign defaults by OS and override with a envvar like PREFIX, i think
[2013-05-06 19:57:45 -0400] KarlHungus: petecheslock: havent looked at the older bento stuff yet
[2013-05-06 20:01:27 -0400] chris---: I see other examples of os specific things here and there
[2013-05-06 20:01:54 -0400] chris---: guess the current issue came with the smartos specific pulled and the LDFLAGS was added
[2013-05-06 20:02:01 -0400] chris---: speaking of specifics
[2013-05-06 20:02:34 -0400] KarlHungus: ah
[2013-05-06 20:02:37 -0400] chris---: i can of course make my own version, but it would be nice to have work I could share if it was desireable
[2013-05-06 20:02:42 -0400] chris---: a desireable change
[2013-05-06 20:03:10 -0400] chris---: greater use may prompt me to get it done than if its just for myself
[2013-05-06 20:05:38 -0400] chris---: especially since this was just me experimenting, and in true form I got way off in the weeds immediately
[2013-05-06 20:05:58 -0400] chris---: i know more about building the omnibus installer than i know about using chef so far
[2013-05-06 21:33:28 -0400] schisamo: petecheslock KarlHungus this change in omnibus-software fixes things https://gist.github.com/schisamo/056fab4c04e4d94fc16a
[2013-05-06 21:33:42 -0400] schisamo: will get it commited later this eveninb
