[2013-05-13 16:33:01 -0400] jtimberman: we use minitest in test-kitchen? :D
[2013-05-13 16:59:43 -0400] fnichol_: jtimberman: at the moment it's being used as the spec'ing framework. shouldn't be hard to swap out with rspec if that ends up being a better fit
[2013-05-13 17:00:16 -0400] fnichol_: jtimberman: i still prefer the spec style so minitest/spec and rspec look very similar to my eyes
[2013-05-13 17:01:05 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol_: I prefer using things that are in the stdlib ;)
[2013-05-13 17:01:21 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol_: if nokogiri were in the stdlib, then i'd have less angst about it.
[2013-05-13 17:01:29 -0400] jtimberman: because then i wouldn't have to remember to install libxml2-dev ;)
[2013-05-13 17:01:48 -0400] fnichol_: jtimberman: argh, yes!
[2013-05-13 17:01:57 -0400] fnichol_: jtimberman: and don't forget libxslt too
[2013-05-13 17:02:47 -0400] jtimberman: oh, i never do
[2013-05-13 17:03:03 -0400] jtimberman: once i get that "failed to build native extensions for nokogiri" error ;)
[2013-05-13 17:03:04 -0400] fnichol_: ...except that one time
[2013-05-13 17:03:04 -0400] c_t: I dunno about anyone else, but I always install those anyway
[2013-05-13 17:03:13 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol_: ..|..
[2013-05-13 17:03:15 -0400] jtimberman: ;)
[2013-05-13 17:03:22 -0400] c_t: (but we already have a dependency on libxml2 and libxslt)
[2013-05-13 17:03:23 -0400] jtimberman: exactly
[2013-05-13 17:03:36 -0400] c_t: (and, oddly enough, nokogiri)

[2013-05-13 19:40:58 -0400] miketheman: notifies vs subscribes - which and why?
[2013-05-13 19:42:54 -0400] coderanger: miketheman: Same feature, just different directions
[2013-05-13 19:43:08 -0400] miketheman: coderanger: agreed - but which is simpler to grok?
[2013-05-13 19:43:25 -0400] coderanger: Usually notifies
[2013-05-13 19:43:34 -0400] coderanger: But it depends on the exact code
[2013-05-13 19:43:38 -0400] miketheman: also - which is less buggy? :)
[2013-05-13 19:43:47 -0400] coderanger: Its exactly the same feature
[2013-05-13 19:44:08 -0400] coderanger: subscribes x,y == x.notifies self, y
[2013-05-13 19:44:51 -0400] miketheman: well, if that were 100% accurate, would there be tickets like http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-1994 ?
[2013-05-13 19:45:39 -0400] miketheman: it's two features, with a similar method of inter-resource communication, but they aren't the same same same
[2013-05-13 19:46:10 -0400] coderanger: Actually that bug is _because_ the impl as simple as I stated
[2013-05-13 19:46:21 -0400] jtimberman: iirc, subscribes doesn't work with the 'resource[name]' syntax and requires resources('resource[name'])
[2013-05-13 19:46:29 -0400] jtimberman: unless something changed
[2013-05-13 19:46:43 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: No, I think thats fixed
[2013-05-13 19:46:50 -0400] coderanger: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/resource.rb#L452
[2013-05-13 19:46:51 -0400] jtimberman: coderanger: ok :)
[2013-05-13 19:47:11 -0400] coderanger: miketheman: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/resource.rb#L458
[2013-05-13 19:47:21 -0400] coderanger: I had the args backwards, but thats basically it
[2013-05-13 19:47:48 -0400] miketheman: ha, cool.
[2013-05-13 19:48:33 -0400] coderanger: Originally it didn't have that special case for strings, hence CHEF-1994
[2013-05-13 19:48:41 -0400] coderanger: Not sure which version fixed that
[2013-05-13 19:48:52 -0400] miketheman: ticket says 10.14.0
[2013-05-13 19:49:43 -0400] coderanger: Ahh, yep
[2013-05-13 19:50:51 -0400] miketheman: I'm a fan of notifies, since it's more "this does that" vs "if that then this"
[2013-05-13 20:02:04 -0400] fnichol_: miketheman: if you want an example of subscribes, i use it in this rbenv system packages cookbook: https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rbenv_system_pkgs/blob/master/recipes/default.rb#L36-L45
[2013-05-13 20:03:29 -0400] fnichol_: miketheman: i'm hooking into a "no-op" resource in the rbenv cookbook to install rubies in a tarball before ruby-build attempts to compile from source
[2013-05-13 20:05:46 -0400] miketheman: fnichol_: I suspect your use case is rather rare, correct?
[2013-05-13 20:07:02 -0400] fnichol_: miketheman: that's the only time i've ever knowingly used it, but it was really useful in this situation--hooking in a certain spot in another cookbook
[2013-05-13 20:11:04 -0400] miketheman: fnichol_: I think that makes my case for notifies - if it's that rarely used, it's probably not as easliy understood. by placing the notifies in the resource that you may be changing, you can immediately see that affect it would have on other resources, whereas subscribes means you'd have to hunt them down,.
[2013-05-13 20:16:01 -0400] fnichol_: miketheman: i'd go along with that - notifies certainly is the more used pattern so hopfully less surprising to uysers
[2013-05-13 20:53:02 -0400] fnichol_: miketheman: by the way, i watched your chefconf talk over lunch today. woah dude, great job!
[2013-05-13 20:53:29 -0400] miketheman: fnichol_: glad I was able to provide entertainment, and not indigestion! :)
[2013-05-13 20:54:16 -0400] fnichol_: miketheman: naw, i try to beat over the head with you thesis as well--servers are transient and faulty, services are what matter
[2013-05-13 20:55:03 -0400] miketheman: it proves true time and again. design for failure, and you won't be surprised when it does.
[2013-05-13 20:56:47 -0400] fnichol_: miketheman: i also enjoyed your story of your friend that does the same with bare metal. that's usually where people go: "oh, wait, what about real servers?"
[2013-05-13 20:57:43 -0400] miketheman: fnichol_: it's true - we did it back when there was only cobbler, and got it to a 6min turnaround with ipmi, netboot, cobbler - all to hand off to chef for the next step
[2013-05-13 20:57:55 -0400] miketheman: now with other tools like razor, might even be shorter
[2013-05-13 20:58:41 -0400] miketheman: fnichol_: share the vid, make me famous. :)
[2013-05-13 20:59:12 -0400] miketheman: so I can retire, since I'm sure ChefConf videos are generating me money. ;)
[2013-05-13 20:59:38 -0400] fnichol_: miketheman: good, that was my plan as well :)
[2013-05-13 21:00:20 -0400] miketheman: fnichol_: we'll be sipping drinks on the beach before long, slinging OSS.
[2013-05-13 21:12:23 -0400] fnichol_: miketheman: wait, we should do that *now*
[2013-05-13 21:13:44 -0400] miketheman: fnichol_: agreed.
