[2013-05-20 17:16:42 -0400] pwelch_: is there anywhere I could read more about chef-bifrost that the Opscode team is deploying right now?
[2013-05-20 17:16:57 -0400] pwelch_: is that the name for erchef?
[2013-05-20 17:19:03 -0400] jtimberman: pwelch_: it's the name of an internal service.

[2013-05-20 17:20:41 -0400] sfalcon: bifrost is the internal name for the new authorization service for OHC and OPC.

[2013-05-20 18:13:17 -0400] gchristensen: hi, using test-kitchen is there a way to utilize an encrypted data bag?
[2013-05-20 18:23:20 -0400] jtimberman: gchristensen: unless you're specifically testing that encrypted data bags work, I'd mock out that data in some way.
[2013-05-20 18:25:03 -0400] gchristensen: agreed. here's my situation: my application requires I write out a file with sensitive data. in production it'll read from an encrypted data bag. since the dev / stage / prod steps are all slightly different dependencies, I want to be able to test the cookbook can deploy each step safely. I have a change locally that adds the attributes in the .kitchen.yml, but I don't want to commit them because they
[2013-05-20 18:25:05 -0400] gchristensen: are inherently sensitive for production and staging.
[2013-05-20 18:25:48 -0400] gchristensen: I'm unclear on a Best Practice for making this happen, so I was tempted to package an encrypted data bag with the cookbook, and make sure the build server had the decryption key.

[2013-05-20 18:42:04 -0400] jwitrick: jtimberman: Question. I was wondering if you would be able to change/fix the tests in the yum cookbook. I keep getting the same error when I try to deploy/use TK and my cookbook:        Error:

[2013-05-20 18:57:09 -0400] rayrod2030: is it possible to define attributes for a resource provider based on the action?
[2013-05-20 18:57:38 -0400] rayrod2030: so certain actions would define different required attributes.
[2013-05-20 18:58:14 -0400] coderanger: rayrod2030: Not directly

[2013-05-20 18:58:43 -0400] coderanger: rayrod2030: You could do some hacks in the after create hooks, but that won't cover actions triggered by notifications or other code
[2013-05-20 18:59:07 -0400] coderanger: rayrod2030: So short answer "it doesn't work that way, just raise an exception in the provider impl code"
[2013-05-20 18:59:30 -0400] rayrod2030: or turn every action type into it's own provider.
[2013-05-20 19:11:44 -0400] jtimberman: jwitrick: does it cause a failure or does it just annoy you? :)
[2013-05-20 19:12:24 -0400] jwitrick: jtimberman: unfortunately it makes my TK run fail.
[2013-05-20 19:13:48 -0400] jtimberman: jwitrick: can you file a ticket in COOK, yum component

[2013-05-20 20:34:13 -0400] rayrod2030: is it an anti pattern to pass an entire data bag to a lwrp?
[2013-05-20 20:34:39 -0400] rayrod2030: instead of sorting through the values of the data bag in a cookbook and then passing along those values to the lwrp.
[2013-05-20 20:39:33 -0400] rayrod2030: I'm going to go ahead and say yes that's a bad idea.  It bypasses all of the attribute constraints at the lwrp level which are useful.
