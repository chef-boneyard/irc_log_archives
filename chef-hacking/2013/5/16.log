[2013-05-16 13:43:17 -0400] simonmcc_: is it possible to compile ruby roles into json, so that I can use Ruby DSL roles in a chef-solo testing environment?
[2013-05-16 15:30:07 -0400] gazoombo:  is there a way to do black-box testing from outside a VM with test-kitchen?
[2013-05-16 15:31:30 -0400] gazoombo: That is, without SSH-ing in to the the provisioned VM, run tests against it (e.g. a system test that checks to see that your web app deploys by making an HTTP request)
[2013-05-16 15:32:16 -0400] gazoombo: It looks like busser lets you run tests with different test frameworks as long as you set up a plugin, but they all get run on the VM under test, right?

[2013-05-16 15:43:24 -0400] gazoombo: Seems like I'd need to write a plugin or driver to support what I wanted to do, but I'm not familiar enough with test kitchen's design to know where the appropriate place to add that would even be (if at all)

[2013-05-16 18:55:48 -0400] gazoombo: jtimberman ^^
[2013-05-16 18:56:23 -0400] jtimberman: gazoombo: oho, didn't see your messages earlier with all the github chatter :)
[2013-05-16 18:57:18 -0400] jtimberman: gazoombo: i believe busser does run the tests logged into the VM.
[2013-05-16 18:57:52 -0400] jtimberman: gazoombo: i don't particularly like the approach, but the *current* apache2 cookbook uses cucumber to do integration tests against the node from your local system rather than in the VM, I believe.
[2013-05-16 18:58:01 -0400] jtimberman: (i don't like the approach because I really don't like cucumber :))
[2013-05-16 18:58:24 -0400] gazoombo: ah, I'll look at how the apache2 cookbook is doing that then
[2013-05-16 18:59:04 -0400] jtimberman: i think the 'application' cookbook has cucumber tests too, and maybe mysql.
[2013-05-16 18:59:43 -0400] gazoombo: jtimberman: are those all pre-TK 1.0?
[2013-05-16 19:00:08 -0400] jwitrick: fnichol: Is there a quick way to change the default naming scheme of servers in TK ?
[2013-05-16 19:02:09 -0400] jtimberman: gazoombo: yeah unfortunately
[2013-05-16 19:03:08 -0400] gazoombo: jtimberman: ok, so then it comes back to my original question, with TK 1.0, where might such tests be added (whether as cukes or something else)?
[2013-05-16 19:04:37 -0400] jtimberman: i don't think tk1 has an automatic runner for that.
[2013-05-16 19:04:51 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol would have a better idea of where to put those if they can be done with busser.
[2013-05-16 19:08:21 -0400] cwj: seems like i have to duplicate my .kitchen.yml in .kitchen.local.yml if i want to do override of attributes in the local yaml. am i holding it wrong?
[2013-05-16 19:10:40 -0400] gazoombo: Ok, I'll wait to hear from fnichol then. I may have to hack together my own temporary thing for now. Long term I'd like to have those tests integrated with TK, though.
