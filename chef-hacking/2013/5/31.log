[2013-05-31 05:49:25 -0400] stephenking: fnichol_: you gave me a tipp, how to use site-cookbooks/ with test-kitchen two days ago
[2013-05-31 05:50:24 -0400] stephenking: fnichol_: Ah, sorry, the idea was from teukka - here: http://community.opscode.com/chat/chef-hacking/2013-05-29#id-365146
[2013-05-31 05:50:45 -0400] stephenking: correct syntax would be that I think: Dir.glob('site-cookbooks/*').each { |dir| cookbook File.basename(dir), :path => dir }
[2013-05-31 05:51:10 -0400] stephenking: but then librarian-chef complains that "Cheffile and Cheffile.lock are out of sync"
[2013-05-31 05:51:14 -0400] stephenking: any idea?
[2013-05-31 11:26:07 -0400] teukka: stephenking: even after `librarian-chef update`?
[2013-05-31 11:26:51 -0400] teukka: stephenking: I've only used that kind of hack with Berkshelf. so no idea how it works with Librarian. Thought it would just evaluate it the same way...
[2013-05-31 11:28:58 -0400] stephenking: teukka: yes also when I execute librarian-chef update
[2013-05-31 11:30:23 -0400] stephenking: will try to add the cookbooks manually..
[2013-05-31 11:31:51 -0400] teukka: sorry, can't help without reading the source code. and right now too busy with work
[2013-05-31 11:32:12 -0400] stephenking: np, thx!

[2013-05-31 17:32:40 -0400] stephenking: hey.. a question:
[2013-05-31 17:32:57 -0400] stephenking: are you using vagrant boxes with chef preinstalled or are you using sth. like vagrant-omnibus?
[2013-05-31 17:40:07 -0400] cwj: personally i am using vagrant-omnibus even when boxes already have chef preinstalled
[2013-05-31 17:40:53 -0400] cwj: i think opscode is going to start releasing their box files w/o any provisioner (chef, puppet) installed, relying on vagrant-omnibus to sort it out
[2013-05-31 17:41:26 -0400] stephenking: cwj: thanks. IIRC it didn't install itself as chef was already installed through veewee - unfortunately with an old ruby from debian squeeze (which had some weird problems)
[2013-05-31 17:41:26 -0400] cwj: speaking of vagrant-omnibus, i would like to bribe schisamo into cutting a new version with the recently merged vmware_fusion changes
[2013-05-31 17:41:42 -0400] stephenking: what's the problem? worked for me
[2013-05-31 17:42:07 -0400] cwj: stephenking: https://github.com/schisamo/vagrant-omnibus/pull/17
[2013-05-31 17:42:29 -0400] jtimberman: stephenking: yeah, old rubies installed is the thing we want to avoid
[2013-05-31 17:43:12 -0400] stephenking: kk, so I will go with clean boxes
[2013-05-31 17:46:00 -0400] cwj: jtimberman: is cutting a new release of your ruby cookbook on your radar? i am still tracking git for a fix of mine you merged a while ago
[2013-05-31 17:46:17 -0400] jtimberman: uh
[2013-05-31 17:56:09 -0400] c_t: ohai, hacking chefs

[2013-05-31 20:50:16 -0400] petecheslock: btm: just pm'd you over a link to the 8.3 freebsd box build for 10g and following the steps you had in your gist

[2013-05-31 21:07:26 -0400] petecheslock: btm: - nope i take that back - i think that box had fubar'd fstab - let me resolve
[2013-05-31 21:08:32 -0400] btm: petecheslock: if you can convert that to qcow2 or raw before you send it, you'll save me a lot of moving it around. ;)
[2013-05-31 21:08:50 -0400] btm: our open stack cluster can't convert from vmdk because of a kvm-img bug.
[2013-05-31 21:09:11 -0400] petecheslock: btm gotcha - it's easy enough for me to do.  and i'm happy to make things easier.
[2013-05-31 21:15:55 -0400] jtimberman: btm: is that a bug fixed in a) later ubuntu or b) later openstack?
[2013-05-31 21:19:43 -0400] ssd7: jtimberman: Later ubuntu afaik
