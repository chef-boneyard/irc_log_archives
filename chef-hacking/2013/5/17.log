[2013-05-17 15:55:43 -0400] github-bawt: chef/ss/OC-7900 f125bbd sersut: Make selinux util a module.
[2013-05-17 16:59:26 -0400] cwj: so is there no way to get access to node attributes in tests executed by busser?
[2013-05-17 17:00:11 -0400] cwj: e.g. i want to test that a service is listening on a port number which is specified by a node attribute
[2013-05-17 17:12:55 -0400] fnichol: jwitrick: hey, currently each tk driver would handle (re)naming a host. the vagrant driver gets its rename from the Vagrantfile but others (like ec2) don't bother to rename
[2013-05-17 17:13:16 -0400] fnichol: jwitrick: is that something that's needed for testing/verification/etc?
[2013-05-17 17:14:09 -0400] fnichol: gazoombo: at the moment all the busser runner plugins are run from the instance node itself. however, it would be super handy to support a "testing from the outside" style
[2013-05-17 17:14:58 -0400] jtimberman: fnichol: +1 :)
[2013-05-17 17:17:14 -0400] fnichol: cwj: currently busser isn't aware of chef whatsoever which was partially by design. to date i've been putting that port number into the test itself
[2013-05-17 17:17:44 -0400] fnichol: cwj: i don't view this as bad duplication since the .kitchen.yml is setup and the tests are verification. however...
[2013-05-17 17:18:36 -0400] fnichol: cwj: at blue box, we toyed with serializing out the node's attributes if tests needed it
[2013-05-17 17:19:41 -0400] cwj: fnichol: ok. im using minitest-handler right now. it feels like the best option but it still doesn't feel "right"
[2013-05-17 17:19:49 -0400] fnichol: cwj: hm, would it be crazy if the .kitchen.yml was pushed to each instance? that way you'd have your setup inputs
[2013-05-17 17:20:36 -0400] cwj: that might be helpful but to make the most use of it i would have to duplicate my cookbook default attributes into .kitchen.yml ?
[2013-05-17 17:21:00 -0400] fnichol: cwj: in a perverse way i like that the post-converge tests can't introspect on the chef run. it feels like too much temptation to peek at the internals
[2013-05-17 17:22:41 -0400] fnichol: cwj: what i've done in the past is declare that cookbook default in the testing code so that if the prod code (cookbook code) changes, the tests will break by default
[2013-05-17 17:23:13 -0400] fnichol: cwj: for example, in the rvm cookbook, i'm declaring the default ruby that gets installed https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm/blob/master/test/integration/stock_system_and_user/bats/system.bats#L3
[2013-05-17 17:24:10 -0400] fnichol: cwj: again, it's bordering on duplication but for me it feels like a production/test code mirroring thing that catches accidental default updates
[2013-05-17 18:08:14 -0400] cwj: yeah i can see some value in that
[2013-05-17 18:08:31 -0400] cwj: maybe i'll take another shot at rewriting my minitests in bats
[2013-05-17 19:34:27 -0400] fnichol: cwj: it depends what it is that you're testing/verifying. in the rvm/rbenv/ruby_build cookbooks, the software is CLI-based anyway and made testing feel pretty natural
[2013-05-17 19:37:31 -0400] cwj: yeah, for sure
[2013-05-17 19:37:53 -0400] cwj: in my case i am trying to do integration testing for a django web app
[2013-05-17 19:38:07 -0400] cwj: not being able to reuse tests between suites with bats kind of blows
[2013-05-17 19:38:21 -0400] fnichol: oh that's cool!
[2013-05-17 19:39:16 -0400] fnichol: cwj: we may need a way to have "common" files that get uploaded to all suite-instances. i've had success with using a symlink btw the two but of course that's a major league hack
[2013-05-17 19:40:53 -0400] cwj: i asked sstephenson about reusing tests between suites and it sounds like it would require a hack, even if there were common files present
[2013-05-17 19:48:19 -0400] cwj: like the common file would have "function mytest {...}" and then a suite would load the common file and then use bats_test_function mytest

[2013-05-17 20:43:37 -0400] stephenking: hi
[2013-05-17 20:43:43 -0400] stephenking: I have a problem with chef-rewind
[2013-05-17 20:43:51 -0400] stephenking: i'm trying to rewind a web_app
[2013-05-17 20:44:40 -0400] stephenking: can this work? does it not work because it's not an LWRP, but a definition?
[2013-05-17 20:44:43 -0400] ctracey: am i correct that the way to get search in test-kitchen is through normal chef-solo-search means?
[2013-05-17 20:44:48 -0400] stephenking: or am I doing sth. completely wrong
[2013-05-17 20:45:19 -0400] stephenking: ctracey: according to the podcasts it sounds so, as it uses chef-solo
[2013-05-17 20:45:45 -0400] ctracey: that is what I figured
[2013-05-17 20:45:47 -0400] ctracey: thanks
[2013-05-17 21:00:08 -0400] stephenking: okay, I was able to figure it out.. I can't rewind the web_app, instead I have to rewind the template it creates
[2013-05-17 21:00:30 -0400] stephenking: can one tell me, what I can rewind directly and what not?
[2013-05-17 21:43:05 -0400] stephenking: sscMkXtPHCHtmzMJ
[2013-05-17 21:43:27 -0400] stephenking: no, this was not a password.. no.. ^^
[2013-05-17 21:52:51 -0400] miketheman: yahright
[2013-05-17 22:06:48 -0400] jtimberman: stephenking: correct, definitions aren't resources, they're replaced in the Resource Collection by the resources they contain.
[2013-05-17 22:07:25 -0400] stephenking: thx jtimberman
[2013-05-17 22:07:42 -0400] stephenking: for what else is chef-rewind not working directly?
[2013-05-17 22:07:57 -0400] stephenking: otoh.. I will notice it when it isn't working next time ;)
[2013-05-17 22:08:48 -0400] jtimberman: dunno offhand, I don't use it.
[2013-05-17 22:09:59 -0400] stephenking: um.. I know you write a lot of cookbooks, but I guess you're also using cookbooks..
[2013-05-17 22:10:22 -0400] stephenking: is there another way than using chef-rewind to e.g. replace a template (when I'm in my wrapper cb)
[2013-05-17 22:10:44 -0400] stephenking: I always do rewind "template[]" do cookbook "mine" end
[2013-05-17 22:10:44 -0400] jtimberman: stephenking: i use the #resources() method
[2013-05-17 22:10:58 -0400] jtimberman: resources("template[foo]").cookbook "mine"
[2013-05-17 22:11:12 -0400] stephenking: interesting
[2013-05-17 22:11:35 -0400] jtimberman: literal example from my openvpn cookbook
[2013-05-17 22:11:36 -0400] jtimberman: resources("template[/etc/openvpn/server.conf]").cookbook cookbook_name
[2013-05-17 22:12:27 -0400] jtimberman: I wrote about this on my blog: http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2012/11/19/chef-repository-berkshelf-conversion/
[2013-05-17 22:12:30 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2013-05-17 22:12:47 -0400] jtimberman: it has some other examples
[2013-05-17 22:12:59 -0400] stephenking: I read several "you should follow the wawrapper cookbook pattern" but never read about this
[2013-05-17 22:13:50 -0400] stephenking: I probably skipped your post because of the berkshelf ;)
[2013-05-17 22:14:03 -0400] stephenking: will read through it! thanks for the hint
[2013-05-17 22:24:07 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2013-05-17 23:38:56 -0400] cwj: #resources() changed my life
