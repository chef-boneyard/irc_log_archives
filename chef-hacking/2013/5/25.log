[2013-05-25 00:07:32 -0400] github-bawt: chef/master 7d64b79 lamont-granquist: Merge pull request #783 from opscode/lcg/AIX-no-ruby-shadow...
[2013-05-25 00:30:09 -0400] spheromak: fnichol_  yea thats was it. .Was a combo of old box and old .kitchen.yml
[2013-05-25 00:30:59 -0400] spheromak: and im using vagabond edge dev  as well.. so Im playing a game of track down the breakage :D
[2013-05-25 00:37:11 -0400] ssd7: Anyone around who knows the foodcritic codebase?
[2013-05-25 00:38:08 -0400] miketheman: I've got some in there
[2013-05-25 00:38:32 -0400] miketheman: ssd7: what's up?
[2013-05-25 00:39:50 -0400] ssd7: Trying to figure out why foodcritic crashes if a provider has a ruby_block longer than 15 lines (FC014)
[2013-05-25 00:40:15 -0400] ssd7: https://github.com/acrmp/foodcritic/issues/139
[2013-05-25 00:40:44 -0400] miketheman: can you add a gist of a dummy block?
[2013-05-25 00:41:50 -0400] ssd7: https://gist.github.com/stevendanna/5647441
[2013-05-25 00:42:48 -0400] miketheman: thanks
[2013-05-25 00:46:56 -0400] miketheman: I suspect the logic is wrong
[2013-05-25 00:49:26 -0400] ssd7: I think it is the xpath query. Currently poking around with pry
[2013-05-25 00:52:29 -0400] miketheman: you on 2.1.0?
[2013-05-25 00:54:16 -0400] ssd7: well 2.1.0+ some debugging at the moemnt
[2013-05-25 00:54:20 -0400] miketheman: sure
[2013-05-25 00:54:39 -0400] miketheman: I've successfully reproed the erorr
[2013-05-25 00:54:47 -0400] miketheman: TDD.red == true
[2013-05-25 00:57:36 -0400] miketheman: is that even a valid ruby_block?
[2013-05-25 00:58:03 -0400] miketheman: ruby_block "name" do
[2013-05-25 00:58:03 -0400] miketheman:   block do
[2013-05-25 00:58:03 -0400] miketheman:     # some Ruby code
[2013-05-25 00:58:04 -0400] miketheman:   end
[2013-05-25 00:58:04 -0400] miketheman:   action :action # see actions section below
[2013-05-25 00:58:04 -0400] miketheman: end
[2013-05-25 00:58:39 -0400] miketheman: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_ruby_block.html
[2013-05-25 00:59:03 -0400] ssd7: miketheman: Yup, just said "oh, wait, I'm dumb"
[2013-05-25 00:59:10 -0400] miketheman: grrr
[2013-05-25 00:59:11 -0400] miketheman: :)
[2013-05-25 00:59:46 -0400] ssd7: well, at least foodcritic found a bug in the ark cookbook at master I guess
[2013-05-25 00:59:56 -0400] miketheman: only one?
[2013-05-25 01:00:57 -0400] ssd7: Well, at least I learned a bit about xpath
[2013-05-25 01:01:33 -0400] miketheman: yeah, it's 'fun'
[2013-05-25 01:02:09 -0400] miketheman: oddly, travis didn't catch this
[2013-05-25 01:02:20 -0400] miketheman: why not?
[2013-05-25 01:05:57 -0400] ssd7: knife cookbook test succeeds because it is still valid ruby
[2013-05-25 01:06:23 -0400] miketheman: meh
[2013-05-25 01:06:42 -0400] miketheman: so I suspect fc could catch that error earlier
[2013-05-25 01:07:18 -0400] miketheman: i.e. "if ruby_block is not followed by a "block", yell"
[2013-05-25 01:36:14 -0400] ssd7: yeah, definitely seems like a rule could have caught this
[2013-05-25 03:00:56 -0400] spheromak: jtimberman is using your test/build.sh  stuff the way to go about getting TK support into an Opscode-cookbook ? is that documented anywhere. I want to add in some tests for that ssl stuff, but I didn't want to do it in a way that wasn't conforming to some standard you guys are using.
[2013-05-25 04:45:10 -0400] Cope: I'm asserting that a recipe includes_recipe java::openjdk, but chefspec bitches at Chef::Recipe::Opscode (java_location = Opscode::OpenJDK.new(node).java_location)
[2013-05-25 04:45:32 -0400] Cope: http://dpaste.com/1198505/
[2013-05-25 04:45:53 -0400] Cope: Any ideas?
[2013-05-25 05:19:59 -0400] ssd7: Hrm
[2013-05-25 05:24:03 -0400] ssd7: Doesn't chefspec have some output about it whether it is actually loading the java libraries if you up the log level?
[2013-05-25 05:30:36 -0400] Cope: ssd7: how does one up the log level?
[2013-05-25 05:35:12 -0400] ssd7: Hrm, I think in the argument ot ChefRunner.new
[2013-05-25 05:37:32 -0400] Cope:     # @option options [Symbol] :log_level The log level to use (default is :warn)
[2013-05-25 05:48:23 -0400] jtimberman: ssd7: FC017: LWRP does not notify when updated: ./providers/default.rb:1 <-- is that the foodcritic "failure" you're getting?
[2013-05-25 05:50:39 -0400] Cope: ssd7: http://dpaste.com/1198573/ <--- debug
[2013-05-25 05:51:16 -0400] Cope: oho
[2013-05-25 05:51:17 -0400] Cope: [2013-05-25T06:49:19+01:00] DEBUG: Platform is chefspec version 0.6.1
[2013-05-25 05:56:28 -0400] Cope: good spot jtimberman - metadata doesn't have dependency
[2013-05-25 05:57:54 -0400] Cope: heh - now it's bitching about minitest-handler, which *is* in the berksfile !
[2013-05-25 05:58:20 -0400] Cope: http://dpaste.com/1198576/
[2013-05-25 05:58:43 -0400] jtimberman: what is line 7?
[2013-05-25 05:59:02 -0400] jtimberman: can you pastie the default_spec.rb
[2013-05-25 05:59:50 -0400] Cope: http://dpaste.com/1198585/
[2013-05-25 06:00:43 -0400] jtimberman: and the jenkins default recipe??
[2013-05-25 06:01:02 -0400] jtimberman: are you including minitest-handler?
[2013-05-25 06:01:15 -0400] Cope: the jenkins recipe just has:
[2013-05-25 06:01:16 -0400] Cope: include_recipe "java::openjdk"
[2013-05-25 06:01:19 -0400] Cope: nothing else at all
[2013-05-25 06:07:31 -0400] jtimberman: Cope: erm, do you have the java cookbook cloned to the directory where the jenkins cookbook is?
[2013-05-25 06:07:37 -0400] jtimberman: (this is a use case of strainer, iirc)
[2013-05-25 06:11:46 -0400] jtimberman: Cope: http://dpaste.com/1198594/
[2013-05-25 06:12:06 -0400] jtimberman: actually
[2013-05-25 06:12:31 -0400] jtimberman: http://dpaste.com/1198595/
[2013-05-25 06:12:57 -0400] jtimberman: Cope: i cloned the java, windows, and chef_handler cookbooks to the directory my 'jenkins' cookbook is in
[2013-05-25 06:13:27 -0400] jtimberman: i'm not sure where the minitest-handler error is coming from tho
[2013-05-25 06:13:28 -0400] ssd7: jtimberman: No, the foodcritic "failure" was a crashed caused by:http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-3048
[2013-05-25 06:15:06 -0400] jtimberman: ssd7: O.o
[2013-05-25 06:15:10 -0400] jtimberman: what version of foodcritic?
[2013-05-25 06:15:45 -0400] jtimberman: i have 2.1.0 and it doesn't do anything there
[2013-05-25 06:21:53 -0400] Cope: jtimberman: i did no cloning
[2013-05-25 06:22:44 -0400] Cope: erm - you just added a platform?
[2013-05-25 06:24:17 -0400] jtimberman: i did, i also cloned the cookbooks required.
[2013-05-25 06:24:34 -0400] jtimberman: chefspec doesn't use berkshelf.
[2013-05-25 06:24:47 -0400] jtimberman: so you have to put the dependencies in place.
[2013-05-25 06:25:30 -0400] Cope: ah you can vendor  them though - i was just about to do that
[2013-05-25 06:25:43 -0400] Cope: how did you 'clone' them?
[2013-05-25 06:25:57 -0400] jtimberman: cd ..
[2013-05-25 06:26:04 -0400] jtimberman: git clone git://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/THING.git
[2013-05-25 06:26:10 -0400] jtimberman: windows, java, chef_handler.
[2013-05-25 06:26:13 -0400] Cope: oh
[2013-05-25 06:26:37 -0400] jtimberman: java depends on windows, so that windows_package can be used in the java::windows recipe. windows depends on chef_handler.
[2013-05-25 06:27:12 -0400] Cope: but the debig output did show chefspec loading java
[2013-05-25 06:28:49 -0400] jtimberman: the hopes and dreams of dependencies :)
[2013-05-25 06:28:51 -0400] Cope: berks install --path vendor/cookbooks
[2013-05-25 06:29:49 -0400] jtimberman: does that work too?
[2013-05-25 06:29:58 -0400] jtimberman: i have all our cookbooks cloned in one directory
[2013-05-25 06:30:01 -0400] Cope: that works, and everything passes
[2013-05-25 06:30:05 -0400] jtimberman: so i'm totally cheating. :)
[2013-05-25 06:35:37 -0400] ssd7: jtimberman: Are you testing against master of the ark cookbook?
[2013-05-25 06:36:01 -0400] jtimberman: ssd7: yes
[2013-05-25 06:36:08 -0400] jtimberman: in production.
[2013-05-25 06:36:55 -0400] ssd7: jtimberman: Unsure if you need master foodcritic too. Was reproducible by mike earlier though
[2013-05-25 06:40:13 -0400] jtimberman: ssd7: /Users/jtimberman/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p392/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/foodcritic-2.1.0/lib/foodcritic/rules.rb:178:in `block (4 levels) in load': undefined method `-' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
[2013-05-25 06:40:17 -0400] jtimberman: with foodcritic from master
[2013-05-25 06:40:45 -0400] jtimberman: oh, rbenv rehash maybe
[2013-05-25 06:41:09 -0400] jtimberman: nup
