[2013-05-21 18:04:13 -0400] petecheslock: hey schisamo  - you back from vacation?  If so we should chat about getting the freebsd build stuff into omnitruck so they can be deployed from the main opscode install site.  /cc btm
[2013-05-21 18:04:46 -0400] petecheslock: i've got all the vagrant/vbox boxes built with & wo chef on them for 8.3 32/64bit and 9.1 - so they should be easy to take and import
[2013-05-21 18:05:03 -0400] btm: petecheslock: ohai. I think schisamo is back tomorrow.
[2013-05-21 18:05:50 -0400] petecheslock: btm - awesome, sounds good.  i'm around all week.
[2013-05-21 18:06:20 -0400] btm: petecheslock: our bits are currently on an internal openstack cluster. Is there anything special about those boxes? If so, is it documented somewhere?
[2013-05-21 18:06:58 -0400] petecheslock: btm - they are basic vagrant boxes now (which i think are just tar'd ovf's
[2013-05-21 18:07:18 -0400] petecheslock: let me write up a gist with links to the boxes and details for what's on them.
[2013-05-21 18:07:58 -0400] petecheslock: i have both boxes with chef on them (11.4.0 omnibus) as well as chef-less boxes that work with vagrant and schisamo vagrant-omnibus code (although slightly hacked to pull down the internal builds)
[2013-05-21 18:20:36 -0400] ggolin: hello. a bit confused about the .kitchen.yml and Kitchenfile - are there mutually exclusive?
[2013-05-21 18:20:45 -0400] ggolin: (test-kitchen)
[2013-05-21 19:26:05 -0400] cwj: ggolin: i believe Kitchenfile is for test-kitchen prior to 1.0, and .kitchen.yml is for 1.0 and above
[2013-05-21 19:26:22 -0400] cwj: 1.0 being more or less a completely different beast
[2013-05-21 19:30:31 -0400] jtimberman: ggolin: yes, what cwj said.
[2013-05-21 19:31:01 -0400] jtimberman: test-kitchen 1.0+ (currently 'alpha') is a completely new code rewrite from scratch. it started as "jamie-ci" by fletcher nichol, but we combined forces :)
[2013-05-21 20:09:36 -0400] ggolin: jtimberman, cwj ok, great, so - does the yml support everything Kitchenfile supported?
[2013-05-21 20:12:57 -0400] ggolin: im just trying to get the data bag search to work in my recipe

[2013-05-21 20:45:25 -0400] github-bawt: kitchen-ec2/master 6151037 Fletcher Nichol: Refactor Rakefile.
[2013-05-21 20:45:25 -0400] github-bawt: kitchen-ec2/master a328536 Fletcher Nichol: Refactor server debugging & add tags to debugging.

[2013-05-21 20:58:31 -0400] jtimberman: ggolin: there's differences between what you'd do with kitchenfile vs .kitchen.yml.
[2013-05-21 20:58:53 -0400] jtimberman: but i think for the most part everything in the kitchenfile is implemented in the .kitchen.yml, at least that you probably really care about.
[2013-05-21 21:00:09 -0400] ggolin: currently i really care about two things, the memory setting and the data_bags_path settings :)
[2013-05-21 21:08:31 -0400] jtimberman: memory setting can be done, it's a customize directive. see the kitchen-vagrant project readme for information on syntax.
[2013-05-21 21:08:37 -0400] jtimberman: i don't know about the data_bags_path bit.
[2013-05-21 21:08:51 -0400] ggolin: thank you sir

[2013-05-21 23:19:58 -0400] bloudermilk: Hey all. I'm having trouble understanding exactly what test-kitchen is for. Is there a good blog post detailing why one would want to use it?
[2013-05-21 23:38:56 -0400] miketheman: bloudermilk: looked for one, could't find anyhting handy
[2013-05-21 23:39:27 -0400] miketheman: bloudermilk: I _do_ know that tomorrow there will be a foodfightshow recording (and streamed to youtube) on the topic of testing, and test-kitchen will be discussed
[2013-05-21 23:39:36 -0400] bloudermilk: miketheman: Would you be able to explain it in a sentence or two?
