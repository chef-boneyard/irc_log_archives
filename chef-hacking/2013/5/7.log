[2013-05-07 03:17:00 -0400] dyer: Hey guys, how can I find out what version a ticket was fixed in ?
[2013-05-07 03:17:02 -0400] dyer: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-1031
[2013-05-07 03:17:26 -0400] dyer: there is no fixed version there
[2013-05-07 03:22:19 -0400] coderanger: dyer: https://github.com/opscode/chef/pull/602
[2013-05-07 03:37:31 -0400] dyer: coderanger, but what version of Chef has it ?
[2013-05-07 03:37:39 -0400] dyer: I dont see that anywhere
[2013-05-07 03:38:03 -0400] dyer: maybe I am just do tired to notice
[2013-05-07 03:42:49 -0400] coderanger: dyer: Just have to find the next release after that merge date
[2013-05-07 03:43:07 -0400] dyer: If only there were a field in JIRA for such a thing :P
[2013-05-07 03:43:14 -0400] dyer: we could call it "fixed version" ;)
[2013-05-07 03:43:31 -0400] dyer: Thanks, I found it
[2013-05-07 03:43:34 -0400] coderanger: Yeah yeah, we're getting there ;-)

[2013-05-07 14:10:37 -0400] jmartin: atomic-penguin: just a quick question if you had any idea on what was causing this -> https://github.com/atomic-penguin/cookbook-snmp/pull/7 issue, because it seemingly works if i run the thing twice on a VMware box
[2013-05-07 14:24:41 -0400] BryanWB: what state of test-kitchen support 4 windows?
[2013-05-07 14:48:49 -0400] atomic-penguin: jmartin, just a guess, the dmi ohai data doesn't exist on the first run

[2013-05-07 14:59:13 -0400] jmartin: atomic-penguin: right, i wonder why that would be though :-/

[2013-05-07 18:25:36 -0400] gondoi: I'm just now getting back around to my apt patch i spoke about briefly at chefconf
[2013-05-07 18:26:02 -0400] gondoi: have 2 seconds to look at what i've done?
[2013-05-07 18:26:15 -0400] gondoi: i have yet to open the jira ticket.. plan to, just haven't done it yet
[2013-05-07 18:26:41 -0400] schisamo: I should have some time in a bit. Do you have a PR I can give feedback on?
[2013-05-07 18:27:00 -0400] gondoi: no pull request yet

[2013-05-07 18:28:12 -0400] gondoi: thank you i'll work on the ticket
[2013-05-07 18:54:10 -0400] laurent\: make it configurable ! :)

[2013-05-07 18:57:19 -0400] schisamo: petecheslock KarlHungus you guys should be G2G WRT FreeBSD on omnibus-chef master now http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4163
[2013-05-07 18:57:57 -0400] petecheslock: schisamo - awesome stuff.  I may have a omnibus-ruby PR coming soon - have an 8.1 build going - and doing 8.2 build now
[2013-05-07 18:58:12 -0400] petecheslock: turns out 8.1 build won't run on 8.2 - so they need separate builds for now
[2013-05-07 18:58:19 -0400] schisamo: kk
[2013-05-07 18:58:19 -0400] petecheslock: more libs to whitelist - easy enough fix
[2013-05-07 18:58:39 -0400] petecheslock: i'll let you know - building up the base build boxes now for 8.1 and 8.2
[2013-05-07 18:59:28 -0400] petecheslock: not that most people need those builds - but some might :P
[2013-05-07 18:59:28 -0400] schisamo: sweet. also much appreciated if you can open a PR in omnibus-chef with additional entries in vagrant/freebsd/Vagrantfile.
[2013-05-07 18:59:45 -0400] petecheslock: schisamo - yea - will do, i can include the base boxes on Dyn's s3 account like the 9.1 box
[2013-05-07 19:00:06 -0400] schisamo: Also be sure to start nagging btm_ about getting these FreeBSD builds into our main build pipeline :)
[2013-05-07 19:00:08 -0400] petecheslock: i'll actually add in 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 and 9.1 - test builds on them all - then test the install
[2013-05-07 19:00:38 -0400] petecheslock: schisamo - yea will do.  I think it makes sense for only unsupported release of 8.3 and 9.1 builds - no need to build old ass freebsd versions
[2013-05-07 19:01:11 -0400] schisamo: petecheslock: so what is the main reason for the 8.1 builds not working on 8.2 and 8.3?
[2013-05-07 19:01:29 -0400] schisamo: on other platforms that doesn't seem to be the case
[2013-05-07 19:03:29 -0400] petecheslock: schisamo - something library related - i'm not 100% sure - i may ping KarlHungus to test my builds and see if he knows
[2013-05-07 19:03:35 -0400] petecheslock: i would *think* they would work - but not so much
[2013-05-07 19:04:03 -0400] schisamo: petecheslock: yeah would be nice to get to a spot where we build a single package for FreeBSD 8 that works across all minor versions.
[2013-05-07 19:08:59 -0400] petecheslock: schisamo - most definitely
[2013-05-07 19:09:22 -0400] petecheslock: but worse case - 8.3 and 9.1 support would be good enough - all our new systems get 9.1 anyway
[2013-05-07 19:13:05 -0400] gondoi: laurent\: oh yes i forgot that point :D
[2013-05-07 19:13:18 -0400] gondoi: laurent\: the monkey patch we use internally allows it to be configured
[2013-05-07 19:16:01 -0400] gondoi: hrm.. that makes it more complicated for me i'll have to dig more into the provider and customizing just apt :D
[2013-05-07 19:29:25 -0400] laurent\: gondoi: hey that's not a big deal :) also have a look at the tests, you'll have to adapt them as well, have fnu ! ;-)
[2013-05-07 19:33:25 -0400] gondoi: laurent\: yeah the tests scare me the most :( just from lack of understanding
[2013-05-07 19:34:04 -0400] gondoi: initial looking doesn't show any kind of coverage for something like this, which means it's an entirely new test
[2013-05-07 20:02:20 -0400] petecheslock: schisamo - have you been able to specify the build of chef recently?  I set the ENV variable but it says in the run "Building chef 11.0.8-rc.2-39-ga4f880c"
[2013-05-07 20:02:33 -0400] petecheslock: like it's defaulting to master still i think?
[2013-05-07 20:02:50 -0400] petecheslock: for example "CHEF_GIT_REV=11.4.4 vagrant up freebsd-8.2"
[2013-05-07 20:03:20 -0400] petecheslock: also tried just changing the vagrant file to default to 11.4.4 (export CHEF_GIT_REV=#{ENV['CHEF_GIT_REV'] || '11.4.4'})
[2013-05-07 20:10:47 -0400] petecheslock: schisamo - scratch that checked out the right version - guess that's just a logging thing early in the run
[2013-05-07 20:26:07 -0400] schisamo: petecheslock: roger..need to get that debug statement fixed though.
[2013-05-07 20:30:29 -0400] petecheslock: schisamo - ok got 8.1 and 8.2 builds going - going to rebuild some base boxes and test out the builds again and can send another PR - in the meantime we'll need this on the omnibus-ruby gem - http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4171
[2013-05-07 20:49:16 -0400] miketheman: kallistec: I recall you had a cool way of profiling a given chef-client run
[2013-05-07 20:51:12 -0400] miketheman: do you rememebr what that was?
[2013-05-07 20:51:38 -0400] kallistec: miketheman: not me in particular, but there's this: https://github.com/jamesc/chef-handler-elapsed-time and this: https://github.com/joemiller/chef-handler-profiler
[2013-05-07 20:52:41 -0400] miketheman: kallistec: awesome, thanks

[2013-05-07 22:01:11 -0400] github-bawt: omnibus-chef/lcg/unbundle-tests db45bb6 Lamont Granquist: add the bundle to the windows build here instead of omnibus-software...
[2013-05-07 22:02:13 -0400] gondoi: i can do that.
[2013-05-07 22:07:42 -0400] gondoi: gist updated
[2013-05-07 22:07:42 -0400] gondoi: https://gist.github.com/gondoi/5536321
[2013-05-07 22:12:19 -0400] gondoi: I guess one thing I can't figure out is why it's calling that resource from Chef::Resource::Package and not from Package::Apt
[2013-05-07 22:20:44 -0400] kallistec: gondoi: in general chef gives you the "base" resource type unless you ask for a more specific one
[2013-05-07 22:21:06 -0400] kallistec: e.g., apt_package => Package::Apt, package => Package
[2013-05-07 22:21:38 -0400] kallistec: there's some code in chef that allows the DSL to pick a more specific type for you but it's not used for most resources
