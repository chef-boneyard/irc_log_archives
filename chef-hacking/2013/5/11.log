[2013-05-11 03:59:42 -0400] rayrod2030: I'm seeing "Message: Failed to complete #converge action: [no implicit conversion of nil into String]" when trying to converge the zsh cookbook.  Running latest 1.0.0-dev version from 1.0 branch
[2013-05-11 04:00:00 -0400] rayrod2030: in reference to test-kitchen of course.
[2013-05-11 04:04:24 -0400] rayrod2030: looks like a missing cookbook or an issue with berkshelf
[2013-05-11 04:04:25 -0400] rayrod2030: hmm
