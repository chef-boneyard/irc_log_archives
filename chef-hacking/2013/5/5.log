[2013-05-05 07:17:34 -0400] github-bawt: chef/master 2ac8fe0 Adam Edwards: Merge pull request #752 from opscode/adamed/ci-failure-windows...
[2013-05-05 17:10:14 -0400] petecheslock: schisamo - FYI looks like some of the recent smartos commits to omnibus-software broke the freebsd builds - https://gist.github.com/petecheslock/1872b127e52d78ad4535
[2013-05-05 17:12:42 -0400] petecheslock: chris--- was the one that found it - from this change.  https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-software/compare/81c608ac577806f900da37879a7f43079e375e5a...9fe7441bd168bd37108bdfe81dfe46249df6595b#L0R29
[2013-05-05 17:13:41 -0400] chris---: looks like it has the effect of adding the LDFLAGS which the fbsd ld doesnt like
[2013-05-05 17:14:17 -0400] chris---: it needs -R rather than the -Wl,-rpath
[2013-05-05 17:14:50 -0400] chris---: i just pulled the LDFLAGS all together and it built again
[2013-05-05 17:15:26 -0400] chris---: but then ran into using ezjails /usr isnt writable in the jail so the install from the omnibus fails
[2013-05-05 17:15:43 -0400] chris---: so I haven't see it all the way through yet
[2013-05-05 17:22:31 -0400] petecheslock: schisamo - in the meantime setting this in the omnibus-chef gemfile works for freebsd builds.  gem 'omnibus-software', :git => 'git://github.com/opscode/omnibus-software.git', :ref => '239315117'
