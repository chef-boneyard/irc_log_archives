[2013-08-09 00:31:36 -0400] github-bawt: knife-essentials/update_cache 61b38a1 John Keiser: Invalidate "children" caches when children are created
[2013-08-09 05:59:37 -0400] erikh: glad to be back writing chef stuff. I'll spare you the details but let's say the alternative was less than happy.
[2013-08-09 15:24:59 -0400] petecheslock: fnichol - with test-kitchen is there a way yet to setup a kitchen.yml file to use 2 different driver_plugin's?  Like on my local I want kitchen vagrant - but on jenkins I want kitchen docker
[2013-08-09 15:28:01 -0400] jtimberman: petecheslock: drop off a .kitchen.local.yml
[2013-08-09 15:28:12 -0400] jtimberman: it will override .kitchen.yml
[2013-08-09 15:30:50 -0400] petecheslock: jtimberman well - i guess one more scenario - some people have ubuntu and will use docker/lxc - others have mac's and will use vagrant - anyway yet to say kitchen test <suite> or kitchen test <platform> and define the driver plugin on a per platform or suite basis?
[2013-08-09 15:31:10 -0400] petecheslock: but i guess in the nearterm using a .kitchen.local.yml could work
[2013-08-09 15:31:53 -0400] jtimberman: you can also stick ERB in there.
[2013-08-09 15:32:07 -0400] jtimberman: an magic ENV could dictate what to use
[2013-08-09 15:32:21 -0400] jtimberman: <% if ENV['docker'] -%>...
[2013-08-09 15:33:33 -0400] petecheslock: boom
[2013-08-09 15:33:48 -0400] petecheslock: great idea jtimberman thanks!
[2013-08-09 15:34:56 -0400] mattray: Are their any known issues with the latest Vagrant and Test-Kitchen versions?
[2013-08-09 15:35:03 -0400] mattray: I can't get TK to run against the apt cookbook, it's not creating "/tmp/kitchen-chef-solo/cookbooks"
[2013-08-09 15:42:19 -0400] mattray: hmm had Berkshelf 3.0beta in there, removed and now I have a different error
[2013-08-09 15:45:02 -0400] adamjk-dev: mattray: hrm
[2013-08-09 15:45:48 -0400] adamjk-dev: mattray: i am using berks 2.0.8 and test-kitchen 1.0.0.beta2
[2013-08-09 15:45:56 -0400] mattray: I'm just trying to follow the TESTING.md instructions out of the box with the apt cookbook
[2013-08-09 15:46:25 -0400] mattray: gem list showed berkshelf (3.0.0.beta2, 2.0.8)
[2013-08-09 15:46:37 -0400] adamjk-dev: hrmmmm
[2013-08-09 15:46:42 -0400] adamjk-dev: i would use berks 2.0.8
[2013-08-09 15:46:48 -0400] adamjk-dev: 3.0 even been released?
[2013-08-09 15:47:01 -0400] mattray: beta
[2013-08-09 15:47:19 -0400] adamjk-dev: yeah i would use 2.0.8
[2013-08-09 15:47:29 -0400] adamjk-dev: which version of test-kitchen came down with --pre?
[2013-08-09 15:47:49 -0400] mattray: beta 2
[2013-08-09 15:47:54 -0400] adamjk-dev: same as me
[2013-08-09 15:48:32 -0400] adamjk-dev: ok
[2013-08-09 15:48:34 -0400] adamjk-dev: so the kitchen.yml for apt
[2013-08-09 15:48:35 -0400] mattray: yeah, don't know why 3.0.0.beta2 had made it in there, must have come down with gem install test-kitchen --pre
[2013-08-09 15:48:38 -0400] adamjk-dev: has 2 platforms and 3 suites
[2013-08-09 15:48:43 -0400] adamjk-dev: if u test... 6 combinations will test
[2013-08-09 15:48:49 -0400] adamjk-dev: ohhh perhaps
[2013-08-09 15:48:50 -0400] mattray: yeah, the first test dies
[2013-08-09 15:49:00 -0400] adamjk-dev: did it get past berks install?
[2013-08-09 15:49:40 -0400] adamjk-dev: i just was working yesterday on adding test kitchen support to a jenkins_test cookbook
[2013-08-09 15:49:43 -0400] adamjk-dev: so its all new to me
[2013-08-09 15:49:45 -0400] adamjk-dev: but i got it all working
[2013-08-09 15:50:31 -0400] mattray: https://gist.github.com/mattray/6194727
[2013-08-09 15:51:10 -0400] mattray: failed on Berksfile stuff
[2013-08-09 15:52:04 -0400] adamjk-dev: that was with 2.0.8?
[2013-08-09 15:52:26 -0400] mattray: yes
[2013-08-09 15:52:55 -0400] adamjk-dev: interesting that output doesnt look familiar to me
[2013-08-09 15:53:37 -0400] adamjk-dev: perhaps i will try to run kitchen test against the apt cookbook
[2013-08-09 15:54:32 -0400] mattray: apt trunk with some fixes
[2013-08-09 15:54:41 -0400] adamjk-dev: oh
[2013-08-09 15:54:46 -0400] adamjk-dev: not what I would have just cloned?
[2013-08-09 15:56:12 -0400] adamjk-dev: you could alwasy try a berks install
[2013-08-09 15:56:13 -0400] adamjk-dev: beforehand
[2013-08-09 15:56:21 -0400] adamjk-dev: to make sure it will work when test-kitchen runs
[2013-08-09 15:56:35 -0400] adamjk-dev: based on the berksfile in the cookbook and your own config file settings for berkshelf
[2013-08-09 15:56:46 -0400] adamjk-dev: i would try that first
[2013-08-09 15:58:47 -0400] mattray: trying that now
[2013-08-09 16:00:19 -0400] adamjk-dev: i am booting the first VM
[2013-08-09 16:00:28 -0400] adamjk-dev: im wondering if I have the correct insecure key etc.

[2013-08-09 16:01:38 -0400] adamjk-dev: since I have had issues using those public boxes in the past
[2013-08-09 16:01:43 -0400] adamjk-dev: I don't know what I am missing
[2013-08-09 16:01:57 -0400] adamjk-dev: but it always seems to fail to SSH into the box to provision it
[2013-08-09 16:03:37 -0400] ryker: anyone know how I can get chef-client to run in debug mode in test-kitchen?
[2013-08-09 16:04:02 -0400] mattray: mine's ssh-ing just fine, berkshelf doesn't find the apt cookbook
[2013-08-09 16:06:05 -0400] adamjk-dev: hm
[2013-08-09 16:06:17 -0400] adamjk-dev: i wish i knew how to fix the SSH problem
[2013-08-09 16:06:22 -0400] adamjk-dev: i can never use any public boxes lol
[2013-08-09 16:06:28 -0400] adamjk-dev: you ran it from within the apt cookbook right?
[2013-08-09 16:06:34 -0400] adamjk-dev: metadata.rb says apt right
[2013-08-09 16:06:52 -0400] mattray: yup, checked that
[2013-08-09 16:07:13 -0400] adamjk-dev: berks install

[2013-08-09 16:07:25 -0400] adamjk-dev: i just did a berks install
[2013-08-09 16:07:27 -0400] adamjk-dev: and it found them
[2013-08-09 16:07:34 -0400] adamjk-dev: berks version?
[2013-08-09 16:07:36 -0400] adamjk-dev: for good measure
[2013-08-09 16:08:16 -0400] mattray: chef_handler is 1.1.4
[2013-08-09 16:08:17 -0400] adamjk-dev: cuz it should be able to find the apt cookbook
[2013-08-09 16:08:18 -0400] mattray: $ berks install
[2013-08-09 16:08:18 -0400] mattray: Using apt (2.0.1) from metadata

[2013-08-09 16:08:48 -0400] adamjk-dev: so berks worked
[2013-08-09 16:08:57 -0400] adamjk-dev: try running kitchen again (just test the first instance)
[2013-08-09 16:08:59 -0400] adamjk-dev: kitchen list
[2013-08-09 16:09:04 -0400] adamjk-dev: kitchen test <first name>
[2013-08-09 16:10:18 -0400] adamjk-dev: i removed my berkshelf (shelf)
[2013-08-09 16:10:28 -0400] adamjk-dev: and did a berks install and 1.1.4 chef_handler came down
[2013-08-09 16:10:30 -0400] adamjk-dev: from opscode
[2013-08-09 16:10:44 -0400] adamjk-dev: i just have that stupid issue with SSHing to public boxes
[2013-08-09 16:10:49 -0400] adamjk-dev: or I would run the kitchen test myself
[2013-08-09 16:11:33 -0400] mattray: trying again. this time with gem install test-kitchen --pre --minimal-deps
[2013-08-09 16:11:43 -0400] mattray: I saw another ridley got in there previously
[2013-08-09 16:11:48 -0400] adamjk-dev: ah i see
[2013-08-09 16:11:51 -0400] mattray: besides the berkshelf 3.0beta
[2013-08-09 16:11:52 -0400] adamjk-dev: ridley and berkshelf....
[2013-08-09 16:11:54 -0400] adamjk-dev: dont get me started
[2013-08-09 16:12:02 -0400] adamjk-dev: i talked with jamie winsor the other day for a while
[2013-08-09 16:12:07 -0400] adamjk-dev: about berkshelf and ridley
[2013-08-09 16:12:21 -0400] adamjk-dev: we troubleshooted an issue and he fixed it with ridley version etc.
[2013-08-09 16:12:26 -0400] mattray: if this works I'll update the TESTING.md :)
[2013-08-09 16:12:42 -0400] adamjk-dev: gem list | grep ridley
[2013-08-09 16:12:42 -0400] adamjk-dev: ridley (1.4.0, 1.2.5)
[2013-08-09 16:12:52 -0400] adamjk-dev: good man :)
[2013-08-09 16:13:05 -0400] adamjk-dev: its neat once it is all going
[2013-08-09 16:13:06 -0400] mattray: well, if this works I'll write some more tests and get on with it :)
[2013-08-09 16:13:12 -0400] adamjk-dev: way to be
[2013-08-09 16:13:16 -0400] adamjk-dev: i wrote a bunch around jenkins
[2013-08-09 16:13:20 -0400] adamjk-dev: but the cookbook is all janked up
[2013-08-09 16:13:29 -0400] adamjk-dev: they have tests in there that aren't minitest
[2013-08-09 16:13:29 -0400] adamjk-dev: and such
[2013-08-09 16:13:32 -0400] adamjk-dev: im confused haha
[2013-08-09 16:13:41 -0400] adamjk-dev: so i made a private cookbook (jenkins_test)
[2013-08-09 16:13:43 -0400] adamjk-dev: that is like a wrapper
[2013-08-09 16:13:45 -0400] adamjk-dev: and i just run it
[2013-08-09 16:13:49 -0400] mattray: did you apt test work?
[2013-08-09 16:13:59 -0400] adamjk-dev: i cant get past logging in via vagrant SSH
[2013-08-09 16:14:05 -0400] adamjk-dev: whatever that issue is
[2013-08-09 16:14:12 -0400] adamjk-dev: i always use internal RHEL boxes we create
[2013-08-09 16:14:17 -0400] adamjk-dev: i cant use the public opscode ones
[2013-08-09 16:14:22 -0400] adamjk-dev: i dont know if its my keys or what
[2013-08-09 16:14:30 -0400] adamjk-dev: http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2012-11/msg00187.html
[2013-08-09 16:14:32 -0400] mattray: ding ding ding, working
[2013-08-09 16:14:35 -0400] adamjk-dev: I see that kind of output
[2013-08-09 16:14:40 -0400] adamjk-dev: BAM!
[2013-08-09 16:14:45 -0400] adamjk-dev: yeah
[2013-08-09 16:14:53 -0400] adamjk-dev: ridley and berkshelf.... gotta be careful there
[2013-08-09 16:15:02 -0400] adamjk-dev: ive had many issues with it
[2013-08-09 16:15:58 -0400] mattray: yay, it ran the test, now to try "all"
[2013-08-09 16:16:08 -0400] adamjk-dev: nice
[2013-08-09 16:16:10 -0400] adamjk-dev: good stuff
[2013-08-09 16:16:21 -0400] adamjk-dev: so the resolution is the Gemfile?
[2013-08-09 16:16:25 -0400] adamjk-dev: or just clearing out ridley version
[2013-08-09 16:17:28 -0400] mattray: clearing out the ridley version
[2013-08-09 16:18:24 -0400] mattray: if you're following the TESTING.md instructions, you install berkshelf, then you install tk with pre. The pre pulls in more berkshelf deps
[2013-08-09 16:19:34 -0400] adamjk-dev: i see
[2013-08-09 16:19:39 -0400] adamjk-dev: well at least you are working
[2013-08-09 16:20:09 -0400] adamjk-dev: wait
[2013-08-09 16:20:19 -0400] adamjk-dev: i thought --pre pulled in the pre-release like alpha or beta
[2013-08-09 16:20:24 -0400] adamjk-dev: but i could be wrong
[2013-08-09 16:21:09 -0400] mattray: https://gist.github.com/6194969
[2013-08-09 16:22:57 -0400] yfeldblum: that is what --pre does
[2013-08-09 16:23:35 -0400] mattray: yfeldblum: but it upgraded the deps too
[2013-08-09 16:23:36 -0400] yfeldblum: it installs the latest version of the gem, whether release or prerelease
[2013-08-09 16:24:27 -0400] adamjk-dev: oh pre does the latest version regardless?
[2013-08-09 16:34:18 -0400] mattray: apparently
[2013-08-09 16:36:54 -0400] yfeldblum: so far as i am aware, yes
[2013-08-09 16:37:06 -0400] jtimberman: mattray: https://gist.github.com/jtimberman/18c6d534b5ebdf818dd6
[2013-08-09 16:37:22 -0400] jtimberman: no ridley or berkshelf update/beta in there
[2013-08-09 16:38:20 -0400] mattray: wtf...
[2013-08-09 16:38:31 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, echo 'gem: --no-rdoc --no-ri' > /etc/gemrc
[2013-08-09 16:38:35 -0400] jtimberman: that's on a fresh VM snapshot w/ only ruby and libxml/xslt
[2013-08-09 16:38:40 -0400] jtimberman: yfeldblum: yeah yeah
[2013-08-09 16:40:57 -0400] mattray: jtimberman: https://gist.github.com/mattray/6195128#file-shell-txt-L101
[2013-08-09 16:41:18 -0400] mattray: I have no idea.
[2013-08-09 16:41:28 -0400] mattray: Using a fresh, empty rvm gemset
[2013-08-09 16:45:40 -0400] jtimberman: mattray: are you sure rvm didn't magic something into the gem function it overrides for you?
[2013-08-09 16:45:57 -0400] jtimberman: mattray: you're doing gem install berkshelf --pre there.
[2013-08-09 16:46:05 -0400] jtimberman: mattray: pretty sure that's not what you want.
[2013-08-09 16:46:17 -0400] mattray: no, I found it
[2013-08-09 16:46:23 -0400] mattray: stupid up arrow
[2013-08-09 16:46:30 -0400] jtimberman: the TESTING.md file says to do gem install berkshelf (no --pre), and separately gem install test-kitchen --pre
[2013-08-09 16:46:47 -0400] mattray: gem install berkshelf;
[2013-08-09 16:46:56 -0400] mattray: gem install berkshelf test-kitchen --pre
[2013-08-09 16:47:32 -0400] mattray: that gist had it, I missed it
[2013-08-09 16:47:40 -0400] mattray: works fine now

[2013-08-09 18:41:36 -0400] jchauncey: so i am trying to get test-kitchen to work with chef-zero. Is there any documentation on doing this?
[2013-08-09 19:29:02 -0400] mattray: anyone have good examples of test-kitchen with chefspec?
[2013-08-09 19:32:18 -0400] mattray: java looks promising
[2013-08-09 19:32:33 -0400] adamjk-dev: mattray: ?
[2013-08-09 19:32:40 -0400] adamjk-dev: isnt chefspec for unit testing?
[2013-08-09 19:32:45 -0400] adamjk-dev: and pre-convergence testing?
[2013-08-09 19:32:54 -0400] adamjk-dev: not sure why you would run it with test kitchen
[2013-08-09 19:34:02 -0400] adamjk-dev: chefspec you can set node attributes as you wish (to simulate different machines) and you can test against them
[2013-08-09 19:34:20 -0400] adamjk-dev: you wouldn't want to bring up a machine and test pre-convergence stuff on it I wouldn't think
[2013-08-09 19:34:23 -0400] adamjk-dev: unless I am missing something
[2013-08-09 19:43:00 -0400] adamjk-dev: chefspec tests you run before converging
[2013-08-09 19:43:16 -0400] adamjk-dev: to have quick tests to see that certain resources will get fired as you expect
[2013-08-09 19:43:33 -0400] adamjk-dev: like saying on Ubuntu, this package will be installed here..... instead of where it would be installed on RHEL
[2013-08-09 19:43:34 -0400] adamjk-dev: etc.
[2013-08-09 19:55:46 -0400] mattray: adamjk-dev: I've got some tests I want to run and mock out results
[2013-08-09 19:55:58 -0400] mattray: it seemed like chefspec was a better fit.
[2013-08-09 19:56:09 -0400] mattray: TK 0.7 ran chefspec too, I assumed the 1.0 did
[2013-08-09 19:59:10 -0400] adamjk-dev: oh
[2013-08-09 19:59:14 -0400] adamjk-dev: then im not up to snuff on that stuff
[2013-08-09 19:59:26 -0400] adamjk-dev: im no expert either
[2013-08-09 19:59:36 -0400] adamjk-dev: to my knowledge, chefspec was for unit testing and pre-convergence
[2013-08-09 19:59:53 -0400] adamjk-dev: so it didn't make much sense to converge nodes, and then run tests that did not require convergence
[2013-08-09 20:00:14 -0400] adamjk-dev: unless chefspec can be used to test after the fact (post convergence tests) to see that a service is "actually" running etc.
[2013-08-09 20:00:23 -0400] adamjk-dev: not that resource would be fired and "told" to install some file
[2013-08-09 20:05:41 -0400] mattray: still digging around
[2013-08-09 20:14:56 -0400] mattray: adamjk-dev: I'm clearly in the tk0.7 era in my thinking
[2013-08-09 20:15:08 -0400] mattray: chefspec isn't called anymore
[2013-08-09 20:16:44 -0400] adamjk-dev: mattray: hehe... i missed that era :)
[2013-08-09 20:16:45 -0400] adamjk-dev: no worries
[2013-08-09 20:16:59 -0400] adamjk-dev: im new to a bit of this (and only 6 months into this whole new space of development)
[2013-08-09 20:17:03 -0400] adamjk-dev: but trying to learn
[2013-08-09 20:17:05 -0400] adamjk-dev: yeah
[2013-08-09 20:17:10 -0400] adamjk-dev: so unless I am mistaken
[2013-08-09 20:17:30 -0400] adamjk-dev: chefspec for unit tests (pre convergence) -- quick tests to verify that resources "will" be invoked as you expect
[2013-08-09 20:17:56 -0400] adamjk-dev: test kitchen and minitest (post convergence) for integration tests -- longer tests to actually converge machines then test whatever you want after they are up
[2013-08-09 20:19:37 -0400] mattray: yup.
[2013-08-09 20:19:47 -0400] mattray: tk/minitest seems like overkill
[2013-08-09 20:19:49 -0400] mattray: sometimes
[2013-08-09 20:21:44 -0400] adamjk-dev: hehe
[2013-08-09 20:21:46 -0400] adamjk-dev: it can be
[2013-08-09 20:21:52 -0400] adamjk-dev: but ive had issues
[2013-08-09 20:21:57 -0400] adamjk-dev: where Chef run succeeds
[2013-08-09 20:22:09 -0400] adamjk-dev: (which should check that  a service was started and is running etc.)
[2013-08-09 20:22:13 -0400] adamjk-dev: and i had other issues
[2013-08-09 20:22:16 -0400] adamjk-dev: that killed that service
[2013-08-09 20:22:29 -0400] adamjk-dev: so really... needed to verify that the service truly was running after the whole run
[2013-08-09 20:22:33 -0400] adamjk-dev: and minitest is good for that
[2013-08-09 20:22:47 -0400] adamjk-dev: if you just want to check that on different distros chef will be told to install files in different locations etc.
[2013-08-09 20:22:52 -0400] adamjk-dev: that is good for chefspec
[2013-08-09 20:23:01 -0400] adamjk-dev: (or if you are doing test driven development :) )
[2013-08-09 20:28:43 -0400] adamjk-dev: im out for now
[2013-08-09 20:28:47 -0400] adamjk-dev: enjoy!
[2013-08-09 20:38:55 -0400] jchauncey: mattray: https://github.com/RallySoftware-cookbooks/chromedriver
[2013-08-09 20:39:25 -0400] jchauncey: that cookbook uses test-kitchen with server spec and uses chef spec
[2013-08-09 20:39:42 -0400] jchauncey: although we are not using test-kitchen to runt he chef-spec tests (didn't know you could do that)
[2013-08-09 20:44:15 -0400] mattray: jchauncey: I think I've got a good mix going now. ChefSpec for minimal testing, TK for unit testing
[2013-08-09 20:45:16 -0400] jchauncey: no TK for integration testing chef spec for unit testing
[2013-08-09 20:45:28 -0400] mattray: yeah, you're right
[2013-08-09 20:45:43 -0400] mattray: s/unit/functional/
[2013-08-09 20:45:49 -0400] mattray: integration
[2013-08-09 20:45:50 -0400] jchauncey: i would look into server spec instead of using mini test kitchen
[2013-08-09 20:46:08 -0400] jchauncey: for your matcher framework against the system
[2013-08-09 20:46:48 -0400] mattray: I was just extending the existing minitests
[2013-08-09 20:47:00 -0400] jchauncey: ah
