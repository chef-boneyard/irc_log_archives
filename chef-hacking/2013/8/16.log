[2013-08-16 00:13:23 -0400] fred909: fnichol: trying to use data_bags with test-kitchen and i'm getting an error "I cannot read /etc/chef/client.pem, which you told me to use to sign requests!"... search() should work?
[2013-08-16 01:57:17 -0400] douglaswth: hmm, it seems there is no way to pass in chef.arguments for vagrant in test-kitchen: https://github.com/opscode/kitchen-vagrant/blob/master/lib/kitchen/vagrant/vagrantfile_creator.rb#L85
[2013-08-16 04:41:01 -0400] jtimberman: douglaswth: not at this time.
[2013-08-16 07:11:05 -0400] erikh: whoever fixed the nat / split horizon erchef/bookshelf problem, I love you.

[2013-08-16 12:05:55 -0400] tugce: Is there anyone who can help me about first chef configurations?
[2013-08-16 12:21:22 -0400] teukka: tugce: #chef has more audience for *using* chef. this channel is for coding chef itself etc.
[2013-08-16 12:21:58 -0400] teukka: tugce: but in any case it is best to just ask the question =)
[2013-08-16 12:29:11 -0400] tugce: teukka: oh, i misinterpreted the channel's name, i think it's best to ask on chef or learnchef

[2013-08-16 17:51:22 -0400] douglaswth: jtimberman: I suppose I should open a ticket and start hacking away?
[2013-08-16 19:58:10 -0400] swedish_chef: I'm wondering if there is a way to capture the output from ShellOut (or at least preserve the temp files generated)? I'm working on an LWRP that wraps third party scripts that occasionally fail but return with exit code zero. No easy way to verify the operation succeeded other than looking at the stderr output.
[2013-08-16 20:09:15 -0400] mattray: swedish_chef: take a look at using mixlib-shellout
[2013-08-16 20:09:28 -0400] yfeldblum: swedish_chef, shell_out(%W[which ruby]).stdout
[2013-08-16 20:15:50 -0400] swedish_chef: @mattray @yfeldblum sorry, should have made this more clear. I was wondering if there is a way do this for a recipe as a whole. I'd like to be able to use existing LWRPs such as bash, etc. Reading the source of ShellOut I saw the stdout/stderr buffers but going that route is a last resort.
[2013-08-16 20:17:39 -0400] yfeldblum: swedish_chef, i don't know why you wouldn't just use shell_out from your provider

[2013-08-16 20:20:08 -0400] swedish_chef: @yfeldblum I get lots of things for free by using the higher-level abstractions: directory changing behaviors, identity management, conditional execution, etc.
[2013-08-16 20:20:48 -0400] swedish_chef: None of it really complicated but I hate reinventing the wheel.
[2013-08-16 20:21:56 -0400] yfeldblum: swedish_chef, you get to specify :cwd, :user, :group, :umask, and plenty of other options with shell_out
[2013-08-16 20:22:14 -0400] yfeldblum: swedish_chef, and you get conditional execution with a simple `if some_condition` tacked onto the end of the line
[2013-08-16 20:22:29 -0400] yfeldblum: swedish_chef, using the `bash` resource is what's reinventing the wheel ... :D
[2013-08-16 20:22:36 -0400] yfeldblum: swedish_chef, at least from within a provider action
[2013-08-16 20:23:13 -0400] swedish_chef: @yfeldblum you are right: I was looking at the OS-specific provider (bad name resolution plugin) as opposed to the higher-level mixin. Thanks.
