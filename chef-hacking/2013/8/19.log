[2013-08-19 08:12:16 -0400] thxspeed_: hi guys, anyone know where I can find a complete set of attributes available inside knife template?
[2013-08-19 08:12:23 -0400] thxspeed_: is there anything apart knife_config available?
[2013-08-19 17:20:28 -0400] pwelch: so with the Chef Enterprise announcement, does anyone have an idea what the code for controlling network hardware like Cisco Routers will look like in the future? Built into Chef running on the hardware? Built in providers or lwrp cookbooks?
[2013-08-19 17:49:24 -0400] miah: unless cisco adds an api, it will likely be a resource that does things over ssh/http

[2013-08-19 18:09:02 -0400] pwelch: miah: the press release mentioned some cisco api called onePK. I guess I was just wondering if it will be baked into chef/cookbook lwrp that gets run on the hardware or some type of ssh thing like you mentioned
[2013-08-19 18:21:25 -0400] erikh: I've done that with arrowpoints before; not particularly... pleasing but some expect/tcl got the job done
[2013-08-19 18:21:45 -0400] erikh: I guess saying "arrowpoint" dates me a bit
[2013-08-19 18:37:33 -0400] jtimberman: tcl!
[2013-08-19 18:38:09 -0400] jtimberman: i did a paper and presentation in college about tcl. thanks to that a friend of mine got a job at cisco and has been there since. he said he's "written hundreds of thousands of lines of tcl code" since ~1999.

[2013-08-19 19:15:33 -0400] pwelch: Haven't messed with TCL but I remember realizing how much you can do on a cisco router since most of the OS versions ship with TCL
[2013-08-19 19:16:08 -0400] pwelch: Did not realize TCL was used that much at Cisco though. Makes sense if they bundle it with their router OS
[2013-08-19 19:18:48 -0400] erikh: well, tcl is used in expect which was used to telnet in and scrape output / send input
[2013-08-19 19:19:11 -0400] erikh: jtimberman: neat. I know a few new cisco employees now, heh
[2013-08-19 19:42:38 -0400] jtimberman: erikh: ha! yes indeed.
[2013-08-19 19:43:10 -0400] jtimberman: erikh: that, and they do a lot of stuff under the hood w/ tcl.
[2013-08-19 19:46:19 -0400] jtimberman: at least thats what my friend told me about the things he worked on, so i'm going to apply an assumption across the board.
[2013-08-19 19:46:57 -0400] erikh: heh
[2013-08-19 19:47:12 -0400] erikh: tcl all the things (tee hee)

[2013-08-19 20:50:21 -0400] sn0wb1rd: Hey guys. I'm trying to hack the test-kitchen's chef_solo provisioner to accept a log_file config parameter so it can use that with the "--logfile" command line argument to chef_solo.

[2013-08-19 22:08:58 -0400] mattray: anyone using a .kitchen.local.yml with test-kitchen? Docs are slim
[2013-08-19 22:19:51 -0400] cwj: mattray: i use one from time to time, pretty much have to duplicate the entire .kitchen.yml and then make my local changes
[2013-08-19 22:20:31 -0400] mattray: cwj: hrmm that's actually not terrible I guess.
[2013-08-19 22:21:02 -0400] cwj: i thought the two were supposed to get merged but i havent been able to get it working that way
[2013-08-19 22:25:18 -0400] mattray: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/test-kitchen if you're interested
