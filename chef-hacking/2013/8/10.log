[2013-08-10 23:52:40 -0400] DCAP: Hi, If anyone is interested in creating chef cookbooks for a debian LAMP project I am working on (Apache, postgres etc) using tools like Vagrant and EC2 please contact me. Apologies however there is no training in australia and Its driving me nuts trying to get it to work as I am not a programmer (main issue is using attributes for the postgresql/database recipe)

[2013-08-10 23:59:47 -0400] DCAP: ok thanks
