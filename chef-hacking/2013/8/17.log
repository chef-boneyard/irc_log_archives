[2013-08-17 03:30:54 -0400] mwildt: Got a question in regard to the 'script and/or 'ruby' resource.
[2013-08-17 03:32:05 -0400] mwildt: I coded up a recipe, and I'm invoking a ruby script that will generate a file. Problem is that I do not see the file generated. If invoking the ruby script manually it works fine but from recipe it does not.
[2013-08-17 03:32:48 -0400] mwildt: The recipe log is not too helpful on whats really executed. Any ideas on how to debug this ?
