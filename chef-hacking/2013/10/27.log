[2013-10-27 06:00:28 -0400] Cope: fnichol: remind me... what's the protocol for getting busser to install a helper package for the purpose of running a test?
[2013-10-27 06:00:51 -0400] Cope: ISTR you can create a file which is basically a chef-apply that installs it
[2013-10-27 06:07:30 -0400] slicknick: HMI ?
[2013-10-27 06:09:19 -0400] Cope: slicknick: hmm?
[2013-10-27 06:11:09 -0400] Cope: but basically you can drop a file in with, eg, package 'nc', and it'll get installed on the node after converge, so you can use it to run a test
[2013-10-27 06:14:50 -0400] Cope: oh it might actually be in busser
[2013-10-27 06:16:21 -0400] Cope: https://github.com/fnichol/busser/blob/master/lib/busser/command/test.rb#L67-L74
[2013-10-27 06:16:24 -0400] Cope: :D
[2013-10-27 06:26:16 -0400] slicknick: i see no reference to a protocol in those lines .. or am i missing it
[2013-10-27 06:26:46 -0400] Cope: sorry - probbaly a poor use of the word; I guess I meant: what should a person do
[2013-10-27 06:27:26 -0400] Cope: i guess procedure would be better
[2013-10-27 07:55:05 -0400] slicknick: indeed
