[2013-10-28 12:14:23 -0400] Guest64837: hi guys, I have a web app I'm working on and I now want to use vagrant and chef to build a better dev env. But I don't quite understand how I have to setup my project to use my application cookbook. I'm really grateful for any hint!!!

[2013-10-28 13:13:06 -0400] jtzl: hello all, I have a test-kitchen workstation that runs lxc+chef-zero properly and another one that was built the same way that gets an error "undefined method `scratch_dir' for Chef::Resource::RubyBlock
[2013-10-28 13:13:25 -0400] jtzl: Has anybody else experienced this?
[2013-10-28 13:13:54 -0400] jtzl: it looks like earlier in the code "scratch_dir" is defined properly and then the reference gets lost(?)

[2013-10-28 19:31:18 -0400] github-bawt: chef/11-stable c39c76c jamescott: update options per CHEF-4685
[2013-10-28 20:58:33 -0400] ryker: hi.  i'm trying to write a knife plugin for automating the launching of our environments in ec2.  For some reason, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to specify the chef environment to use.  Looking at ec2_server_create and ec2_base, it looks like I can either specify it with {ec2servercreateinstance}[:environment] or Chef::Config[:knife][:environment].  I've created an instance called bootstrap
[2013-10-28 20:58:35 -0400] ryker: with 'bootstrap = Chef::Knife::Ec2ServerCreate.new' and then use 'bootstrap.config[:environment] = 'myenvironmentname', but it always ends up defaulting to _default.
[2013-10-28 20:59:13 -0400] ryker: Is that the wrong way to specify the environment?
[2013-10-28 21:01:11 -0400] ryker: fnichol: i'm actually using your knife-server plugin code (specifically server_bootstrap_ec2.rb) as an example, but you don't specify an environment programatically.  Any idea how I'd do that?
[2013-10-28 21:01:21 -0400] cinen: ryker: I've done the same thing and had the same problem.  after digging through the chef source it seems the bootstrap process reads from Chef::Config[:knife][:environment] instead of the config variable from cli options
[2013-10-28 21:01:57 -0400] cinen: so what I did was in my custom plugin set Chef::Config[:knife][:environment] = config[:environment]
[2013-10-28 21:02:02 -0400] cinen: solved it for me
[2013-10-28 21:02:44 -0400] cinen: there is a proc on the environment option that is supposed to do that, but doesn't seem to
[2013-10-28 21:03:37 -0400] ryker: cinen: glad to hear it's not just me, but that sucks. :)  I have knife configs that depend on the value of Chef::Config[:knife][:environment] for pulling in other environment specific files which are tied to a specific chef server, not necessarily that chef environment name.  so, changing Chef::Config[:knife][:environment] isn't really an option for me.  it will require me to duplicate config files for
[2013-10-28 21:03:39 -0400] ryker: each environment the chef server manages.
[2013-10-28 21:04:05 -0400] ryker: cinen: yeah, I dug in the code and saw that proc and was stumped why it didn't work.
[2013-10-28 21:04:23 -0400] ryker: though, i only know enough ruby to do what I need in chef and to be dangerous. :)
[2013-10-28 21:04:31 -0400] cinen: I've meant to submit a bug report but never got around to it
[2013-10-28 21:05:21 -0400] ryker: cinen: ok. thx for replying.  I'll take a look at why it's not pulling in config[:environment] and see about fixing it.
[2013-10-28 21:06:22 -0400] cinen: I found in the chef code where it was at one point
[2013-10-28 21:06:29 -0400] cinen: just a sec, looking again
[2013-10-28 21:08:23 -0400] cinen: something to do with https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/core/bootstrap_context.rb
[2013-10-28 21:10:14 -0400] ryker: cinen: I don't see anything wrong there, but there is a proc that initializes environment somewhere else.  trying to find it.
[2013-10-28 21:10:41 -0400] cinen: I found exactly what it was at one point but its been a while
[2013-10-28 21:11:37 -0400] ryker: cloning the repo now. easier to grep it than navigate the github ui. :)

[2013-10-28 21:12:52 -0400] cinen: ah. https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/bootstrap.rb line 186 when BootstrapContext is initialized Chef::Config is passed in, which is why the proc is there just doesn't seem to work
[2013-10-28 21:15:11 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] danielsdeleo merged debug-req-headers into master: http://git.io/TeOy8Q
[2013-10-28 21:15:25 -0400] cinen: I think the proc in the option for the knife plugin should be :proc => Proc.new { |e| Chef::Config[:environment] = e } instead of :proc => Proc.new { |e| Chef::Config[:knife][:environment] = e }
[2013-10-28 21:15:29 -0400] cinen: that could also fix it
[2013-10-28 21:16:07 -0400] ryker: ah, good point.
[2013-10-28 21:16:13 -0400] cinen: because BootstrapContext reads Chef::Config[:environment]

[2013-10-28 21:16:50 -0400] cinen: so maybe in your custom plugin, override that proc

[2013-10-28 21:17:52 -0400] ryker: i'll have to google that. Not sure how I would override that in my plugin. :)
[2013-10-28 21:18:29 -0400] cinen: option :environment,
[2013-10-28 21:18:29 -0400] cinen: :short => "-E ENVIRONMENT",
[2013-10-28 21:18:29 -0400] cinen: :long => "--environment ENVIRONMENT",
[2013-10-28 21:18:29 -0400] cinen: :description => "Chef Environment",
[2013-10-28 21:18:36 -0400] cinen: :proc => Proc.new { |e| Chef::Config[:environment] = e }
[2013-10-28 21:18:37 -0400] ryker: I think you'd want to intelligently merge Chef::Config[:environment] and Chef::Config[:knife][:environment], not just pass one or the other.
[2013-10-28 21:18:44 -0400] ryker: but, yeah. I see your point.
[2013-10-28 21:18:52 -0400] cinen: just add that inside the class
[2013-10-28 21:19:45 -0400] ryker: i'll give that a shot.  thanks for the help
[2013-10-28 21:19:46 -0400] cinen: I think that would be the best solution without monkeypatching chef
[2013-10-28 21:22:51 -0400] cinen: You're probably right about the merging
[2013-10-28 21:23:05 -0400] cinen: it may need to be set in both places
[2013-10-28 21:23:57 -0400] ryker: cinen: I think the solution would be to change here: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/core/bootstrap_context.rb#L45-47
[2013-10-28 21:24:14 -0400] ryker: that should be a ternary, taking into account config[:environment]
[2013-10-28 21:25:18 -0400] cinen: hmm
[2013-10-28 21:25:59 -0400] cinen: @knife_config[:environment] || '_default'    on line 46 should do it
[2013-10-28 21:27:23 -0400] cinen: or maybe "@knife_config[:environment] || @chef_config[:environment] || '_default'"
[2013-10-28 21:27:37 -0400] ryker: not sure where @knife_config is defined.  Is @knife_config[:environment] the same as Chef::Config[:knife][:environment] ?
[2013-10-28 21:27:52 -0400] cinen: its defined in that class
[2013-10-28 21:27:57 -0400] cinen: line 100
[2013-10-28 21:27:59 -0400] ryker: yeah, that last would probably work better.
[2013-10-28 21:28:16 -0400] ryker: ah, so it is. :)
[2013-10-28 21:28:47 -0400] cinen: I assumed knife_config would fall back to chef_config if key doesn't exist but it doesn't
[2013-10-28 21:29:25 -0400] cinen: if I have time to do some testing later to make sure I may file a bug report and a fix
[2013-10-28 21:40:49 -0400] cinen: oh and btw ryker you can search a github repo without checking it and and using grep.  there's a search bar at the top just make sure "This repository" is selected
[2013-10-28 21:44:13 -0400] ryker: cinen: :).  Yeah, I know.  I just prefer to use grep or ack.  Just habit I guess
[2013-10-28 21:45:32 -0400] cinen: understood
[2013-10-28 21:47:53 -0400] cinen: https://github.com/opscode/chef/commit/ef57e4235ed89e9f7fb1a6107b8fe334f6ea487a#diff-115973714d90125272c556b538118c86R270
[2013-10-28 21:48:06 -0400] cinen: seems to me like that very old commit should've fixed it
[2013-10-28 21:48:18 -0400] cinen: not sure why it doesn't
[2013-10-28 21:50:01 -0400] cinen: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/knife.rb#L385 its still there
[2013-10-28 21:59:06 -0400] ryker: yeah, i'm not sure either
