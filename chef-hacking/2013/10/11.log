[2013-10-11 02:41:44 -0400] timsmith: anyone around that's experienced with chef-zero and test kitchen?
[2013-10-11 04:06:55 -0400] fujin: anyone using tk with chef zero?
[2013-10-11 04:11:26 -0400] fujin: tinking about making a chef_client or chef_zero_on_workstation provisioner
[2013-10-11 04:12:02 -0400] fujin: (mostly to test search against a real-ish chefserver from testkitchen)
[2013-10-11 04:26:57 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: possibly of interest: https://twitter.com/jkeiser2/status/388460927026085888
[2013-10-11 04:27:23 -0400] fujin: 100 yaks in every direction
[2013-10-11 04:27:33 -0400] fujin: jtimberman: using test-kitchen, so
[2013-10-11 04:27:39 -0400] fujin: need to build up a provisioner I think :(
[2013-10-11 04:27:59 -0400] fujin: even then, I want to have the data on the host, chef-zero on the host, just the port available via host-only network or similar (docker port map comes to mind)
[2013-10-11 04:28:03 -0400] fujin: for chef-client inside of a VM to talk to
[2013-10-11 04:28:04 -0400] fujin: ya dig?
[2013-10-11 04:29:21 -0400] jkeiser: fujin: I only saw the last three messages, but while it can be done, you can also do exactly the same thing with chef-zero inside the VM(s) pointed at a shared/mounted file system with your repo on it
[2013-10-11 04:29:52 -0400] jkeiser: i.e. chef-client with local_mode true and chef_repo_path '/mnt/directory_from_host'
[2013-10-11 04:30:02 -0400] jkeiser: As long as the host directory is read-write shared
[2013-10-11 04:30:22 -0400] jkeiser: Not saying either one is necessary, but they are both options that should accomplish the same thing
[2013-10-11 04:30:46 -0400] fujin: i guess I just want to avoid running 10+ chef-zero processes inside of VMs, all talking to one synced folder
[2013-10-11 04:30:56 -0400] fujin: to test multi-node searching and so-on.
[2013-10-11 04:31:22 -0400] fujin: they would all have the same responses.. i guess.
[2013-10-11 04:31:38 -0400] jkeiser: fujin: in practical terms it won't be different.  If you use local mode, there are no new actual processes, just a thread that is spawned during the chef-client run to handle the server, and disposed of after the run
[2013-10-11 04:31:54 -0400] fujin: hmm
[2013-10-11 04:32:13 -0400] fujin: still needs a new provisioner yes, for local mode + synced folder?
[2013-10-11 04:32:20 -0400] jkeiser: fujin: chef-zero in repository mode keeps nothing in memory--it *always* reads from / writes to the disk
[2013-10-11 04:32:21 -0400] fujin: (for test-kitchen)
[2013-10-11 04:33:02 -0400] fujin: i can modify the existing chef_zero one to setup a synced folder instead of scping the data down to the VM
[2013-10-11 04:33:15 -0400] jkeiser: So since write-backs will go straight back to the mounted folder, other VMs will see them instantly.  register your node from machine A, and it goes in the nodes/A.rb file.  Node B will immediately see that file when it does a search/node/<something>
[2013-10-11 04:33:29 -0400] fujin: sounds good, I hope :)
[2013-10-11 04:34:01 -0400] fujin: that functionality not released yet, though? right? in omnibus form?
[2013-10-11 04:34:23 -0400] jkeiser: Nope, not till 11.8, sadly
[2013-10-11 04:34:41 -0400] jkeiser: Either one works--I don't have enough context to figure out what you were doing.  It really just depends whether punching a chef-zero port through to the VMs is easier or harder than sharing a folder
[2013-10-11 04:35:10 -0400] jkeiser: The provisioner has to be written either way
[2013-10-11 04:39:43 -0400] fujin: jkeiser: i think both docker and vagrant could pull of the synced folder/volume dance, as well as the port forward routine
[2013-10-11 04:40:18 -0400] fujin: jkeiser: what do you usually use to manage vm lifecycles?
[2013-10-11 04:40:22 -0400] fujin: vagrant directly?
[2013-10-11 04:41:29 -0400] jkeiser: fujin: honestly, our existing tooling still uses chef-solo on vagrant.  I will be changing that now, obviously :)
[2013-10-11 04:42:21 -0400] fujin: vagrant+chef_client provisioner+synced folder/10.0.2.2:8889 chef-zero -H 0.0.0.0 is a zero-work approach
[2013-10-11 04:42:33 -0400] fujin: just have to decide if it is worth the yakshave today of converting my .kitchen.yml over
[2013-10-11 04:43:09 -0400] jkeiser: The only thing about using chef-zero the executable is, it doesn't write back to the dir
[2013-10-11 04:43:29 -0400] jkeiser: So, if I have 2 VMs, they can't see each other's node info, right?
[2013-10-11 04:43:36 -0400] jkeiser: Oh, is chef-zero running on the host in this case?
[2013-10-11 04:43:43 -0400] jkeiser: That would work fine
[2013-10-11 04:44:23 -0400] fujin: yeah, I think I would probably run it on the host.
[2013-10-11 04:44:37 -0400] fujin: to talk to the port directly on 10.0.2.2 (the Virtualbox Host addr)
[2013-10-11 04:44:52 -0400] fujin: otherwise
[2013-10-11 04:44:54 -0400] fujin: ah yeah
[2013-10-11 04:45:03 -0400] fujin: vagrant chef-client provisioner would need to be enhanced to support local_mode true
[2013-10-11 04:45:14 -0400] fujin: oh I think you get raw access to the config object with the vagrant file don't ya
[2013-10-11 04:55:57 -0400] fujin: ah well.
[2013-10-11 04:56:03 -0400] fujin: be excited to play with that in 11.8.
[2013-10-11 05:35:22 -0400] jtimberman: jkzome this is super cool
[2013-10-11 05:35:28 -0400] jtimberman: bah, not here :)
[2013-10-11 16:18:19 -0400] fnichol: cripes, i have an active irc connection?? woah, hey all!
[2013-10-11 16:18:54 -0400] fnichol: jkeiser: again, congrats getting the local mode merged
[2013-10-11 16:19:29 -0400] fnichol: this'll make the chef_zero test-kitchen provisioner more of a backwards compatible shim for releases older thatn 11.8 (i hope)
[2013-10-11 16:20:12 -0400] jkeiser: fnichol: thanks!  So happy to finally have that journey over.  I've been holding off on other projects until I made myself do that final 2%
[2013-10-11 16:20:50 -0400] jkeiser: Yeah, could be a landscape change.  So weird that so much code sits behind those measly two characters on the command line
[2013-10-11 16:21:06 -0400] fnichol: jkeiser: i need to checkout the code diff specifically but how is the chef-zero code incorporated? gem dep or included? and the thin dep?
[2013-10-11 16:22:00 -0400] jkeiser: fnichol: gem dep.  And we're depending on puma v < 2.0 (since that's the only one that works on all Chef OS's and all supported Ruby versions)
[2013-10-11 16:22:01 -0400] fnichol: jkeiser: ah right, it's puma now
[2013-10-11 16:22:19 -0400] jkeiser: It's ridiculous how hard it was to find a web server that just worked everywhere
[2013-10-11 16:22:22 -0400] c_t: hey jkeiser, you might be able to answer this for me, since the docs aren't particularly clear
[2013-10-11 16:22:38 -0400] jkeiser: Even the ruby only web server failed in some places
[2013-10-11 16:22:40 -0400] fnichol: jkeiser: yes and i think it's been some of the native code in puma that's been causing the chef-zero gem to not always install for ppl on test-kitchen instances
[2013-10-11 16:22:51 -0400] c_t: the chef server api docs aren't real clear on GET /users
[2013-10-11 16:22:56 -0400] jkeiser: That happens sometimes?  That sucks
[2013-10-11 16:23:28 -0400] fnichol: jkeiser: i think it's because some distros need a compiler toolchain or dev libs before the gem install works
[2013-10-11 16:23:32 -0400] c_t: is it GET /users, and it returns a list of all users, or GET /users/name, returning just one name, both...
[2013-10-11 16:23:45 -0400] jkeiser: c_t: lol I think that's just because the docs there are wrong.  I'll ping the doc guy
[2013-10-11 16:23:52 -0400] fnichol: jkeiser: good news is that once there's omnibus pkgs for this release that won't be a problem anymore
[2013-10-11 16:24:19 -0400] jkeiser: fnichol: worth noting, all 11.x omnibus releases have chef-zero in them
[2013-10-11 16:24:27 -0400] jkeiser: Since we use them for the tests
[2013-10-11 16:24:58 -0400] jkeiser: c_t: GET /users should return a list of users, and almost certainly returns them as a hash with key = username and value = URL to /users/USERNAME
[2013-10-11 16:25:12 -0400] fnichol: jkeiser: well what the crap then. gonna keep this in mind, thank you for this :)
[2013-10-11 16:25:18 -0400] jkeiser: c_t: the example there looks completely wrong then
[2013-10-11 16:25:40 -0400] jkeiser: It doesn't even represent a GET /users/NAME response
[2013-10-11 16:25:52 -0400] c_t: jkeiser: that's what it seemed like it ought to be to me, so you can imagine my befuddlement
[2013-10-11 16:26:03 -0400] jkeiser: Hell, the json is even invalid
[2013-10-11 16:26:13 -0400] c_t: jkeiser: worse, it sort of says it does both
[2013-10-11 16:29:37 -0400] jkeiser: I'll ping James for a rework, thanks.  I just discovered the usefulness of knife -z when looking at this :)
[2013-10-11 16:29:51 -0400] jkeiser: c_t: GET /users:

[2013-10-11 16:31:12 -0400] jkeiser: c_t: the /clients endpoint is almost identical fyi
[2013-10-11 16:31:22 -0400] c_t: ja
[2013-10-11 16:31:32 -0400] jkeiser: There are some fun things with POST and PUT, special things you can put in that let you regenerate the private key for example

[2013-10-11 16:33:17 -0400] jchauncey: we are using chef-zero as the provisioner for all of our test-kitchen tests (for about 50 cookbooks so far) and have had no issues =)
[2013-10-11 16:34:12 -0400] jkeiser: fnichol: there is a bug filed against chef-zero to use a ruby web server.  I'll write the damn thing if I have to, it's not like it's that hard to do a basic web server
[2013-10-11 16:34:37 -0400] jkeiser: It can fall back onto puma if it's installed, making it an optional (invisible?) dependency
[2013-10-11 16:36:23 -0400] fnichol: jchauncey: well that is the best feedback to hear!
[2013-10-11 16:37:44 -0400] fnichol: jkeiser: did you need the web server to be evented to stream files back to the client? that was my guess for thin and puma in the mix (both great server btw)
[2013-10-11 16:38:05 -0400] jchauncey: im actually working on a chef-zero/vagrant/berkshelf tool that will allow our testers to create multi host vagrant files for bringing up whatever service they need to test in isolation without needing to know about chef
[2013-10-11 16:38:24 -0400] jchauncey: was hoping to have it done before the november community summit but that doesnt seem like its going to happen
