[2013-10-25 15:50:25 -0400] Guest19756: I am trying to install git using kitchen/chef, however it prompts the user when connecting to a host for the first time. I am trying to use opscode-cookbooks/ssh_known_hosts to get around this, but that cookbook requires Chef search, which is not available in Chef Solo, which kitchen is using.
[2013-10-25 15:52:02 -0400] Guest19756: Would anyone be able to offer a suggestion on how to solve this?
[2013-10-25 16:01:26 -0400] Cope: I'm trying to use the test-kitchen ec2 driver, in a VPC environment.  Machines launched have no externally available, public IPs.  Access is via a bastion host.
[2013-10-25 16:01:41 -0400] Cope: Within the VPC I have a machine from which I try to run kitchen create
[2013-10-25 16:01:55 -0400] Cope: this creates a machine, but then tries to connect to it on the public IP
[2013-10-25 16:02:11 -0400] Cope: I need it to use the private IP, much as can be done with knife-ec2
[2013-10-25 16:02:21 -0400] Cope: anyone done this? or worked around it?
[2013-10-25 16:04:39 -0400] Cope: Basically I think I need to implement: https://github.com/opscode/knife-ec2/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/ec2_server_create.rb#L200-L203
