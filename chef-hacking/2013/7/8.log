[2013-07-08 09:20:51 -0400] mind__: hi all, guys I have a question, is there any way to install chef-solo to system with-out root-privileges?
[2013-07-08 14:11:38 -0400] teukka: mind__: I think #chef is better channel, but yes, you can install the "chef" gem as a normal user.
[2013-07-08 14:16:16 -0400] mind__: teukka, but if I can't install ruby and rubygems? I have only "base" installation and customer don't want to install any of chef requirements due to their security policies... Can I make something looks like chef portable? I will setup it on my system with all permisiion, then ZIP it and unpack on target system.
[2013-07-08 14:19:51 -0400] teukka: mind__: yeah you could compile the ruby on a similar platform and then just copy it to the node
[2013-07-08 14:21:36 -0400] teukka: but I guess quite many chef resources expect root permissions, so you might have interesting time ahead still =)
[2013-07-08 14:46:09 -0400] patcon: Moving question for #chef: for anyone with more extensive test-kitchen roadmap knowledge: why are we not just primarily leveraging vagrant? like why doesn't kitchen-ec2 simply help test-kitchen know how to set up vagrant-aws?
[2013-07-08 14:46:27 -0400] patcon: the reason for hte provider/driver divide is unclear to me :)
[2013-07-08 14:46:55 -0400] patcon: I see lots of convos where folks are speaking about AVOIDING the assumption of kitchen-vagrant, and there never seems to be a mention of that being temporary: https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen/issues/138
[2013-07-08 14:47:02 -0400] patcon: jtimberman: ^^
[2013-07-08 15:08:32 -0400] erikh: I can't speak for the test-kitchen project, but my own experience is that vagrant is a horrible, horrible thing to work with as a library
[2013-07-08 15:08:42 -0400] erikh: really horrible
[2013-07-08 15:08:45 -0400] erikh: horribad.
[2013-07-08 15:13:07 -0400] miketheman: boom.
[2013-07-08 15:20:03 -0400] wannatest: hello.  anyone familiar with test kitchen + lxc?  On an arm chip with ubuntu 12.04, I get as far as "Starting up the container..." and it hangs
[2013-07-08 15:21:06 -0400] wannatest: on ubuntu 12.04 on an esx guest, i could get as far as launching LXCs without networking...in retrospect, maybe that was closer to viable
[2013-07-08 16:18:41 -0400] wannatest: ok one step closer maybe... but kitchen action failed... >>>>>> Message: Failed to complete #converge action: [Could not parse PKey: no start line]
[2013-07-08 16:19:03 -0400] wannatest: which PKey is it talking about?  anyone know?  do i need to generate ssh keys on my default container that I clone?
[2013-07-08 16:22:56 -0400] wannatest: oh weird...i have to have a corresponding id_rsa.pub on my workstation VM; i only had the private key previously
