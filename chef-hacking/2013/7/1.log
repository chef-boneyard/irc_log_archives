[2013-07-01 13:48:13 -0400] pwelch: morning all. could anyone tell me who I could ping about adding knife-linode to the code reviews? It has several pull requests out and needs some love

[2013-07-01 16:16:16 -0400] btm: pwelch_: there's a knife plugin code review that's going to be on Thursdays. Unfortunately this Thursday is a US Holiday. We may have something in the interim this week, otherwise it'll start next thursday.

[2013-07-01 16:18:46 -0400] pwelch_: is it mainly a time thing? looks like knife-linode has fallen behind
[2013-07-01 16:20:45 -0400] pwelch_: Mainly just wanted to get it on someone's radar if knife-linode was not on their list
[2013-07-01 16:25:25 -0400] btm: pwelch_: it's been an logistics work in progress mostly, gettin processes built around the many open source projects, and then people to implement those. We've been working on the knife plugin stuff a lot the last few months, getting developers assigned to plugins, making someone specifically responsible for the knife plugins, adding a specific code review.
[2013-07-01 16:27:40 -0400] pwelch_: btm: makes sense. Opscode has a lot of projects to manage. Did not want to come off as pushy. Just wanted to remind someone if it was an issue. Are developers internal to Opscode or is there some where someone could volunteer for this?
[2013-07-01 16:29:28 -0400] btm: pwelch_: we've handed knife plugin management over to other folks in the past where they're better suited to test it than us. Opscode developers is just a matter of priorities.

[2013-07-01 19:50:01 -0400] maxmanders: I've been using Fletcher's awesome busser-minitest with test-kitchen and it's working brilliantly!  One thing I'm not clear on is how to access/reference attributes overridden in .kitchen.yml in the test?

[2013-07-01 20:40:07 -0400] cwj: maxmanders: its my understanding that the pure minitest tests run under busser-minitest do not have access to node attributes (they run outside of the chef run)
[2013-07-01 20:42:13 -0400] cwj: but minitest tests running under minitest-chef-handler do

[2013-07-01 21:05:24 -0400] maxmanders: cwj: that's what I understood too trying to write implementation agnostic tests, over thinking things and missing the point.  They're my tests, I'm allowed to make certain assumptions :-)

[2013-07-01 21:21:44 -0400] jtimberman: maxmanders: cwj is correct. those are more "outside in" type tests, so they're not going to be aware of the context of the chef node.
[2013-07-01 21:22:31 -0400] maxmanders: jtimberman: indeed! Need more or less coffee, not sure which yet ;-)
