[2013-07-09 14:16:43 -0400] nico: hey hackers
[2013-07-09 14:17:35 -0400] nico: I'm in the process of migrating to chef 11, but the fqdn part (for the certificate) bugs me out, as I don't want to install a machine with that hostname
[2013-07-09 14:18:09 -0400] nico: does anyone has a trick to circumvent this problem ? (regenerating certificate for example)
[2013-07-09 14:33:00 -0400] erikh: remove your domain from your fqdn with this one weird trick!
[2013-07-09 14:36:05 -0400] nico: found out a blog post : http://bealetech.com/blog/2013/06/14/custom-ssl-certificates-with-chef-11-server/
[2013-07-09 14:36:29 -0400] nico: but still no debian (not ubuntu) packages :/
[2013-07-09 14:45:58 -0400] laurent\: i'm planning on migration to chef 11. but i don't like this huge big package with everything in it
[2013-07-09 14:52:11 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] sean-horn force-pushed sh/CHEF-3609 from a989880 to 09fed83: http://git.io/-POayA
[2013-07-09 14:52:11 -0400] github-bawt: chef/sh/CHEF-3609 5f4d620 Sean Horn: [CHEF-3609] Support no_proxy for first chef-client run

[2013-07-09 15:04:28 -0400] nico: laurent\: tested stuff, without checking how it was done
[2013-07-09 15:04:34 -0400] nico: but doing it now
[2013-07-09 15:04:43 -0400] nico: and there are some things I don't like
[2013-07-09 15:04:47 -0400] nico: inittab:SV:123456:respawn:/opt/chef-server/embedded/bin/runsvdir-start
[2013-07-09 15:47:29 -0400] jtimberman: nico: the chef 11 omnibus *is* a deb package. (or rpm) :)
[2013-07-09 16:39:47 -0400] c_t: so getting Chef Server on OS X did not get off to an auspicious start so far
[2013-07-09 16:40:28 -0400] erikh: it'd be interesting it you could get it wired up to launchd's port listening magic
[2013-07-09 16:40:36 -0400] erikh: s/it/if
[2013-07-09 16:40:50 -0400] c_t: indeed
[2013-07-09 16:41:11 -0400] c_t: fortunately the immediate emergency has passed, but I'd still like to get it working
[2013-07-09 16:41:31 -0400] c_t: and as it happens the easily available machine for it is running OS X
[2013-07-09 16:41:59 -0400] erikh: well, modern minis run ubuntu fine
[2013-07-09 16:42:03 -0400] erikh: if that helps any :)
[2013-07-09 16:43:26 -0400] c_t: heh
[2013-07-09 16:43:32 -0400] c_t: that would be a battle in and of itself
[2013-07-09 16:43:45 -0400] c_t: also, I'm a little unhappy with Ubuntu at the moment
[2013-07-09 16:43:54 -0400] erikh: ah
[2013-07-09 16:44:27 -0400] c_t: we had a new person come on who uses Ubuntu
[2013-07-09 16:44:46 -0400] c_t: since everyone else uses a Mac, I've been having to craft up new chef stuff for her workstation
[2013-07-09 16:45:27 -0400] c_t: been hitting the "debian and ubuntu are not, in fact, quite the same" issues (we're a debian shop with various custom packages that may or may not work)
[2013-07-09 16:45:36 -0400] c_t: along with some crap tossed along by Upstart
[2013-07-09 16:45:36 -0400] erikh: ah
[2013-07-09 16:45:45 -0400] erikh: ah, upstart. you so cray
[2013-07-09 16:45:51 -0400] erikh: yeah, sounds like a "blast"
[2013-07-09 16:45:56 -0400] c_t: I used Ubuntu for many years, mind you
[2013-07-09 16:46:10 -0400] c_t: it was great when it was a less actively hostile version of debian
[2013-07-09 16:46:33 -0400] c_t: but as time went by they got more and more hand-holdy, but weren't actually that good at it
[2013-07-09 16:46:42 -0400] c_t: so I finally said "fuck it" and got a Mac desktop
[2013-07-09 16:46:47 -0400] c_t: (I'd had a Mac laptop for a while)
[2013-07-09 16:47:25 -0400] erikh: ah
[2013-07-09 16:47:34 -0400] c_t: also I was getting annoyed at how Ubuntu has a thing where they'll take something that everyone's perfectly happy with, toss it out, and replace it with something that sucks
[2013-07-09 16:47:43 -0400] erikh: yeah, not too dogmatic about this stuff myself.
[2013-07-09 16:47:51 -0400] erikh: I just start with ubuntu and replace what I don't like.
[2013-07-09 16:48:07 -0400] erikh: tends to be a good base at least. but then again, I'm typing this on a mac.
[2013-07-09 16:48:21 -0400] c_t: if I went back to Linux-on-the-desktop I'd probably go back to debian
[2013-07-09 16:48:34 -0400] c_t: although that would inevitably lead to running experimental again
[2013-07-09 16:48:44 -0400] c_t: which would likely lead to kablooie
[2013-07-09 16:49:10 -0400] c_t: I ran debian experimental as my desktop for a while a long time ago
[2013-07-09 16:49:15 -0400] c_t: went fine until it didn't
[2013-07-09 16:49:34 -0400] c_t: I think I ran "apt-get update" while they were updating all the X packages or something
[2013-07-09 16:49:37 -0400] c_t: *BOOM*
[2013-07-09 16:49:45 -0400] erikh: yeah, I went through that before ubuntu existed, heh
[2013-07-09 16:49:51 -0400] erikh: whatever sid was back then
[2013-07-09 16:50:01 -0400] erikh: not testing, the next one up
[2013-07-09 16:50:10 -0400] c_t: experimental I think?
[2013-07-09 16:50:12 -0400] erikh: lost its lunch installing qt
[2013-07-09 16:50:25 -0400] jtimberman: moar illumos :)
[2013-07-09 16:50:44 -0400] erikh: switched to gentoo for a while, then table flipped after it took a day and a half building gnome and x11 so I could get some app I needed
[2013-07-09 16:50:49 -0400] jtimberman: sid is always unstable
[2013-07-09 16:50:53 -0400] erikh: ah
[2013-07-09 16:51:00 -0400] jtimberman: experimental is unnamed
[2013-07-09 16:51:15 -0400] c_t: jtimberman: you know, some hardy soul out there is still maintaining 4.3-BSD "Quasijarus"
[2013-07-09 16:51:18 -0400] c_t: you could install that
[2013-07-09 16:51:31 -0400] c_t: (you'd need a VAX though)
[2013-07-09 16:51:31 -0400] erikh: nowadays I'm doing the whole linux laptop thing + work mac
[2013-07-09 16:51:38 -0400] erikh: and smartos for all the vms
[2013-07-09 16:51:51 -0400] erikh: oh. and a windows box. for gaming.
[2013-07-09 16:51:58 -0400] erikh: did I mention this office gets pretty hot in the summer?
[2013-07-09 16:52:05 -0400] c_t: I took Debian/kFreeBSD for a spin in a VM the other week
[2013-07-09 16:52:11 -0400] c_t: ... it's pretty much what you'd expect
[2013-07-09 16:52:18 -0400] erikh: HURD lite?
[2013-07-09 16:52:35 -0400] c_t: jtimberman: remind me, is Illumos just the rebranded Solaris, or is it the Solaris kernel + GNU userland one?
[2013-07-09 16:52:46 -0400] c_t: erikh: haven't braved the HURD yet
[2013-07-09 16:53:00 -0400] c_t: although I've also fired up the version 7 for x86 port
[2013-07-09 16:53:08 -0400] c_t: ... it's also pretty much what you'd expect
[2013-07-09 16:53:09 -0400] erikh: illumos is forked opensolaris
[2013-07-09 16:53:17 -0400] c_t: mkay
[2013-07-09 16:53:20 -0400] erikh: smartos and omnios are effectively maintained forks of that
[2013-07-09 16:53:35 -0400] erikh: think free/open/netbsd in relation to 386BSD
[2013-07-09 16:53:38 -0400] c_t: there was also a solaris kernel + GNU userland out there at one point, but I think it faded away
[2013-07-09 16:53:44 -0400] c_t: Nexenta maybe?
[2013-07-09 16:53:50 -0400] erikh: yeah, that's nexenta
[2013-07-09 16:54:00 -0400] erikh: that's different, but I don't know how much.
[2013-07-09 16:56:57 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] sean-horn force-pushed sh/CHEF-3609 from 09fed83 to 66492aa: http://git.io/-POayA
[2013-07-09 16:56:57 -0400] github-bawt: chef/sh/CHEF-3609 66492aa Sean Horn: [CHEF-3609] Test no_proxy entries during bootstrap
[2013-07-09 17:03:00 -0400] c_t: anyway, for some reason the os x chef server is terribly unhappy about not being able to "find any shared zlib"
[2013-07-09 17:03:08 -0400] c_t: so I have to figure that out at some point
[2013-07-09 17:09:40 -0400] jtimberman: c_t: why arey ou making a chef server run on osx? the chef-server cookbook has a vagrantfile...
[2013-07-09 17:13:39 -0400] c_t: I thought running chef server in a VM was discouraged
[2013-07-09 17:13:48 -0400] jtimberman: for real, yes.
[2013-07-09 17:13:53 -0400] jtimberman: for testing, not at all
[2013-07-09 17:14:02 -0400] c_t: ah, this wasn't for testing
[2013-07-09 17:14:38 -0400] c_t: this was investigating running our own chef server because we were stuck between a bit of a rock and a hard place
[2013-07-09 17:21:21 -0400] c_t: I guess it's good to have something to remind us that the various Unixes are not in fact exactly the same

[2013-07-09 18:44:41 -0400] nico: jtimberman: sure, juste a matter of label here, meaning  "which ubuntu version should I download for squeeze ? or wheezy ?"
[2013-07-09 19:16:47 -0400] jtimberman: nico: heh, well, we don't currently build debian-specific packages.
[2013-07-09 19:16:54 -0400] jtimberman: it probably "just works" on Debian
[2013-07-09 19:17:27 -0400] jtimberman: but it's not listed as a supported platform: http://docs.opscode.com/chef_system_requirements.html#open-source-chef-server
