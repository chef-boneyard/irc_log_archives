[2013-07-11 02:31:49 -0400] cwj: is there a reasonable way to override the automatically generated name for an LWRP?

[2013-07-11 09:30:35 -0400] laurent\_: nico: I'm trying chef11, for a start it seems RHEL and debian don't set the hostname the same way
[2013-07-11 09:31:59 -0400] laurent\_: none of my debian/ubuntu system has its hostname set to fqdn
[2013-07-11 10:02:24 -0400] nico: laurent\_: making my way through this, using /etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb and its knobs to get it running
[2013-07-11 10:08:06 -0400] laurent\_: is /etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb supposed to be created after "chef-server-ctl reconfigure" ?
[2013-07-11 10:16:59 -0400] laurent\_: nico: have you tried to move postgresql/rabbitmq/solr/nginx elsewhere ? (on another hosts i mean)
[2013-07-11 10:18:22 -0400] nico: laurent\_: nope, changed some ports not to conflict with my existing stuff
[2013-07-11 10:20:46 -0400] laurent\_: i'm also wondering how relevant http://docs.opscode.com/server/private_chef_1x_install_ha.html is for the opensource chef
[2013-07-11 11:31:55 -0400] nico: laurent\_: DRBD is really not a choice I like, personnal experience and portability speaking here
[2013-07-11 11:46:32 -0400] laurent\_: nico: i already have shared storage here
[2013-07-11 11:46:56 -0400] nico: using ? DRBD ?
[2013-07-11 11:47:08 -0400] laurent\_: oh no, it's a netapp cluster :)
[2013-07-11 11:50:39 -0400] laurent\_: i also already have 2 rabbitmq nodes running, i don't wont to use the one provided by chef-server
[2013-07-11 11:54:57 -0400] nico: changing ports is already giving me trouble; splitting across machines is not for today :)
[2013-07-11 11:57:52 -0400] nico: great, random failure

[2013-07-11 12:18:45 -0400] nico: ok, figured out
[2013-07-11 12:19:06 -0400] nico: there are some hardcoded values
[2013-07-11 12:19:27 -0400] nico: moving from 443 to 8443 breaks stuff
[2013-07-11 12:31:07 -0400] laurent\_: nico: you've changed the port before or after the first "reconfigure"
[2013-07-11 12:31:08 -0400] laurent\_: ?
[2013-07-11 12:32:01 -0400] nico: before, reconfigured, broke stuff
[2013-07-11 12:32:41 -0400] laurent\_: here it doesn't like when i try to use another rabbitmq server :)
[2013-07-11 12:32:49 -0400] nico: changed back to 443, reconfigured, worked
[2013-07-11 12:32:51 -0400] fooJBar: It's always been like that since chef-server 11. Hardocoded deps on 443 for SSL
[2013-07-11 12:33:04 -0400] nico: fooJBar: sucks
[2013-07-11 12:33:08 -0400] nico: hard
[2013-07-11 12:33:21 -0400] fooJBar: nico: shouldn't be too hard to fix, I bet there's a JIRA ticket open for this
[2013-07-11 12:34:59 -0400] nico: hmm, is CHEF-4029 the issue you have in mind ?
[2013-07-11 12:35:05 -0400] nico: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4029
[2013-07-11 12:35:10 -0400] fooJBar: Yes!
[2013-07-11 12:36:15 -0400] fooJBar: Ah not exactly, but related, let me dig it out
[2013-07-11 12:37:12 -0400] fooJBar: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3849
[2013-07-11 12:37:51 -0400] fooJBar: nico: allegedly fixed in 11.0.8
[2013-07-11 12:38:09 -0400] nico: running 11.0.8 here
[2013-07-11 12:38:16 -0400] fooJBar: hehe ops
[2013-07-11 12:39:27 -0400] nico: before whining I work out some research & make sure I run the latest :)
[2013-07-11 12:39:45 -0400] fooJBar: This is annoying actually, because I was running a secure ttomcat on 443 on my chef server and had to change the port of that instead.
[2013-07-11 12:40:52 -0400] nico: I keep this somewhere in my mind, to create a PR when I'll have time
[2013-07-11 12:41:11 -0400] fooJBar: ta
[2013-07-11 12:41:54 -0400] nico: that should be easy to fix, just missing URL construction
[2013-07-11 13:13:56 -0400] nico: so, all data imported & reindexed to the new chef server
[2013-07-11 13:14:58 -0400] nico: I feel like http://secretsof7scribes.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hannibal_a-team-jpeg.jpg
[2013-07-11 13:44:00 -0400] laurent\_: nico: have you seen bigbang blog post, he post  something on #chef 40min ago
[2013-07-11 13:44:07 -0400] laurent\_: wrong chan
[2013-07-11 13:44:16 -0400] laurent\_: grrr
[2013-07-11 13:45:22 -0400] nico: nice
[2013-07-11 13:45:50 -0400] laurent\_: it seems easy to split components out
[2013-07-11 13:46:08 -0400] laurent\_: just done it with amqp
[2013-07-11 13:46:29 -0400] laurent\_: i don't like what he does tho :)
[2013-07-11 14:03:13 -0400] nico: laurent\_: I managed to graph time of search queries in chef (to statsd/graphite)
[2013-07-11 14:03:51 -0400] nico: https://gist.github.com/rottenbytes/f631080cc7ca06898c03
[2013-07-11 14:04:05 -0400] nico: it needs some refinements but it's pretty cool
[2013-07-11 14:05:34 -0400] laurent\_: oh yes it's a pretty cool idea
[2013-07-11 14:06:29 -0400] laurent\_: i'm a latecomer, haven't started to play with statsd yet
[2013-07-11 14:07:09 -0400] nico: first experiment for me :)
[2013-07-11 14:07:21 -0400] nico: that's the ugly version
[2013-07-11 14:07:37 -0400] nico: nice version will come with variables & such
[2013-07-11 14:07:48 -0400] laurent\_: :) that's to be expected from a proof of concept :)
[2013-07-11 14:18:21 -0400] miketheman: nico: that looks really cool
[2013-07-11 14:18:55 -0400] miketheman: does the sort you apply change the behavior of the default search?
[2013-07-11 14:19:35 -0400] nico: nope
[2013-07-11 14:19:56 -0400] nico: the block is still passed, so there is no breaking here
[2013-07-11 14:20:02 -0400] nico: as long as I know :)
[2013-07-11 14:20:19 -0400] miketheman: you alos limit to 1000 rows - is that the same as the original invocation?
[2013-07-11 14:20:25 -0400] nico: yup
[2013-07-11 14:20:42 -0400] miketheman: that's pretty cool
[2013-07-11 14:21:04 -0400] nico: thanks
[2013-07-11 14:21:08 -0400] miketheman: can you possible add a bit to the gist with a sample output?
[2013-07-11 14:21:19 -0400] miketheman: so I'd know what to expect when it works?
[2013-07-11 14:21:43 -0400] miketheman: (I'm diving deeper into Chef execution time profiling)
[2013-07-11 14:24:03 -0400] nico: ho, you have to use chef in fork mode to use this
[2013-07-11 14:24:26 -0400] nico: or you will mess up with the file limit, did not manage to fix it
[2013-07-11 14:24:49 -0400] nico: (as we had planned that moves a while ago to reduce memory usage)
[2013-07-11 14:25:59 -0400] nico: miketheman: gist updated
[2013-07-11 14:26:01 -0400] miketheman: nico: some changes I'd add - make sending to statsd configurable (wishlist)
[2013-07-11 14:26:19 -0400] nico: 16:07 < nico> that's the ugly version
[2013-07-11 14:26:20 -0400] nico: 16:07 < nico> nice version will come with variables & such
[2013-07-11 14:26:22 -0400] miketheman: also, Chef::Log.debug instead of info - you're already sending the data elsewhere, let the log file be
[2013-07-11 14:26:30 -0400] nico: just a PoC here :)
[2013-07-11 14:26:53 -0400] miketheman: I know - I'm spitballing ideas
[2013-07-11 14:27:15 -0400] miketheman: (disclaimer, I work for Datadog, and we do a lot with statsd, this might be a cool add-on)
[2013-07-11 14:29:10 -0400] nico: miketheman: the hierarchy is statsd is probably to refine, as I'm *really* a beginner on this topic
[2013-07-11 14:29:12 -0400] laurent\_: ok time to install a statsd daemon ! :)
[2013-07-11 14:29:36 -0400] miketheman: laurent\_: check out our product.  - free for 5 servers
[2013-07-11 14:29:44 -0400] laurent\_: last time i checked i couldn't choose which one to install
[2013-07-11 14:29:57 -0400] nico: maybe add the hostname too, I'm not sure about this
[2013-07-11 14:30:13 -0400] nico: laurent\_: I used the original nodejs one
[2013-07-11 14:30:31 -0400] miketheman: nico: we've extended statsd to allow for tags, and hostname is one that we consume by default
[2013-07-11 14:30:37 -0400] laurent\_: miketheman: i've got something like ~320 nodes :)
[2013-07-11 14:30:48 -0400] miketheman: laurent\_: I'll get you the volume discount
[2013-07-11 14:30:53 -0400] nico: :)
[2013-07-11 14:31:08 -0400] nico: miketheman: neat
[2013-07-11 14:31:49 -0400] miketheman: I wrote and maintain the chef-datadog cookbook, so as to make deployment easy and fun, as well as integrate Chef metrcis into our system
[2013-07-11 14:32:09 -0400] laurent\_: nico: i'm not too keen in running yet another language written daemon :)
[2013-07-11 14:32:28 -0400] nico: laurent\_: a coworker wrote a ruby version
[2013-07-11 14:32:40 -0400] nico: but its only output is stdout atm
[2013-07-11 14:32:44 -0400] miketheman: and ours is python
[2013-07-11 14:32:54 -0400] nico: https://github.com/josqu4red/yastatsd/
[2013-07-11 14:33:03 -0400] miketheman: with clients in multiple lanuagges
[2013-07-11 14:33:17 -0400] miketheman: http://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/dogstatsd/
[2013-07-11 14:33:24 -0400] nico: miketheman: is your custom version backward compatible ?
[2013-07-11 14:33:38 -0400] miketheman: nico: yup
[2013-07-11 14:36:33 -0400] miketheman: anyways, enough of my product pitching. :) Check out #datadog or PM me for that kind of stuff.
[2013-07-11 14:36:41 -0400] miketheman: let's chat about nico's cool search timer
[2013-07-11 14:38:25 -0400] miketheman: nico: you mentioned it must run in forked mode (or cron, I guess) - due to file handle exhaustion?
[2013-07-11 14:38:30 -0400] miketheman: can you explain?
[2013-07-11 14:43:53 -0400] laurent\_: i guess it's for the same reason --fork mode was created, to prevent memory leaks
[2013-07-11 14:44:17 -0400] KarlHungus: speaking of statsd, collectd now has a statsd read plugin =)
[2013-07-11 14:44:26 -0400] laurent\_: You might as well find a way to re-use that UDPSocket
[2013-07-11 14:44:33 -0400] KarlHungus: so you can just fire events at collectd since its already running everywhere =)
[2013-07-11 14:44:44 -0400] laurent\_: KarlHungus: so i read, have you tried it ?
[2013-07-11 14:45:11 -0400] KarlHungus: laurent\_: have not, its in the queue. should get to that this weekend with luck!
[2013-07-11 14:45:12 -0400] laurent\_: i wouldn't mind using it, i'm already packaging it from head
[2013-07-11 14:57:57 -0400] nico: miketheman: "Too many open files - socket(2) - udp"
[2013-07-11 14:58:27 -0400] nico: using s.close does not seem to destroy the socket, so you run out of sockets
[2013-07-11 14:59:22 -0400] nico: I think of using a persistant instance of the socket should fix this, needs more metaprog / black magic / patching to do so
[2013-07-11 14:59:44 -0400] laurent\_: using an class/instance var with ||= UDPthingy.new ?
[2013-07-11 15:00:00 -0400] nico: something like that yes
[2013-07-11 15:00:18 -0400] nico: but the class instance would require more code for instanciation
[2013-07-11 15:00:35 -0400] nico: I'm just a sysadmin, not a code exprty
[2013-07-11 15:00:39 -0400] nico: expert*
[2013-07-11 15:02:10 -0400] laurent\_: i'm still using a ugly hack in one of my cookbook, i use node.run_state[:my_key] to store data that could be passed from one cookbook to another. i'm not sure it will still work with chef11 tho
[2013-07-11 15:02:37 -0400] nico: we make an extensive use of run_state here
[2013-07-11 15:03:15 -0400] nico: laurent\_: https://speakerdeck.com/renchap/sysadmin-4-chef-at-fotolia
[2013-07-11 15:03:23 -0400] nico: (to slide 40)
[2013-07-11 15:03:50 -0400] laurent\_: nico: :)
[2013-07-11 15:06:57 -0400] nico: It's an nice way to pass stuff all around, making things non resilient
[2013-07-11 15:07:22 -0400] nico: by moving from attributes to run_state stuff we have cleaned our nodes a lot

[2013-07-11 15:48:33 -0400] mparadise: if anyone is interesting in hammering on it, I've forked vagrant (and opened a PR) to add support for chef-solo environments out of 11.6, allowing you to specifiy 'environment' and 'environment_path' config options for the chef-solo provisioner.
[2013-07-11 15:48:54 -0400] mparadise: https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/pull/1915
[2013-07-11 16:00:52 -0400] miketheman: mparadise: higher acceptance rate if it incldues tests
[2013-07-11 16:05:17 -0400] mparadise: good point miketheman , I've got some acceptance tests but it's a bit tough 'til after 11.6 is released, because of the chef version dependency

[2013-07-11 16:15:48 -0400] jtimberman: mparadise: i believe the vagrant-omnibus plugin can install a prerelease version of the chef omnibus package. might follow-up with schisamo about that though.
[2013-07-11 16:15:56 -0400] jtimberman: (or ... read the vagrant-omnibus plugin code :))
[2013-07-11 16:17:52 -0400] mparadise: cool, thanks jtimberman
[2013-07-11 16:26:11 -0400] donaldguy: Hello. I have a silly problem. I have root on the chef server (private chef), but I don't have a user account in the org. Or rather I didn't. Using orgmapper I successfully associated user with the org to some degree, but I can't seem to get it to be part of the admins group. Mixlib::Authorization::Models::Organization#add_user_to_group seems to have no effect :-(
[2013-07-11 16:32:50 -0400] jtimberman: donaldguy: best bet is to contact support@opscode.com about private chef issues.
[2013-07-11 16:33:13 -0400] donaldguy: okay :-/
[2013-07-11 16:34:03 -0400] jtimberman: orgmapper is definitely a poweruser tool, and it's only in private chef so it's unlikely anyone in here (other than opscode employees) will know anything about it :)
[2013-07-11 16:39:39 -0400] donaldguy: alright. thanks anyway
[2013-07-11 16:39:51 -0400] ssd7: donaldguy: Definitely open a support ticket but the following might work: g = ORGS['ORGNAME'].groups['admins']; g.add_actor(USERS["USERNAME"]); g.save
[2013-07-11 16:41:00 -0400] donaldguy: oh man that totally worked
[2013-07-11 16:41:05 -0400] donaldguy: or seemed to have :-)
