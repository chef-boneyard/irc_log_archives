[2013-11-18 14:57:25 -0500] bur: after knife upload in all cookbooks in each file adds some symbols in bedin and zero in end
[2013-11-18 14:57:40 -0500] bur: only on server
[2013-11-18 15:02:57 -0500] bur: before upload cookbook looks like pakage "mc"

[2013-11-18 18:21:30 -0500] github-bawt: [chef] sersut pushed 1 new commit to CHEF-3297-part-2: http://git.io/HnoNPw
[2013-11-18 18:21:31 -0500] github-bawt: chef/CHEF-3297-part-2 0c1501e sersut: Group spec fixed for CI.
[2013-11-18 18:43:44 -0500] programmerq: so, I find myself writing a few fairly generic "templates" over and over. For example, I might have a yaml file that I generate inside a recipe somehow, and my erb ends up being a single line that passes through a single value, which is the final rendered yaml.
[2013-11-18 18:44:05 -0500] programmerq: I might have another recipe that pulls a certificate out of a data bag, and renders it using a similar "passthrough" erb file.
[2013-11-18 18:44:31 -0500] programmerq: would it make sense for some kind of meta generic template that does stuff like that to be bundled with chef?
[2013-11-18 18:44:55 -0500] programmerq: maybe for the yaml case (or json, or xml) there could be an additional layer that validates the file as valid yaml (or json or xml or whatever)

[2013-11-18 18:49:15 -0500] github-bawt: chef/CHEF-4639 a03cc74 Allen Goodman: Refactor
[2013-11-18 19:27:02 -0500] zts: programmerq: I'm probably misunderstanding, but why use the template resource at all in that case, vs the "content" parameter for the file resource?
[2013-11-18 19:39:01 -0500] programmerq: zts: the file resource does nothing if the content changes, where template will overwrite when it is rendered.
[2013-11-18 19:39:21 -0500] programmerq: unless I'm misusing the file resource somehow.
[2013-11-18 19:43:46 -0500] zts: programmerq: if the value of content changes from one run to the next, and assuming action is :create, the file should be updated and notifications fired (just like template) - it certainly works for me
[2013-11-18 19:43:58 -0500] programmerq: zts: yeah, I re-read the docs
[2013-11-18 19:44:29 -0500] programmerq: my only question is whether file will fire off notifies on every chef run, even if the content doesn't change-- I'll do a test in a vagrant box to see what it does.
[2013-11-18 19:45:07 -0500] programmerq: well, I'll do it later, not right now. :)

[2013-11-18 21:22:34 -0500] antonio_: hi, I am using test-kitchen with minitest-chef-handler. Is there a way to access test kitchen configuration (spefically the platform name) from the minitest tests?
