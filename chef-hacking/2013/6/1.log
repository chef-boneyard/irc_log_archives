[2013-06-01 16:50:05 -0400] Cope: Trying to work out the best way to have chruby support installing Gems
[2013-06-01 16:50:25 -0400] Cope: basically all that's needed is to run chruby myversion
[2013-06-01 16:50:29 -0400] Cope: and then run gem install
[2013-06-01 16:51:48 -0400] Cope: it's way simpler than the rbenv provider; but it's not behaving as expected either with a bash resource or with shellout in a library
