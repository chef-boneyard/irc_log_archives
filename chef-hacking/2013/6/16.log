[2013-06-16 16:29:46 -0400] gchristensen: jtimberman: do you know if Opscode destroys the VMs from building omnibus-chef after a build? or does it run the VMs continuously to allow for faster builds?
[2013-06-16 16:59:17 -0400] coderanger: gchristensen: Our build lab is continuous, jenkins slaves running on openstack instances
[2013-06-16 16:59:18 -0400] coderanger: (mostly)
[2013-06-16 16:59:40 -0400] coderanger: Some of the weirder systems are just physical installs I think, like older solaris and whatnot
[2013-06-16 17:02:18 -0400] gchristensen: coderanger: and do you use vagrant for the build machines? or are they straight-up openstack machines of those OSes?
[2013-06-16 17:02:32 -0400] coderanger: AFAIK its just OpenStack
[2013-06-16 17:03:03 -0400] gchristensen: got it. so once ruby 1.9.3 is compiled, it won't compile it again for the next build
[2013-06-16 17:03:08 -0400] coderanger: But I will also note my knowledge of our build lab is probably way out of date
[2013-06-16 17:03:32 -0400] gchristensen: that's fine :) I'm getting started with the first here, so even outdated knowledge is a start.
[2013-06-16 17:03:46 -0400] coderanger: Ahh, the build itself is somewhat separate, we do clean builds once a day I want to say, or at least we used to, might be less frequent now that the builds take longer (for servers)
[2013-06-16 17:04:21 -0400] gchristensen: I got tired of trying to deploy Ruby to all our servers for simple CLI tools :)
[2013-06-16 17:04:25 -0400] gchristensen: ah, cool. got it. thank you
[2013-06-16 20:50:44 -0400] zackf: How do I make an ominbus package for a custom build of erchef?
[2013-06-16 21:02:10 -0400] petecheslock: btm - i was able to get chef spec tests to pass on freebsd 9.1 - https://gist.github.com/petecheslock/4a2240ff719e4340bdad
[2013-06-16 21:03:10 -0400] petecheslock: something about the '=~' it seems - setting "export LC_CTYPE=UTF-8" prior to the run gets it to pass at least
[2013-06-16 21:03:15 -0400] petecheslock: trying it one more time to confirm
[2013-06-16 21:17:56 -0400] petecheslock: btm - good to go from what I can see.  Finished in 10 minutes 58.19 seconds
[2013-06-16 21:17:56 -0400] petecheslock: 7995 examples, 0 failures, 255 pending
