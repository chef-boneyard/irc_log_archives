[2013-06-30 19:47:58 -0400] wannatest: are people still here?  anyone familiar with "/opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/1.9.1/date.rb:3:in `require': superclass mismatch for class DateTime (TypeError)
[2013-06-30 19:48:24 -0400] coderanger: wannatest: Whats the full traceback?
[2013-06-30 19:48:30 -0400] wannatest: for any berks command?  like the gem didn't install correctly (ubuntu 12, ruby 1.9.3 from chef install)

[2013-06-30 19:50:59 -0400] coderanger: I got nothin'
[2013-06-30 19:51:34 -0400] wannatest: it's cool; this is the error i get with irb when i do require 'berkshelf' so it must be a path thing
[2013-06-30 19:52:20 -0400] coderanger: The fact that activesupport is in there is definitely very suggestive
[2013-06-30 19:52:30 -0400] wannatest: ?
[2013-06-30 19:52:33 -0400] coderanger: It does like to monkeypatch the everloving hell out of Ruby
[2013-06-30 19:53:32 -0400] coderanger: and give that 4.0 was released last week, it is quite possible it isn't compatible with something
[2013-06-30 19:56:28 -0400] wannatest: coderanger: thanks, downgraded to 3.2.13 and all is well
[2013-06-30 19:56:31 -0400] coderanger: Might want to try it with activesupport 3.2 and see if that fixes
[2013-06-30 19:56:32 -0400] coderanger: heh
[2013-06-30 19:56:36 -0400] coderanger: yeah, that :)
[2013-06-30 19:57:30 -0400] coderanger: Looks like the next release just won't use activesupport https://github.com/RiotGames/berkshelf/pull/678
[2013-06-30 19:57:58 -0400] wannatest: ah nice
[2013-06-30 19:58:18 -0400] wannatest: it's good to get past some of these errors - some of them get so random that I forget what I set out to do
[2013-06-30 20:06:28 -0400] wannatest: coderanger: got any idea why my lxc containers come up without ipv4 addresses?  they get the right resolv.conf but no eth0 and therefore 'fail' to come up, despite being reachable by lxc-console
[2013-06-30 20:07:17 -0400] coderanger: No clue
[2013-06-30 20:08:16 -0400] wannatest: ok - i'll figure it out sooner or later
