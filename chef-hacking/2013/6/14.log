[2013-06-14 02:33:17 -0400] spheromak: I have one but its not using octokit
[2013-06-14 02:33:30 -0400] spheromak: was gonna convert, but If you had work on this I could just work with it
[2013-06-14 03:39:05 -0400] jtimberman: sn0wb1rdz: chef_environment is a property of the node, but it is not an attribute.
[2013-06-14 03:40:51 -0400] sn0wb1rdz: jtimberman: It was brought to my attention that the chef environment is not set properly even though it is specified in the runlist.json file parameter passed to the `chef-client` call only on the first run and had to specify it with the -E flag
[2013-06-14 03:41:16 -0400] sn0wb1rdz: jtimberman: I just wanted to verify and reproduce the problem.

[2013-06-14 13:12:34 -0400] zackf: hello
[2013-06-14 13:17:27 -0400] roidrage: this made my day: https://travis-ci.org/opscode/chef :)
[2013-06-14 13:27:19 -0400] zackf: :)
[2013-06-14 13:32:50 -0400] zackf: anyone have experience using omnibus-chef-server repo to build a package of erchef?
[2013-06-14 13:43:53 -0400] miketheman: roidrage: any reason in particular?
[2013-06-14 13:44:20 -0400] miketheman: OIC.
[2013-06-14 13:44:24 -0400] roidrage: miketheman: i've been a big chef user for four years, and i run travis ci :)
[2013-06-14 13:44:45 -0400] miketheman: oh, I know who you are. :) We met at DevOpsDays NYC.
[2013-06-14 13:46:28 -0400] roidrage: just nice to see chef on there :)
[2013-06-14 13:52:20 -0400] miketheman: indeed. didn't realize it was only build #5 - I ask myself "what took so long?!"
[2013-06-14 14:41:18 -0400] jtimberman: miketheman: "reasons"
[2013-06-14 14:46:47 -0400] roidrage: jtimberman: i'm just happy to see it :)
[2013-06-14 14:47:23 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: i am too :)
[2013-06-14 14:47:33 -0400] jtimberman: miketheman: partially because we already had all that in jenkins :)
[2013-06-14 15:00:18 -0400] roidrage: jtimberman: let us know if we can help wih anything :)
[2013-06-14 15:09:42 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: <3
[2013-06-14 15:09:53 -0400] jtimberman: roidrage: how would one go about running test kitchen in travis? :)
[2013-06-14 15:10:31 -0400] roidrage: jtimberman: with vagrant and virtualbox, it may be a no go at the moment
[2013-06-14 15:13:02 -0400] kallistec: roidrage: you could run lxc?
[2013-06-14 15:13:47 -0400] kallistec: ^^ cc jtimberman
[2013-06-14 15:13:47 -0400] roidrage: kallistec: it's an openvz container setup right now
[2013-06-14 15:13:54 -0400] roidrage: we could cook up something custom for you based on ec2 for example if you're interested
[2013-06-14 15:15:37 -0400] kallistec: roidrage: maybe jtimberman can chime in with cookbook testing requirements; for chef we're going to be adding a bunch of cookbook-based integration tests, need to run them on a bunch of platforms (including as much windows as possible)
[2013-06-14 15:15:42 -0400] jtimberman: well, for *our* cookbooks we're going to run those in jenkins against our openstack environment, but there's a lot of people in the community that are looking for such things.
[2013-06-14 15:16:07 -0400] kallistec: travis is rad that the community has the same access to it as we do
[2013-06-14 15:16:27 -0400] roidrage: jtimberman: this could be done with rackspace for instance from the travis ci environment
[2013-06-14 15:16:40 -0400] jtimberman: kallistec: totally
[2013-06-14 15:17:34 -0400] roidrage: but yeah, we're considering the use case a bit more, mozilla has similar requirements :)
[2013-06-14 15:17:52 -0400] kallistec: e.g, we have the same test matrix internally as we run on travis (plus win2k8r2 w/ ruby 1.9.2) but no one can see it outside
[2013-06-14 15:25:24 -0400] roidrage: got it
[2013-06-14 15:25:37 -0400] roidrage: we can have a hangout chat about that next week so we can get an idea of your requirements maybe?
[2013-06-14 15:29:33 -0400] kallistec: still figuring those out on the chef front TBH
[2013-06-14 15:31:31 -0400] kallistec: but platform-specific functional (for us this means mock-free component tests) and integration tests are one direction we're going
[2013-06-14 15:32:12 -0400] kallistec: e.g., does the user provider work on all the platforms, does the windows cookbook work on this dev build of chef, etc.
[2013-06-14 15:32:56 -0400] kallistec: and TBH I don't know how worth it it would be for you guys to support all our platform requirements, stuff like sol9 and aix and whatnot
[2013-06-14 15:33:10 -0400] roidrage: heh, aix probably not :)
[2013-06-14 15:53:33 -0400] kallistec: so I think we really don't have a choice but to run an internal jenkins cluster, but it would be cool to run as much as we can on travis, too, so community ppl can see the tests run on their PRs and stuff
[2013-06-14 15:55:47 -0400] roidrage: yah

[2013-06-14 20:58:47 -0400] miketheman: Cookbook versions are not equivalent to other ruby versions - is that something that is making it into Chef 11.6 ?
[2013-06-14 21:00:11 -0400] coderanger: miketheman: Not sure what you mean
[2013-06-14 21:01:12 -0400] miketheman: coderanger: they are string representations of versions, and you cannot use the full pessimistic version constrains, such as '~> 1' that you can with RubyGems - you get an erry that it's not x.y or x.y.z
[2013-06-14 21:01:33 -0400] miketheman: or even '>= 1'
[2013-06-14 21:02:10 -0400] coderanger: That definitely worked at one point, I defer to kallistec et al though
[2013-06-14 21:03:00 -0400] kallistec: coderanger: did it? maybe back before constraints did anything?
[2013-06-14 21:03:10 -0400] coderanger: Quite possible :)
[2013-06-14 21:03:30 -0400] kallistec: also, '~> 1' seems like quite the degenerate case
[2013-06-14 21:04:00 -0400] miketheman: kallistec: would that not prevent you from ever going to 2?
[2013-06-14 21:05:09 -0400] coderanger: Wouldn't that be ~>1.0?
[2013-06-14 21:05:10 -0400] kallistec: miketheman: ~> 1.0 means 1.x
[2013-06-14 21:06:28 -0400] kallistec: and ~> 1.0.0 means 1.0.x, so working backwards, what would be the logical way to interpret ~> 1 ?
[2013-06-14 21:06:50 -0400] coderanger: Same as >=1 I would think, thats what npm does at least
[2013-06-14 21:08:58 -0400] miketheman: logic? use_inline_resources broke every cookbook maintainer's dependency on apt that has to maintain code for both chef 10 and 11.
[2013-06-14 21:09:09 -0400] miketheman: no clean way to handle this.
[2013-06-14 21:10:07 -0400] kallistec: I don't follow
[2013-06-14 21:10:16 -0400] kallistec: what version do you want to stay below?
[2013-06-14 21:10:31 -0400] miah: could you wrap 'use_inline_resources' in a conditional that checks the chef version?
[2013-06-14 21:11:04 -0400] jtimberman: don't check the chef version
[2013-06-14 21:11:07 -0400] coderanger: miah: No, since without the feature, the semantics of the resource are quite different
[2013-06-14 21:11:07 -0400] miketheman: I can't - the apt cookbook maintainer sure can. :)
[2013-06-14 21:11:13 -0400] jtimberman: use_inline_resources if defined?(use_inline_resources)
[2013-06-14 21:11:21 -0400] jtimberman: i hate this :(
[2013-06-14 21:11:37 -0400] jtimberman: workaround conditionals everywhere
[2013-06-14 21:11:48 -0400] miketheman: that's what you get for releasing software.
[2013-06-14 21:12:01 -0400] miah: well clearly its ugly. but it at least allows backwards compat and prevents an error that the majority of the users have no idea how to understand
[2013-06-14 21:13:03 -0400] jtimberman: i fear the side effects of things not working the way that you think they would though :/
[2013-06-14 21:13:18 -0400] jtimberman: someone test this stuff that isn't me! :D
[2013-06-14 21:13:39 -0400] miketheman: isn't that what test-kitchen is supposed to do?
[2013-06-14 21:14:06 -0400] miketheman: hell, travis told me about the incompat today when I tried to modify something.
[2013-06-14 21:15:21 -0400] miah: test-kitchen typically tests integration. it depends on your cookbook actually compiling.
[2013-06-14 21:15:45 -0400] miah: you're testing _after_ you've written the code =)
[2013-06-14 21:17:53 -0400] nbouscal: as a new user, i can attest to that use_inline_resources error being pretty confusing. ran into it earlier today, i figured it out, but it took 10-15 minutes of googling.
[2013-06-14 21:18:47 -0400] coderanger: We just need to pick how LWRPs are defined to behave and do that
[2013-06-14 21:18:53 -0400] coderanger: having two modes is an awful hack
[2013-06-14 21:19:42 -0400] miketheman: yeah, who let that happen? :)
[2013-06-14 21:20:17 -0400] jtimberman: wasn't me :)
[2013-06-14 21:20:35 -0400] jtimberman: we're blameless here tho! ;)
[2013-06-14 21:20:39 -0400] miah: well, its a question of: do resources created inside a lwrp/hwrp get added to the resource collection at all, or at least to _a_ resource collection? =)
[2013-06-14 21:21:48 -0400] coderanger: miah: HWRP doesn't (by default) include the recipe DSL so thats not a thing, LWRPs normally just append to the global resource collection at the point that the LWR was invoked
[2013-06-14 21:21:49 -0400] miah: if you want to notify/subscribe to changes in a rp you need to be able to locate the resource you created
[2013-06-14 21:22:03 -0400] miah: coright
[2013-06-14 21:22:07 -0400] miah: fuck lag
[2013-06-14 21:22:10 -0400] coderanger: with inline mode they get added to a resource context hidden in a closure, basically
[2013-06-14 21:22:31 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] sersut force-pushed ss/OC-8297 from 9537179 to 247d5e4: http://git.io/ECrzmA
[2013-06-14 21:22:31 -0400] github-bawt: chef/ss/OC-8297 247d5e4 sersut: Better error logging in solo integration test.
[2013-06-14 21:22:34 -0400] jtimberman: yeah it gets around the ugly hack that was going aroudn for making notifications and updated_by_last_action shit work
[2013-06-14 21:22:57 -0400] miah: ya, the updated_by_last_action shit was cargo culting in the wrong way
[2013-06-14 21:23:10 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, the right fix is nested resource collections
[2013-06-14 21:23:21 -0400] coderanger: I've got an initial version of that floating around in a gist
[2013-06-14 21:23:26 -0400] miah: cool
[2013-06-14 21:23:33 -0400] coderanger: lexical namespaces, do you speak them
[2013-06-14 21:23:46 -0400] coderanger: at least this is what I think is right, kallistec might disagree :)
[2013-06-14 21:24:10 -0400] kallistec: in a mtg, will chime in
[2013-06-14 21:32:10 -0400] kallistec: miketheman: I was the one who decided to make inline resources opt-in, 1) because there was not a lot of time to beta test, and 2) to give cookbook authors the option of using 10.x patterns to stay compatible at their own discretion
[2013-06-14 21:33:14 -0400] kallistec: I think it's been a pretty successful feature, so I'm leaning towards making it the default and adding warnings if you're not using it at some future time
[2013-06-14 21:33:27 -0400] miah: nice
[2013-06-14 21:35:25 -0400] coderanger: kallistec: I still think we should change it to allow for seeing resources from the parent context
[2013-06-14 21:35:33 -0400] miketheman: kallistec: while it's a cool thing, and allowing opt-in behavior is great, as a cookbook maintainer that relies on a well-known cookbook to leverage THAT cookbook's LWRP (namely apt), when another maintainer opts in, without maintaining backwards compatibility, that forces me to pin to an earlier, non-updated version, essentially forever, because Chef 10 isn't going to be EOL anytime soon.
[2013-06-14 21:37:07 -0400] kallistec: miketheman: right, but there's no way to maintain compatibility except not to release it
[2013-06-14 21:37:34 -0400] kallistec: which means you can never improve anything if the original implementation was not optimal
[2013-06-14 21:37:37 -0400] kallistec: which sucks
[2013-06-14 21:37:59 -0400] miketheman: agreed, but that's the challenege of design.
[2013-06-14 21:38:33 -0400] coderanger: miketheman: I think there is an unstated policy that opscode cookbooks only support the latest major version of chef, we should probably be explicit about that policy
[2013-06-14 21:38:47 -0400] coderanger: and I think thats a reasonable policy for our own cookbooks
[2013-06-14 21:39:10 -0400] miketheman: coderanger: that would be a step in the right direction
[2013-06-14 21:39:12 -0400] jtimberman: coderanger: there's no such policy unstated or otherwise.
[2013-06-14 21:39:16 -0400] coderanger: This has also come up a lot lately with people wanting compat for opsworks
[2013-06-14 21:39:26 -0400] jtimberman: well
[2013-06-14 21:39:32 -0400] miketheman: coderanger: is does, however, mean that there is less "good" software out there if everyone only uses the latest and greatest.
[2013-06-14 21:39:38 -0400] jtimberman: opsworks is on a version of chef that we don't support at all and haven't for awhile.
[2013-06-14 21:39:56 -0400] miketheman: which was fully EOL'ed, with announceements and everything.
[2013-06-14 21:40:10 -0400] miketheman: is there even a timeline on Chef 10?
[2013-06-14 21:40:47 -0400] miketheman: case: Apache HTTPD Server 2.2.23 vs 2.4.x and so on
[2013-06-14 21:41:29 -0400] github-bawt: [chef] sersut force-pushed ss/OC-8297 from 247d5e4 to 42700be: http://git.io/ECrzmA
[2013-06-14 21:41:30 -0400] github-bawt: chef/ss/OC-8297 42700be sersut: Better error logging in solo integration test.
[2013-06-14 21:41:39 -0400] coderanger: I've heard musings internally, but I don't think we have an overall policy at this point
[2013-06-14 21:41:41 -0400] kallistec: miketheman: I don't see any other approach that wouldn't cause these same problems
[2013-06-14 21:42:03 -0400] coderanger: but we should establish what version we support for the opscode cookbooks
[2013-06-14 21:42:11 -0400] coderanger: and then follow that :)
[2013-06-14 21:42:26 -0400] kallistec: I could make lwrp2s in resources2/ and providers2/. Then the apt stuff gets migrated to that and you're equally screwed
[2013-06-14 21:42:28 -0400] coderanger: If that is 10.14 or 11.0 or whatever, it should be a number
[2013-06-14 21:42:32 -0400] miketheman: coderanger: it's going to encourage 'apt-chef10' cookbooks
[2013-06-14 21:43:06 -0400] coderanger: miketheman: Okay, I don't view that as a bad thing as long as it isn't opscode maintaining those :)
[2013-06-14 21:44:00 -0400] miah: resources2/ providers2/ uh. i dont think chef would even acknowledge those =)
[2013-06-14 21:44:02 -0400] miketheman: fun article on the general topic: http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/ruby/excerpts/ruby-best-practices/writing-backward-compatible.html

[2013-06-14 21:44:47 -0400] miah: miketheman: so, engineyard is on chef 0.6, but i have yet to see a huge number of 'EY-Chef-foo' cookbooks. (there are a few, but not many)
[2013-06-14 21:45:11 -0400] miah: (also EY needs to pull their head out of their ass)
[2013-06-14 21:45:13 -0400] miketheman: miah: https://github.com/engineyard/ey-cloud-recipes/tree/master/cookbooks
[2013-06-14 21:45:18 -0400] miah: yes, im aware.
[2013-06-14 21:45:30 -0400] miah: thats their equivilent to 'chef-repository'
[2013-06-14 21:45:39 -0400] miah: everybody forks that by default and writes/adds their own cookbooks
[2013-06-14 21:45:40 -0400] miketheman: yep
[2013-06-14 21:45:44 -0400] miketheman: they started https://github.com/engineyard/ey-cloud-recipes-chef-10/tree/master/cookbooks

[2013-06-14 21:46:07 -0400] miah: ya, the v4 ami's for their stack has chef 10.16 (heh)
[2013-06-14 21:46:45 -0400] miah: Date:   Mon Oct 22 10:24:59 2012 -0700
[2013-06-14 21:46:51 -0400] miah: its at least not _super ancient_
[2013-06-14 21:47:23 -0400] miah: the reason they had to do that is because the way you build attributes in chef 0.6 is very different than chef 10
[2013-06-14 21:47:31 -0400] miketheman: anyways, thanks everyone for chatting, I think I'm going to stop grinding this axe now, because it's not going to change what's done, and I'm left with version pinning in order to support all users of my cookbooks. sigh.
[2013-06-14 21:47:57 -0400] jtimberman: coderanger: the nearest we have to a policy is, "We generally target the latest or current Chef version."
[2013-06-14 21:47:59 -0400] miah: you shyould be version pinning / tagging releases anyways
[2013-06-14 21:48:09 -0400] miah: 'this cookbook version was tested and verified on these versions'
[2013-06-14 21:48:23 -0400] miah: no reason people _have_ to use the newest version of the cookbook if they can't be bothered to update their software
[2013-06-14 21:48:33 -0400] jtimberman: one issue: only one "Default" versino allowed on the community site.
[2013-06-14 21:48:44 -0400] jtimberman: there isn't a "default for chef 10, different for chef 11"
[2013-06-14 21:48:46 -0400] miah: but you might get into the 'maintaining' various different vbranches
[2013-06-14 21:48:49 -0400] miketheman: miah: I don't want to force anyone to use a cookbook they don't have in their repo.
[2013-06-14 21:48:49 -0400] jtimberman: and none of the tooling out there supports it.
[2013-06-14 21:48:56 -0400] miah: jtimberman: true true
[2013-06-14 21:48:58 -0400] jtimberman: miah: yeah fuck all that for 140 projects :D
[2013-06-14 21:49:00 -0400] miah: i dont use community site though =)
[2013-06-14 21:49:09 -0400] miah: i agree
[2013-06-14 21:49:13 -0400] miketheman: miah is an anti-pattern
[2013-06-14 21:49:21 -0400] miah: thats why its easier to say 'update your shit and use the newest version'
[2013-06-14 21:49:39 -0400] miah: i am an anti-pattern.
[2013-06-14 21:49:44 -0400] jtimberman: hehehehe
[2013-06-14 21:49:54 -0400] jtimberman: anyway
[2013-06-14 21:50:12 -0400] jtimberman: these are all known problems with no fixes, and have been for awhile.
[2013-06-14 21:50:15 -0400] miah: yup
[2013-06-14 21:50:22 -0400] jtimberman: there will be topics for the community summit again.
[2013-06-14 21:50:30 -0400] kallistec: coderanger: so back to seeing outside of a LWRP's resource collection. That's pretty easy to do if you split the resource collection's responsibilities into resource set and action list
[2013-06-14 21:50:31 -0400] jtimberman: and nathen is taking notes and making plans for fixing.
[2013-06-14 21:50:36 -0400] miah: i think this is also part of the reason people need to get into the habit of testing cookbooks in their environment before updating and being pissed when a cookbook fails on all of their servers
[2013-06-14 21:51:42 -0400] coderanger: kallistec: easier https://gist.github.com/coderanger/4506662#file-notofying_action-rb-L2-L13
[2013-06-14 21:52:36 -0400] nbouscal: One consideration is that even for people who keep all software as up-to-date as possible (myself), you can run into problems if the vagrant box you're using has an older chef version. That's how I ran into that error earlier. Now that I know, I won't have that issue again, but for people who don't
[2013-06-14 21:52:54 -0400] coderanger: nbouscal: grab the vagrant omnibus plugin
[2013-06-14 21:54:07 -0400] nbouscal: coderanger: thanks for the tip, I will. The point still stands for people that don't know about that, though, and will get a confusing error message
[2013-06-14 21:54:37 -0400] btm: petecheslock: it would help if you would try to clone the repo and run the spec tests, we're going to need to get those passing. if folks can work on that while I get the 8.3 boxes going we'll make progress faster. /cc KarlHungus
[2013-06-14 21:54:51 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, we're working with michell I know, there is a vague plan to remove both chef and puppet from the default images
[2013-06-14 21:54:54 -0400] petecheslock: btm - cool thing I can work on that later today
[2013-06-14 21:55:24 -0400] petecheslock: btm - wait - which  repo you guys working on?
[2013-06-14 21:55:28 -0400] petecheslock: might have missed it in the chat
[2013-06-14 21:55:57 -0400] nbouscal: coderanger: that makes sense, also has the benefit of keeping the box to just essentials
[2013-06-14 21:56:53 -0400] jtimberman: nbouscal: there's a more nuanced problem, in that vagrant base boxes have shit installed :)
[2013-06-14 21:57:11 -0400] coderanger: nbouscal: We already provide "blank" images for ubntu and cento
[2013-06-14 21:57:21 -0400] coderanger: check the bento repo for the links
[2013-06-14 21:57:35 -0400] jtimberman: coderanger: *we* do
[2013-06-14 21:57:54 -0400] jtimberman: coderanger: but those a) aren't the documented default in the vagrant documentation or b) most people probably don't even know about them.
[2013-06-14 21:58:03 -0400] nbouscal: I think part of the learning curve is that everyone provides base boxes and they're all different :P I'm trying to learn vagrant, chef, and berkshelf all three provide different 'defaults'
[2013-06-14 21:58:23 -0400] nbouscal: and espouse different best practices / workflow guidelines / etc
[2013-06-14 21:58:31 -0400] jtimberman: that too.
[2013-06-14 21:58:50 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: Yeah, though they are the deafaults in the new starter kit :D
[2013-06-14 21:59:14 -0400] jtimberman: sure.
[2013-06-14 21:59:54 -0400] btm: petecheslock: I mean checkout the chef repo itself, master branch, and run the spec tests on a freebsd box.
[2013-06-14 22:02:26 -0400] btm: petecheslock: here are the two failures we had on 9.x in CI: https://gist.github.com/btm/31bcc3b43edb0b948a62

[2013-06-14 22:34:13 -0400] petecheslock: btm - ahh - gotcha.  I'll do that tonight and check it out.  Maybe KarlHungus can check it as well.
[2013-06-14 22:34:16 -0400] petecheslock: let you know what i find
[2013-06-14 22:39:40 -0400] gchristensen: anyone know how the omnibus installer creates the symlink in /usr/bin to the chef client in /opt/chef/bin? I'm not seeing anywhere that enables this
[2013-06-14 22:40:53 -0400] gchristensen: (I'm working to package my own stuff with omnibus, and executables I put in the bin directory don't get symlinked.)
[2013-06-14 23:03:05 -0400] kallistec: gchristensen: postinstall script
[2013-06-14 23:13:45 -0400] gchristensen: d'oh! thank you, kallistec
