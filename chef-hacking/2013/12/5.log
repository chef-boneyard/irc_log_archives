[2013-12-05 01:00:11 -0500] kisoku: is knife cookbook upload idempotent, ie. it wont take action if none is required ?
[2013-12-05 01:20:27 -0500] juliancdunn: kisoku: no, it'll upload whatever you tell it to
[2013-12-05 01:41:10 -0500] spheromak: juliancdunn: really ? didn't it used to only upload what sums weren't matching
[2013-12-05 01:41:16 -0500] spheromak: I recall it being liket that at one point
[2013-12-05 01:44:35 -0500] spheromak: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/cookbook_uploader.rb
[2013-12-05 01:44:42 -0500] spheromak: coookboko_uploader checks sums
[2013-12-05 01:48:33 -0500] spheromak: and won't re-upload if sum hasn't changed.
[2013-12-05 01:48:57 -0500] spheromak: kisoku: using debug should show you whats uploading and whats not
[2013-12-05 01:50:12 -0500] kisoku: actually verbose shows that too
[2013-12-05 01:50:21 -0500] kisoku: with less output than debug
[2013-12-05 01:50:43 -0500] kisoku: so yeah. way better than berks upload :-P
[2013-12-05 02:20:18 -0500] spheromak: well
[2013-12-05 02:20:33 -0500] spheromak: berks checks if the cook @ that version exists and is frozen and only uploades if not
[2013-12-05 02:20:38 -0500] spheromak: but yea always uploads
[2013-12-05 02:20:49 -0500] spheromak: why versions become sorta important :)

[2013-12-05 14:59:56 -0500] zts: Using test-kitchen, how can I enable SSH agent forwarding when connecting to an instance?  I can see the code to do it, but it's not obvious how/where I set the option.
[2013-12-05 15:05:06 -0500] zts: never mind, guessed it - add a top-level key to kitchen.yml called "driver_config", with "forward_agent: true" under that

[2013-12-05 22:38:03 -0500] fdsfds: hi
[2013-12-05 22:38:19 -0500] fdsfds: I have a question
[2013-12-05 22:39:04 -0500] fdsfds: does anyone know the difference between the workstation and the chef server?
[2013-12-05 22:39:28 -0500] fdsfds: why can I just use the workstation to upload the cookbooks to the nodes, do i even need to use the server?
[2013-12-05 22:42:00 -0500] aspiers: mattray: hey :) I'm about to start work on a pacemaker cookbook and barclamp. What's the latest with barclamp_ha_service? It looks like noone's really touched it for quite a while right?
[2013-12-05 22:45:39 -0500] aspiers: mattray: and should I announce my intentions on the chef list, or chef-dev?
[2013-12-05 22:46:19 -0500] aspiers: or chef-openstack?
[2013-12-05 22:47:49 -0500] mattray: aspiers: nobody's touched the one I worked on for a long time
[2013-12-05 22:48:14 -0500] aspiers: mattray: I'd prefer to call it barclamp-pacemaker than barclamp_ha_service
[2013-12-05 22:48:22 -0500] mattray: makes sense
[2013-12-05 22:48:27 -0500] c_t: call it "steve"
[2013-12-05 22:48:28 -0500] aspiers: less ambiguous
[2013-12-05 22:48:31 -0500] aspiers: barclamp-steve
[2013-12-05 22:48:43 -0500] aspiers: also, the Crowbar convention is hyphens not underscores
[2013-12-05 22:48:52 -0500] c_t: there's a fine tradition of chef related projects being named so as to be utterly ungoogleable
[2013-12-05 22:48:58 -0500] aspiers: hehe
[2013-12-05 22:49:03 -0500] mattray: I know the general consensus for Rackspace & AT&T is to use haproxy + carpd and build out a share-nothing architecture for HA OpenStack
[2013-12-05 22:49:20 -0500] mattray: c_t: Spiceweasel resists that ;)
[2013-12-05 22:49:44 -0500] aspiers: mattray: well, I'm very much in Florian's camp of seeing the value in Pacemaker, even when haproxy is still used
[2013-12-05 22:49:48 -0500] c_t: mattray: that was one motivation behind the "goiardi" name too, along with the delicious pun
[2013-12-05 22:50:04 -0500] aspiers: mattray: admittedly I'm biased, having formerly worked on our HA team
[2013-12-05 22:50:12 -0500] mattray: aspiers: we're a big tent :)
[2013-12-05 22:50:36 -0500] mattray: I think the roles and cookbooks should work well with either/neither
[2013-12-05 22:51:05 -0500] aspiers: not everything can be fronted with haproxy anyway
[2013-12-05 22:51:14 -0500] mattray: right
[2013-12-05 22:51:56 -0500] aspiers: mattray: that aside, I was glad to find that solution #2 in https://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Solving+the+Pacemaker+Chef+Services+issue is more or less exactly what we were planning
[2013-12-05 22:52:27 -0500] mattray: aspiers: alas, that code was never written, just planned
[2013-12-05 22:52:31 -0500] aspiers: mattray: though that raises the question, are other folk going to get irritated when we do the retrofitting? since that would introduce a dependency on the new LWRP
[2013-12-05 22:52:54 -0500] aspiers: which would then need to be present even for scenarios without pacemaker
[2013-12-05 22:53:31 -0500] aspiers: maybe it would be better to call the LWRP "clustered_service", in case there are other clustering technologies which people would want to support
[2013-12-05 22:53:33 -0500] mattray: aspiers: perhaps a judicious use of chef_rewind or some other patch could change out the services with a wrapper cookbook
[2013-12-05 22:54:14 -0500] aspiers: hmm, more structured sort of monkey patching?
[2013-12-05 22:54:54 -0500] mattray: yes
[2013-12-05 22:55:05 -0500] mattray: rewind it, then change out the provider would probably work
[2013-12-05 22:55:43 -0500] mattray: we can discuss an openstack-common wrapper for clustered_service also
[2013-12-05 22:56:05 -0500] mattray: I think IBM wants both Pacemaker and a carpd-ish solution
[2013-12-05 22:56:38 -0500] aspiers: mattray: which list is best for this discussion?
[2013-12-05 22:56:57 -0500] mattray: the openstack chef ML
[2013-12-05 22:57:05 -0500] aspiers: OK
[2013-12-05 22:57:47 -0500] mattray: http://groups.google.com/group/opscode-chef-openstack
[2013-12-05 22:58:15 -0500] aspiers: yup, was already lurking on that :)
[2013-12-05 22:58:19 -0500] mattray: the IRC channel could have a lively discussion around it, assuming there's a couple people present (spheromak, jaypipes, galstrom)
[2013-12-05 22:58:27 -0500] aspiers: OK cool
[2013-12-05 22:58:40 -0500] aspiers: mostly American timezone I'm guessing?
[2013-12-05 22:58:47 -0500] mattray: mostly
[2013-12-05 22:58:55 -0500] aspiers: OK
[2013-12-05 22:59:10 -0500] mattray: spheromak is with KT, back and forth between San Francisco & Korea
[2013-12-05 22:59:14 -0500] aspiers: I don't quite understand the chef_rewind idea yet, but presumably if I read up on it, it will make sense
[2013-12-05 22:59:38 -0500] mattray: aspiers: the intention is to not have to modify the underlying cookbook, which seems like the goal here
[2013-12-05 23:00:13 -0500] aspiers: yup, just don't understand why it's called "rewind" yet :)
[2013-12-05 23:02:28 -0500] aspiers: mattray: BTW, github happily allowed renaming: https://github.com/aspiers/barclamp-pacemaker
[2013-12-05 23:04:52 -0500] mattray: aspiers: it looks like I did my work on the "pacemaker_service" branch FYI
[2013-12-05 23:04:58 -0500] aspiers: ah
[2013-12-05 23:05:49 -0500] aspiers: mattray: I'll definitely use that as a starting point then
[2013-12-05 23:06:00 -0500] mattray: aspiers: good luck
[2013-12-05 23:06:05 -0500] aspiers: thanks :)
