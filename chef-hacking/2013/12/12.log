[2013-12-12 16:01:49 -0500] gchristensen: I had this wild thought last night, what if cookbooks had a MANIFEST file which was GPG signed, with a cookbook that runs first ensuring that all the cookbooks onthe local cache were signed properly?
[2013-12-12 16:02:26 -0500] gchristensen: the MANIFEST being a list of all the files in the cookbook with md5 or sha sums
[2013-12-12 16:54:20 -0500] s2r2: gchristensen: that's interesting.  I wonder if it solves a real problem (in chef's security architecture) or if it'd just be nice-to-have
[2013-12-12 16:56:21 -0500] gchristensen: s2r2: my understanding is that if the chef-server is compromised, you're toast. just a thought to help prefent that
[2013-12-12 16:56:46 -0500] gchristensen: it doesn't begin to try and fix if the databags or node data is altered though
[2013-12-12 17:06:46 -0500] zambon: Hello everyone! I'm trying to create a node, set the run list and bootstrap it from Ruby code, instead of using knife. Any leads on that?
[2013-12-12 17:13:48 -0500] s2r2: shell out to knife bootstrap?  or you could look at its code and learn from that, I suppose.
[2013-12-12 17:14:25 -0500] s2r2: but maybe what you really want is stuff to happen without your interaction, so you might be able to use cloud-inits chef support or something similar
[2013-12-12 17:19:20 -0500] teukka: zambon: if you really want to use Knife::Bootstrap directly you can see how the cloud plugins use it. knife-ec2 etc
[2013-12-12 17:21:23 -0500] zambon: <zambon> teukka: good point, I'll take a look! thanks
