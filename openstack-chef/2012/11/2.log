[2012-11-02 16:54:38 -0400] mattray: new pxe_dust if anyone's interested. Now enforces pxe-booted NIC as eth0
[2012-11-02 16:57:24 -0400] mattray: also renamed the cookbook in my github to pxe_dust-cookbook
[2012-11-02 16:58:34 -0400] mattray: bumped the essex versions of the cookbooks to match the OpenStack release numbering too, so 5.0.0 -> 2012.1.0
[2012-11-02 17:00:30 -0400] retr0h: mattray: nice.. the udev trick end up working?
[2012-11-02 17:00:42 -0400] mattray: yeah, I modified it a bit
[2012-11-02 17:01:09 -0400] mattray: since I know in advance which nic is PXE-booted, I can just write that in
[2012-11-02 17:01:38 -0400] mattray: so I drop the IFACE line and plug in the known value into the MAC line
[2012-11-02 17:01:52 -0400] retr0h: yah nice
[2012-11-02 17:02:25 -0400] mattray: so dropped the udev cookbook from use. I did start digging into ipxe, will probably write a cookbook for that
[2012-11-02 17:02:34 -0400] mattray: that can be used by pxe_dust
[2012-11-02 17:02:40 -0400] retr0h: ahh nice
[2012-11-02 17:02:45 -0400] retr0h: should check out cobbler too
[2012-11-02 17:02:48 -0400] retr0h: thats what we use
[2012-11-02 17:03:06 -0400] retr0h: fairly hapy with it.. its slanted towards redhat a bit... but I only use the basics
[2012-11-02 17:03:24 -0400] mattray: yeah, I've got some things I want to do with pxe_dust that are incompatible with Cobbler, especially since it leverages the Chef server heavily
[2012-11-02 17:03:57 -0400] mattray: also helping get Razor support for Chef moving too
[2012-11-02 17:04:10 -0400] retr0h: razor smazor :P
[2012-11-02 17:04:27 -0400] retr0h: cool.. well let me know what issues u ran into with cobbler
[2012-11-02 17:04:29 -0400] retr0h: t some point
[2012-11-02 17:04:33 -0400] retr0h: i may be able to help yah
[2012-11-02 17:04:43 -0400] retr0h: we run cobbler and chef as well
[2012-11-02 17:07:04 -0400] mattray: Mainly Cobbler wanted to do too much. I wanted to just bolt OS provisioning into Chef
[2012-11-02 17:07:28 -0400] mattray: so pxe_dust doesn't manage dhcp or dns and gets its config management from Chef
[2012-11-02 18:11:30 -0400] mattray: NYC Chef for OpenStack Hack Day is officially canceled.
[2012-11-02 22:25:15 -0400] ctracey__: mattray, carlp lookin forward to the webinar next week - interested to hear your take on deployment at dreamhost
