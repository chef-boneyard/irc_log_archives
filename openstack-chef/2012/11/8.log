[2012-11-08 19:44:18 -0500] grizzlyCode: hi all, i'm trying to get up and running w/ chef for an initial openstack install from the opscode/openstack-chef-repo. it's falling over during glance install giving a strange error
[2012-11-08 19:44:32 -0500] grizzlyCode: here's the dump: + cd images/precise
[2012-11-08 19:44:33 -0500] grizzlyCode: + curl -L http://hypnotoad/precise-server-cloudimg-amd64.tar.gz
[2012-11-08 19:44:33 -0500] grizzlyCode: + tar -zx
[2012-11-08 19:44:33 -0500] grizzlyCode: curl: (6) Couldn't resolve host 'hypnotoad'
[2012-11-08 19:44:58 -0500] grizzlyCode: in my attributes i have set: default["glance"]["image"]["precise"] = "http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/precise/current/precise-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img"
[2012-11-08 19:45:08 -0500] grizzlyCode: anyone have any idea where it's picking up hynotoad?
[2012-11-08 19:57:29 -0500] mattray: hah
[2012-11-08 19:57:40 -0500] mattray: hypnotoad is a locally mirrored file
[2012-11-08 19:57:45 -0500] mattray: lemme get you the original source
[2012-11-08 19:58:58 -0500] mattray: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/glance/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L49
[2012-11-08 19:59:08 -0500] mattray: just remove the hypnotoad stuff and it'll use the defaults
[2012-11-08 19:59:23 -0500] mattray: grizzlyCode: ^^
