[2012-07-27 02:01:54 -0400] rpedde: mattray: not as far as I know.  I haven't looked at ours or the upstream, don't know what the changes are etc.  Generally we try not to fork upstreams, and we try to push back upstream where we can/should, but it's easy to forget.  :(
[2012-07-27 02:52:36 -0400] galstrom: mattray: the rsyslog cookbook has a ton of changes.. I am not sure all of them are upstream able..
[2012-07-27 02:53:02 -0400] galstrom: ~200 lines diff
[2012-07-27 14:01:40 -0400] mattray: galstrom: following up on your post about the size of the merge, I'm thinking it makes sense to have a openstack-rsyslog cookbook that would pull out the various syslog recipes. That makes the merge smaller and the syslog support stand-alone
[2012-07-27 14:02:04 -0400] mattray: keeping syslog optional and out of glance, keystone, etc.
[2012-07-27 14:02:18 -0400] galstrom: yeah.. i have no problem with the openstack-rsyslog cookbook
[2012-07-27 14:02:31 -0400] mattray: I'm adding it to my backlog for after the quickstart
[2012-07-27 14:02:37 -0400] galstrom: i am just not sure if the other changes we made to rsyslog are good for upstreaming
[2012-07-27 14:02:52 -0400] galstrom: however.. since it did not really work before.. i guess by definition they are
[2012-07-27 14:02:58 -0400] mattray: indeed :)
[2012-07-27 14:03:09 -0400] mattray: I can review them later, no rush since I've disabled it from my build
[2012-07-27 14:03:35 -0400] wkelly: that's like problem solved!
[2012-07-27 14:03:53 -0400] wkelly: what's up with the furry animal army that helps us run chef?
[2012-07-27 14:04:12 -0400] mattray: furry animal army?
[2012-07-27 14:04:35 -0400] wkelly: spiceweasel and cuddly koala librarian or something?
[2012-07-27 14:05:39 -0400] mattray: ahhh I'm thinking I should add librarian-chef support to spiceweasel so it can handle mixing community cookbooks with git and local cookbooks
[2012-07-27 14:05:48 -0400] mattray: spiceweasel doesn't do anything with git
[2012-07-27 14:05:58 -0400] wkelly: I see!
[2012-07-27 14:06:01 -0400] mattray: and librarian-chef is pretty standard
[2012-07-27 14:06:09 -0400] mattray: well, good traction at least
[2012-07-27 14:06:26 -0400] mattray: and spiceweasel still handles roles, data bags, etc.
[2012-07-27 14:06:45 -0400] mattray: with validation which I'd like to get into foodcritic at some point
[2012-07-27 14:07:43 -0400] wkelly: that makes sense!
[2012-07-27 14:08:02 -0400] wkelly: Sadly, I did not know what either of these projects did until about five minutes ago
[2012-07-27 14:09:53 -0400] galstrom: wait.. there is another dsl thingy to handle the whole "these versions are known to work well with each other" issue?  I think what you are looking for is git.
[2012-07-27 14:13:03 -0400] mattray: the Cheffile for librarian looks like this: http://pastebin.com/GpCMeYGC
[2012-07-27 14:13:28 -0400] mattray: librarian handles making sure the right versions are pulled down from the community site and git
[2012-07-27 14:13:37 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/yfeldblum/librarian
[2012-07-27 14:14:20 -0400] mattray: with 17 cookbooks and growing, we're going to need something to track the deps
[2012-07-27 14:18:24 -0400] galstrom: um.. "handle the deps" .. like git submodules? which is even better that just grabbing a version.. you can actually grab a specific git commit (example there might be 4 commits between v1.1 and v1.2)
[2012-07-27 14:20:22 -0400] mattray: galstrom: librarian has "ref" for git usage, so that can be "any branch name, tag name, SHA, or SHA unique prefix"
[2012-07-27 14:20:53 -0400] mattray: plus it can just pull releases from community.opscode.com
[2012-07-27 14:20:57 -0400] wkelly: and it can also download from community
[2012-07-27 14:21:02 -0400] mattray: which is where we want the cookbooks to go
[2012-07-27 14:21:06 -0400] rpedde: a branch name is a sha.  a tag is a sha.  a sha is a sha.  a sha unique prefix is a sha
[2012-07-27 14:21:19 -0400] wkelly: I can see that!
[2012-07-27 14:22:04 -0400] rpedde: what does librarian do that git doesn't, maybe that's the question.
[2012-07-27 14:22:11 -0400] wkelly: rpedde: community!
[2012-07-27 14:22:51 -0400] rpedde: anyone else?
[2012-07-27 14:22:59 -0400] wkelly: noooooooooooo
[2012-07-27 14:23:04 -0400] galstrom: rpedde: that is exactly what i was getting at
[2012-07-27 14:23:34 -0400] galstrom: I don't understand the point of yet another tool.. that attempts to do what git is great at
[2012-07-27 14:24:11 -0400] rpedde: :)
[2012-07-27 14:24:26 -0400] mattray: galstrom: git doesn't know about the opscode community site, we want the openstack chef stuff to require less git for the uninitiated
[2012-07-27 14:24:53 -0400] galstrom: mattray: the opscode community site points to git repos
[2012-07-27 14:25:02 -0400] rpedde: okay, that makes sense
[2012-07-27 14:25:02 -0400] galstrom: still confused
[2012-07-27 14:25:02 -0400] mattray: sometimes
[2012-07-27 14:25:42 -0400] mattray: stuff gets put on the community site when it's "released", git may or may not reflect that.
[2012-07-27 14:25:44 -0400] galstrom: ok.. I am willing to concede that this is probably a power user vs. a regular user argument..
[2012-07-27 14:25:51 -0400] mattray: and not everyone is dilligent about tagging their releases
[2012-07-27 14:26:02 -0400] galstrom: and for that the chef-butler solves an issue for a regular user
[2012-07-27 14:26:02 -0400] mattray: so the community site holds tarballs
[2012-07-27 14:30:15 -0400] galstrom: err.. meant chef-librarian
[2012-07-27 14:34:53 -0400] mattray: anyway, today should be some osops-utils syncing and trying to get nova up in my lab
[2012-07-27 14:35:05 -0400] mattray: with a weekly status email for the ML
[2012-07-27 14:35:18 -0400] mattray: which I'm going to try to do every week
[2012-07-27 18:46:55 -0400] mattray: galstrom: in osops-utils, when you do get_config_endpoint it's searching by roles that map to the service?
[2012-07-27 18:47:29 -0400] mattray: ahh, yeah
[2012-07-27 18:47:39 -0400] mattray: I collapsed the glance stuff into a single role, broke that :)
[2012-07-27 18:47:42 -0400] mattray: I'll undo that
[2012-07-27 19:46:44 -0400] galstrom: yeah.. that is there to allow for services to be unique.. and provide the ability for them to be running anywhere
[2012-07-27 19:47:28 -0400] mattray: yup, switched back to the way it was, glance appears to be up and happy, tackling nova now
[2012-07-27 19:47:39 -0400] galstrom: mattray: https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/osops-utils/pull/11
[2012-07-27 19:47:59 -0400] galstrom: you want me to reopen and merge.. since it passed gates?
[2012-07-27 19:48:10 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/osops-utils/pull/29
[2012-07-27 19:48:14 -0400] mattray: moved it there
[2012-07-27 19:48:22 -0400] galstrom: ah..
[2012-07-27 19:48:23 -0400] galstrom: ok
[2012-07-27 19:48:50 -0400] galstrom: i thought maybe the "un-approved comitter" message caused you to close it..
[2012-07-27 20:54:32 -0400] mattray: hey rackers, what's with the installation of dsh? is that just for admins?
[2012-07-27 20:55:04 -0400] mattray: I mean, helper stuff not required?
[2012-07-27 21:45:23 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde, mattray: looks like I missed a great conversation :(
[2012-07-27 22:17:41 -0400] rpedde: jaypipes: you aren't going to stir the pot more, are you?  :P
[2012-07-27 22:18:16 -0400] rpedde: mattray: yeah, pretty much as an admin convenience, at least on the nova side
[2012-07-27 22:19:03 -0400] mattray: rpedde: I took it out of my fork. There's a users cookbook and knife ssh that would give you the same behavior
[2012-07-27 22:20:00 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde: well, funny thing ... mattray and I had this conversation yesterday with Aaton :)
[2012-07-27 22:21:08 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde: I'm still thinking that git submodules are a better long-term solution, but Aaton and mattray made some arguments for librarian
[2012-07-27 22:21:30 -0400] rpedde: I don't like the idea of librarian, but it does not impact me, so I don't care
[2012-07-27 22:21:30 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde: I think it goes back to what Justin was saying earlier... a regular user vs. power user preference thing.
[2012-07-27 22:21:34 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: you can still ignore librarian and use git submodules
[2012-07-27 22:21:43 -0400] rpedde: ^^ this
[2012-07-27 22:21:46 -0400] mattray: that just won't be the default
[2012-07-27 22:21:58 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: well, we're talking about the approach that github.com/openstack/chef-repo should take here.
[2012-07-27 22:22:42 -0400] rpedde: jaypipes: there can still be a chef-repo that uses git submodules, but the librarian yaml can just be sedded out of .gitmodules
[2012-07-27 22:23:26 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde: ya... that's pretty much what I thought as well.
[2012-07-27 22:24:18 -0400] jaypipes: my only worry/thought is that I'm just not sure that roles belong on the community site. I think cookbooks belong there, but roles should be in the github.com/openstack/chef-repo only and represent best practices for openstack deploys
[2012-07-27 22:24:44 -0400] mattray: there aren't any roles in the cookbooks
[2012-07-27 22:25:04 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: no, I know that silly :)
[2012-07-27 22:25:29 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I meant if roles would be somewhere on the community site... as opposed to on the github/openstack/chef-repo
[2012-07-27 22:25:43 -0400] mattray: ahh...
[2012-07-27 22:26:00 -0400] mattray: well at some point you need a chef-repo. We could provide links to the zip or tarball off of GitHub
[2012-07-27 22:26:04 -0400] mattray: for new users
[2012-07-27 22:26:41 -0400] jaypipes: sure, that would work
[2012-07-27 22:27:03 -0400] jaypipes: my concern (as is yours I think) is to limit the amount of duplication when it comes to the roles...
[2012-07-27 22:27:12 -0400] jaypipes: the cookbook de-duplication is already solved clearly
[2012-07-27 22:27:25 -0400] jaypipes: but want to make sure the same effort is done for a good set of roles
[2012-07-27 22:29:56 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: I'm thinking that can be driven with documentation and a graphic showing the roles usage
[2012-07-27 22:30:44 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: sorry, not quite following you... how would documentation help in de-duplicating role definitions?
[2012-07-27 22:31:08 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: we give people a doc like "100 node HA deployment HOWTO"
[2012-07-27 22:31:25 -0400] mattray: doc'ing which roles to use and how
[2012-07-27 22:31:34 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: and the doc would point to role definitions where?
[2012-07-27 22:32:10 -0400] mattray: just the big bunch of roles included in https://github.com/mattray/openstack-chef-repo/tree/essex/roles
[2012-07-27 22:32:41 -0400] mattray: or even a spiceweasel file just for that configuration
[2012-07-27 22:32:50 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: k. and those roles would live at github.com/openstack/chef-repo/roles?
[2012-07-27 22:32:57 -0400] mattray: yeah
[2012-07-27 22:33:01 -0400] jaypipes: got it.
[2012-07-27 22:33:05 -0400] jaypipes: cool with me.
[2012-07-27 22:33:14 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: you sending out your week in review? :)
[2012-07-27 22:33:27 -0400] mattray: nuts. I'll send it tonight
[2012-07-27 22:33:32 -0400] mattray: I'm leaving for dinner
[2012-07-27 22:33:45 -0400] jaypipes: no worries cya
[2012-07-27 22:33:50 -0400] mattray: but the raw notes are here: https://github.com/mattray/openstack-chef-repo/blob/essex/TODO.org
[2012-07-27 22:34:09 -0400] jaypipes: rock on. will look\
[2012-07-27 22:37:31 -0400] rpedde: I'm outted.  Have a good weekend, y'
[2012-07-27 22:37:35 -0400] rpedde: all
[2012-07-27 22:37:38 -0400] mattray: later, I'm out too
