[2012-07-26 19:00:33 -0400] mattray: syncing up with last month of rackspace changes to keystone, glance and osops-utils
[2012-07-26 19:02:09 -0400] mattray: would be nice to move the monitoring and logging out of the core cookbooks
[2012-07-26 19:10:37 -0400] rpedde: agree
[2012-07-26 19:20:13 -0400] mattray: right now I'm just tracking rcbops in a branch, diffing it against my branch and reading the commits to track changes
[2012-07-26 19:20:30 -0400] mattray: not very different, I've just purged out the monitoring and logging stuff
[2012-07-26 20:46:56 -0400] Aaton: so after finding out the folsom-trunk-testing ubuntu packages don't work I switched to the precise-trunk-testing one.  got farther but still issues.
[2012-07-26 20:51:30 -0400] mattray: just merged up with rcbops' keystone
[2012-07-26 20:51:34 -0400] mattray: working on glance now
[2012-07-26 20:51:46 -0400] Aaton: cool!
[2012-07-26 20:54:38 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: where you putting your work, and can we contribute?
[2012-07-26 20:55:45 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: right now it's in https://github.com/mattray/keystone
[2012-07-26 20:55:48 -0400] mattray: and other repos
[2012-07-26 20:55:55 -0400] mattray: I'm trying to get it into shape for a quickstart
[2012-07-26 20:56:01 -0400] jaypipes: k
[2012-07-26 20:56:16 -0400] mattray: so it's a bit messy as I test and upgrade as I go
[2012-07-26 20:56:28 -0400] mattray: lemme push some cookbook updates in openstack-chef-repo too
[2012-07-26 20:57:51 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: openstack-chef-repo where? there's many of them.. :(
[2012-07-26 20:59:21 -0400] mattray: good point
[2012-07-26 20:59:56 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/mattray/openstack-chef-repo
[2012-07-26 21:00:20 -0400] mattray: once I have things usable, I'll push to opscode's repos and it'll become slightly more formalized
[2012-07-26 21:01:40 -0400] mattray: today's successes(?): upgrading dependency cookbooks
[2012-07-26 21:01:47 -0400] mattray: syncing with rcbops' updates
[2012-07-26 21:02:06 -0400] mattray: talking with a few people about potentially hosting chef/openstack hackdays
[2012-07-26 21:04:07 -0400] mattray: also planning on sending out weekly status emails, starting tomorrow
[2012-07-26 21:11:01 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: any decisions been made on using git submodules vs., say, infrastructure.yaml files?
[2012-07-26 21:12:18 -0400] mattray: I guess git submodules would be OK, I'm leaning towards using librarian-chef at some point
[2012-07-26 21:12:54 -0400] mattray: already 17 cookbooks used https://github.com/mattray/openstack-chef-repo/blob/essex/infrastructure.yml
[2012-07-26 21:13:09 -0400] mattray: and nova and swift aren't in there yet
[2012-07-26 21:13:14 -0400] mattray: well, fully
[2012-07-26 21:13:30 -0400] mattray: 2 cookbooks are currently forked
[2012-07-26 21:13:50 -0400] mattray: from the community site, waiting for patches upstream
[2012-07-26 21:14:19 -0400] mattray: and the openstack cookbooks would be preferred to take from the community site
[2012-07-26 21:14:28 -0400] mattray: not that I've published them there yet
[2012-07-26 21:16:21 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: when you say "community site", what are you referring to? :)
[2012-07-26 21:16:34 -0400] mattray: community.opscode.com
[2012-07-26 21:16:47 -0400] mattray: so you can "knife cookbook site download glance" for example
[2012-07-26 21:16:58 -0400] mattray: or "knife cookbook site download glance 1.2.1"
[2012-07-26 21:17:22 -0400] mattray: the goal is to only need the openstack-chef-repo from git
[2012-07-26 21:18:20 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: wouldn't someone really be doing something like git clone git://github.com/openstack/chef-repo && cd chef-repo/cookbooks && for cookbook in $pwd; knife cookbook add $cookbook
[2012-07-26 21:18:39 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I know personally I don't plan on using knife cookbook site download ever...
[2012-07-26 21:18:46 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: since it's a one-off thing...
[2012-07-26 21:19:25 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I'm much more inclined to be scripting everything based on the cookbooks in my own local git checkout of the openstack/chef-repo
[2012-07-26 21:20:09 -0400] mattray: yeah, it's a matter of balancing community usage vs. developers
[2012-07-26 21:20:30 -0400] mattray: I don't want 14 non-openstack cookbooks in the cookbook directory
[2012-07-26 21:20:52 -0400] mattray: it clutters the git repo
[2012-07-26 21:21:01 -0400] jaypipes: ? not following uyou...
[2012-07-26 21:21:18 -0400] mattray: so there are currently 17 cookbooks used by openstack-chef-repo
[2012-07-26 21:21:31 -0400] mattray: 12 of them are straight from the community site
[2012-07-26 21:21:37 -0400] mattray: 2 are waiting patches
[2012-07-26 21:21:38 -0400] jaypipes: shouldn't the github.com/openstack/chef-repo's cookbook directory contain all cookboooks needed for a deployment of OenStack?
[2012-07-26 21:22:13 -0400] mattray: and use submodules for every dep? They'd all have to have tags for their versions
[2012-07-26 21:22:26 -0400] mattray: which isn't as universal as it should be
[2012-07-26 21:22:37 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: no.. you tag the overall repo, not the individual submodules
[2012-07-26 21:22:57 -0400] mattray: can you tag submodules?
[2012-07-26 21:23:14 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: in other words, if we tag github.com/openstack/chef-repo with "stable/essex", the git submodules contained in cookbooks would be assured to work with a stable/essex deployment of OpenSTack
[2012-07-26 21:23:46 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: and the stable/folsom tag would have its submodules at versions that are correct for a folsom openstack deploy, etc
[2012-07-26 21:23:50 -0400] jaypipes: make sense?
[2012-07-26 21:24:05 -0400] mattray: yeah, that's not how most chef users track their cookbooks
[2012-07-26 21:24:37 -0400] mattray: they use something like librarian-chef for a mix of community site and github right
[2012-07-26 21:24:41 -0400] mattray: http://pastebin.com/GpCMeYGC
[2012-07-26 21:24:53 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: if I do: git clone git://github.com/openstack/chef-repo stable/essex, that would clone all cookbooks that are ready for use in an essex deployment.
[2012-07-26 21:25:34 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: sorry, what am I looking at in that paste? is that a librarian=-chef script?
[2012-07-26 21:25:38 -0400] mattray: yes
[2012-07-26 21:25:40 -0400] jaypipes: sorry.. have to bear with me :)
[2012-07-26 21:26:28 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: OK, so how do you have multiple versions of OpenStack deployments handled by the same repo with librarian-chef?
[2012-07-26 21:27:33 -0400] mattray: sure, nothing's finalized
[2012-07-26 21:27:48 -0400] mattray: so right now, there's nothing for folsom
[2012-07-26 21:28:01 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: ah, ok, I'm not a huge fan of having a single cookbook handle multiple releases... I kind of feel that is what source control is for
[2012-07-26 21:28:31 -0400] mattray: I agree, but if it's the same cookbook you have less version control churn, perhaps understand your upgrades in place better
[2012-07-26 21:28:34 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: meaning a cookbook for glance in the stable/essex openstack/chef-repo would be for essex deployments, etc]
[2012-07-26 21:28:36 -0400] Aaton: jaypipes: I just started using librarian-chef. Before I was doing it with git submodules. You could create a git branch for folsom which would have a different Cheffile and Cheffile.lock then doing an librianian-chef install  would pullin the right cookbooks
[2012-07-26 21:28:44 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: that was my original goal
[2012-07-26 21:29:17 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: but not everyone is git-savvy enough
[2012-07-26 21:29:24 -0400] jaypipes: Aaton: so your solution is kinda a mix of the approaches mattray and I have been discussing?
[2012-07-26 21:29:40 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: yeah, Aaton's approach is where I'm leaning
[2012-07-26 21:30:03 -0400] mattray: well, unsure about essex vs. folsom branches
[2012-07-26 21:30:04 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I could go for that. seems a reasonable mix.
[2012-07-26 21:30:10 -0400] jaypipes: heh, ok
[2012-07-26 21:30:24 -0400] mattray: but librarian-chef would handle the cookbook dependencies
[2012-07-26 21:30:35 -0400] mattray: mixing community site & git as we evolve
[2012-07-26 21:30:47 -0400] mattray: I plan on upstreaming everything
[2012-07-26 21:30:52 -0400] jaypipes: is librarian-chef tightly integrated with the community site?
[2012-07-26 21:30:55 -0400] Aaton: yes. It keeps the problems of git submodules away and makes tracking which cookbooks your on easier. so far I'm happy with librarian-chef
[2012-07-26 21:31:05 -0400] mattray: yeah, it's gotten good traction
[2012-07-26 21:31:14 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: is librarian-chef tightly integrated with the community site?
[2012-07-26 21:31:17 -0400] mattray: yes
[2012-07-26 21:31:28 -0400] mattray: and/or github
[2012-07-26 21:31:32 -0400] jaypipes: i.e. we can't have librarian-chef pointing at chef.openstack.org? :)
[2012-07-26 21:31:48 -0400] mattray: oh
[2012-07-26 21:32:03 -0400] mattray: that's been discussed, open sourcing the community site
[2012-07-26 21:32:14 -0400] mattray: it's pretty tightly-coupled to opscode.com though
[2012-07-26 21:32:17 -0400] jaypipes: gotcha
[2012-07-26 21:32:20 -0400] mattray: so it's never gotten much priority
[2012-07-26 21:32:22 -0400] jaypipes: no worries, was just curious
[2012-07-26 21:32:30 -0400] Aaton: in that pastebin you can see the site 'http://community.opscode.com/api/v1' line will grab cookbooks from here unless defined with a :git => 'url'
[2012-07-26 21:32:47 -0400] mattray: but if the cookbooks are all tagged properly, community.opscode.com doesn't become a SPOF
[2012-07-26 21:33:27 -0400] mattray: Aaton: and that would make it easier to switch back and forth between patched cookbooks waiting to be upstreamed
[2012-07-26 21:33:48 -0400] jaypipes: ah, Aaton gotcha
[2012-07-26 21:33:57 -0400] Aaton: exactly. since I can point over to my own git or someone elses
[2012-07-26 21:34:27 -0400] mattray: the spiceweasel infrastructure.yml currently is dumb about git, but it also handles roles, data bags and environments
[2012-07-26 21:34:43 -0400] jaypipes: ok, lots of food for thought... I'll discuss with my colleague (retr0h) and see what's up.
[2012-07-26 21:34:53 -0400] jaypipes: in the meantime, I'm starving :) gonna grab some chow.
[2012-07-26 21:35:03 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: you're in Seattle?
[2012-07-26 21:36:09 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: Columbus Ohio
[2012-07-26 21:36:19 -0400] mattray: oh yeah, we've had this discussion :)
[2012-07-26 21:36:32 -0400] mattray: just trying to think who would be where and potentially do some Chef/OpenStack hackdays
[2012-07-26 21:36:50 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: most of my team is in L.A...
[2012-07-26 21:37:08 -0400] mattray: there may be something there soon, still working on details
[2012-07-26 21:37:15 -0400] jaypipes: coolio.
[2012-07-26 21:37:19 -0400] jaypipes: ok, off to eat :)
[2012-07-26 22:32:52 -0400] mattray: rpedde: do you guys have tickets or pull requests for the changes made in https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/rsyslog ?
[2012-07-26 22:33:07 -0400] mattray: lots of changes, wondering about upstreaming
