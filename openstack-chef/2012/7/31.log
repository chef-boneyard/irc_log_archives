[2012-07-31 17:23:46 -0400] japage: hi
[2012-07-31 17:31:43 -0400] mattray: howdy
[2012-07-31 17:33:09 -0400] mattray: automating my second network for nova testing
[2012-07-31 17:35:51 -0400] japage: ahh, need any help? anything i can do?
[2012-07-31 17:38:27 -0400] mattray: I've got glance and keystone up and cleaned up a bit
[2012-07-31 17:38:46 -0400] mattray: if you want to look around, add some tests or documentation that would be worthwhile
[2012-07-31 17:38:59 -0400] mattray: without nova it's kinda boring
[2012-07-31 17:39:14 -0400] japage: ok, sounds good
[2012-07-31 17:39:17 -0400] mattray: but I'll backfill testing and docs more once I can test more
[2012-07-31 17:39:40 -0400] mattray: github.com/mattray/openstack-chef-repo is still the starting place
[2012-07-31 17:39:47 -0400] japage: ok
[2012-07-31 17:39:50 -0400] mattray: github.com/mattray/glance and github.com/mattray/keystone
[2012-07-31 17:40:13 -0400] mattray: it's essex on ubuntu 12.04 right now
[2012-07-31 17:40:43 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/mattray/openstack-chef-repo/blob/essex/TODO.org has my notes as I progress along
[2012-07-31 17:42:02 -0400] mattray: I should probably push that daily
[2012-07-31 17:42:23 -0400] mattray: just my raw org-mode notes
[2012-07-31 17:43:29 -0400] wkelly: org-mode ftw
[2012-07-31 20:16:32 -0400] mattray: rpedde: ping
[2012-07-31 20:21:50 -0400] rpedde: mattray: pong
[2012-07-31 20:36:08 -0400] mattray: rpedde: what's with the mixing of db attribute sources here? https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/nova/blob/master/recipes/nova-common.rb#L66
[2012-07-31 20:38:42 -0400] rpedde: the db server is the node that has db ip, port, etc
[2012-07-31 20:39:01 -0400] rpedde: but it's the node that has the nova setup role that knows the nova db name, username, and password
[2012-07-31 20:39:16 -0400] rpedde: user should probably be nova_setup_info[....]
[2012-07-31 20:39:35 -0400] rpedde: hrm, and db_name
[2012-07-31 20:40:13 -0400] rpedde: bit of an oops, I think.
[2012-07-31 20:40:55 -0400] rpedde: yeah, I believe all the node["nova"]["db"]s should be nova_setup_info["db"]...
[2012-07-31 20:41:48 -0400] mattray: I hadn't realized how tightly coupled the roles and osops-utils were
[2012-07-31 20:42:36 -0400] rpedde: very
[2012-07-31 20:43:12 -0400] rpedde: anything that offers or consumes an ip based service at a minimum goes through there
[2012-07-31 20:44:26 -0400] rpedde: It's moderately ugly, but lets us change our strategy easily for loadbalancing services, or choosing to cache in a dbag or use the nifty new upcoming lean deep searches or whatever
[2012-07-31 20:44:29 -0400] mattray: rpedde: I'm adding a bit of debugging to osops-utils so it's more transparent
[2012-07-31 20:44:52 -0400] mattray: rpedde: the "partial searches" are already live on Hosted Chef
[2012-07-31 20:45:12 -0400] mattray: rpedde: of course, we won't require that in the cookbooks until open source chef server supports it
