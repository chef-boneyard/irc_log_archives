[2012-10-02 16:43:44 -0400] mattray: rpedde: wkelly: fixed rabbitmq to use the distro version, I'll send you my pull request for rabbitmq-openstack once it's released
[2012-10-02 17:24:42 -0400] rpedde: mattray: awesome, thx!
[2012-10-02 17:59:40 -0400] wkelly: mattray: thanks!!
[2012-10-02 19:53:13 -0400] mattray: Anyone around to help with a few hints on figuring out why my VMs just don't respond? No errors, no logs, no stack traces
[2012-10-02 19:54:09 -0400] mattray: if I can just get my VMs to be accessible I can push this code out
[2012-10-02 21:10:05 -0400] mattray: not sure how many times I've deployed today, but this is getting frustrating
[2012-10-02 21:14:38 -0400] urbanphoton: I'm working on the same thing, PXE setup across 34 servers, boot script installs Omnibus, runs client, I tell you if I figure out what's happening
[2012-10-02 21:16:29 -0400] mattray: urbanphoton: what does your network look like? Are you using my cookbooks?
[2012-10-02 21:16:51 -0400] mattray: I'm happy to debug your issues if I have any insight
[2012-10-02 21:17:11 -0400] mattray: nothing is complaining anymore, or I'm missing it. That's why I'm stumped
[2012-10-02 21:17:29 -0400] urbanphoton: Using your stuff pulled from your repos today, network is a head node with Internet access, PXE stack, and Chef
[2012-10-02 21:17:36 -0400] urbanphoton: Then a /16
[2012-10-02 21:18:20 -0400] mattray: urbanphoton: with your network defined in the Environment?
[2012-10-02 21:18:30 -0400] mattray: 2 networks?
[2012-10-02 21:18:37 -0400] urbanphoton: I've been trying to emulate a hand done install someone else in the office did which setup Floating IP's, but the cookbooks don't do that yet, so I'm just trying to get something to boot a VM
[2012-10-02 21:18:46 -0400] urbanphoton: Network defined in Enrivonment
[2012-10-02 21:18:55 -0400] urbanphoton: *Environment
[2012-10-02 21:18:58 -0400] mattray: sounds really close to what I have
[2012-10-02 21:19:01 -0400] urbanphoton: I normally can spell
[2012-10-02 21:19:47 -0400] mattray: well, I'm happy to trade gists, I'm doing another allinone install right now
[2012-10-02 21:20:02 -0400] mattray: with an ubuntu12.04 vm
[2012-10-02 21:20:03 -0400] urbanphoton: I can a deployment run going now, I'm going to try and load an image and boot once it's done
[2012-10-02 21:20:09 -0400] urbanphoton: *I have
[2012-10-02 21:20:52 -0400] mattray: do you see the glance-images role? that loads a locally cached image into glance
[2012-10-02 21:21:18 -0400] urbanphoton: Ah
[2012-10-02 21:22:49 -0400] mattray: so my run_list for my single node install is role[lab-base], recipe[udev::net], role[glance-images], role[allinone]
[2012-10-02 21:23:05 -0400] mattray: where lab-base and udev::net are coming from my lab-repo, providing basics
[2012-10-02 21:25:11 -0400] urbanphoton: I've got one server running role[single-controller] and five running role[single-compute], I'm going to add the glance role since that'll make the tests faster
[2012-10-02 21:25:50 -0400] mattray: yeah, I'm trying to get allinone working on 1 node, since I _used_ to have it working
[2012-10-02 21:25:59 -0400] mattray: and it worked with 2 nodes after that
[2012-10-02 21:35:13 -0400] mattray: hmmm this is odd
[2012-10-02 21:35:22 -0400] mattray: libvirt/qemu/networks/autostart/default.xml:  <ip address="192.168.122.1" netmask="255.255.255.0">
[2012-10-02 21:35:39 -0400] mattray: has a default network that is being used by dnsmasq...
[2012-10-02 21:35:47 -0400] mattray: which is different from mine
[2012-10-02 21:36:28 -0400] urbanphoton: It should be populated from MySQL
[2012-10-02 21:36:51 -0400] urbanphoton: At least as far as I've been able to tell
[2012-10-02 21:36:52 -0400] mattray: nova-manage network list
[2012-10-02 21:37:00 -0400] mattray: shows the network I want
[2012-10-02 21:39:55 -0400] mattray: killed dnsmasq, let's see what happens now
[2012-10-02 21:47:48 -0400] mattray: well, dnsmasq came back with the right network settings, but still can't reach my vms
[2012-10-02 21:48:00 -0400] mattray: they report ok, just can't see anything about them
[2012-10-02 21:48:20 -0400] mattray: nothing in /var/log/libvirt/qemu/ of interest
[2012-10-02 21:50:43 -0400] mattray: added TCP/22 to the security group and ICMP/-1 so I can reach them
[2012-10-02 21:50:52 -0400] mattray: the logs return empty when I click on them
[2012-10-02 21:57:49 -0400] urbanphoton: Been bouncing this to some co-workers, no one has seen that problem before on our OpenStack deployment
[2012-10-02 21:58:57 -0400] mattray: I think I may be on to something

[2012-10-02 22:09:41 -0400] mattray: somehow this dep was there at some point
[2012-10-02 22:09:47 -0400] mattray: let's see if adding it fixes it
[2012-10-02 22:11:26 -0400] urbanphoton: Good find, I'm looking for a similar error in my setup
[2012-10-02 22:13:03 -0400] mattray: that may have been it
[2012-10-02 22:13:31 -0400] mattray: well, maybe not
[2012-10-02 22:13:36 -0400] mattray: different error now
[2012-10-02 22:22:27 -0400] mattray: I did just stumble upon the fact that my amd boxes didn't have the kvm modules loaded
[2012-10-02 22:23:40 -0400] mattray: but this one is an Intel box
[2012-10-02 22:36:11 -0400] mattray: I'm about to head out, feel free to email me if you come across anything useful. I'll probably be back online later, but away from my lab
[2012-10-02 22:36:32 -0400] urbanphoton: I'm heading home as well, catch you online tomorrow
[2012-10-02 22:36:33 -0400] mattray: trying 1 last installation on my AMD boxes
[2012-10-02 22:37:41 -0400] urbanphoton: I stuck guestmount into the preseed file for my setup and I'm running another install to see if it helps
[2012-10-02 22:40:44 -0400] mattray: I added it to my boxes, haven't pushed it into the preseed yet since I saw comments about it not being necessary. I don't know what the issue is
