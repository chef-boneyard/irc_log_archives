[2012-10-09 18:36:41 -0400] rackerjoe: who's got two thumbs and thinks deleting /opt as part of package removal is a good idea?
[2012-10-09 18:36:46 -0400] wkelly: <---
[2012-10-09 18:36:52 -0400] wkelly: feature!
[2012-10-09 18:37:33 -0400] rackerjoe: might as well delete /tmp while you're at it
[2012-10-09 19:11:47 -0400] mattray: rackerjoe: that bug still there? What's the number?
[2012-10-09 19:27:27 -0400] rackerjoe: mattray: I don't know.  wkelly could have been lying to me
[2012-10-09 19:27:48 -0400] wkelly: mattray: I am not sure what the number is!  I just know dpkg -r means my /opt is gone
[2012-10-09 19:27:49 -0400] mattray: nah, the bug was there for uninstalling the omnibus installer
[2012-10-09 19:29:11 -0400] wkelly: on 10.14.4-2.ubuntu.11.04
[2012-10-09 19:30:48 -0400] wkelly: ah, here is the bug for 0.10.10
[2012-10-09 19:30:51 -0400] wkelly: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3172
[2012-10-09 19:31:35 -0400] wkelly: so not just an omnibus thing
[2012-10-09 20:44:57 -0400] mattray: wkelly: so it deletes /opt only if chef is the only thing there
[2012-10-09 20:45:27 -0400] mattray: if anything else gets put there, like say gems installed with chef_gem; the /opt gets left
[2012-10-09 20:47:25 -0400] wkelly: mattray: that is much better than the alternative but still makes my eyes water with tears of sadness
[2012-10-09 20:47:40 -0400] mattray: why, isn't that standard apt behavior?
[2012-10-09 20:47:56 -0400] mattray: delete directories installed by the package?
[2012-10-09 20:48:00 -0400] wkelly: it's not standard to delete /opt
[2012-10-09 20:48:19 -0400] mattray: is /opt standard?
[2012-10-09 20:48:24 -0400] wkelly: it's part of lsb
[2012-10-09 20:49:04 -0400] mattray: ok, that makes sense to leave it open, but the priority is probably much lower since it no longer appears to be whacking stuff willy-nilly. Potentially an fpm bug
[2012-10-09 20:50:30 -0400] wkelly: mattray: agreed!  it's definitely lower priority than it used to be
[2012-10-09 21:49:14 -0400] mattray: wkelly: where do you plan on getting CentOS images for https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/glance/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L49 from?
[2012-10-09 21:49:36 -0400] mattray: ie. are you going to get them from your Public Cloud brethren or do you know of a good public place?
[2012-10-09 21:50:15 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: https://github.com/mattray/glance/pull/2 :)
[2012-10-09 21:50:50 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: nice!
[2012-10-09 21:51:07 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: hope it's an easy one :)
[2012-10-09 21:52:16 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: I mentioned this to retr0h earlier, I'm going to push out what I have now as the first Essex revisions, then I'll take his pull request and yours to start iterating on them. Next week we can discuss how much we want to keep improving Essex vs. diving into Folsom
[2012-10-09 21:52:23 -0400] rackerjoe: mattray: centos image can be found at http://c250663.r63.cf1.rackcdn.com/centos60_x86_64.qcow2
[2012-10-09 21:52:37 -0400] rackerjoe: we build them with oz (https://github.com/rackerjoe/oz-image-build)
[2012-10-09 21:53:29 -0400] mattray: rackerjoe: excellent! We were just thinking about how to unify boxgrinder with test-kitchen and bento and openstack for ourselves, maybe this is a better approach
[2012-10-09 21:53:59 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: We are deploying the latest stable packages, which is Folsom...
[2012-10-09 21:54:30 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I think it's good to make the Folsom/trunk branches of the chef cookbook repositories sooner rather than later.
[2012-10-09 21:54:54 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: agreed, I'll have them before Monday
[2012-10-09 21:54:59 -0400] jaypipes: rock on.
[2012-10-09 21:57:15 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I think long-term (i.e. during Grizzly) it would be great to decouple more from osops-utils::ip_location in the OpenStack cookbooks -- just to make it a bit less dependent
[2012-10-09 21:57:46 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: but doing so in an iterative manner is best, of course.
[2012-10-09 21:58:15 -0400] mattray: yeah, now that I have a repeatable, consistently working install I can start iterating over it
[2012-10-09 21:58:48 -0400] mattray: I went down a rathole thinking networking was broken when really my glance image imports were messed up
[2012-10-09 21:59:09 -0400] mattray: getting continuous deployment on my own stuff will help
