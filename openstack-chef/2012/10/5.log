[2012-10-05 02:13:01 -0400] mattray: installing alamo under fusion, I must have a bad USB stick or something, it would never install on any machines
[2012-10-05 02:36:24 -0400] Diopter: mattray: Still having trouble?
[2012-10-05 02:36:43 -0400] mattray: yeah
[2012-10-05 02:36:51 -0400] mattray: I'm at home, so I don't have access to my lab
[2012-10-05 02:36:53 -0400] Diopter: Tell me what your setup is. I'm sure I can help
[2012-10-05 02:37:01 -0400] Diopter: You're using Fusion on your Mac, yes?
[2012-10-05 02:37:37 -0400] mattray: now I am
[2012-10-05 02:38:07 -0400] mattray: doing an all-in-one of alamo 1.0.1, bridged networking
[2012-10-05 02:38:38 -0400] mattray: I wanted to get alamo up so I could see what I was doing wrong in my own installations wrong, figured a working install would help debug
[2012-10-05 02:39:00 -0400] Diopter: Sounds good. It's pretty easy, but there's some weird caveats
[2012-10-05 02:39:20 -0400] Diopter: Are you following any of the guides in the knowledgebase?
[2012-10-05 02:39:30 -0400] Diopter: Also, Fusion 4 or 5?
[2012-10-05 02:40:10 -0400] mattray: 5
[2012-10-05 02:40:19 -0400] mattray: I walked through the post-install.sh trying to figure out what I was doing wrong
[2012-10-05 02:40:31 -0400] mattray: AFAIK it's something about the br100
[2012-10-05 02:40:36 -0400] Diopter: Cool.
[2012-10-05 02:40:44 -0400] mattray: ahh, looks like alamo is coming up
[2012-10-05 02:40:57 -0400] Diopter: So... in 5, you can enable the nested virt in the VM settings UI
[2012-10-05 02:41:10 -0400] Diopter: It's called something like "Provide hypervisor services to guest" or whatnot
[2012-10-05 02:41:23 -0400] Diopter: Which will be needed for the Alamo installer's kvmcheck to pass
[2012-10-05 02:42:04 -0400] mattray: yeah, enabled
[2012-10-05 02:42:13 -0400] mattray: that's in http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/installing-rackspace-private-cloud-vmware-fusion
[2012-10-05 02:42:29 -0400] mattray: well, at least the settings are in the vmx
[2012-10-05 02:42:39 -0400] Diopter: Right, that's required for 4
[2012-10-05 02:42:44 -0400] Diopter: 5 has it right in the settings UI, is what I'm saying
[2012-10-05 02:42:50 -0400] Diopter: Makes it easier. Same effect, though
[2012-10-05 02:43:11 -0400] mattray: hrmmm that failed
[2012-10-05 02:43:23 -0400] Diopter: What did?
[2012-10-05 02:43:27 -0400] mattray: rebooted and nothing running
[2012-10-05 02:43:41 -0400] Diopter: The installer rebooted?
[2012-10-05 02:43:50 -0400] mattray: yeah
[2012-10-05 02:44:04 -0400] mattray: no /var/log/post-install.log
[2012-10-05 02:44:32 -0400] Diopter: So, to verify
[2012-10-05 02:44:51 -0400] Diopter: You saw the Nascar logo splash screen when the installer started... got asked what role you want, IP info, users, passwords, etc
[2012-10-05 02:45:01 -0400] Diopter: And it spent a few minutes installing... then rebooted
[2012-10-05 02:45:06 -0400] mattray: yup
[2012-10-05 02:45:13 -0400] Diopter: Interesting
[2012-10-05 02:45:50 -0400] Diopter: Does /opt/rpcs exist?
[2012-10-05 02:45:58 -0400] mattray: nope
[2012-10-05 02:46:13 -0400] Diopter: How did you obtain the .iso?
[2012-10-05 02:46:32 -0400] mattray: website, then email with the link
[2012-10-05 02:46:49 -0400] mattray: alamo-v1.0.1.iso
[2012-10-05 02:47:11 -0400] Diopter: And it's ~1.9GB?
[2012-10-05 02:47:15 -0400] mattray: yep
[2012-10-05 02:47:22 -0400] mattray: it's got all the rpcs stuff on it
[2012-10-05 02:47:36 -0400] Diopter: Ok
[2012-10-05 02:47:39 -0400] mattray: I pulled the cirros and precise images out for my install
[2012-10-05 02:47:51 -0400] Diopter: You might have made the installer scripts fail
[2012-10-05 02:47:57 -0400] Diopter: And therefore not copy/mkdir anything
[2012-10-05 02:47:59 -0400] mattray: and read through the post-install.sh trying to figure out my own installation
[2012-10-05 02:48:02 -0400] mattray: right
[2012-10-05 02:48:08 -0400] Diopter: So
[2012-10-05 02:48:16 -0400] mattray: I can try again
[2012-10-05 02:48:23 -0400] Diopter: First place to modify, if you want to make it work this way...
[2012-10-05 02:48:29 -0400] Diopter: Is late_command.sh
[2012-10-05 02:48:48 -0400] Diopter: Which is where the ubuntu installer initial setup and copying is done
[2012-10-05 02:49:08 -0400] Diopter: Although
[2012-10-05 02:49:17 -0400] Diopter: I think I changed it to use filename globs last...
[2012-10-05 02:49:25 -0400] Diopter: So it shouldn't really fail just because you removed some glance images
[2012-10-05 02:49:45 -0400] Diopter: Need to figure out why it's not making /opt/rpcs and dropping the big files into it
[2012-10-05 02:50:37 -0400] mattray: copying the contents of the /opt/rpcs over to the VM via the /mnt/hgfs
[2012-10-05 02:51:23 -0400] Diopter: lol
[2012-10-05 02:51:33 -0400] Diopter: Doing it wrong. But might as well ;P
[2012-10-05 02:52:47 -0400] mattray: Diopter: it would probably be more productive if we got my lab working as opposed to hacking up something to work with fusion
[2012-10-05 02:54:11 -0400] mattray: there's so much conflicting documentation around how the networks should be configured
[2012-10-05 02:55:14 -0400] Diopter: Nonsense. I'm the source of truth on how it should be
[2012-10-05 02:55:23 -0400] Diopter: Ignore the docs for now
[2012-10-05 02:55:44 -0400] Diopter: Any failure on documentation is probably my fault in not communicating it clearly enough to Karen/Anne/etc
[2012-10-05 02:56:12 -0400] mattray: ok, you're familiar with how the environment hold the configuration and gets applied by the cookbooks?
[2012-10-05 02:56:22 -0400] Diopter: Yes
[2012-10-05 02:56:30 -0400] mattray: lemme show you mine
[2012-10-05 02:56:52 -0400] Diopter: The functions script should make it relatively clear how we're mapping our rpcs.cfg values to the environment
[2012-10-05 02:57:31 -0400] mattray: yeah, I tried to get it working with 1 NIC instead of the 2 I have
[2012-10-05 02:57:52 -0400] Diopter: All-in-one?
[2012-10-05 02:58:56 -0400] mattray: I've tried allinone and single-controller and single-compute
[2012-10-05 02:59:12 -0400] mattray: here's today's failure: https://github.com/mattray/openstack-chef-repo/blob/essex/environments/production.rb
[2012-10-05 02:59:29 -0400] mattray: fixed network 192.168.100.0/24
[2012-10-05 02:59:39 -0400] mattray: eth0 is dhcp-assigned on 10.0.111.x
[2012-10-05 03:01:18 -0400] mattray: my current /etc/network/interfaces https://github.com/mattray/lab-repo/blob/master/cookbooks/labsetup/recipes/default.rb#L21
[2012-10-05 03:02:47 -0400] mattray: I grabbed the disable_virbr0 from the post-install.sh
[2012-10-05 03:03:52 -0400] mattray: but I expect something in the config_interfaces and/or the setup_iptables I'm doing wrong
[2012-10-05 03:04:31 -0400] mattray: my VMs all popped up on the public network, which had pxe booting enabled so they would never boot
[2012-10-05 03:04:55 -0400] mattray: I'd see them making requests on my router, instead of getting dhcp from dnsmasq
[2012-10-05 03:05:54 -0400] mattray: and VNC would connect to them, so I could see them just fail on pxe booting
[2012-10-05 03:10:54 -0400] mattray: I'm happy to turn eth1 back on tomorrow, I thought simplifying my network would make it work
[2012-10-05 03:12:32 -0400] Diopter: HRm
[2012-10-05 03:13:15 -0400] Diopter: Give me a minute, got busy for a few
[2012-10-05 03:13:37 -0400] mattray: no problem
[2012-10-05 03:14:02 -0400] mattray: if you're busy, I can hit you up in the morning
[2012-10-05 03:14:13 -0400] mattray: and then I can actually fix machines
[2012-10-05 03:18:43 -0400] Diopter: Maybe that'd be better.
[2012-10-05 03:18:53 -0400] Diopter: I can definitely get you going.
[2012-10-05 03:19:03 -0400] Diopter: The networking bits of how all this works are my actual job :P
[2012-10-05 03:20:01 -0400] Diopter: I'm out then. Catch you tomorrow
[2012-10-05 03:20:12 -0400] mattray: thanks a lot, I figure once I can lock down a reproducible deployment, I can start fixing things for you guys :)
[2012-10-05 03:20:22 -0400] mattray: talk to you tomorrow, thanks!
[2012-10-05 03:27:54 -0400] mattray: Diopter: I forgot to unclick the "Easy Install" option FWIW
[2012-10-05 14:55:07 -0400] japage: anything I can do to help you guys troubleshoot networking?
[2012-10-05 15:01:49 -0400] mattray: I'm rebuilding everything right now
[2012-10-05 15:12:06 -0400] japage: ive never quite seen bonding devices set up the way you have them, but I am anything but a networking expert
[2012-10-05 15:12:19 -0400] japage: s/bond/bridge/
[2012-10-05 15:15:49 -0400] mattray: trying to speed up my installs a bit, pushing more into the preseed. I seemed to have made a dumb choice of switching ":create_if_missing" to ":create" for the omnibus installers. It's not getting proper md5 hashes apparently and downloading them repeatedly
[2012-10-05 15:16:00 -0400] mattray: which is delaying my reinstallations
[2012-10-05 15:16:06 -0400] japage: hmm
[2012-10-05 15:16:36 -0400] mattray: or maybe it just didn't have hashes in place for them, testing that logic
[2012-10-05 15:16:46 -0400] japage: ill be back in a bit
[2012-10-05 15:21:34 -0400] Apsu`: mattray: I'm available today, btw
[2012-10-05 15:21:58 -0400] Apsu`: Doing standup atm, but then we can work the nets
[2012-10-05 15:22:21 -0400] mattray: thanks, I'll try to get the machines to a good state for testing asap
[2012-10-05 15:23:16 -0400] Apsu`: np
[2012-10-05 15:34:14 -0400] japage: does spiceweasel require root to run?
[2012-10-05 15:34:54 -0400] mattray: nope
[2012-10-05 15:35:14 -0400] mattray: whatever user you use for "knife"
[2012-10-05 15:35:42 -0400] japage: i must have installed it wrong
[2012-10-05 15:47:46 -0400] mattray: Apsu`: ok, 4 boxes empty and ready for testing
[2012-10-05 15:49:56 -0400] mattray:  etc/network/interfaces: https://gist.github.com/3840639
[2012-10-05 15:50:24 -0400] mattray: environment: https://github.com/mattray/openstack-chef-repo/blob/essex/environments/production.rb
[2012-10-05 15:53:57 -0400] Apsu`: mattray: kk
[2012-10-05 15:54:23 -0400] mattray: I was going to put the allinone role on the fastest box and see what happens
[2012-10-05 15:55:26 -0400] mattray: as you can see from the environment, it's currently keeping everything on eth0
[2012-10-05 15:55:42 -0400] Apsu`: Right
[2012-10-05 15:55:48 -0400] mattray: eth0: 10.0.111.0/24 eth1: 10.0.200.0/24
[2012-10-05 15:56:09 -0400] mattray: fixed_network is 192.168.100/24
[2012-10-05 15:56:20 -0400] Apsu`: Right
[2012-10-05 15:56:46 -0400] mattray: the box "hypnotoad" is 10.0.111.3 and serving up pxe booting and cached images
[2012-10-05 15:57:07 -0400] mattray: 10.0.111.1 is a dd-wrt router
[2012-10-05 15:57:18 -0400] mattray: 10.0.200.1 is a dd-wrt
[2012-10-05 15:57:24 -0400] mattray: both serving up dhcp
[2012-10-05 15:57:40 -0400] mattray: 10.0.111.1 has public internet access
[2012-10-05 15:58:55 -0400] mattray: so I'm kicking off the allinone role now on 10.0.111.9
[2012-10-05 15:59:08 -0400] mattray: aka, "crushinator" :)
[2012-10-05 15:59:11 -0400] Apsu`: kk
[2012-10-05 15:59:14 -0400] Apsu`: lawlz
[2012-10-05 15:59:49 -0400] mattray: all Futurama names here
[2012-10-05 16:00:46 -0400] mattray: http://www.flickr.com/photos/mray/5815381617/in/photostream/
[2012-10-05 16:03:19 -0400] Apsu`: Fun fun
[2012-10-05 16:11:45 -0400] mattray: ok, chef-client run finished
[2012-10-05 16:12:02 -0400] mattray: logged into dashboard
[2012-10-05 16:12:26 -0400] mattray: precise image launched
[2012-10-05 16:13:09 -0400] mattray: lol, looks like it just disconnected itself from the network
[2012-10-05 16:13:29 -0400] mattray: logging in manually, I bet it's a br100
[2012-10-05 16:15:12 -0400] mattray: neither br100 or eth0 have an ethernet port
[2012-10-05 16:15:20 -0400] mattray: err, IP address
[2012-10-05 16:16:54 -0400] Apsu`: Yeah, I think your issue is in the "public" nova network
[2012-10-05 16:17:12 -0400] mattray: oh yeah?
[2012-10-05 16:17:20 -0400] Apsu`: Just a sec
[2012-10-05 16:17:21 -0400] mattray: not the contents of /etc/network/interfaces?
[2012-10-05 16:18:35 -0400] mattray: looking at post-install.sh and functions.sh, I thought I needed to add
[2012-10-05 16:18:36 -0400] mattray:     bridge_ports $([ $net_private_iface = $net_public_iface ] && echo none || echo $net_private_iface)
[2012-10-05 16:18:36 -0400] mattray: auto $net_bridge
[2012-10-05 16:18:36 -0400] mattray: iface $net_bridge inet manual
[2012-10-05 16:19:08 -0400] Apsu`: Actually no, your public network is fine. I was distracted when looking at which network you had in ipv4_cidr
[2012-10-05 16:19:40 -0400] Apsu`: You Don't have to add the bridge yourself. That's one of the things post-install is doing for you.
[2012-10-05 16:20:25 -0400] mattray: right, but I'm not using the post-install.sh directly
[2012-10-05 16:20:33 -0400] Apsu`: Why aren't you, exactly?
[2012-10-05 16:20:40 -0400] Apsu`: It covers a lot of ground and corner cases
[2012-10-05 16:20:54 -0400] mattray: heh, because I'm using the cookbooks directly
[2012-10-05 16:21:51 -0400] mattray: so I need to make sure that what the post-install.sh is doing is captured in some set of cookbooks for deploying openstack
[2012-10-05 16:22:06 -0400] Apsu`: Fun fun.
[2012-10-05 16:22:08 -0400] Apsu`: Well
[2012-10-05 16:22:15 -0400] mattray: because not everyone will use Alamo :)
[2012-10-05 16:22:28 -0400] Apsu`: Our test case has always been using statically configured interfaces, for one thing.
[2012-10-05 16:23:04 -0400] mattray: I can make them static
[2012-10-05 16:23:09 -0400] Apsu`: The bridge_ports $( ... ) logic is based on having separate public/private NICs
[2012-10-05 16:23:14 -0400] Apsu`: Vs a single NIC for both
[2012-10-05 16:23:35 -0400] mattray: right, I went to a single NIC because I thought it would be easier, I'm happy to split that back out
[2012-10-05 16:23:58 -0400] mattray: put 'management' back on 10.0.200.0/24?
[2012-10-05 16:24:23 -0400] mattray: and 'nova' there too? (eth1)
[2012-10-05 16:24:37 -0400] Apsu`: It is easier to use a single, actually
[2012-10-05 16:24:43 -0400] Apsu`: So
[2012-10-05 16:25:42 -0400] Apsu`: What Alamo is doing currently is setting all three osops networks = public network
[2012-10-05 16:26:12 -0400] mattray: yeah
[2012-10-05 16:26:14 -0400] Apsu`: Because it'll be known to exist when running the cookbooks.
[2012-10-05 16:27:52 -0400] mattray: but looking at the config_interfaces, it looks like it sets up a br100
[2012-10-05 16:29:16 -0400] Apsu`: Right. It does.
[2012-10-05 16:29:47 -0400] Apsu`: In the single-NIC case, it'll be auto br#, inet manual, bridge_ports none, before the cookbooks run
[2012-10-05 16:30:24 -0400] mattray: like this?
[2012-10-05 16:30:26 -0400] mattray: auto br100
[2012-10-05 16:30:27 -0400] mattray: iface br100 inet manual
[2012-10-05 16:30:27 -0400] mattray:     bridge_ports eth0
[2012-10-05 16:31:42 -0400] mattray: bridge_ports none or eth0?
[2012-10-05 16:33:13 -0400] Apsu`: none, for single-nic
[2012-10-05 16:33:31 -0400] Apsu`: You don't want to bridge it yet, because it's going to remove the IP on eth0, and not IP br100 for you
[2012-10-05 16:33:36 -0400] mattray: ok, fixing that and restarting networking, then re-runnign chef-client
[2012-10-05 16:33:37 -0400] Apsu`: (nova does that)
[2012-10-05 16:34:03 -0400] Apsu`: You should have your desire IP on eth0, br100 should exist and have nothing in it and no IP on it, before you spawn an instance.
[2012-10-05 16:34:21 -0400] Apsu`: OR you should have your interface in br100, no IP on that interface, and the appropriate IP on br100
[2012-10-05 16:34:24 -0400] Apsu`: One of the two.
[2012-10-05 16:37:43 -0400] Apsu`: Once you spawn an instance, nova-network's going to move eth0 into br100, and move the IP as well
[2012-10-05 16:37:53 -0400] mattray: right
[2012-10-05 16:40:24 -0400] mattray: ok, back where I was yesterday
[2012-10-05 16:40:30 -0400] Apsu`: Which is?
[2012-10-05 16:40:35 -0400] mattray: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14483515/Screenshots/nqnp.png
[2012-10-05 16:40:51 -0400] Apsu`: .. I'm getting lunched
[2012-10-05 16:40:56 -0400] Apsu`: I'll be back in a bit.
[2012-10-05 16:41:18 -0400] mattray: and here's ifconfig: https://gist.github.com/8cfd927f8eb0e60d36ac
[2012-10-05 16:41:24 -0400] mattray: Apsu`: ok, lunching too then
[2012-10-05 18:20:45 -0400] mattray: still nothing.
[2012-10-05 18:21:16 -0400] mattray: I don't see anything in the setup_iptables that look interesting
[2012-10-05 18:35:48 -0400] mattray: Apsu`: does it matter when I do nova-manage network list the network's Project is 'none'?
[2012-10-05 19:00:11 -0400] Apsu`: mattray: After the cookbooks have runnerated?
[2012-10-05 19:00:41 -0400] mattray: they've run multiple times. I'm going to see if changing the br100 off of eth0 helps
[2012-10-05 19:02:06 -0400] Apsu`: You should totally see the network :P
[2012-10-05 19:02:19 -0400] mattray: network/interfaces was managed by chef, undid the addition of the br100
[2012-10-05 19:02:32 -0400] Apsu`: ok
[2012-10-05 19:09:09 -0400] mattray: hmmm some kind of progress I guess
[2012-10-05 19:09:27 -0400] mattray: no longer hitting my dhcp server for a pxe install
[2012-10-05 19:11:08 -0400] Apsu`: lol
[2012-10-05 19:11:12 -0400] mattray: but still failing as seen via VNC
[2012-10-05 19:12:23 -0400] mattray: the images I'm using were pulled out from the alamo ISO
[2012-10-05 19:15:44 -0400] Apsu`: I'm real curious what exactly you're doing :P
[2012-10-05 19:17:34 -0400] mattray: me too
[2012-10-05 19:17:43 -0400] mattray: it's killing me, I've been blocked by this for days
[2012-10-05 19:18:01 -0400] Apsu`: The screenshot you sent me earlier showed that it couldn't boot from your disk
[2012-10-05 19:18:04 -0400] Apsu`: And tried PXE instead
[2012-10-05 19:18:11 -0400] Apsu`: Which confuses me, since that's After the installation completes, ostensibly
[2012-10-05 19:18:28 -0400] Apsu`: How are you skipping post-install.sh getting run? Are you not even using our installation pieces? Are you using your own preseed?
[2012-10-05 19:22:36 -0400] mattray: I'm using my own preseed
[2012-10-05 19:22:58 -0400] mattray: is there anything weird in your preseed?
[2012-10-05 19:23:12 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/mattray/pxe_dust/blob/master/templates/default/ubuntu-preseed.cfg.erb
[2012-10-05 19:23:28 -0400] mattray: I didn't see a custom preseed file on the ISO
[2012-10-05 19:23:59 -0400] Apsu`: Well we do a bunch of setup work for the target system...
[2012-10-05 19:24:12 -0400] Apsu`: You're using your own late_command and everything
[2012-10-05 19:24:30 -0400] Apsu`: Also, are you actually trying To boot off pxe for this deployment?
[2012-10-05 19:24:48 -0400] mattray: no, I definitely don't want that
[2012-10-05 19:25:11 -0400] mattray: yeah, but I went through your late command to make sure I had everything there
[2012-10-05 19:25:27 -0400] mattray: you think I'm missing a package or something?
[2012-10-05 19:25:50 -0400] Apsu`: I'm not sure. What's confusing is that it said it can't boot off the drive after the install finished.
[2012-10-05 19:25:50 -0400] mattray: I mean, I've got the list of .debs bundled with alamo, I can load those all on my machine
[2012-10-05 19:26:04 -0400] Apsu`: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14483515/Screenshots/nqnp.png in this
[2012-10-05 19:26:12 -0400] Apsu`: Was ^ after the installer finished and rebooted?
[2012-10-05 19:26:37 -0400] mattray: oh yeah
[2012-10-05 19:26:53 -0400] mattray: well, I've never gotten alamo to work on anything other than vmware
[2012-10-05 19:27:01 -0400] Apsu`: You're doing bare metal currently?
[2012-10-05 19:27:27 -0400] mattray: I'm using the alamo cookbooks on my bare metal install
[2012-10-05 19:27:35 -0400] Apsu`: Ok.
[2012-10-05 19:27:57 -0400] mattray: and I've followed the post-install.sh to see if there was something I was leaving out, and I just don't see it
[2012-10-05 19:27:57 -0400] Apsu`: Well... I'd probably start by checking out tty4 when your installer is moving forward.
[2012-10-05 19:28:09 -0400] Apsu`: Wondering if your partman/bootloader setup isn't right in the preseed
[2012-10-05 19:28:48 -0400] Apsu`: Comparing
[2012-10-05 19:29:05 -0400] mattray: machines boot up and install just fine, I just switched to lvm because there were errors about allocating a filesystem
[2012-10-05 19:29:18 -0400] mattray: I can switch back
[2012-10-05 19:29:19 -0400] Apsu`: Well
[2012-10-05 19:29:32 -0400] Apsu`: It doesn't boot after you finish the install, right?
[2012-10-05 19:29:37 -0400] Apsu`: That's The issue you're stuck at?
[2012-10-05 19:30:02 -0400] mattray: the issue I'm stuck at right now is when I go through the dashboard and try to launch a VM, the VM tries to pxe boot
[2012-10-05 19:30:11 -0400] mattray: everything else appears to install fine
[2012-10-05 19:30:32 -0400] mattray: nova-manage service list is happy
[2012-10-05 19:30:43 -0400] mattray: dashboard is up
[2012-10-05 19:30:48 -0400] Apsu`: Ok, so
[2012-10-05 19:31:18 -0400] mattray: var/log/nova/ logs are pretty clean except for nova-volume
[2012-10-05 19:31:22 -0400] Apsu`: I was confused originally at the screenshot. I thought perhaps you were running the whole thing in an instance. Now I see wtf you're actually doing.
[2012-10-05 19:31:28 -0400] mattray: oh sorry
[2012-10-05 19:31:31 -0400] Apsu`: You've got a bare-metal install, using your preseed, and it boots up fine
[2012-10-05 19:31:35 -0400] Apsu`: Cookbooks run fine
[2012-10-05 19:31:36 -0400] mattray: yup
[2012-10-05 19:31:37 -0400] Apsu`: Instance spawns
[2012-10-05 19:31:39 -0400] mattray: yup
[2012-10-05 19:31:43 -0400] Apsu`: But it wants to PXE and doesn't make a bootable drive
[2012-10-05 19:31:49 -0400] mattray: right
[2012-10-05 19:31:53 -0400] Apsu`: Ok!
[2012-10-05 19:32:08 -0400] Apsu`: So, the only reason it's falling back to the PXE option ROM is because it's not getting a bootable drive
[2012-10-05 19:32:13 -0400] Apsu`: Which tells me your image is fuxed :P
[2012-10-05 19:32:32 -0400] mattray: but I pulled them straight out of the alamo ISO and scp'd them to my box
[2012-10-05 19:32:41 -0400] mattray: and wouldn't glance complain?
[2012-10-05 19:32:49 -0400] mattray: I'm happy to nuke the images
[2012-10-05 19:33:30 -0400] Apsu`: Well
[2012-10-05 19:33:41 -0400] Apsu`: I would expect glance to complain, I would expect nova not to launch it
[2012-10-05 19:33:44 -0400] Apsu`: But it is, and yet... it can't boot
[2012-10-05 19:33:54 -0400] Apsu`: So there's certainly Something wrong with that process.
[2012-10-05 19:34:17 -0400] Apsu`: I'm very unconvinced it's remotely related to networking, at least for the first step of getting it to boot the image.
[2012-10-05 19:34:55 -0400] Apsu`: Have you checked all the relevant logs? YOu said the nova logs are pretty clean... maybe you should check out libvirt logs, syslog, see if the disk is full, check load, dmesg, etc
[2012-10-05 19:35:12 -0400] mattray: md5sums match between inside the mounted ISO and the machine mirroring the images
[2012-10-05 19:35:27 -0400] mattray: libvirt logs are empty
[2012-10-05 19:37:08 -0400] Apsu`: What's in /var/lib/nova/instances/instance-00000001, or whichever number it gave it/them
[2012-10-05 19:37:16 -0400] Apsu`: And what sizes
[2012-10-05 19:37:53 -0400] mattray: I've been using m1.tinies
[2012-10-05 19:38:03 -0400] mattray: all deleted right now, launching a new one
[2012-10-05 19:40:31 -0400] mattray: here's the libvirt instance log https://gist.github.com/8bc8edae147aa2626300
[2012-10-05 19:41:37 -0400] Apsu`: Looks... about as expected
[2012-10-05 19:42:35 -0400] Apsu`: Do you have a disk, kernel and ramdisk file in there?
[2012-10-05 19:44:56 -0400] mattray: where?
[2012-10-05 19:45:06 -0400] mattray: in the /var/log/libvirt/qemu?
[2012-10-05 19:45:22 -0400] mattray: nothing there but instance-xxx.logs
[2012-10-05 19:51:06 -0400] Apsu`: No, /var/lib/nova/instance/instance*
[2012-10-05 19:51:17 -0400] Apsu`: There should be 5-6 files in there

[2012-10-05 21:11:51 -0400] mattray: I owe you beers, and not just the free kind at the various OpenStack parties
[2012-10-05 21:12:36 -0400] Apsu`: haha. Sounds good sir.
[2012-10-05 21:13:13 -0400] mattray: on to the next big openstack component Swift
[2012-10-05 21:13:21 -0400] Apsu`: yeehaw
[2012-10-05 21:13:27 -0400] Apsu`: That's a fun one I'm sure
[2012-10-05 21:13:34 -0400] mattray: how soon until you guys are jumping on Folsom?
[2012-10-05 21:13:41 -0400] mattray: rpedde: ^^
[2012-10-05 21:14:05 -0400] mattray: I just got an email about getting Swift up and he was interested in working with the Folsom release
[2012-10-05 21:15:01 -0400] mattray: I bet it's safe to mix Folsom Swift with Essex Nova
[2012-10-05 21:15:28 -0400] mattray: since Swift is pretty stable and relatively conservative
[2012-10-05 21:27:35 -0400] Apsu`: Probably, but I personally don't know.
[2012-10-05 21:35:34 -0400] rpedde: mattray: we're poking around on it already in some test branches
[2012-10-05 21:36:02 -0400] mattray: does that sound like a reasonable assumption, to just ahead to Folsom?
[2012-10-05 21:36:05 -0400] rpedde: mattray: was going to ask what the prevailing wisdom was on how to do targeting against folsom/essex
[2012-10-05 21:36:28 -0400] mattray: well, there are already a few people jumping on it
[2012-10-05 21:37:15 -0400] rpedde: mattray: yeah, the swift stuff doesn't really change haven't had any problems with different versions once past the keystone debacle
[2012-10-05 21:37:16 -0400] mattray: I'd just as soon document what now works in Essex and jump to Folsom myself
[2012-10-05 21:37:47 -0400] mattray: now that I have something working (thanks again Apsu`) I can start cleaning things up and refactoring
[2012-10-05 21:38:20 -0400] rpedde: tag as working in essex and work toward folsom in head?
[2012-10-05 21:38:31 -0400] mattray: I was going to merge my essex branch to master, push to opscode and the community site and start working folsom on master
[2012-10-05 21:38:34 -0400] mattray: yes
[2012-10-05 21:38:39 -0400] rpedde: yeah
[2012-10-05 21:38:39 -0400] Apsu`: mattray: You betcha
[2012-10-05 21:39:10 -0400] rpedde: seems right to me
