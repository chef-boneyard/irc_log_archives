[2012-10-10 18:21:51 -0400] japage: I am sure there are some inaccuracies in this presentation I just gave, however, If it helps anyone else: http://prezi.com/cjoebupahw3o/chef/
[2012-10-10 18:22:03 -0400] japage: its an overview of chef, and the openstack repo
[2012-10-10 18:58:51 -0400] mattray: japage: I like your presentation, good stuff

[2012-10-10 19:13:39 -0400] japage: cool, did i make any huge mistakes?
[2012-10-10 19:13:53 -0400] japage: also, feel free if this helps you guys out to reuse it
[2012-10-10 19:14:51 -0400] japage: I just gave an hour long presentation (with demo deploying a simple cookbook, and then the all in one stack) to an IBM internal call on openstack's architecture
[2012-10-10 19:16:49 -0400] japage: so hopefully that will drum up some more support at ibm for chef/openstack-chef-repo
[2012-10-10 19:18:06 -0400] mattray: japage: you going to be in San Diego next week?
[2012-10-10 19:18:16 -0400] mattray: (I've already asked that haven't I?)
[2012-10-10 19:19:37 -0400] mattray: japage: nothing jumped out at me, I'd love to get you more and more updates for your deck. Especially as I get things pushed out of my own repos into Opscode's
[2012-10-10 19:21:03 -0400] japage: mattray: no, I wont be in san diego unfortunatly. I am investigating ways of tele-ing in somehow, but I havent been able to really.
[2012-10-10 19:21:45 -0400] japage: mattray: sure, ill be happy to push any updates you want into the deck, also, if this format works well conceptually, I can try to expand it into more details/documentation, etc
[2012-10-10 19:23:24 -0400] japage: and, I know anyone can fork a presentation on prezi, and I think I can also push out edit invites to this prezi as well, if you wanted
[2012-10-10 19:27:43 -0400] mattray: just signed up for an account
[2012-10-10 19:32:49 -0400] japage: I just cleaned up the openstack-chef-repo bubbles, removed a lot of duplication and put more specific information in
[2012-10-10 19:33:08 -0400] japage: what is your account name? mattray?
