[2012-10-26 02:25:42 -0400] bitsmart: I found a issue Downloading EC2 Credentials on the web site. I resolved the issue by adding nova::nova-cert to the node. I'm trying to figure out if that recipe should be in a role. if so which one. I'm still new to Openstack.
[2012-10-26 17:14:11 -0400] retr0h: mattray: .... ? :)
[2012-10-26 17:15:02 -0400] mattray: howdy. Digging out from under 2 weeks of travel
[2012-10-26 17:15:35 -0400] retr0h: hey! :)
[2012-10-26 17:15:37 -0400] retr0h: any idea how to knife node create, and setting the chef_environment at the same time?
[2012-10-26 17:15:48 -0400] mattray: after I clear my email backlog and book a hotel for NYC, I'll hit up retr0h and jaypipes' pull requests
[2012-10-26 17:15:55 -0400] jaypipes: no worries
[2012-10-26 17:16:05 -0400] mattray: retr0h: -E is the environment argument
[2012-10-26 17:16:43 -0400] mattray: knife node create -h
[2012-10-26 17:17:04 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: we are using node from file...
[2012-10-26 17:17:18 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: and apparently the -E arg is ignored in that case.
[2012-10-26 17:17:29 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: and a chef_environment key in the JSON is also ignored.
[2012-10-26 17:17:35 -0400] mattray: hrmm.
[2012-10-26 17:17:47 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: at the very least those are bugs, lemme look
[2012-10-26 17:19:23 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h, mattray: and when just trying to set the environment using CLI:
[2012-10-26 17:19:23 -0400] jaypipes: jpipes@uberbox:~/repos/att-cloud/substructure$ knife node edit c1r1.dal2.tfoundry.com -d -E production
[2012-10-26 17:19:24 -0400] jaypipes: ERROR: You specified the --disable_editing option, nothing to edit
[2012-10-26 17:21:28 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: this worked for me: https://gist.github.com/3960063
[2012-10-26 17:22:20 -0400] mattray: I just did a knife node show anotherbox.atx.lab -Fj > test.box.json
[2012-10-26 17:22:27 -0400] mattray: and changed the name of the node
[2012-10-26 17:22:35 -0400] mattray: so it put it in "production"
[2012-10-26 17:23:37 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: json has "chef_environment": "production"
[2012-10-26 17:23:50 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: hmm, I trie that already :(
[2012-10-26 17:23:55 -0400] jaypipes: no workie
[2012-10-26 17:24:02 -0400] mattray: Chef 10.16 if it matters
[2012-10-26 17:24:21 -0400] jaypipes: 10.14.2 here.
[2012-10-26 17:24:24 -0400] mattray: using "knife node from file blah.json"?
[2012-10-26 17:24:41 -0400] mattray: (which I didn't know was a thing)
[2012-10-26 17:27:22 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: yeah, it works if I use EDITOR=vim knife node edit ..., but not if I use knife node from file blah.json
[2012-10-26 17:28:14 -0400] mattray: I'm not going to troll and say it works because I have EDITOR=emacs ;)
[2012-10-26 17:29:19 -0400] mattray: adding -VV will add a little more debugging if it helps
[2012-10-26 17:29:40 -0400] retr0h: mattray: LOL
[2012-10-26 17:31:01 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: nm, I am a morono.
[2012-10-26 17:31:10 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I was referring to the wrong friggin node...
[2012-10-26 17:31:16 -0400] mattray: sweet, not a bug
[2012-10-26 17:31:26 -0400] mattray: no problemo, now I'm going to go get some lunch
[2012-10-26 17:32:12 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3565?focusedCommentId=28286#comment-28286
[2012-10-26 17:33:24 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: closed :)
[2012-10-26 17:33:43 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: danke
[2012-10-26 17:34:33 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: I pinged a few people about the state of the MySQL tickets. There was a lot of talk at the Chef Developer Summit about ways to get faster turn-around on tickets.
[2012-10-26 17:34:51 -0400] mattray: jtimberman is working on it
[2012-10-26 17:37:11 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: 5 months is a long time :|
[2012-10-26 17:38:37 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: don't worry, lots of people shared similar sentiments.
[2012-10-26 18:55:37 -0400] japage: mattray: you indicated you were going to be in new york soon, was that the 13th?
[2012-10-26 18:55:49 -0400] mattray: japage: yes
[2012-10-26 18:56:00 -0400] japage: mattray: I'll work on being there
[2012-10-26 18:56:05 -0400] mattray: just booked my hotel. Fly in the 12th, leave the 14th
[2012-10-26 18:56:33 -0400] mattray: japage: awesome. jaypipes and primeministerp may be there as well
[2012-10-26 18:57:15 -0400] japage: cool, what time periods should I plan for?
[2012-10-26 19:03:42 -0400] mattray: if you're going to be at the Hack Day, it's 10-5 I think
[2012-10-26 19:04:03 -0400] mattray: and the Chef NYC Meetup is 7-9
[2012-10-26 19:04:30 -0400] japage: Ok, ill try to be up from 10 to 9 then
[2012-10-26 19:04:43 -0400] japage: wait, thats silly
[2012-10-26 19:05:27 -0400] japage: cool, thanks for letting me know the times
[2012-10-26 21:46:41 -0400] mattray: retr0h: ping
[2012-10-26 22:32:47 -0400] Aaton: does mysql have to listen on the pubic IP?
[2012-10-26 22:36:11 -0400] Aaton: actually that not what I mean. its this osops-utils. MySQL binds to one IP but Nova get configured to connect to another.
[2012-10-26 22:39:01 -0400] mattray: Aaton: not sure, doesn't seem like it should. You want to use the manage network?
[2012-10-26 22:39:21 -0400] mattray: Aaton: we'll just need to ensure mysql is listening on the right network
