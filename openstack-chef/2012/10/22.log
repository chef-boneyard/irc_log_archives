[2012-10-22 17:04:08 -0400] ctracey_: wkelly: good catching up last week
[2012-10-22 17:05:04 -0400] ctracey_: wondering if you guys have given any thought to using librarian for the rcbops repo
[2012-10-22 17:41:16 -0400] galstrom: ctracey: last time we discussed using librarian.. there was not a compelling reason to use it over git submodules
[2012-10-22 17:48:06 -0400] ctracey_: galstrom: i can certainly see that from an internal perspective.  for us, who may want from time to time override some parts of the rcbops repo, it would be mighty handy.
[2012-10-22 17:51:08 -0400] galstrom: ctracey: i am not sure those two things are mutually exclusive.. since librarian is essentially trying to do the same thing as submodules..
[2012-10-22 17:51:34 -0400] galstrom: ctracey: you should still be able to control it with librarian if you so choose..
[2012-10-22 17:51:46 -0400] galstrom: just dont ever do a submodule init/update on the chef-cookbooks repo
[2012-10-22 17:52:58 -0400] galstrom: *havent tried it.. but i think that would work*
[2012-10-22 20:35:01 -0400] rpedde: ctracey_: I think mattray uses librarian, but I'm not sure exactly where his librarian config is
