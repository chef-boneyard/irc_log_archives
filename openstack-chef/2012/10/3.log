[2012-10-03 16:08:08 -0400] mattray: Installing Rackspace's Alamo installer to see if there's something I'm missing
[2012-10-03 19:07:16 -0400] retr0h: mattray: is there an easy way to get spiceweasel to add -o .
[2012-10-03 19:07:33 -0400] retr0h: or is it best just ot update cookbook_path in knife.rb ?
[2012-10-03 19:07:38 -0400] mattray: -o?
[2012-10-03 19:07:43 -0400] retr0h: for cookbook path
[2012-10-03 19:07:52 -0400] retr0h: im testing via jenkins
[2012-10-03 19:08:07 -0400] mattray: use the knifeconfig I guess
[2012-10-03 19:08:40 -0400] mattray: hmmm knife doesn't use -o either
[2012-10-03 19:12:35 -0400] retr0h: oh duhhh cookbook_path ["./cokbooks"] will work with jenkins
[2012-10-03 19:25:12 -0400] mattray: watch the typo ;)
[2012-10-03 21:44:37 -0400] mattray: don't know if it matters or not, but the Essex docs say LVM is required and I didn't have it. Updated my preseed and testing now
[2012-10-03 21:53:03 -0400] mattray: nope, same failure
[2012-10-03 21:57:18 -0400] mattray: my usb thumbdrive with alamo refuses to boot
[2012-10-03 22:00:45 -0400] mattray: interestingly, I see dhcp requests on my router that have the fa-16-3e mac address for openstack
[2012-10-03 22:01:30 -0400] mattray: or actual leases
