[2012-10-04 20:34:28 -0400] mattray: this is killing me. I've torn everything down repeatedly and still can't get into my VMs
[2012-10-04 20:40:01 -0400] mattray: oh nuts, the VMs are hitting up my pxe boot server
[2012-10-04 20:41:42 -0400] mattray: wkelly: rpedde: have you seen this before? ^^
[2012-10-04 20:41:58 -0400] mattray: no wonder my VMs all die, they're trying to pxe boot
[2012-10-04 21:02:12 -0400] mattray: shouldn't dnsmasq be giving my vms their IPs?
[2012-10-04 22:51:29 -0400] rpedde: uh, sorry matt, was afk
[2012-10-04 22:52:07 -0400] rpedde: but yeah, have seen that repeatedly.  on my "outside" pxe dhcp, I set it to be non-promiscuous
[2012-10-04 22:53:02 -0400] rpedde: if that's  dnsmasq, "dhcp-ignore=tag:!known" will keep it from answering unknown macs
[2012-10-04 22:53:25 -0400] rpedde: probably you've already fixed this tho, so.... sorry.  :p
