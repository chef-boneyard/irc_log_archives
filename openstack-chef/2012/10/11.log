[2012-10-11 14:38:49 -0400] japage: I am sure that I am doing something wrong, however, in the infrastructure.yml, i see that spiceweasel is being told that it requires rabbitmq-openstack 1.0.4, however when I check chef-librarian, it is pointing at the github:/mattray/rabbitmq-openstack, which is at 1.0.3, however the rcbops/rabbitmq-openstack is at 1.0.4; should I go grab that version, and use it?
[2012-10-11 14:40:39 -0400] japage: or should I just roll back the dependency in spiceweasel?
[2012-10-11 14:42:13 -0400] japage: it looks like the version number was an automated bump in rcbops/rabbitmq-openstack
