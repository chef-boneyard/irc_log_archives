[2012-10-31 19:21:47 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: the example there is really kind of mix-mashing information in chef with information that really is in other tools (like nagios/munin/rrdtool/graphite, etc). Not sure I totally buy the use case for it yet..
[2012-10-31 19:22:34 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: the example is from the Nagios cookbook, where search is leveraged to manage monitoring
[2012-10-31 19:22:40 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: nevertheless, it would indeed cut down on the amount of data passed back, so that's a good thing :)
[2012-10-31 19:23:19 -0400] mattray: we use a fair amount of search with OpenStack, so this will definitely help scaling and memory footprint
[2012-10-31 19:23:38 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: no, I was referring to the top example (the one that returns eth0_rx_bytes...
[2012-10-31 19:24:06 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: ahh, yes. A bit of a contrived example

[2012-10-31 19:24:39 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: but yeah, totally agreed re: the role search we do in OpenStack cookbooks -- though I'm not totally convinced it's structured as cleanly as it could be.
