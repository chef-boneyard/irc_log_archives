[2012-08-29 01:13:40 -0400] richleland:  does anyone know if knife-openstack plays nice w/Rackspace's OpenStack?
[2012-08-29 01:19:11 -0400] wkelly: richleland: it did not the last time I checked.  Rackspace exposes multiple regions and endpoints, and fog didn't like that very much
[2012-08-29 01:19:59 -0400] richleland: wkelly yeah that's where I'm getting errors compute.rb:340:in `authenticate': uninitialized constant Fog::Compute::OpenStack::ServiceUnavailable (NameError)
[2012-08-29 01:22:50 -0400] wkelly: richleland: it looks like this will get fixed naturally in fog
[2012-08-29 01:23:07 -0400] wkelly: https://github.com/fog/fog/pull/1041/files fixes multiple regions
[2012-08-29 01:27:13 -0400] richleland: oh nice - thanks for the info wkelly
[2012-08-29 01:27:51 -0400] richleland: so just to make sure I understand - knife-openstack has a dependency on Fog (1.4.0 currently)
[2012-08-29 01:28:25 -0400] richleland: once Fog pushes a new gem with this update, knife-openstack would get its gem spec updated, then it would push a new gem
[2012-08-29 01:28:59 -0400] wkelly: that's correct!  mattray could probably give you a rough timeline
[2012-08-29 01:29:08 -0400] wkelly: but he is all conferenced up this week, I think
