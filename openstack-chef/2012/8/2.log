[2012-08-02 15:19:18 -0400] japage: mattray: i see you added a cookbook for setting up networking for your testing, should I go ahead and make sure I have 2 nic's set up on my test boxes as well?
[2012-08-02 15:21:59 -0400] mattray: japage: I'm debugging an issue with it right now :)
[2012-08-02 15:22:14 -0400] mattray: I figured I was trying to get my lab more like production deployments
[2012-08-02 15:22:22 -0400] mattray: most have 2 or more networks
[2012-08-02 15:22:41 -0400] mattray: mine was 1, setting up second now for a "management" network
[2012-08-02 15:23:14 -0400] mattray: which shows up in here: https://github.com/mattray/openstack-chef-repo/blob/essex/roles/os-networks.rb
[2012-08-02 15:23:30 -0400] mattray: osops-utils looks for that and writes it out to etc/hosts
[2012-08-02 15:23:49 -0400] mattray: so machines that have the management network can talk on a separate network
[2012-08-02 15:24:19 -0400] mattray: I've seen 4 networks in installations
[2012-08-02 15:24:29 -0400] mattray: public, private, management and swift
[2012-08-02 15:24:58 -0400] japage: cool, folks around here were wondering if that was going to be supported by these cookbooks. (right now, we have 4 nics, not sure how they are going to be distributed yet, 2x 1gb, 2x10gb)
[2012-08-02 15:25:28 -0400] mattray: yeah, I think the osops-utils technique should work well for that
[2012-08-02 15:25:35 -0400] japage: yep
[2012-08-02 15:26:03 -0400] mattray: you populate the attributes, then you can query things like "swift" on the "management" network
[2012-08-02 15:26:07 -0400] mattray: to get the right IP
[2012-08-02 15:26:39 -0400] japage: yea, i just started looking at that, looks like a winner for sure
[2012-08-02 15:26:49 -0400] mattray: there's definitely room for improvement, potentially databags or partial search in the future
[2012-08-02 15:27:03 -0400] mattray: but for now I'm not worried
[2012-08-02 15:28:14 -0400] mattray: but right now the Ubuntu preseed blew up when I changed the networking
[2012-08-02 15:28:23 -0400] mattray: with the labdefaults cookbook
[2012-08-02 15:28:46 -0400] mattray: so I may make the preseed aware of it, but for now I'll just leave that as technical debt
[2012-08-02 15:29:45 -0400] mattray: btw, I'll try out the pxe_dust changes you sent in the next week I hope. Trying to just get Nova up and running first
[2012-08-02 15:30:13 -0400] japage: no problem, focus is a good thing :-)
[2012-08-02 15:33:16 -0400] japage: actually, maybe save some time, right now, in the pxe_dust, "addresses":{"AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF":"string"}, it does not appear "string" is being used. is this on purpose? If I want to add hostname information, would you prefer I take over this unusued string? or would you prefer I make a new item, eg: "addresses":{"AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF":{"hostname":"stringValue"}}
[2012-08-02 15:34:30 -0400] mattray: where? file & line number please?
[2012-08-02 15:35:09 -0400] japage: nevermind, we can talk about it later when you review the pull
[2012-08-02 16:53:57 -0400] mattray: my rabbitmq failures were because 2.8.5 just came out
[2012-08-02 16:54:14 -0400] mattray: rpedde was right, we need to make distro-versions an option
[2012-08-02 17:48:49 -0400] rpedde: mattray: "rpedde was right" -- if I had a nickle for every time I heard that
[2012-08-02 17:48:56 -0400] rpedde: ... I'd have a nickle
[2012-08-02 18:46:00 -0400] carlp: Don't be so hard on yourself rpedde - you would have at least two
[2012-08-02 18:46:04 -0400] carlp: :)
[2012-08-02 18:49:57 -0400] mattray: rpedde: looks like the repository LWRP is eating notifications to apt-get update, which means rabbitmq fails
[2012-08-02 18:50:02 -0400] mattray: testing a patch now
[2012-08-02 18:50:37 -0400] mattray: and then it tries to install the old rabbitmq, which fails
