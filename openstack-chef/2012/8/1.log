[2012-08-01 03:15:06 -0400] carlp: mattray: you around?
[2012-08-01 03:15:32 -0400] mattray: carlp: I was just about to head out, what's up?
[2012-08-01 03:15:48 -0400] carlp: Did I get you all the details for the hack-a-thon?
[2012-08-01 03:16:15 -0400] carlp: I've got inital copy, I'll send it along to you.  Wanted to be sure you had the details just in case :)
[2012-08-01 03:17:44 -0400] mattray: the only details I have is the date and city :)
[2012-08-01 03:17:56 -0400] carlp: My bad!
[2012-08-01 03:18:04 -0400] carlp: 10am-5pm, DreamHost offices
[2012-08-01 03:18:18 -0400] carlp: Doors open at 9, lunch and snacks will be provided
[2012-08-01 03:18:30 -0400] carlp: as well as some unwind time before the chef meetup that evening at 7pm
[2012-08-01 03:18:58 -0400] mattray: excellent.
[2012-08-01 03:19:07 -0400] mattray: I'll see about booking a flight tomorrow
[2012-08-01 03:19:43 -0400] carlp: Awesome.  Let me know if you have any problems with the wording on the announcement, and we'll post it tomorrow.  It should be visible through the OpenStack LA Meetup on meetup.com
[2012-08-01 03:20:13 -0400] carlp: I just wanted some way where we could track RSVPs and order food accordingly :)
[2012-08-01 03:20:29 -0400] carlp: Also, I'll hit you up tomorrow so we can work out a goal list
[2012-08-01 03:20:33 -0400] mattray: yeah
[2012-08-01 03:20:55 -0400] mattray: ok, time to go tell my wife I'm out of town for a night :)
[2012-08-01 03:20:56 -0400] mattray: later
[2012-08-01 03:21:09 -0400] carlp: later!
[2012-08-01 17:22:22 -0400] mattray: carlp: LA is greenlit
[2012-08-01 17:39:40 -0400] carlp: mattray: AWESOME!
[2012-08-01 17:39:49 -0400] carlp: you OK with that wording I sent you?
[2012-08-01 17:41:19 -0400] mattray: perhaps instead of "Well be coding http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home Cookbooks for OpenStack" "Well be coding on http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home
[2012-08-01 17:41:35 -0400] mattray: doh, bad paste
[2012-08-01 17:41:56 -0400] mattray: "We'll be coding on Chef for OpenStack" with the opscode.com/openstack URL
[2012-08-01 17:42:13 -0400] carlp: Can do
[2012-08-01 17:42:22 -0400] mattray: and "Deep Expertise" lol
[2012-08-01 17:43:13 -0400] mattray: and make sure you post the address, so I can find a hotel nearby
[2012-08-01 17:43:36 -0400] carlp: 707 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles 90017
[2012-08-01 17:43:46 -0400] carlp: There are several nearby
[2012-08-01 17:44:15 -0400] carlp: Our marketing guy is making the change now and then I think we're going to post the meetup
[2012-08-01 17:44:22 -0400] carlp: Who was on your invite list?
[2012-08-01 17:44:31 -0400] carlp: just out of curiosity
[2012-08-01 17:51:16 -0400] mattray: I don't have a firm invite list, I know DreamHost and InkTank will be there, I'll publicize it a bunch and put out some feelers to a few people directly
[2012-08-01 17:51:54 -0400] carlp: cool
[2012-08-01 17:52:16 -0400] carlp: Any idea on goals?  If we could get a full stack running on Folsom that would be awesome
[2012-08-01 17:52:32 -0400] carlp: I have two dev environments (one Essex and one Folsom) we can play with
[2012-08-01 17:52:39 -0400] mattray: sounds good
[2012-08-01 17:52:52 -0400] mattray: I'm thinking by then we should have some Folsom traction
[2012-08-01 17:52:56 -0400] carlp: Anything else you wanted to accomplish?
[2012-08-01 17:53:01 -0400] mattray: at least with milestone builds
[2012-08-01 17:53:16 -0400] mattray: more testing and hypervisors pulled out
[2012-08-01 17:53:29 -0400] mattray: that sounds like the next 3 weeks
[2012-08-01 17:53:57 -0400] mattray: so we'll have Folsom started, kvm, lxc and hyper-v possibly by then
[2012-08-01 17:54:14 -0400] mattray: and then we can look at storage backends or quantum
[2012-08-01 17:54:24 -0400] mattray: both of which I expect are dear to you guys
[2012-08-01 17:55:43 -0400] carlp: indeed!
[2012-08-01 17:56:38 -0400] mattray: there's tons that needs to be done, so I figure we start with an overview and walk through the existing stuff
[2012-08-01 17:56:52 -0400] mattray: then identify things that could be worked on independently
[2012-08-01 17:57:29 -0400] carlp: excellent
[2012-08-01 17:57:50 -0400] mattray: I'm already taking lots of notes as I work
[2012-08-01 17:58:07 -0400] mattray: whoever shows up gets to steer
[2012-08-01 17:58:37 -0400] carlp: I was going to try and get some parts of Folsom working before hand, but I doubt it will be much farther along than you.
[2012-08-01 17:59:07 -0400] mattray: Aaton has some stuff in progress I believe
[2012-08-01 17:59:16 -0400] carlp: good to know
[2012-08-01 17:59:43 -0400] mattray: and I expect next week to start adding initial Folsom stuff
[2012-08-01 18:00:33 -0400] carlp: cool
[2012-08-01 18:01:00 -0400] carlp: I was also going to start the process of migrating my Essex stuff from the osops cooksbooks to yours as well.
[2012-08-01 18:01:18 -0400] carlp: That may be a far better goal for me to hit before the 21st
[2012-08-01 18:01:40 -0400] mattray: well, if you read my commits you can see what I've done since forking from rcbops
[2012-08-01 18:01:55 -0400] mattray: and I'm still watching their stuff and patching back in
[2012-08-01 18:02:01 -0400] mattray: I've just pulled out monitoring and logging
[2012-08-01 18:02:10 -0400] mattray: so they can move to their own cookbooks eventually
[2012-08-01 18:02:40 -0400] mattray: now I'm butting up against assumptions that everything will always be deployed, so I'm adding guards for that
[2012-08-01 18:02:54 -0400] mattray: and fixing and upstreaming cookbook fixes on other stuff
[2012-08-01 18:03:03 -0400] carlp: I'm not sure how far rcbops diverged from osops - but it's a start.  Once I can get it working, I'll tear down osops and point it at you
[2012-08-01 18:03:42 -0400] mattray: I did a lot of diff walkthroughs and git log reading
[2012-08-01 18:04:07 -0400] carlp: I can imagine
[2012-08-01 18:04:17 -0400] carlp: There were a lot of bugs in the osops stuff too
[2012-08-01 18:05:34 -0400] carlp: ...and a painful amount of incomplete features
[2012-08-01 18:12:04 -0400] mattray: that's what hackdays are for
[2012-08-01 18:23:34 -0400] carlp: Here's the link: http://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-LA/events/75878692/
[2012-08-01 18:34:52 -0400] mattray: carlp: is the Chef LA Meetup going up soon too?
[2012-08-01 20:25:12 -0400] carlp: I believe so
