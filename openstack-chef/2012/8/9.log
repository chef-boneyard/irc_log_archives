[2012-08-09 17:25:19 -0400] japage: mattray: i believe i have a working copy of dhcp, and that it is doing some interraction with pxe_dust, but, i have not yet tested it extensively
[2012-08-09 17:35:50 -0400] mattray: japage: sounds good. I don't want pxe_dust to require using software dhcp, but I expect that's not where you're headed
[2012-08-09 17:36:38 -0400] mattray: or at least, it's optional
[2012-08-09 17:40:54 -0400] japage: mattray: If the pxe_dust data bag happens to have dhcp stuff in it, then dhcp will add that into its calculations
[2012-08-09 17:41:09 -0400] mattray: exactly
[2012-08-09 17:41:36 -0400] japage: in much the same manner that if apt-cacher-ng happens to be around, pxe_dust will act accordingly
[2012-08-09 17:42:09 -0400] mattray: sounds good
[2012-08-09 17:43:28 -0400] japage: also, i am noob-tacular when it comes to chef/ruby/lwrp's etc, so im not sure my code is all that good. Also, and ctracey brought this up, I just broke backwards compatibility with how I have dhcp working, and I didnt know if that was acceptable
[2012-08-09 17:45:19 -0400] japage: after ctracey uploads his version (with backwards compatibility), i am planning on including that into this.
[2012-08-09 17:46:37 -0400] japage: does anyone else have a strong need for dhcp, and want to do some testing and code review?
[2012-08-09 17:52:25 -0400] mattray: japage: I don't think you're breaking much backwards compatibility, since I never pushed the cookbook anywhere
[2012-08-09 17:53:09 -0400] japage: ohhh, ok, it just doesnt work on anything older than when they changed the packages (i think its any ubuntu pre 12.04)
[2012-08-09 17:56:17 -0400] mattray: japage: I'll wait for someone to complain and bring patches
[2012-08-09 17:56:35 -0400] japage: mattray :-)
[2012-08-09 17:57:11 -0400] mattray: essentially the dhcp cookbook has no installed base, so as soon as you say it "works", we can push it up to the community site
[2012-08-09 17:57:26 -0400] japage: ahh ok
[2012-08-09 17:57:45 -0400] mattray: miah in #chef was kicking the tires on it
[2012-08-09 17:58:05 -0400] mattray: but that's about it
[2012-08-09 17:58:28 -0400] japage: well, im putting it through a test now, and after that, id like someone else to give it a quick check over, then ill push it up
[2012-08-09 18:34:22 -0400] japage: um, anyone know what I should do if i am getting blocked by apparmor?
[2012-08-09 18:36:35 -0400] japage: nvmd, i have the config files all messed up. ignore last
[2012-08-09 19:29:52 -0400] mattray: rpedde: wkelly: one of you guys have that photo of the whiteboard from yesterday?
[2012-08-09 19:31:29 -0400] wkelly: mattray: rpedde does!
[2012-08-09 19:31:56 -0400] wkelly: he is conversationed at present, but I will throw something at him momentarily
[2012-08-09 19:32:00 -0400] mattray: thanks!
[2012-08-09 19:56:24 -0400] rpedde: I do indeed have this photo
[2012-08-09 19:59:40 -0400] rpedde: ummm
[2012-08-09 19:59:57 -0400] rpedde: sadly this photo only has our task list
[2012-08-09 20:00:21 -0400] rpedde: stuff like "quit whining"
[2012-08-09 20:02:27 -0400] mattray: rpedde: feel free to send it to me, I've got notes
[2012-08-09 20:22:13 -0400] japage: mattray: yes! it seems to have worked this last run... the dhcp cookbook
[2012-08-09 20:23:04 -0400] mattray: awesome, I'll check it out and maybe turn off my dd-wrt boxes if it works for me :)
[2012-08-09 20:23:12 -0400] japage: k
[2012-08-09 20:23:36 -0400] japage: i have not documented the changes to the pxe_dust databag, and you do need to set up a generic dhcp databag
[2012-08-09 20:23:52 -0400] japage: do you want me to send a pull request, or how should i share it?
[2012-08-09 20:25:46 -0400] japage: also, i do not /yet/ have it automatically adding and removing mac addresses from the allowed list in the cookbook, I was going to do that next. Since everything is lwrp'd in the dhcp cookbook, that should be fairly easy to add
