[2012-08-23 14:01:32 -0400] mancdaz: can anyone from opscode take a look at this http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KNIFE_RACKSPACE-36?focusedCommentId=26530#comment-26530
[2012-08-23 14:01:51 -0400] mancdaz: the pull referenced there needs to be made as the tool is currently broken
[2012-08-23 14:08:00 -0400] japage: on a completely different topic, I just deployed an all-in-one role, with great success :-)
[2012-08-23 21:45:19 -0400] mattray: japage: awesome!
