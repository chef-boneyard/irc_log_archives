[2012-08-07 15:52:12 -0400] japage: mattray: working on getting ccla for ibm as quick as I can, I'll know more in the next couple of days
[2012-08-07 15:52:48 -0400] mattray: japage: cool.
[2012-08-07 15:53:33 -0400] mattray: I'm testing a bunch of patches for pxe_dust right now
[2012-08-07 16:06:21 -0400] japage: mattray: let me know if the changes I made need to be done differently, or if there is anything I need to fix
[2012-08-07 16:07:05 -0400] mattray: japage: yeah, the patch got changed a bit
[2012-08-07 16:07:11 -0400] mattray: japage: testing now
[2012-08-07 16:09:26 -0400] japage: pxe_dust works really well, i still love just hitting the on button, and instantly getting a working, ready to go physical node
[2012-08-07 16:09:58 -0400] japage: only took 1 extra cookbook to deal with the networking insanity specific to this location
[2012-08-07 16:11:03 -0400] mattray: japage: yeah, I need to get some setup so I can leave my boxes in pxe boot always, without potentially reinstalling the OS everytime
[2012-08-07 16:11:19 -0400] mattray: japage: needs some logic in managing dhcp probably
[2012-08-07 16:12:00 -0400] mattray: japage: so I still have my boxes boot the HD, have to hit the boot-selector on boot
[2012-08-07 16:12:11 -0400] mattray: japage: if I'm using PXE
[2012-08-07 16:12:59 -0400] japage: mattray: i have it lucky, i dont control the dhcp server at this location, however I do have the ability to add and remove mac addresses from a dhcp class using an api, so the custom recipe removes the machine from the dhcp pool before reboot, which causes the pxe to fail through to local hd
[2012-08-07 16:13:18 -0400] mattray: japage: yeah, I have a dhcp cookbook that hasn't gotten much love
[2012-08-07 16:13:30 -0400] mattray: japage: and dhcp3-server can be managed via API
[2012-08-07 16:13:45 -0400] mattray: japage: just haven't gotten around to it
[2012-08-07 16:14:22 -0400] japage: mattray: ill go take a look, this is something i did struggle with in my other test environment (for a while i was looking at using cobbler, but that was way too bulky and complex to be reliable)
[2012-08-07 16:27:40 -0400] japage: mattray: is there a good way to cause a recipe on one server to cause a configuration change on another? eg: node a pxe boots, installs, then sets a local attribute to indicate that it is installed now, then triggers pxe_dust server to re-compute its config for something like tftp?
[2012-08-07 16:29:03 -0400] japage: nvmd: thats why you want to do it with the dhcp server...
[2012-08-07 16:55:54 -0400] mattray: japage: I'm thinking eventually a knife plugin might be the best approach
[2012-08-07 17:00:55 -0400] mattray: japage: if you want to mess with the dhcp cookbook, here it is: https://github.com/mattray/mattray-cookbooks/tree/master/dhcp
[2012-08-07 17:01:10 -0400] mattray: japage: probably making sure that is working well is the first step
[2012-08-07 17:01:10 -0400] japage: mattray: that makes sense, you would have your knife plugins for cloud vm's, then your knife plugin for physical machines too. You can wait for the state changes of the machine as it goes through the install process, and you can interract with the services that bootstrap the machine.
[2012-08-07 17:01:21 -0400] mattray: japage: yes
[2012-08-07 17:01:40 -0400] mattray: so knife pxe_dust would talk to the dhcp server, moving nodes between which state they should be in
[2012-08-07 17:01:59 -0400] mattray: with a list of supported operating systems they could install
[2012-08-07 17:02:21 -0400] japage: yea, that is exactly the appropriate tool for the job. I knew there were smarter people in the room :-)
[2012-08-07 17:02:30 -0400] mattray: but first you need dhcp interacting with the pxe_dust data bag
[2012-08-07 17:02:33 -0400] japage: yep
[2012-08-07 17:02:39 -0400] japage: on it
[2012-08-07 17:03:26 -0400] japage: kicking off the startup of my "networking" test environment
[2012-08-07 17:03:48 -0400] mattray: and then figure out how to have knife pxe_dust interact with the dhcp server via omapi
[2012-08-07 17:03:53 -0400] mattray: either via the CLI or API
[2012-08-07 17:04:14 -0400] mattray: update the dhcp server, then kick the machine to reboot and reinstall the OS
[2012-08-07 17:04:23 -0400] mattray: I know what needs to be done, just a matter of hours in the day :)
[2012-08-07 17:05:56 -0400] japage: I completly understand. Well, while my hands are tied on the stuff in heavy development (untill the ccla), I can work on this, and hopefully get it working in an ideal fashion right about the time ibm legal gives me the green light
[2012-08-07 17:07:02 -0400] mattray: sounds awesome.
[2012-08-07 21:11:05 -0400] mattray: it appears that reloading the mysql service isn't working
[2012-08-07 21:11:14 -0400] mattray: so it never starts listening on anything but localhost
[2012-08-07 21:22:28 -0400] carlp: oh mysql, is there anything you can't do poorly
[2012-08-07 21:23:14 -0400] galstrom: wait.. is the problem with mysql.. or the mysql cookbook..
[2012-08-07 21:23:34 -0400] galstrom: are you sure it is not a problem with the cookbook..
[2012-08-07 21:23:37 -0400] rpedde: DO NOT FEED THE SHEP
[2012-08-07 21:24:40 -0400] galstrom: or it could be upstart
[2012-08-07 21:25:12 -0400] Diopter: You upstart whippersnappers
[2012-08-07 21:25:17 -0400] rpedde: sunspots
[2012-08-07 21:25:31 -0400] Diopter: Did you enable the cosmic ray filter?
[2012-08-07 21:25:48 -0400] rpedde: try covering the system in tinfoil
[2012-08-07 21:26:08 -0400] rackerjoe: Belly-Button logic Works!
[2012-08-07 21:26:14 -0400] mattray: galstrom: mysql cookbook
[2012-08-07 21:26:24 -0400] wkelly: haha
[2012-08-07 21:26:33 -0400] mattray: so reload mysql doesn't pull in the my.cnf settings
[2012-08-07 21:26:35 -0400] rpedde: I am _literally_ crying
[2012-08-07 21:26:44 -0400] galstrom: mattray: i have seen some odd behavior in the cookbook
[2012-08-07 21:26:48 -0400] Diopter: Add the autodegausser to the cookbook deps
[2012-08-07 21:26:59 -0400] galstrom: where bind_address gets wiped
[2012-08-07 21:27:10 -0400] galstrom: which causes it to bind to localhost only
[2012-08-07 21:27:14 -0400] mattray: galstrom: reload mysql ignores bind address
[2012-08-07 21:27:16 -0400] galstrom: and is super awesome
[2012-08-07 21:27:22 -0400] galstrom: mattray: fair point
[2012-08-07 21:28:08 -0400] mattray: there was a ticket that exposed and fixed this the other day, looks like I'll explicitly require restarts
[2012-08-07 21:29:16 -0400] mattray: https://gist.github.com/3289555
[2012-08-07 21:30:06 -0400] galstrom: mattray: why i gotta be a troll?
[2012-08-07 21:34:13 -0400] mattray: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1475?focusedCommentId=26013#comment-26013
[2012-08-07 21:45:19 -0400] japage: mattray: im supprised that the reload code is siginificantly different than the restart code, unless the reload code can somehow do so without causing the service to have even a millisecond of downtime... I feel your pain though
[2012-08-07 21:55:11 -0400] japage: mattray: WOW! git://gist.github.com/3289555.git
