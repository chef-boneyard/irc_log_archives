[2012-08-20 20:39:55 -0400] carlp: Hey mattray
[2012-08-20 20:40:00 -0400] mattray: howdy
[2012-08-20 20:40:49 -0400] carlp: Got your intinerary, looks good to me.  Lunch will be here around noon, so that should be enough time to get through the first one or two things.  We'll also have some breakfast snacks, and munchies for after lunch
[2012-08-20 20:41:31 -0400] galstrom: mattray: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3172
[2012-08-20 20:42:19 -0400] mattray: galstrom: yeah, I read the log on http://community.opscode.com/chat/openstack-chef and saw that
[2012-08-20 20:42:46 -0400] carlp: mattray: Anything else you want to cover before tomorrow?
[2012-08-20 20:43:04 -0400] mattray: galstrom: it may make 10.14, but RC1 is going out presently so it may not
[2012-08-20 20:43:19 -0400] mattray: galstrom: there will be a 10.16 while Chef 11 solidifies as well
[2012-08-20 20:44:09 -0400] mattray: carlp: not really. I'm open to suggestions for how to run the session, will we have hardware available?
[2012-08-20 20:44:29 -0400] mattray: running it on my laptop is painful
[2012-08-20 20:45:01 -0400] carlp: mattray: Yes, my dev cluster is on site and will be ready for use
[2012-08-20 20:45:09 -0400] mattray: peachy.
[2012-08-20 20:45:30 -0400] carlp: Lots of 10G bandwidth between those boxes too :)
[2012-08-20 20:46:27 -0400] mattray: how many boxes? can we have parallel installations being tested?
[2012-08-20 20:47:21 -0400] carlp: There are 4 ceph nodes, 4 hypervisor nodes, and 6 other boxes.  Of those 6, one is running ESXi for misc VMs
[2012-08-20 20:47:27 -0400] carlp: so, yeah - we can do a lot
[2012-08-20 20:47:52 -0400] mattray: excellent
[2012-08-20 20:48:35 -0400] mattray: 29 RSVPs, that's a lot of folks
[2012-08-20 20:49:19 -0400] carlp: Some are folks who work here, so it may not be that bad.  Squeezing everyone in the conference room for discussion may be interesting, but we have room to spread out when working.
