[2012-09-11 15:49:40 -0400] mattray: GitHub's quite unhappy right now, guess I'll go write docs instead of coding
[2012-09-11 16:23:55 -0400] retr0h: mattray: btw when GH returns I have a pull req on your keystone repo, if you don't mind taking a look
[2012-09-11 16:24:06 -0400] mattray: yeah, I was trying to look and merge
[2012-09-11 16:24:29 -0400] mattray: heading to Rackspace in about 45 minutes, doing training for them the next 3 days
[2012-09-11 16:24:59 -0400] mattray: but I should have some time tomorrow morning for merging
[2012-09-11 16:25:06 -0400] mattray: unless GitHub comes back right now
[2012-09-11 16:27:55 -0400] retr0h: cool
