[2012-09-17 17:13:25 -0400] carlp: morning mattray
[2012-09-17 17:20:55 -0400] mattray: carlp: greetings
[2012-09-17 17:21:12 -0400] carlp: I've got a meeting in a few, but I should be back on-line shortly
[2012-09-17 17:21:28 -0400] mattray: cool, eating lunch. Just ping me
[2012-09-17 18:06:35 -0400] carlp: I'm back
[2012-09-17 18:07:10 -0400] carlp: So, mattray : if I recall the plan is to split installation of components out to a component-install recipe (nova-install)
[2012-09-17 18:07:31 -0400] carlp: We want the ability to choose essex, folsom, and eventually git HEAD as versions
[2012-09-17 18:07:31 -0400] mattray: for packaging?
[2012-09-17 18:07:42 -0400] mattray: yeah, for selecting source of components
[2012-09-17 18:07:53 -0400] carlp: Then there would be a component-essex and a component-folsom recipe for doing the work
[2012-09-17 18:08:11 -0400] carlp: Which recipe to be used would be picked by a release attribute from the component cookbook
[2012-09-17 18:08:17 -0400] carlp: Did I get all that right?
[2012-09-17 18:08:18 -0400] mattray: yes
[2012-09-17 18:08:34 -0400] carlp: sweet!  I'm not an idiot!
[2012-09-17 18:08:40 -0400] mattray: ie. node['openstack']['version']
[2012-09-17 18:08:49 -0400] mattray: and node['nova']['version']
[2012-09-17 18:09:00 -0400] carlp: right
[2012-09-17 18:09:13 -0400] mattray: or perhaps [openstack][openstack][version]
[2012-09-17 18:09:32 -0400] mattray: with [openstack][nova|glance|horizon|etc][version]
[2012-09-17 18:09:35 -0400] carlp: I like namespacing everything in openstack
[2012-09-17 18:09:39 -0400] mattray: yeah
[2012-09-17 18:09:46 -0400] carlp: cool
[2012-09-17 18:10:10 -0400] carlp: OK, I'll sync my forks to your current upstream and then start renaming :)
[2012-09-17 18:10:20 -0400] mattray: are you starting in folsom?
[2012-09-17 18:10:32 -0400] carlp: Yes, it's what I need for now
[2012-09-17 18:10:46 -0400] mattray: did you follow the thread about branches?
[2012-09-17 18:11:03 -0400] mattray: the suggestion is that we keep 'essex' and 'folsom' separate
[2012-09-17 18:11:21 -0400] mattray: which somewhat conflicts with what you're proposing
[2012-09-17 18:11:31 -0400] carlp: I thought I did.  I thought the idea was to keep the recipes separate
[2012-09-17 18:11:34 -0400] carlp: hrm
[2012-09-17 18:11:38 -0400] mattray: separate branches
[2012-09-17 18:11:44 -0400] carlp: ok
[2012-09-17 18:11:57 -0400] mattray: I'm not averse to letting folsom support the use of HEAD
[2012-09-17 18:12:07 -0400] mattray: or even backporting it to essex
[2012-09-17 18:12:14 -0400] carlp: so in this model, how would you expect HEAD working, as that will always be a moving target?
[2012-09-17 18:12:32 -0400] mattray: well, there will soon be 2 main branches, 'essex' and 'folsom'
[2012-09-17 18:12:43 -0400] mattray: and 'folsom' will have support for pulling stuff from HEAD if you add it?
[2012-09-17 18:12:59 -0400] mattray: by default, 'folsom' will always be just folsom
[2012-09-17 18:13:16 -0400] mattray: but the capability you want to add, mixing versions, will be supported in that branch
[2012-09-17 18:13:54 -0400] mattray: I don't see a lot of value in adding the mixing versions in the 'essex' branch myself
[2012-09-17 18:14:10 -0400] mattray: unless we really want to try to keep branches mostly in sync
[2012-09-17 18:15:47 -0400] mattray: or we add the feature to 'essex', then branch afterward
[2012-09-17 18:20:53 -0400] carlp: hrm
[2012-09-17 18:22:36 -0400] carlp: Yeah, I was kind of hoping for long term convergence
[2012-09-17 18:22:48 -0400] carlp: maybe I'm just crazy :)
[2012-09-17 18:24:21 -0400] carlp: I think having one branch, long term, would make it easier for migrating forward but again, I may be crazy
[2012-09-17 18:24:42 -0400] carlp: I'll build on a branch for now, and we can recombine later
[2012-09-17 18:26:15 -0400] mattray: I can see the argument either way
[2012-09-17 18:26:47 -0400] carlp: yeah, I can too :)
[2012-09-17 18:27:47 -0400] carlp: OK, so keep using the namespaced versions.  The folsom branch will support packages and git refs for now (packages first, git later).  Anything else we need to touch on?
[2012-09-17 18:30:50 -0400] mattray: not especially. I'm re-syncing with rcbops right now, then doing a quick test to make sure it still "works", then releasing to the Opscode community site as versions "5.0.0"
[2012-09-17 18:31:02 -0400] mattray: Folsom stuff will start with version 6.0.0
[2012-09-17 18:31:24 -0400] mattray: I plan on doing some clean ups and documentation
[2012-09-17 18:31:29 -0400] mattray: this week, then swift
[2012-09-17 18:34:52 -0400] carlp: Cool
[2012-09-17 18:36:56 -0400] carlp: I will send out a response to your weekly summary email this week with Folsom status
[2012-09-17 18:49:51 -0400] mattray: perfect, thanks
