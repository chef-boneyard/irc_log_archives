[2012-09-26 02:49:50 -0400] carlp: mattray: you around?
[2012-09-26 02:50:04 -0400] mattray: yeah
[2012-09-26 02:50:14 -0400] carlp: Now I have a glance question :)
[2012-09-26 02:50:21 -0400] mattray: ruh-roh
[2012-09-26 02:50:36 -0400] carlp: It's trying to register the registry service, but cannot lookup the keystone IP
[2012-09-26 02:50:55 -0400] carlp: I'm not sure where the breakdown is in osops-utils foo
[2012-09-26 02:51:30 -0400] carlp: It finds the port fine, but the host is blank and tracing through ip_management is making my head hurt
[2012-09-26 02:52:40 -0400] carlp: got any ideas? (the keystone and glance instances are on different machines if that helps/hurts any)
[2012-09-26 03:11:23 -0400] mattray: nothing jumps out, but I've been running them on the same machine :/
[2012-09-26 03:11:48 -0400] mattray: I'd probably start by dropping a ton of logging into osops-utils and glance cookbooks
