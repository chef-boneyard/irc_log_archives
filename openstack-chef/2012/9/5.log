[2012-09-05 20:06:44 -0400] retr0h: mattray: when will 1.2.0 spiceweasel be released... running inot (https://github.com/mattray/spiceweasel/pull/17)
[2012-09-05 20:07:15 -0400] mattray: I wanted to try some stuff, but I guess I should just push out all the fixes
[2012-09-05 20:07:42 -0400] retr0h: well can always just push out the fixes into a . release :/
[2012-09-05 20:08:28 -0400] retr0h: I kinda think issue 17 makes spiceweasel unusable
[2012-09-05 20:08:34 -0400] retr0h: darn nginx cookbook :)
[2012-09-05 20:09:24 -0400] mattray: ok, I'll move this to the top of my development stack
[2012-09-05 20:09:53 -0400] retr0h: no problem... was curious when it was going to be fixed..  kindaly reminding :)
[2012-09-05 21:39:10 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: is there a normal -- i.e. not Chef -- way to only install chef-client on a machine? In other words, can I apt-get install chef-client in some way?
[2012-09-05 21:39:32 -0400] mattray: http://apt.opscode.com/dists/
[2012-09-05 21:39:43 -0400] mattray: make sure you use the 0.10 repos
[2012-09-05 21:42:33 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: only the client, not the server...
[2012-09-05 21:43:16 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I'm looking at http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installing+Chef+Client+on+Ubuntu+or+Debian
[2012-09-05 21:43:29 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: and unless I'm mistaken, that looks to install the server, too?
[2012-09-05 21:44:00 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: course I could be mistaken :) I usually am :)
[2012-09-05 21:45:23 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: nm. I'm mistaken clearly...
[2012-09-05 21:45:25 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: it looks like the Chef package is the client
[2012-09-05 21:45:27 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: sorry for the bother!
[2012-09-05 21:45:34 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I was confused.
[2012-09-05 21:45:44 -0400] mattray: apt-get install chef
[2012-09-05 21:45:55 -0400] mattray: looking at the depends, it isn't the server
[2012-09-05 21:46:13 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: right, I was mistaken. sorry bro
[2012-09-05 21:46:19 -0400] mattray: yeah, there's a chef-server package. No worries :)
[2012-09-05 22:09:01 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: just tried doing a sudo gem install spiceweasel... got this:
[2012-09-05 22:09:01 -0400] jaypipes: jpipes@uberbox:~/repos/att-cloud/chef-repo$ spiceweasel infrastructure.yml

[2012-09-05 22:09:05 -0400] jaypipes: any ideas?
[2012-09-05 22:09:52 -0400] mattray: anything show up with debug?
[2012-09-05 22:10:10 -0400] mattray: or at least, if you say "spiceweasel -v"
[2012-09-05 22:10:39 -0400] jaypipes: one sec
[2012-09-05 22:10:51 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: no, same output.
[2012-09-05 22:11:10 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: so spiceweasel just isn't working with 1.8 at all?
[2012-09-05 22:11:32 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I have no idea :(
[2012-09-05 22:11:38 -0400] mattray: checking
[2012-09-05 22:11:39 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I don't know crap about gems.
[2012-09-05 22:11:52 -0400] mattray: I don't know much more, but I'll help you debug
[2012-09-05 22:12:11 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: which ruby are you using?

[2012-09-05 22:27:05 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: 1.1.2 works just fine with my 1.8.7, is /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/spiceweasel-1.1.2 there?
[2012-09-05 22:27:53 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: I'm wondering if there's something missing?
[2012-09-05 22:28:12 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: which Linux are you using, maybe I could try to recreate

[2012-09-05 22:29:42 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: nope, I can't execute just gem install spiceweasel without hitting a permission error
[2012-09-05 22:30:00 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: did you do it with sudo?

[2012-09-05 22:30:49 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: yes, I have to do it with sudo (the gem install)
[2012-09-05 22:30:55 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: otherwise, gets a permission error
[2012-09-05 22:31:06 -0400] mattray: I'm firing up a 12.04 vm
[2012-09-05 22:31:57 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: thx man
[2012-09-05 22:34:12 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: how did you install ruby?
[2012-09-05 22:34:17 -0400] mattray: I want to recreate your setup
[2012-09-05 22:34:42 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I believe it was installed when I apt-get install chef'd.
[2012-09-05 22:34:56 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: following these instructions: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installing+Chef+Client+on+Ubuntu+or+Debian
[2012-09-05 22:35:03 -0400] mattray: ok, lemme recreate exactly
[2012-09-05 22:36:41 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: thx for your help man.
[2012-09-05 22:36:54 -0400] mattray: np, I think I saw this once before
[2012-09-05 22:37:22 -0400] mattray: permissions in Ubuntu, or maybe things weren't getting into the right places
[2012-09-05 22:37:44 -0400] mattray: I'll see if I can recreate, then get a new spiceweasel out to make retr0h happy
[2012-09-05 22:42:35 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: interesting...

[2012-09-05 22:47:33 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: but it says on that page something about gem author uploading with wrong permissions?
[2012-09-05 22:47:33 -0400] mattray: I fixed a perms problem on an earlier release (probably that one)
[2012-09-05 22:47:40 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: not sure ... shooting in the dark :)
[2012-09-05 22:47:41 -0400] mattray: but it could have come back
[2012-09-05 22:47:44 -0400] mattray: I'll double-check
[2012-09-05 22:47:47 -0400] mattray: gotta run now
