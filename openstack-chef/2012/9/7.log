[2012-09-07 19:18:50 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: trying to use the jenkins_job resource provider of the chef-jenkins cookbook in a separate cookbook.
[2012-09-07 19:19:24 -0400] mattray: add the jenkins cookbook as a dependency in the metadata.rb
[2012-09-07 19:19:37 -0400] mattray: then you can use "jenkins_job" in your cookbook
[2012-09-07 19:20:07 -0400] mattray: the terminology is that the jenkins cookbook is providing a "Light Weight Resource Provider" or "LWRP"
