[2012-09-24 18:58:21 -0400] Aaton: mattray: do you have a simple omnigraffle of what you network looks like based on the  environments/production.rb
[2012-09-24 18:58:41 -0400] mattray: No, but that's a good idea
[2012-09-24 18:58:57 -0400] mattray: my network is pretty simple right now, since the Swift one isn't on
[2012-09-24 18:59:42 -0400] mattray: eth0 is 10.0.111.x, 10.0.111.1 is Internet gateway
[2012-09-24 19:00:05 -0400] mattray: eth1 is 10.0.200.x private network with dhcp
[2012-09-24 19:00:17 -0400] mattray: 10.0.200.1 is dd-wrt router doing dhcp
[2012-09-24 19:00:48 -0400] mattray: 10.0.111.1 is also dd-wrt. 10.0.111.3 is pxe-boot server
[2012-09-24 19:02:48 -0400] Aaton: interesting. I'
[2012-09-24 19:11:51 -0400] Aaton: m looking at the naming convention the osops_networks section uses and for my setup I must still have it wrong. I also only have one real interface and have to create two vlan's. so eth2 is my private / control / management (actual physical server on a 10.8.x.x ). Then osops_networks -> public = a real public IP range (not RFC 1918 on br100). The osops_networks -> management = 10.9.x.x (br101)
