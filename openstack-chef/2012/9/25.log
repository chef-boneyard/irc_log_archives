[2012-09-25 20:00:09 -0400] carlp: mattray: you around?
[2012-09-25 20:00:24 -0400] mattray: carlp: yeah, fixing knife-hp at the moment
[2012-09-25 20:00:48 -0400] carlp: I was wondering if you can point me in the right direction with a problem I'm having
[2012-09-25 20:01:15 -0400] carlp: glance is trying to include mysql::ruby and it's dying with the oh-so-helpful "TypeError: can't convert nil into String"
[2012-09-25 20:03:33 -0400] carlp: I know the mysql cookbook is your favorite piece of the code in the world, too....
[2012-09-25 20:08:09 -0400] mattray: carlp: maybe a gist or 2 for context?
[2012-09-25 20:08:17 -0400] mattray: the stacktrace
[2012-09-25 20:08:24 -0400] mattray: and run it with chef-client -ldebug
[2012-09-25 20:10:32 -0400] carlp: ok, one sec
[2012-09-25 20:19:38 -0400] carlp: well, our internet just broke
[2012-09-25 20:19:46 -0400] carlp: trying to find a way to get this file up to gist
[2012-09-25 20:37:37 -0400] carlp: mattray: http://pastebin.com/kvE99hjN
[2012-09-25 20:40:13 -0400] carlp: let me know if you need more than that
[2012-09-25 20:45:55 -0400] mattray: carlp: hmmm I think that's a bug in 10.14.2
[2012-09-25 20:46:14 -0400] mattray: there's a rc for 10.14.4 available
[2012-09-25 20:47:05 -0400] mattray: 1 sec, I'll get you the command
[2012-09-25 20:50:23 -0400] carlp: thanks!
[2012-09-25 20:50:44 -0400] mattray: carlp: on that node with the failure, upgrade the chef-gem with this "/opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install --pre chef"
[2012-09-25 20:50:51 -0400] mattray: and then re-run it
[2012-09-25 20:50:59 -0400] mattray: let me know if that fixes it
[2012-09-25 21:53:00 -0400] carlp: mattray: that did it!
[2012-09-25 21:53:22 -0400] mattray: I think 10.14.4 is releasing today or tomorrow
[2012-09-25 22:14:10 -0400] carlp: cool, good to know
