[2012-09-10 11:16:51 -0400] mancdaz: trying to use the latest mysql cookbook, 1.3.0, and getting 'LoadError: no such file to load -- mysql'
[2012-09-10 11:17:34 -0400] mancdaz: am also using the latest database cookbook with it (1.3.4)
[2012-09-10 11:19:29 -0400] mancdaz: I gather it's failing to install the mysql gem but I'm not sure why
[2012-09-10 15:08:36 -0400] mancdaz: hey can anyone help me with some issues I'm having with the latest mysql cookbook?
[2012-09-10 16:03:10 -0400] jaypipes: mancdaz: I can try..
[2012-09-10 16:03:24 -0400] mancdaz: ah jaypipes great thanks
[2012-09-10 16:03:44 -0400] mancdaz: I've updated our cookbooks to use the latest mysql cookbook from opscode
[2012-09-10 16:03:55 -0400] mancdaz: which installs the mysql gem in a different way to the older one we were using
[2012-09-10 16:04:13 -0400] mancdaz: but I'm getting the error 'LoadError: no such file to load -- mysql'
[2012-09-10 16:04:22 -0400] mancdaz: I gather it's failing to install the mysql gem but I'm not sure why
[2012-09-10 16:04:33 -0400] mancdaz: this is using the latest mysql and database cookbooks
[2012-09-10 16:04:50 -0400] jaypipes: hmmm...
[2012-09-10 16:05:16 -0400] jaypipes: LoadError usually has something to do with failed depends in the metadata.rb
[2012-09-10 16:05:24 -0400] jaypipes: lemme look at the upstream cookbook.
[2012-09-10 16:06:03 -0400] mancdaz: thanks
[2012-09-10 16:08:16 -0400] jaypipes: mancdaz: what does ls -alh /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/mysql-2.7/lib print?
[2012-09-10 16:26:09 -0400] mancdaz: jaypipes: I'm using the chef omnibus installed chef-client with embedded ruby
[2012-09-10 16:26:27 -0400] mancdaz: but there is  no mysql gem in /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems
[2012-09-10 16:27:44 -0400] jaypipes: mancdaz: then I would bet that's your prblem :) I would file an Issue on GitHub (or is it Jira that opsocode uses now?) about it.
[2012-09-10 16:28:55 -0400] mancdaz: yeah so it should be installing the gem as part of the cookbook run
[2012-09-10 16:29:31 -0400] mancdaz: or shuld I perhaps be calling the recipe to install the gem myself?
[2012-09-10 16:31:59 -0400] jaypipes: mancdaz: nah, the mysql/database cookbook should be handling that properly, and clearly it isn't...
[2012-09-10 16:32:22 -0400] mancdaz: ok cool. ta muchly
[2012-09-10 17:30:18 -0400] retr0h: its prob the new chef_gem stuff
[2012-09-10 18:10:59 -0400] retr0h: matt gone today?
[2012-09-10 18:19:39 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h: just emailed him.. not sure
[2012-09-10 18:24:35 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde: yo... AFAIK, https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/keystone was going to be the upstream cookbook in matt ray's openstack cookbook repo, right?
[2012-09-10 18:25:08 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde: if so, I'm going to give a go at getting it cleaned up a bit and pull request'd to matt's keystone cookbook repo
[2012-09-10 18:49:06 -0400] retr0h: mattray: wewt!
[2012-09-10 18:49:07 -0400] retr0h: :P
[2012-09-10 18:50:45 -0400] rackerjoe: mattray: Do you have any insight into http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2427?
[2012-09-10 18:55:03 -0400] mattray: rackerjoe: nope
[2012-09-10 18:55:55 -0400] mattray: read the backlog
[2012-09-10 18:55:57 -0400] mattray: retr0h: dealing with family stuff this morning, I'm in for a few more hours
[2012-09-10 18:56:46 -0400] retr0h: mattray: any idea when/if the openssh config stuff will be pulled in (https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/openssh/pulls)
[2012-09-10 18:58:21 -0400] retr0h: I have some changes I'd like to add in, but looks like there are 2 pull req for basically same thing...  (pull/2) actually looks better, was hoping you guys had some insight as to when...
[2012-09-10 18:59:52 -0400] mattray: retr0h: I'd ping jtimberman, he's the keeper of the cookbooks. I tend to poke a few now and then
[2012-09-10 19:08:11 -0400] retr0h: ok i'll hit him up
[2012-09-10 19:08:12 -0400] retr0h: thx
[2012-09-10 20:51:09 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: OK, so retr0h and I have been discussing how to get the keystone cookbook into a place where it does not depends on the osops-utils cookbook or its IP management.
[2012-09-10 20:51:53 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: basically, we believe it should be possible to just have the URIs configurable without mucking with dnsmasq or trying to allocate an IP based on some other library...
[2012-09-10 20:51:58 -0400] mattray: there was discussion in LA about using the Environment to override the searches done by osops-utils
[2012-09-10 20:52:12 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: in other words, having the keystone cookbook *assume* the network and DNS is already set up.
[2012-09-10 20:52:23 -0400] mattray: yeah, same result
[2012-09-10 20:52:46 -0400] mattray: check the Environment to see if it's set, search otherwise?
[2012-09-10 20:52:49 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: would you be amenable to that if we pull request'd a change?
[2012-09-10 20:53:27 -0400] mattray: yeah, I think so. I'd like to update the osops-utils to have that logic
[2012-09-10 20:53:37 -0400] mattray: so it's reusable other places besides keystone
[2012-09-10 20:54:00 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: ok
[2012-09-10 20:54:08 -0400] mattray: cool, looking forward to it
[2012-09-10 20:54:31 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: cheers
[2012-09-10 21:21:26 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: retr0h: done with the spiceweasel cookbook, I'll push it
[2012-09-10 21:22:28 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: thx man!
[2012-09-10 21:23:14 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/mattray/spiceweasel-cookbook
[2012-09-10 21:25:48 -0400] mattray: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/spiceweasel
[2012-09-10 21:25:54 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde, galstrom: ping
[2012-09-10 21:27:22 -0400] galstrom: jaypipes: pong
[2012-09-10 21:27:53 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: heyo. so I'm trying to figure something out in the osops-utils/libraries/ip_location.rb file...
[2012-09-10 21:28:05 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: specifically line 160
[2012-09-10 21:28:41 -0400] galstrom: ok
[2012-09-10 21:28:46 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: it looks to me that even if the entry returned from get_config_endpoint() has a "host" key in it, then it just gets overwritten on line 162.
[2012-09-10 21:29:09 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: is that on purpose or should line 160 really be if not retval.has_key?("host")?
[2012-09-10 21:29:27 -0400] galstrom: um.. line 160 is a comment
[2012-09-10 21:29:56 -0400] jaypipes: oh, duh... sorry, :)
[2012-09-10 21:30:10 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: I'd made some changes.. lemme get the line nums from github... one sec
[2012-09-10 21:31:01 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: https://github.com/mattray/osops-utils/blob/master/libraries/ip_location.rb#L145
[2012-09-10 21:31:08 -0400] galstrom: ok..
[2012-09-10 21:31:13 -0400] jaypipes: is what I was referring to..
[2012-09-10 21:31:15 -0400] galstrom: so host and uri are derived values
[2012-09-10 21:31:37 -0400] galstrom: host is the ip that corresponds to the correct network declaration for that service
[2012-09-10 21:32:03 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: but lines 126 and 130 can set the host in get_config_endpoint(), but those values are always overridden in line 145...
[2012-09-10 21:32:41 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: overridden on line 147, sorry
[2012-09-10 21:34:30 -0400] galstrom: so the host value in line 129 is probably there as an artifact ..
[2012-09-10 21:35:03 -0400] galstrom: might have been provided by node attributes at one point.. was probably not removed.. when we moved to the derived host/lookup method in line 147
[2012-09-10 21:35:30 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: ah, I see...
[2012-09-10 21:36:24 -0400] galstrom: that is the only reason i can see for that bit in get_config_endpoint
[2012-09-10 21:36:57 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: well, one of the things I am working on is decoupling the need for osops-utils/ip_location from the keystone (and other openstack cookbooks). I'm working on a patch that, if the "host" or "uri" keys are already set in the nodeish arg, then just return the node hash. this is so we can use the keystone cookbook with an already-allocated-and-configured network.
[2012-09-10 21:37:19 -0400] galstrom: ah
[2012-09-10 21:37:29 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: and where we already have the DNS names for service endpoints configured
[2012-09-10 21:37:36 -0400] galstrom: gotcha
[2012-09-10 21:38:04 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: so basically, I'm adding some short-circuits to the routines in the ip_location lib to do just that...
[2012-09-10 21:38:28 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: and noticed that they'd get overridden in this line and wasn't sure the reason :)
[2012-09-10 21:50:59 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: also, related to the keystone cookbook. would you guys (RCB) be amenable to replacing the create_db_and_user() resource with the database cookbook's database_user and database_db resources? That way, wouldn't be pinned to MySQL...
[2012-09-10 21:51:58 -0400] galstrom: jaypipes: i dont think we would have any issue with accepting that patch
[2012-09-10 21:51:59 -0400] galstrom: :)
[2012-09-10 21:52:19 -0400] jaypipes: coolio. :) thx galstrom
[2012-09-10 21:52:24 -0400] retr0h: wewt
[2012-09-10 21:52:27 -0400] galstrom: jaypipes: np
[2012-09-10 22:04:04 -0400] rpedde: jaypipes: I think the line 124-133 stuff was that if an endpoint was more easily expressed as a URI (or was a valid scheme) you could express it that way, otherwise you'd express host/port/etc and the uri would be derived
[2012-09-10 22:04:26 -0400] rpedde: jaypipes: as far as overriding hard-coded stuff, it should be doing that, but I think L145 has an inverted test
[2012-09-10 22:04:54 -0400] rpedde: jaypipes: sorry so late... was asleep at the wheel...
[2012-09-10 22:05:00 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde: :) no probs!
[2012-09-10 22:05:28 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde, galstrom: FYI, proposed change to keystone-cookbook to make the IP lookup optional if overridden in the node attrs... https://github.com/mattray/keystone/pull/1/files
[2012-09-10 22:07:09 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: I'll try to merge this tonight
[2012-09-10 22:07:55 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: cool. would be great to get rpedde and galstrom input on it... since I plan to do a similar patch to other openstack cookbooks as neeeded
[2012-09-10 22:08:32 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde: FYI, this is just so we (AT&T) can just set these host values in our role and envionrment definition files, since our network and DNS is managed/configured already before we run chef-client
[2012-09-10 22:08:37 -0400] rpedde: jaypipes: I think if you swap the sense of the test in L145, all the external resource stuff Just Works (tm)
[2012-09-10 22:10:07 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde: well, no need to change the osops_utils cookbook (yet) ;)
[2012-09-10 22:12:36 -0400] rpedde: jaypipes: I think if you ask osops_utils what the endpoint for a service is and it doesn't return the right value, then the fix needs to be in osops_utils
[2012-09-10 22:13:36 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde: gotcha... and, correct me if I'm wrong, if the nodeish passed to osops_utils::ip_location routines contains a "host" or "uri" key, the library should not edit it?
[2012-09-10 22:13:57 -0400] mattray: gotta run, I'll read the log of this chat later
[2012-09-10 22:14:00 -0400] jaypipes: kk
[2012-09-10 22:14:08 -0400] rpedde: jaypipes: Except for the flopped test in L145 yeah
[2012-09-10 22:14:35 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde: OK. alright, I'll push a patch to osops_utils then instead.
[2012-09-10 22:15:01 -0400] rpedde: jaypipes: although that whole thing has grown unreadable, I think the idea of saying "tell me where to connect to glance" isn't a totally fail idea
[2012-09-10 22:15:13 -0400] rpedde: could be wrong.  <shrug>
[2012-09-10 22:16:07 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde: oh, I don't disagree :) my point is that if that decision has already been configured -- i.e. there is already a server called glance.example.com on my network -- no reason to look up what the host is again ;)
[2012-09-10 22:16:07 -0400] rpedde: jaypipes: there is a lot of wrong there, and I'd have no issues with less-wronging it.  :)  So fix away!
[2012-09-10 22:16:47 -0400] jaypipes: rpedde: I just wanted to make sure I wasn't reading the code incorrectly, but you and galstrom got me straight. :)
[2012-09-10 22:17:22 -0400] rpedde: jaypipes: bottom line is it *should* work that way already.  If not, that's bugged.  (unpossible!)
