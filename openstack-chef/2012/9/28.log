[2012-09-28 15:52:05 -0400] mattray: just a heads up Ubuntu 12.04 users there's a bug in 10.14.4 Omnibus that breaks knife and shef, they're tracking it down now
[2012-09-28 15:52:28 -0400] mattray: if you don't use shef or knife from your boxes, no problems :)
[2012-09-28 19:55:15 -0400] japage: what makes the most sense for general purpose networking in folsom? quantum + openvswitch + 2 physical nics?
[2012-09-28 20:12:58 -0400] mattray: not sure yet, but probably openvswitch
[2012-09-28 20:13:14 -0400] mattray: isn't there an even more vanilla option?
[2012-09-28 20:18:27 -0400] mattray: debugging osops-utils again :(
[2012-09-28 20:18:53 -0400] mattray: I find it helpful to turn all the debug logging into info
[2012-09-28 20:56:20 -0400] mattray: rpedded: apparently I missed that you guys started using mysql-openstack and rabbitmq-openstack to define the services :(
