[2012-12-28 14:07:21 -0500] josanabr: I wonder if a sequel of steps are suggested for installing OpenStack in a bunch of servers
[2012-12-28 14:08:07 -0500] josanabr: my setup consists of four blades
[2012-12-28 14:08:21 -0500] josanabr: each blade has Ubuntu Server 12.04
[2012-12-28 14:08:24 -0500] josanabr: just that
[2012-12-28 14:08:41 -0500] josanabr: what steps from there I should take?
[2012-12-28 14:10:11 -0500] josanabr: ok, sorry, I have to leave but I look after you later ;-)
