[2012-12-03 03:18:27 -0500] jtran: where do i find more information on opscode's offering for openstack-chef?  is it a repo?  is it a custom hosted chef ?  what is it?   All I see is this but it's vague:  http://www.opscode.com/solutions/chef-openstack/
[2012-12-03 03:23:21 -0500] ctracey: jtran, https://github.com/opscode/openstack-chef-repo
[2012-12-03 03:23:29 -0500] jtran: ctracey: thanks!
[2012-12-03 03:25:00 -0500] ctracey: also some folks from Rackspace in here .  They have a repo as well: https://github.com/rcbops/chef-cookbooks
[2012-12-03 03:35:36 -0500] jtran: ctracey: ah, nice.  thx
[2012-12-03 03:36:13 -0500] ctracey: np
[2012-12-03 14:46:21 -0500] odyssey4me: good afternoon all
[2012-12-03 17:46:19 -0500] jtran: using rcbops repo, how do i use folsom?   Precise and lower do not have folsom packages ,   yet if I use Quantal w/ rcbops, i have problems w/ ppa missing for it
[2012-12-03 17:50:26 -0500] wkelly: jtran: rcbops uses cloudarchive for folsom on precise
[2012-12-03 17:50:29 -0500] wkelly: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/CloudArchive
[2012-12-03 17:50:46 -0500] wkelly: you should be able to run the repos on precise, but we haven't tested on quantal
[2012-12-03 17:50:49 -0500] jtran: wkelly: ah that explains it !  Thanks!
[2012-12-03 17:50:55 -0500] wkelly: no problem!
[2012-12-03 18:03:59 -0500] rackerjoe: jtran: you need to set the environment variable override_defaults: package_component: folsom
[2012-12-03 18:04:19 -0500] jtran: rackerjoe: definitely.
[2012-12-03 18:07:10 -0500] jtran: oh, so this is a more broad question about chef than openstack ,    when i have an environments override a default attribute, it doesn't really behave like an override instead it behaves more like "prepend the array with the variable" .   so for example if i change attribute 'openssh['listen_interfaces']'   to 'eth0' instead of the default 'bond0'   ,    when i look at the opens['listen_interfaces']  in my recipe, it is an a
[2012-12-03 18:07:10 -0500] jtran: [eth0, bond0] instead of expected [eth0].  Is there a way to truly override by overWRITE ?
[2012-12-03 18:24:40 -0500] mattray: jtran: are you mixing overrides? Make the environment an override and make the attribute a default
[2012-12-03 18:24:56 -0500] mattray: they merge if they're the same
[2012-12-03 18:25:11 -0500] mattray: but if you have an override and a default, you should get the override
[2012-12-03 18:25:31 -0500] jtran: the default attribute was defined in a role, in my case
[2012-12-03 18:25:45 -0500] jtran: and then i specified an override in my environment json
[2012-12-03 18:30:04 -0500] jtran: mattray:  for clarification,   if the default attribute was specified in a role json,  and if I create an override in my environment json,   is that the right way to do it?
[2012-12-03 18:30:22 -0500] mattray: jtran:  yes
[2012-12-03 18:30:28 -0500] jtran: hmm.. that's what i'm doing
[2012-12-03 18:30:34 -0500] mattray: that's odd
[2012-12-03 18:31:04 -0500] jtran: indeed.  let me come up with a simplified test case and get back to you.  the repo i'm pulling it from is complicated
[2012-12-03 18:31:11 -0500] jtran: thanks for the help
[2012-12-03 18:44:19 -0500] mattray: off to jury duty.
[2012-12-03 18:46:05 -0500] jaypipes: jtran: where is the stuff you are working on? in the att-cloud repo?
[2012-12-03 18:48:17 -0500] jaypipes: wkelly: you guys using Keystone with PKI yet?
[2012-12-03 18:58:51 -0500] jtran: jaypipes:  i'm doing all of it!   att-cloud rcbops openstack-chef
[2012-12-03 18:59:33 -0500] jaypipes: jtran: for ceilo?
[2012-12-03 18:59:41 -0500] jtran: jaypipes: right.
[2012-12-03 19:00:14 -0500] jaypipes: jtran: you are creating a new cookbook or a new recipe in the nova cookbook (recommend the latter until the nova deps in Ceilo are decoupled)
[2012-12-03 19:00:34 -0500] jtran: jaypipes: new recipe
[2012-12-03 19:01:04 -0500] jaypipes: jtran: coolio.
[2012-12-03 19:01:39 -0500] jtran: jaypipes:  i got the recipes down, pretty simple  but the dilemma in all repo cases is getting it to deployed 'allinone'
[2012-12-03 19:01:43 -0500] jtran: to test out those rcipes
[2012-12-03 19:02:09 -0500] jtran: i got furthest w/ rcbops but i ran into a wall cuz I was running on Quantal and it complained about missing ppas for some package for that distro
[2012-12-03 19:02:13 -0500] jaypipes: jtran: sorry, not quite following you... how are you doing your testing?
[2012-12-03 19:02:38 -0500] jtran: by installing all the appropriate roles to launch all the necessary components
[2012-12-03 19:02:46 -0500] jaypipes: jtran: we decoupled all our Openstack cookbooks from osops-utils to get away from the IP management stuff... I think it's worth checking out what we've done.
[2012-12-03 19:02:53 -0500] jtran: jaypipes:  yes, i know :)
[2012-12-03 19:03:23 -0500] jtran: jaypipes:  our repo is a lot diff.   a lot.  i had a lot of issues w/ it cuz i think it makes a lot of assumptions based on the framework we use to pxe the nodes
[2012-12-03 19:03:31 -0500] jtran: that would not exist in a vm
[2012-12-03 19:03:47 -0500] jaypipes: jtran: that's exactly the opposite of reality. :)
[2012-12-03 19:04:04 -0500] jaypipes: jtran: the RCBops repo makes lots of assumptions about networking. ours don't.
[2012-12-03 19:04:49 -0500] jaypipes: jtran: ours don't rely on "named networks" like "public" and "private" and allow folks to use DNS names for stuff instead of hardcoding networks and IP blocks
[2012-12-03 19:05:26 -0500] jtran: jaypipes:   probably true, i haven't run into issues w/ that one but i'lll pm you on some of the issues i ran into thus far.
[2012-12-03 19:05:43 -0500] jaypipes: jtran: coolio.
[2012-12-03 19:05:46 -0500] jtran: thanks jaypipes
[2012-12-03 19:06:16 -0500] jaypipes: jtran: we also support VLAN networking, unlike the RCB ones.
[2012-12-03 19:06:37 -0500] jtran: jaypipes: nice!
[2012-12-03 22:14:17 -0500] mattray: http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/12/03/test-kitchen-0-7-0-released/
[2012-12-03 22:14:34 -0500] mattray: OpenStack test runner now included, I'm working on it a bit
[2012-12-03 22:44:19 -0500] jtran: mattray: should've called it "Hell's Kitchen"
[2012-12-03 22:44:24 -0500] jtran: ;)
