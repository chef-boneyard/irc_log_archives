[2014-07-11 02:06:11 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-object-storage: Updating Berks to 2.0.18  https://review.openstack.org/105902
[2014-07-11 10:01:45 -0400] openstackgerrit: Ma Wen Cheng proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: Add a SSL configuration item  https://review.openstack.org/105399

[2014-07-11 15:14:52 -0400] markvan: mattray: Was this the idea you were mentioning about "senitive"  tags.  This seems like resource level, not at attribute level.  https://github.com/opscode/chef/pull/1220
[2014-07-11 15:15:12 -0400] openstackgerrit: JJ Asghar proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: This is JJs first test to get higher unit testing  https://review.openstack.org/106397
[2014-07-11 15:15:19 -0400] j^2: :D
[2014-07-11 15:15:38 -0400] mattray: markvan: yeah, it was on the resource
[2014-07-11 15:15:52 -0400] mattray: markvan: so diffs of config files don't show up
[2014-07-11 15:16:09 -0400] mattray: hiding attributes will be harder
[2014-07-11 15:16:18 -0400] j^2: running specs yesterday, i noticed there were some low hanging fruit for me to get my hands dirty with the unit testnig
[2014-07-11 15:16:27 -0400] j^2: that's no my TODO now :-/
[2014-07-11 15:16:29 -0400] j^2: :D
[2014-07-11 15:16:31 -0400] markvan: mattray: so since we have passwords in almost all of the conf files for openstack, all of them would be marked as senitive?
[2014-07-11 15:16:58 -0400] mattray: markvan: potentially
[2014-07-11 15:17:28 -0400] mattray: I guess the question is can the user running chef-client be trusted?
[2014-07-11 15:17:37 -0400] markvan: Is there an issue open for hiding senitive attributes at least in the logs?
[2014-07-11 15:17:44 -0400] PaulCzar_: mattray: Ive never trusted that root guy myself
[2014-07-11 15:18:03 -0400] mattray: PaulCzar_: praise dog!
[2014-07-11 15:18:20 -0400] mattray: markvan: not that I'm aware of
[2014-07-11 15:18:43 -0400] mattray: markvan: having an attribute make things :sensitive everywhere it's used?
[2014-07-11 15:19:30 -0400] mattray: because that attribute will be written to the node, which can be accessed via search
[2014-07-11 15:20:07 -0400] mattray: so perhaps node attributes aren't exactly what you want?
[2014-07-11 15:20:47 -0400] markvan: humm, yeah, maybe a bit more narrow, like for templates, at least being able to mark a sub variable as senitive for logging, rendering, diffing?
[2014-07-11 15:21:21 -0400] markvan: The senitive resouce change seems a bit high level for just a passwod in a file, like openrc.
[2014-07-11 15:30:24 -0400] mattray: there would probably be a way to have a list of attributes that you mark as "sensitive", then finds Resources that access them and marks those as 'sensitive'. But it still leaves them exposed by search
[2014-07-11 15:37:25 -0400] markvan: With the indirect variables passed into templates, it would have to be tagged at the variable level since they are not attributes.
[2014-07-11 15:38:14 -0400] markvan: Was there work done to hide certain strings  (passwords)  from the logs?   using regex searches or ?
[2014-07-11 15:57:15 -0400] mattray: I don't think there's been anything done. The "sensitive" flag is the first I've seen, so far we've taken the stance of "Chef is running as root and deals with sensitive materials, act accordingly with your permissions and logs"

[2014-07-11 16:01:51 -0400] markvan: mattray: thx for the updates
[2014-07-11 16:47:04 -0400] lrr: mattt: ping
[2014-07-11 16:49:14 -0400] mattray: great conversation over in #chef-hacking if you haven't been following along: https://botbot.me/freenode/chef-hacking/2014-07-11/?msg=17844104&page=1
[2014-07-11 16:49:50 -0400] lrr: mattt: i got an email back from erlang, they say the centos repo should be fixed now, however I don't have fast enough access to a machine/vm right now to try
[2014-07-11 17:10:10 -0400] mattt: lrr: let me try a build now
[2014-07-11 17:10:41 -0400] lrr: mattt: i'm doing a build right now, and it's on the erlang install and not failing out (so far)
[2014-07-11 17:11:14 -0400] lrr: woot! it installed
[2014-07-11 17:11:25 -0400] mattt: woo!
[2014-07-11 17:12:00 -0400] mattt: :P
[2014-07-11 17:12:32 -0400] mattt: well i've got a job running and centos is re-enabled, so let's see what happens
[2014-07-11 17:12:37 -0400] mattt: afk for a few
[2014-07-11 17:13:42 -0400] mattt: http://jenkins.uk.rs.wherenow.org/job/Stackforge_Cookbooks_AIO_Matrix/label=performance14-centos/1947/console incase anyone's curious
[2014-07-11 17:24:52 -0400] j^2: markvan: can you +2 https://review.openstack.org/106397 ?
[2014-07-11 19:26:42 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: allow unencrypted databags for storing secrets.  https://review.openstack.org/103934

[2014-07-11 21:18:51 -0400] markvan: mattt: do you know the bug # for that cinder delete issue?
[2014-07-11 21:21:30 -0400] lrr: woo! i have a working icehouse + nova network environment going :)
[2014-07-11 21:23:05 -0400] markvan: lrr: on centos or ?
[2014-07-11 21:23:50 -0400] lrr: centos
[2014-07-11 21:24:11 -0400] openstackgerrit: JJ Asghar proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: Got 100% test coverage for common  https://review.openstack.org/106499
[2014-07-11 21:24:28 -0400] lrr: the only hitch is that whenever I click the console tab on an instance, it won't show up. but if i clikc the link to show only the console (which opens in a new tab) the console works
[2014-07-11 21:24:34 -0400] lrr: but I had that issue in havana as well
[2014-07-11 21:25:02 -0400] markvan: yeah, I recall that same issue
[2014-07-11 21:26:27 -0400] mattt: markvan: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1087886
[2014-07-11 21:27:44 -0400] markvan: mattt: thx, I'll get my cinder guy to take a peek
[2014-07-11 21:30:09 -0400] mattt: markvan: it should be fixed, but the latest centos runs indicate otherwise
[2014-07-11 21:30:51 -0400] markvan: yeah, I see an abandoned patch for it, but have not dug to deep yet
[2014-07-11 21:31:41 -0400] markvan: looks like this in the one to look for: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/99784/
[2014-07-11 21:33:11 -0400] markvan: seems very tied to a specifc version of lvm, blah

[2014-07-11 21:49:51 -0400] mattt: markvan: we are getting an updated package but that fix def. does not address the bug i reported
[2014-07-11 21:56:27 -0400] j^2: \o/
[2014-07-11 21:56:35 -0400] j^2: had to update some specs to rspec3
[2014-07-11 21:56:45 -0400] j^2: falsey? really? come on
[2014-07-11 22:06:48 -0400] j^2: can anyone +2 https://review.openstack.org/106499 for me? :)
[2014-07-11 22:07:56 -0400] j^2: i'm gonna try to figure out a way to post the test coverage to the READMEs down the line too
[2014-07-11 22:08:23 -0400] j^2: it's cosmetic for the most part, but it's one of those nice things that i know adopters look for
