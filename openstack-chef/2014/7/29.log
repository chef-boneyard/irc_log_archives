[2014-07-29 15:21:35 -0400] j^2: where?
[2014-07-29 15:23:05 -0400] markvan: for all the branch changes, since galstrom_zzz and I are tag teaming on the patches.
[2014-07-29 15:23:15 -0400] j^2: oh nice
[2014-07-29 15:23:25 -0400] j^2: sorry havint had any caffiene yet, yeah i'll take a look
[2014-07-29 15:32:04 -0400] ianrossi: j^2, PaulCzar_ WIth stable/havana have you guys used (or seen others) use mostly nova-network or neutron with the openstack-chef-repo? I went with the default (nova-network) and I'm getting this error in the openstack-dashboard-error.log: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7895910/ I'm changing over to neutron now to see if this helps.
[2014-07-29 15:38:04 -0400] PaulCzar_: ianrossi: hrmmm,  those look like neutrn errors
[2014-07-29 15:38:23 -0400] j^2: markvan: ok, i think i'm going crazy, i cant find the identity change to confirm it's pushed though
[2014-07-29 15:38:44 -0400] PaulCzar_: ianrossi: what is that error log from ?
[2014-07-29 15:39:01 -0400] j^2: isnt: [Tue Jul 29 13:45:42 2014] [error] ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='10.0.0.101', port=8774): Max retries exceeded with url: /v2/ed344d5ea64744038443c530ed960929/os-simple-tenant-usage?start=2014-07-29T00:00:00&end=2014-07-29T23:59:59&detailed=1 (Caused by <class 'socket.error'>: [Errno 111] Connection refused)

[2014-07-29 15:40:47 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar_, that's from /var/log/apache2/openstack-dashboard-error.log
[2014-07-29 15:43:15 -0400] markvan: j^2: ah, welcome to core!
[2014-07-29 15:43:26 -0400] j^2: :D
[2014-07-29 15:44:19 -0400] PaulCzar_: ianrossi: oh  I never use horizon :)
[2014-07-29 15:44:27 -0400] markvan: the ops-db, ops-msg, dashboard, obj-storage are also ready for icehouse since they all just depend upon common.
[2014-07-29 15:44:51 -0400] ianrossi: Thanks j^2 that was an old error, I did solve that by setting bind_address, but now I'm dealing with the error at the very end of the log
[2014-07-29 15:44:52 -0400] PaulCzar_: ianrossi: check to see if the rest of the stuff works    `nova list,  `glance image-list` etc
[2014-07-29 15:45:08 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar_, Oh yeah, it's been awhile, checking the CLI now...
[2014-07-29 15:46:47 -0400] j^2: markvan: looking
[2014-07-29 15:47:06 -0400] PaulCzar_: ianrossi:   you might want to look over your API logs ( maybe even keystone ) for failed attempts at interacting with them from horizon.
[2014-07-29 15:51:42 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar_, j^2 I switched over to neutron and this is the error I'm seeing now in /var/log/apache2/openstack-dashboard-error.log: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7896052/ I'm still scouring other logs.
[2014-07-29 15:54:53 -0400] j^2: i think i have everything reviewed as we wait on identidy
[2014-07-29 16:00:01 -0400] markvan: j^2: ok, identity merged, I update the last few and get them out there.
[2014-07-29 16:00:09 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar_, j^2 Anybody know what the developer mode user/password is for the openstack-chef-repo?
[2014-07-29 16:00:15 -0400] j^2: markvan: rock on
[2014-07-29 16:01:11 -0400] PaulCzar_: ianrossi: developer mode passwords are always the same as the username ( i think )
[2014-07-29 16:02:04 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar_, OK, b/c I think I got into the dashboard with user/pass admin (but errors after login) but the CLI is telling me they are not valid creds.  :(
[2014-07-29 16:02:23 -0400] PaulCzar_: check your /root/openrc file ?
[2014-07-29 16:02:24 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar_, I just get "ERROR: Invalid OpenStack Nova credentials."
[2014-07-29 16:02:28 -0400] PaulCzar_: should have creds in it
[2014-07-29 16:02:30 -0400] ianrossi: OK
[2014-07-29 16:02:51 -0400] ianrossi: Oh yeah, there it is! PaulCzar_
[2014-07-29 16:03:00 -0400] ianrossi: Sourcing it!
[2014-07-29 16:03:57 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar_, Great, I'm getting all "nova endpoints" now, so stuff in general is working.
[2014-07-29 16:07:03 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar_, I can do "nova net-list" and get a blank list, looks like that's working, it's just that 404 unknow API version neutron error I'm getting in the dashboard log

[2014-07-29 17:43:42 -0400] markvan: j^2:   10.0.0 I think is correct for cookbooks own version, it's the depends 'openstack-common', '~> 10.0'   that only needs to for ~>.

[2014-07-29 20:28:29 -0400] markvan: j^2: time to start the juno merges? with common
[2014-07-29 20:28:43 -0400] j^2: looking
[2014-07-29 20:30:04 -0400] lrr: j^2: your gist link in the docs isn't working
[2014-07-29 20:30:10 -0400] lrr: "If you would like to pull down all the repositories to start playing around with them, https://gist.github.com/jjasghar/ef5410192f053ebdb6c0O"
[2014-07-29 20:30:18 -0400] j^2: shit
[2014-07-29 20:30:46 -0400] j^2: ok, ill figure it what happened
[2014-07-29 20:30:56 -0400] j^2: lrr: sorry about that
[2014-07-29 20:31:01 -0400] lrr: no worries :)
[2014-07-29 20:33:37 -0400] j^2: markvan: workflow pushed for common
[2014-07-29 20:34:01 -0400] lrr: j^2: if i want to work on something and have it go in master as well as stable/icehouse, what should the process look like?
[2014-07-29 20:35:22 -0400] j^2: ah
[2014-07-29 20:35:26 -0400] j^2: thats a great question
[2014-07-29 20:35:42 -0400] j^2: because they are two branches you can create the same patch, but youll need to commit against both branches
[2014-07-29 20:35:53 -0400] j^2: so itll be two reviews
[2014-07-29 20:35:59 -0400] lrr: ok :)
[2014-07-29 20:48:00 -0400] markvan: j^2:  last three for icehouse are ready now: https://review.openstack.org/#/q/status:open+branch:stable/icehouse+topic:bug/1349154,n,z
[2014-07-29 20:48:12 -0400] j^2: wow, you get these searching down pat
[2014-07-29 20:48:36 -0400] markvan: j^2: just hacking the url a bit...
[2014-07-29 20:48:53 -0400] j^2: you must love graphite then
[2014-07-29 20:49:06 -0400] j^2: thats all graphite hacking URLs
[2014-07-29 20:49:32 -0400] markvan: j^2: ;)
[2014-07-29 20:50:09 -0400] markvan: j^2:  what about the openstack-chef-repo  branch for icehouse?  that would be the last step and were almost there for icehouse.
[2014-07-29 20:51:00 -0400] j^2: i still havent been able to get the chef-repo to work with vagrant vagrant-chef-zero et al. im really close with chef-metal, but the main dev is on vacation so i cant poke him to fix it till then
[2014-07-29 20:51:55 -0400] j^2: i was hoping that chef-metal and stable/icehouse was gonna be the first
[2014-07-29 20:52:19 -0400] j^2: i personally cant test stable/icehouse till vagrant ridely and all that crap is fixed
[2014-07-29 20:52:33 -0400] j^2: for the chef-repo that is
[2014-07-29 20:53:18 -0400] markvan: j^2: ok.  I'll have to learn more about metal.
[2014-07-29 20:53:26 -0400] j^2: oh man its awesome
[2014-07-29 20:53:40 -0400] j^2: this is my WIP repo: https://github.com/jjasghar/singlestack
[2014-07-29 20:54:09 -0400] j^2: read https://github.com/opscode/chef-metal s readme and you can see what im trying to do
[2014-07-29 20:54:12 -0400] markvan: j^2: juno common went in, so galstrom_zzz can start to unblock his group
[2014-07-29 20:54:20 -0400] j^2: \o/
[2014-07-29 20:54:35 -0400] markvan: j^2:   k, will check it out.
[2014-07-29 20:57:27 -0400] j^2: the net-net of this metal thing is the ability to have one recipe that can talk to multiple providers so you can have the same wrapper for vagrant/digitalocean/ec2 etc
[2014-07-29 20:57:44 -0400] j^2: i just need to get it working with vagrant and were like 95% done
[2014-07-29 20:59:47 -0400] markvan: j^2: that does sound nice.  How does it relete to test-kitchen?
[2014-07-29 21:00:18 -0400] j^2: its parallel? its two different problem spaces
[2014-07-29 21:00:41 -0400] j^2: but ill be able to leverage the chef-metal stuff in test-kitchen so we can get the integration testing
[2014-07-29 21:00:58 -0400] markvan: j^2: ah, ok
[2014-07-29 21:01:40 -0400] j^2: it all is very insestuious everything relies on everything else ;)
[2014-07-29 21:29:29 -0400] lrr: do you guys have a convention on how you name your topic branches?
[2014-07-29 21:48:45 -0400] j^2: i tihnk for bugfixes its becoming bugfix/XXXXX but for something new, id just make it descriptive as you can
[2014-07-29 21:49:53 -0400] lrr: ok :)
