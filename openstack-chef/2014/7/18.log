[2014-07-18 17:49:13 -0400] j^2: i thought i did, let me try again
[2014-07-18 17:49:39 -0400] markvan_: Maybe compare your bundle vers to the gate logs

[2014-07-18 18:41:15 -0400] markvan_: j^2: is there a way to use the Bot to broadcast a message to the cores?  Like in this case, we'll need some help getting this gate fixes in.

[2014-07-18 18:46:23 -0400] j^2: (reading your comments now, and talking with matt)
[2014-07-18 18:46:49 -0400] j^2: ah, so you're thinking of leveraging the bot to ping cores to get those reviews completed?
[2014-07-18 18:48:25 -0400] markvan_: j^2: yeah, some way to easily call out to the core for help on a topic
