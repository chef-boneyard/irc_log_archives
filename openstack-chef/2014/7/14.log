[2014-07-14 15:19:47 -0400] neelashah: mattray: does chef support RHEL 7.0? I don't see a download for it, just for RHEL 6
[2014-07-14 15:20:36 -0400] markvan: neelashah: not sure on that part, but as folks have tried to use the cookbooks there, the issue with systemd comes up.  Will need changes to all cookbooks to fix that init stuff...
[2014-07-14 15:21:47 -0400] neelashah: markvan: but you don't see any issue with using chef server or client with RHEL 7 even though its not explicitly available for download i.e. you expect it will work as-is
[2014-07-14 15:22:29 -0400] markvan: neelashah: really have no idea on what to expect there.  I can ask at the up coming mtg today.
[2014-07-14 15:22:53 -0400] neelashah: markvan: that would be great to find out at the mtg today...thanks.
[2014-07-14 15:26:15 -0400] markvan: mattt: this might do the trick on the centos cinder issue:   https://review.openstack.org/#/c/106300/
[2014-07-14 15:29:03 -0400] j^2: markvan: saw my update?
[2014-07-14 15:29:41 -0400] mattray: neelashah: the RHEL6 installer works
[2014-07-14 15:30:01 -0400] mattray: we're adding it to our CI
[2014-07-14 15:30:37 -0400] neelashah: mattray: RHEL6 installer works on RHEL 7? If so, thats great...
[2014-07-14 15:31:08 -0400] markvan: j^2:   yeah

[2014-07-14 16:49:14 -0400] galstrom: mattray: are you saying that the texas coast is not glamourous?

[2014-07-14 21:05:06 -0400] markvan_: j^2:   while your hacking at specs, please see my attempt  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/97537/   so you don't re-churn all that...
[2014-07-14 21:05:51 -0400] j^2: will do
[2014-07-14 21:05:59 -0400] j^2: and i saw your comments

[2014-07-14 21:06:11 -0400] markvan_: One issue we have is that coverage is only at resource level, would be nice to extend that to the attribute and resource key-value levels....then we'll see how far we really are from 100%
[2014-07-14 21:07:05 -0400] markvan_: I think we can do some of that with some better matchers

[2014-07-14 22:15:13 -0400] j^2: i added .with user:root, group:root in what i'm about to push up
[2014-07-14 22:15:17 -0400] j^2: i think that's what you're asking
[2014-07-14 22:18:33 -0400] j^2: opps, i meant cinder not root
