[2014-07-10 15:42:23 -0400] j^2: for the +2's
[2014-07-10 15:42:47 -0400] markvan: j^2:  thx for the efforts on that mess
[2014-07-10 15:42:59 -0400] j^2: :D gotta learn by fire eh?
[2014-07-10 16:27:55 -0400] mrodden: mattray: you around? i think i found a bug with chef client...
[2014-07-10 16:28:06 -0400] mrodden: but i need to test with the latest still
[2014-07-10 16:28:15 -0400] mattray: mrodden: there's an 11.14 RC out now
[2014-07-10 16:28:22 -0400] mrodden: ah k
[2014-07-10 16:28:54 -0400] mrodden: have you seen an issue where using --environment b would still run through a chef run even though environment e doesn't exist on the server
[2014-07-10 16:29:09 -0400] mrodden: but if you do the same thing with an environment with more than one character it fails out
[2014-07-10 16:29:58 -0400] mrodden: its for a new node in each case
[2014-07-10 16:36:19 -0400] mrodden: my guess is its something with how _default is handled
[2014-07-10 17:39:49 -0400] j^2: markvan: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/105872/ can you +2 that? so it can get merged?
[2014-07-10 17:40:00 -0400] j^2: that's right? right? it just needs one more?
[2014-07-10 17:40:23 -0400] markvan: j^2:  looking
[2014-07-10 17:40:27 -0400] j^2: :D
[2014-07-10 17:42:03 -0400] markvan: j^2:  it stills need one more core to push it.
[2014-07-10 17:42:38 -0400] j^2: cool, i'll ping mattray
[2014-07-10 17:42:43 -0400] j^2: thanks :)

[2014-07-10 20:08:41 -0400] markvan: mattray: topic for discussion?  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/103371/4/CHANGELOG.md     version changes are needed by some, even at master level?
[2014-07-10 20:22:39 -0400] markvan: mattt: have any ideas on that CI bug with erlang?   http://jenkins.uk.rs.wherenow.org/job/Stackforge_Cookbooks_AIO_Matrix/1940/label=performance14-centos/console
[2014-07-10 20:28:12 -0400] lrr: haha i'm having that exact same bug
[2014-07-10 20:44:25 -0400] mattt: markvan: not seen that before no :(
[2014-07-10 20:44:30 -0400] mattt: markvan: centos is turning into a big bag of fail
[2014-07-10 20:45:37 -0400] lrr: mattt, markvan: i just emailed erlang's support about the version dependency issues and referenced you guys as having issues as well
[2014-07-10 20:46:04 -0400] markvan: mattt: yeah, diff seems to be new version of erlang that just came out  17.1   http://packages.erlang-solutions.com/rpm/centos/6/x86_64/
[2014-07-10 20:46:30 -0400] markvan: lrr:  thx
[2014-07-10 20:46:51 -0400] mattt: lrr: thanks for chasing that up
[2014-07-10 20:47:13 -0400] mattt: we've actually had no success w/ centos since icehouse landed
[2014-07-10 20:47:17 -0400] markvan: mattt:   maybe we could try doing erlang from source?   ['erlang']['install_method'] = 'source'
[2014-07-10 20:47:32 -0400] mattt: markvan: that is a horrible idea!
[2014-07-10 20:47:33 -0400] mattt: :)
[2014-07-10 20:47:48 -0400] mattt: i'm going to disable the centos gate for the time being
[2014-07-10 20:48:00 -0400] lrr: mattt: really? could that be the reason i've been having issue with icehouse + centos + nova network where it's still trying to use neutron even though i told it not to?
[2014-07-10 20:48:32 -0400] mattt: lrr: the issue we were having was actually with cinder ... i think it's just recently been fixed
[2014-07-10 20:48:40 -0400] lrr: ah
[2014-07-10 20:49:07 -0400] mattt: lrr: deleting a snapshot would disable the parent logical volume IIRC
[2014-07-10 20:49:17 -0400] lrr: ouch
[2014-07-10 20:49:18 -0400] mattt: lrr: so when cinder went to delete it it'd fail becuase the LV wasn't active
[2014-07-10 20:49:39 -0400] mattt: something along those lines, i looked at it so long ago that i forget the details now :P
[2014-07-10 20:50:08 -0400] mattt: lrr: but our centos gate uses nova-network ... which worked i believe?
[2014-07-10 20:50:40 -0400] lrr: hmm, when i've tried icehouse + nova network, the webui would fail on login because it was trying to communicate with neutron and failing
[2014-07-10 20:51:02 -0400] lrr: and none of the services (keystone service-list) would show up
[2014-07-10 20:51:43 -0400] lrr: and unfortunately i can't reproduce it right now because the centos erlang is in a bad state :\
[2014-07-10 20:52:03 -0400] mattt: lrr: check the horizon django local_settings.py file or whatever it's called, i'm sure there was something in there to use neutron or not
[2014-07-10 20:52:13 -0400] mattt: either way sounds like our cookbooks are at fault here and not centos
[2014-07-10 20:52:29 -0400] lrr: mattt: i looked in there and tried to comment out the section about neutron, and no luck
[2014-07-10 20:54:22 -0400] mattt: btw guess it's time to start testing w/ centos 7 :P
[2014-07-10 20:54:45 -0400] lrr: well, won't you have to wait until chef supports centos w/ systemd?
[2014-07-10 20:55:27 -0400] mattt: lrr: ah, suppose you're right
[2014-07-10 21:04:01 -0400] mattt: lrr: would you mind pinging me when you get any news back on that package ?
[2014-07-10 21:04:43 -0400] lrr: mattt: sure, no problem
[2014-07-10 21:05:34 -0400] mattt: thank ya!
