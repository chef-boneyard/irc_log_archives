[2014-07-16 14:43:29 -0400] markvan_: j^2: I put some comments out on the bug guideline...
[2014-07-16 14:43:29 -0400] os-chef-bot: markvan_: while you were out, j^2 said: i created https://gist.github.com/jjasghar/f2cd601c133dfec47c65 to explain the bug reports. It's just a proposal, but none of the reports where consistant, so i think we should have a doc or something
[2014-07-16 14:57:17 -0400] markvan_: galstrom: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/97522/  could use a bit a love...

[2014-07-16 14:58:59 -0400] j^2: Markvan_: I think I'm gonna organize the bug reports today. Any thoughts suggestions?
[2014-07-16 14:59:32 -0400] j^2: Awesome I'll take a look when I'm on my laptop
[2014-07-16 15:00:09 -0400] markvan_: j^2: organize?   by release, priority or just basic cleanup
[2014-07-16 15:01:00 -0400] j^2: Any and all I was thinking. Start by that standardization of the summary and move from there
[2014-07-16 15:01:23 -0400] j^2: If I'm overstepping I'll back off
[2014-07-16 15:21:19 -0400] j^2: Markvan_: updated invite per Justin

[2014-07-16 15:52:16 -0400] PaulCzar: anyone using 14.04 yet?   I just tried running keystone cookbook across 14.04 and get errors from the keystone service enable
[2014-07-16 15:54:30 -0400] PaulCzar: I think due to 14.04 using upstart and not providing a /etc/init.d/keystone   the service enable fails
[2014-07-16 16:06:19 -0400] markvan_: galstrom:  thx!
[2014-07-16 16:07:58 -0400] jeffshantz: Hi all.  Looking at some of the Chef cookbooks for OpenStack, it appears that packages are being installed with 'action :upgrade'.  Presumably, then, if I deploy my cloud using these cookbooks, it's going to be continuously upgrading itself as new versions of OpenStack packages are released.  Is this not a problem in practice?  What if something present in Icehouse is removed in Juno?  Will my OpenStack deployment suddenly break?
[2014-07-16 16:08:51 -0400] iartarisi: jeffshantz: you control when you switch your repositories from Icehouse to Juno
[2014-07-16 16:09:32 -0400] jeffshantz: iartarisi: Ah, I didn't realize that.  Ok, thank you.
[2014-07-16 16:09:55 -0400] iartarisi: jeffshantz: it's done via: default['openstack']['release'] = 'icehouse'
[2014-07-16 16:10:39 -0400] jeffshantz: iartarisi: Great.  I will play around with the cookbooks today.  Thanks again.
[2014-07-16 16:10:46 -0400] iartarisi: actually that's just the default way to do it, if you custom repositories then that has no effect
[2014-07-16 16:10:49 -0400] iartarisi: sure
[2014-07-16 16:12:41 -0400] j^2: :D
[2014-07-16 16:20:11 -0400] j^2: wow, this meeting markvan_ will never happen

[2014-07-16 16:20:20 -0400] j^2: i had to move it again
[2014-07-16 16:20:47 -0400] markvan_: j^2: do I have to bring food?  ;)
[2014-07-16 16:20:54 -0400] j^2: heh

[2014-07-16 20:37:41 -0400] lrr: the stackforge berksfile is missing iptables and fails when uploading because apache2 requires iptables to upload
[2014-07-16 20:48:26 -0400] lrr: actually, that might be related to me
[2014-07-16 20:48:50 -0400] lrr: BUT i can't get the mysql::ruby cookbook to work. it just hangs on chef_gem 'mysql'
[2014-07-16 20:49:01 -0400] lrr: and the rror points to it being rubygems.org's fault
[2014-07-16 21:41:07 -0400] j^2: :-/
[2014-07-16 21:41:08 -0400] mattray: rubygems is having outages right now
[2014-07-16 21:41:10 -0400] j^2: that's not fun
[2014-07-16 21:42:02 -0400] lrr: damnit rubygems
[2014-07-16 21:42:26 -0400] j^2: i'm gonna write up a proposed versioning scheme for bumping cookbooks. Basiclly it'll be semver distilled for us? yay? nay? markvan_ you mentioned you'd like something like that
