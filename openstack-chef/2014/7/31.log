[2014-07-31 12:35:13 -0400] openstackgerrit: Nacer Laradji proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: dhcp_domain should be set to empty in nova.conf when we use neutron for network.  https://review.openstack.org/108367
[2014-07-31 13:03:28 -0400] nacer: markvan: are you here ?
[2014-07-31 14:12:18 -0400] markvan: nacer: howdy
[2014-07-31 14:20:02 -0400] markvan: nacer: I added a comment to your patch.
[2014-07-31 14:21:05 -0400] nacer: markvan: for the junos patch, i can't
[2014-07-31 14:21:17 -0400] nacer: i don't know if it work the same with junos
[2014-07-31 14:21:22 -0400] nacer: i don't use junos yet
[2014-07-31 14:21:58 -0400] nacer: and i don't have the time to test junos for my patch
[2014-07-31 14:22:06 -0400] nacer: i know that's a lot of I don't ! :)
[2014-07-31 14:23:52 -0400] markvan: nacer: ah, maybe you could a post on the neutron ml to see if the issue is still valid?    If you want to jsut go after a stable branch, I think the bug should not be closed, maybe Partial-Bug? and create entry in bug for the various branches?
[2014-07-31 14:24:49 -0400] nacer: markvan: https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+bug/1338664
[2014-07-31 14:26:00 -0400] markvan: nacer: yup, bug looks ok for tracking. thx
[2014-07-31 14:26:45 -0400] nacer: i just need to involve some openstack neutron guy now :)

[2014-07-31 15:29:49 -0400] j^2: galstrom: can we pair up on that sphinx thing? if not, i might have one other person to ask. This is frustrating as all hell. I spent way too much time last night reading about this software
[2014-07-31 15:29:59 -0400] galstrom: sure
[2014-07-31 15:30:33 -0400] galstrom: also.. all of the current gates have been queued for 25 minutes or so.. so they will get through at some point
[2014-07-31 15:30:53 -0400] j^2: nice
[2014-07-31 15:31:09 -0400] j^2: i like screenhero a lot: http://screenhero.com if you want to use that
[2014-07-31 15:32:07 -0400] markvan: j^2:   the juno image one can go:  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/110361/
[2014-07-31 15:32:14 -0400] j^2: looking
[2014-07-31 15:32:50 -0400] markvan: j^2:  I also tried a few things with sphinx, but did not get any closer.  I did notice that we have olsosphinx in there and probably don't need it.
[2014-07-31 15:33:11 -0400] j^2: wow
[2014-07-31 15:33:31 -0400] j^2: i must have been reading the wrong things, what is olsophinx?
[2014-07-31 15:34:04 -0400] markvan: j^2:  it's looks like just a way to provide differnt themes and incubator for base openstack projects.
[2014-07-31 15:34:36 -0400] markvan: oslosphinx
[2014-07-31 15:35:20 -0400] j^2: ahhh
[2014-07-31 15:41:42 -0400] markvan: j^2: I think I have a solution to the sphinx issue, at least it's an easy  workaround
[2014-07-31 15:45:14 -0400] markvan: j^2:  never mind, it only stopped the warning, but then did not include the rst file in the output.    Added   :orphan: to top of .rst.
[2014-07-31 15:45:32 -0400] j^2: :-/
[2014-07-31 15:45:39 -0400] j^2: ah yeah i read something about that last night
[2014-07-31 15:46:04 -0400] j^2: do you have the depth set at 4?
[2014-07-31 15:46:07 -0400] j^2: or 2
[2014-07-31 15:58:00 -0400] markvan: j^2: had it at 4
[2014-07-31 15:59:40 -0400] j^2: ah damn
[2014-07-31 15:59:40 -0400] j^2: ok
[2014-07-31 15:59:47 -0400] j^2: yeah galstrom is stumped here too
[2014-07-31 15:59:56 -0400] j^2: im pinging one of my docs guys about this too
[2014-07-31 16:09:33 -0400] markvan: j^2: I also don't see the new version .rst in the html output, even after two runs, but the templates are there (and should probably be excluded)
[2014-07-31 16:10:06 -0400] j^2: so i doesnt build?
[2014-07-31 16:10:08 -0400] j^2: that seems wrong
[2014-07-31 16:12:36 -0400] j^2: let me double check mine
[2014-07-31 16:13:35 -0400] j^2: ok, something is really wrong now, theres nothing in my build/ directory
[2014-07-31 16:15:23 -0400] j^2: wait, wow. i need caffiene
[2014-07-31 16:15:29 -0400] j^2: ill stop talking now
[2014-07-31 16:17:12 -0400] markvan: j^2:  I think I have it figured out now
[2014-07-31 16:17:17 -0400] j^2: :-O
[2014-07-31 16:17:37 -0400] markvan: It's very picky on files matching exactly with the index layout.
[2014-07-31 16:17:58 -0400] markvan: I can post up my changes and you can take a look from there.  They are fairly minor.
[2014-07-31 16:18:05 -0400] j^2: thanks id love that
[2014-07-31 16:18:12 -0400] markvan: k, on it
[2014-07-31 16:18:59 -0400] markvan: j^2:  any vote on leaving oslosphix in there?   does not seem to hurt, but it's hard coded to just the base openstack projects.
[2014-07-31 16:19:49 -0400] j^2: yeah lets leave it alone for now
[2014-07-31 16:19:57 -0400] j^2: lets understand this before messing with it more ;)
[2014-07-31 16:22:20 -0400] markvan: j^2: k, and any reason for having templates at each level, one at base seems like enough.
[2014-07-31 16:22:30 -0400] j^2: really?
[2014-07-31 16:22:35 -0400] j^2: thatsdisappointing
[2014-07-31 16:23:20 -0400] markvan: k, will push patch shortly, one last run.
[2014-07-31 16:23:29 -0400] galstrom: j^2: i think the issue is with all of the blank directories
[2014-07-31 16:23:38 -0400] galstrom: blank == no rst files
[2014-07-31 16:23:58 -0400] j^2: even with the .gitignores? lame
[2014-07-31 16:24:30 -0400] galstrom: i think so..
[2014-07-31 16:24:33 -0400] galstrom: one sec
[2014-07-31 16:25:42 -0400] galstrom: yup
[2014-07-31 16:25:45 -0400] galstrom: looks that way
[2014-07-31 16:28:09 -0400] markvan: galstrom: yup, I cleaned up the index to only have the populated dirs and removed the templates from view and all is well...
[2014-07-31 16:28:34 -0400] markvan: just about to post my updates
[2014-07-31 16:31:03 -0400] j^2: man thats lame

[2014-07-31 16:31:07 -0400] j^2: but i guess helpful?
[2014-07-31 16:31:56 -0400] markvan: j^2: ^^^ new patch, let's see how that goes.
[2014-07-31 16:32:35 -0400] j^2: \o/
[2014-07-31 16:33:39 -0400] markvan: j^2:  and that image one is still ready.   zuul is backed up a bit, so lets pile on!

[2014-07-31 16:52:52 -0400] j^2: im not crazy right? https://review.openstack.org/#/c/110839/ is a new setting but he doesnt set/default that option anywhere?
[2014-07-31 17:02:23 -0400] markvan: j^2: since there is an if check in the template, technically don't need attr, but I think it should be there and default to nil.
[2014-07-31 17:02:54 -0400] j^2: yeah because where else/how else would you know if that option even existed?
[2014-07-31 17:04:23 -0400] markvan: j^2: agreed

[2014-07-31 17:18:35 -0400] j^2: markvan: interesting
[2014-07-31 17:18:55 -0400] j^2: so we should probably just blow away icehouse completely?
[2014-07-31 17:19:00 -0400] j^2: in the specs directory
[2014-07-31 17:23:43 -0400] markvan: j^2: yeah, maybe I should have commented it out in index, but until we need it, it will just cause problems there.  Having the dir there is ok, but will probably never be used.
[2014-07-31 17:24:01 -0400] j^2: agreed
[2014-07-31 17:24:21 -0400] j^2: i just put it there becasue i thought we should, but being icehouse is now stable we shouldnt have any major changes to it
[2014-07-31 17:24:34 -0400] j^2: which is what a blueprint is supposed to be ;)
[2014-07-31 17:25:44 -0400] markvan: j^2: yup, don't need it then
[2014-07-31 18:39:01 -0400] j^2: markvan: awesome the https://review.openstack.org/#/c/110728/ (cookbook versioning) didnt fail
[2014-07-31 18:39:08 -0400] j^2: so now we can have the conversation on it
[2014-07-31 18:39:37 -0400] j^2: ill see if i can get the integration spec one done myself

[2014-07-31 19:07:48 -0400] markvan: failing until then
[2014-07-31 19:09:14 -0400] markvan: j^2:  we just need one .rst file in the juno dir for that change to work.

[2014-07-31 19:45:00 -0400] lrr: it looks like a lot of the service cookbooks don't have cofiguration to use ssl in them
[2014-07-31 19:45:09 -0400] lrr: (the first one i checked being dashboard)
[2014-07-31 19:45:17 -0400] lrr: what would be the best way to go about that?

[2014-07-31 22:38:10 -0400] pcn: hello, I'm looking for some help in getting chef deploying openstack for me
[2014-07-31 22:38:16 -0400] j^2: hello
[2014-07-31 22:38:19 -0400] pcn: mattray pointed me to j^2
[2014-07-31 22:38:23 -0400] pcn: Heya
[2014-07-31 22:38:29 -0400] pcn: Got a few minutes :)
[2014-07-31 22:38:55 -0400] pcn: I've just updated chefdk and installed spiceweasel on a mac laptop running 10.9
[2014-07-31 22:39:04 -0400] j^2: ok
[2014-07-31 22:39:29 -0400] pcn: I've cloned the openstack-chef-repo for myself (after I get it working, I'm going to need to make some changes to swap some components in/out, etc.)
[2014-07-31 22:39:45 -0400] pcn: but an untouched clone from earlier this AM isn't really getting me started easily.
[2014-07-31 22:40:01 -0400] j^2: yeah weve had some issues with the openstack-chef-repo to be honest
[2014-07-31 22:40:04 -0400] j^2: brb
[2014-07-31 22:40:31 -0400] pcn: Some thoughts: 1) It'd be nice if the data bags described made it clearer what the structure of the data bags should be... e.g. include "knife data bag create <whatever> <foo>" commands to be explicit
[2014-07-31 22:40:37 -0400] pcn: j^2: k
[2014-07-31 22:41:39 -0400] j^2: Oh nice good point
[2014-07-31 22:46:34 -0400] pcn: So what should I expect at this point?  I would like to just get a working in stall of icehouse.  My main goal is just to get to the point where nova and neutron will launch systems and create tunnels.
[2014-07-31 22:46:49 -0400] j^2: one sec ill come back to you
[2014-07-31 22:47:14 -0400] pcn: k
[2014-07-31 22:52:13 -0400] j^2: awesome, ok so yeah it seems you are trying to create the single stack boxes to make a tunnel?
[2014-07-31 22:52:19 -0400] j^2: or am i reading this wrong?
[2014-07-31 22:55:45 -0400] pcn: Right, i want to start with a single stack box for all of the controller processes, and have it reach out to another box as the vm host
[2014-07-31 22:56:38 -0400] pcn: After I get 1 running, i want to re-launch and separate the services, specifically networking.  Most of my interest is in the networking tunnels
[2014-07-31 22:57:56 -0400] pcn: One of my devs has spent a week trying to do this manually, and there are too many moving parts :(
[2014-07-31 22:58:27 -0400] pcn: It mostly works, but we can't reproduce it to isolate some of our issues
[2014-07-31 22:59:43 -0400] pcn: So I'm looking for a way to iterate faster
[2014-07-31 23:00:07 -0400] j^2: ah yeah the chef-repo is what you want to use
[2014-07-31 23:00:17 -0400] j^2: but its influx right now for icehouse/juno
[2014-07-31 23:00:27 -0400] j^2: we should have something solid in the nextcouple days
[2014-07-31 23:01:34 -0400] pcn: So if I check out the stable/grizzly branch, would that work?
[2014-07-31 23:02:01 -0400] j^2: you could but it is really old and iirc i dont support neotron
[2014-07-31 23:02:01 -0400] pcn: I do need icehouse, but first I need to figure out if I'm using the tooling correctly!
[2014-07-31 23:02:07 -0400] j^2: heh
[2014-07-31 23:02:12 -0400] j^2: completely understood
[2014-07-31 23:02:22 -0400] j^2: id say icehouse/stable is where you want to be honestly
[2014-07-31 23:02:54 -0400] pcn: OK, I can dedicate a couple of days to working with broken cookbooks if the rest of the tooling works
[2014-07-31 23:03:05 -0400] pcn: where can I start?
[2014-07-31 23:04:08 -0400] j^2: youre probably already there https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo
[2014-07-31 23:05:59 -0400] pcn: OK, so that's the canonical repo?  As opposed to the mattray/openstack-chef-repo?
[2014-07-31 23:08:27 -0400] j^2: yep, that is the Standard chef-repo now
[2014-07-31 23:10:05 -0400] pcn: OK, cool, I've added that as a remote, and I've checked out master from there.
[2014-07-31 23:10:11 -0400] j^2: rock on
[2014-07-31 23:10:13 -0400] pcn: And it looks like there are still tooling issues vs. chefdk
[2014-07-31 23:10:48 -0400] j^2: yeah thats accurate
[2014-07-31 23:10:51 -0400] pcn: Specifically, the instructions lean on spiceweasel.  Using that results in a stack trace: Unable to activate varia_model-0.4.0, because buff-extensions-0.5.0 conflicts with buff-extensions (~> 1.0)
[2014-07-31 23:11:12 -0400] j^2: im in the process or standarizing everything against the chef-dk you caught me in the beginning of that process
[2014-07-31 23:11:29 -0400] j^2: yeah im actually going to rewrite everything for chef-metal too
[2014-07-31 23:11:44 -0400] j^2: but i have to work with jkeiser2 to get some parsing issues
[2014-07-31 23:11:48 -0400] j^2: im really close though
[2014-07-31 23:17:14 -0400] pcn: Hmm.  Let me clean out my ~/.chefdk.  There may be junk in there from a prior install
[2014-07-31 23:28:11 -0400] pcn: Nope, let's see if I can wind back buff-extensions to 0.5 for everything.
[2014-07-31 23:35:45 -0400] pcn: Looks like  varia_model can use buff-extensions-0.4.0
[2014-07-31 23:35:48 -0400] pcn: errr 0.5.0
[2014-07-31 23:37:57 -0400] pcn: So spiceweasel runs berks, and berks is dying on the first cookbook statement in the Berksfile
[2014-07-31 23:38:44 -0400] j^2: what version of Berks are you using?
[2014-07-31 23:40:49 -0400] pcn: Looks like 3.1.3.  But I am mucking with the dep. version of buff-extensions
[2014-07-31 23:41:42 -0400] pcn: Yeah, all of the 3.1.3 bits in berkshelf looks like it wants buff-extensions 1.0.
[2014-07-31 23:46:31 -0400] pcn: I think chefdk is getting in my way
[2014-07-31 23:53:42 -0400] pcn: I can't install spiceweasel from gems in the omnibus chef - I'm going to change my tune and say that it looks like spiceweasel and its deps are broken
[2014-07-31 23:53:49 -0400] pcn: Is it doing anything more than berks?
