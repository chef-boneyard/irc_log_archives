[2014-07-24 15:24:00 -0400] alanmeadows: A heads up, if we cant solve the issue of being able to commit one-liners to what appear to be EOL'd branches (stable/grizzly), ATT is going to move onto forks for stable/grizzly.  If new gate jobs are going to get applied, in my mind it is the responsibility of those applying the gate jobs to ensure all existing branches can pass.
[2014-07-24 15:27:30 -0400] alanmeadows: ^ galsrom_zzz, j^2, iartarisi, et al
[2014-07-24 15:32:05 -0400] iartarisi: alanmeadows: hm... are those errors really caused by a new gate job?
[2014-07-24 15:32:48 -0400] alanmeadows: iartarisi: indeed, master and stable/havana were refactored but stable/grizzly was left behind
[2014-07-24 15:33:32 -0400] alanmeadows: on several cookbooks at least, I haven't validated whether its across the board
[2014-07-24 15:35:09 -0400] iartarisi: alanmeadows: are we talking about this error? http://logs.openstack.org/53/105953/1/check/gate-cookbook-openstack-dashboard-chef-unit/2acfd7d/console.html

[2014-07-24 15:37:28 -0400] iartarisi: right, the error is the same
[2014-07-24 15:39:40 -0400] iartarisi: if I'm not mistaken those are caused by the Supermarket release
[2014-07-24 15:40:55 -0400] alanmeadows: I'm at a loss to understand what to do to resolve it at this point
[2014-07-24 15:41:10 -0400] iartarisi: I think just changing the Gemfile, I'm trying it now...
[2014-07-24 15:42:30 -0400] openstackgerrit: Ionut Artarisi proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: upgrade berkshelf requirement to 2.0.18  https://review.openstack.org/109324

[2014-07-24 15:46:40 -0400] iartarisi: it's not that easy I guess :)
[2014-07-24 15:48:36 -0400] alanmeadows: if only it were :)
[2014-07-24 15:48:55 -0400] alanmeadows: Well, it will require an update to lock as well
[2014-07-24 15:49:17 -0400] iartarisi: yeah
[2014-07-24 15:49:22 -0400] alanmeadows: to have a chance at least
[2014-07-24 15:54:55 -0400] markvan: iartarisi: for that change, I also had to add hashie 2.0 and rspec 2.14.1.  see https://review.openstack.org/#/c/105580/2/Gemfile
[2014-07-24 15:55:44 -0400] iartarisi: markvan: yup, I know your change, I'm trying to follow it. I'm currently doing a slooooooow bundle update
[2014-07-24 15:55:52 -0400] openstackgerrit: Alan Meadows proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: upgrade berkshelf requirement to 2.0.18  https://review.openstack.org/109324
[2014-07-24 15:57:17 -0400] iartarisi: hope that works ^ I'm still installing gems...
[2014-07-24 15:58:10 -0400] markvan: iartarisi: yeah, I just hit another similar issue but with master, seems only way to fix it is to move to chefspec 4.x/rspec 3.x. bummer another bundle update
[2014-07-24 15:58:58 -0400] iartarisi: markvan: oh? what issue?
[2014-07-24 16:00:53 -0400] iartarisi: markvan: btw, I guess we don't have a bug for the berkshelf upgrade?
[2014-07-24 16:01:20 -0400] markvan: iartarisi: trying to make a simple change to network to allow templated rootwrap, but spec is failing.  this patch: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/109113/2   It worked for compute, but it fails with network with what apears to be chefspec issue.
[2014-07-24 16:02:11 -0400] iartarisi: markvan: hm, no that's just rubocop :)
[2014-07-24 16:02:56 -0400] iartarisi: markvan: ooh, I see what you mean, sorry
[2014-07-24 16:06:43 -0400] markvan: iartarisi: now I've tried with chefspec 4.x and still have issue with that simple spec.  I must be missing something obvious...will continue to dig
[2014-07-24 16:07:22 -0400] iartarisi: markvan: I think I'm missing something obvious together with you. The specs above work fine.
[2014-07-24 16:13:37 -0400] markvan: iartarisi: I did some searching and found other folks with template content being nil during spec, but has not helped yet.
[2014-07-24 16:21:27 -0400] iartarisi: markvan: can you reproduce that locally? I can't...
[2014-07-24 16:24:35 -0400] markvan: iartarisi: have you tried a rspec run against patch set 3?   That's the issue with the nil template.
[2014-07-24 16:26:33 -0400] iartarisi: markvan: ooh, so we're talking about this issue? http://logs.openstack.org/13/109113/2/check/gate-cookbook-openstack-network-chef-style/a372afb/console.html
[2014-07-24 16:29:29 -0400] markvan: iartarisi: sorry, no, that was just a lame attempt to try to figure this out.   The real issue just showed up against patch set 3, unit test fail with nil template content.
[2014-07-24 16:29:29 -0400] markvan: https://jenkins03.openstack.org/job/gate-cookbook-openstack-network-chef-unit/67/console
[2014-07-24 16:31:01 -0400] markvan: iartarisi: since it's happens in gate, I'm guessing it's something obvious, but I can't figure it out, ....for such a simple change.

[2014-07-24 16:49:55 -0400] markvan: galstrom: wow....yup just saw that myself. thx much.
[2014-07-24 16:50:06 -0400] galstrom: np
[2014-07-24 16:50:12 -0400] markvan: humm interesting how that caused the template contents to be nil
[2014-07-24 16:50:12 -0400] galstrom: now.. not sure about the second error
[2014-07-24 16:50:25 -0400] galstrom: yeah.. definitely odd
[2014-07-24 16:50:59 -0400] galstrom: probably erb gives up.. once it hits that nil error.. and does not finish templating the rest of the file
[2014-07-24 16:51:02 -0400] galstrom: you are welcome?
[2014-07-24 16:51:45 -0400] markvan: ah, so cascade effect...  yeah, that's looks like it.

[2014-07-24 17:17:30 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar, Thanks for fielding my questions yesterday. I've got my nodes on 12.04 now with a Chef Server running in lxc. Can you or anyone else point me toward a reference that will help me compose the run lists for each of the three nodes? There are a lot of roles in the stackforge stuf and I'm not exactly sure which ones I need/don't need. Would be great to have a starting point.

[2014-07-24 23:13:31 -0400] harlowja: jaypipes i'm going back and forth on an internal chat; and am wondering if u know how many people are using the chef repos that are created by the folks in this channel
[2014-07-24 23:16:44 -0400] jaypipes: harlowja: lots of people use the chef *cookbooks* from stackforge. not many use the upstream openstack-chef-repo other than looking at it as a guide/reference
[2014-07-24 23:17:04 -0400] harlowja: jaypipes thats intersting, why only use as guide?
[2014-07-24 23:17:33 -0400] jaypipes: harlowja: just cuz the openstack-chef-repo generally needs to contain all the deployment-specific stuffs
[2014-07-24 23:17:48 -0400] jaypipes: harlowja: and lots of folks customize the roles
[2014-07-24 23:18:22 -0400] harlowja: jaypipes thx, makes sense
[2014-07-24 23:24:52 -0400] harlowja: is rackspace pretty heavily using versions (customized likely) of these recipes?
