[2014-07-22 07:45:49 -0400] nacer: hi there
[2014-07-22 10:43:39 -0400] jklare: markvan: hi, just got back from holiday and saw your review comment on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/105714/ . I do not understand why a check for an overridden attribute would be usefull, maybe you can give an example?
[2014-07-22 10:46:59 -0400] iartarisi: jklare: I'm not markvan, but say you have a cookbook that wraps the image cookbook and sets metering = true, notifier_strategy = rabbitmq. Your change would throw the notifier_strategy away and use qpid.
[2014-07-22 10:49:28 -0400] jklare: iartarisi: so you would say using a higher precedence in the wrapper would be bad practice?
[2014-07-22 10:54:43 -0400] iartarisi: jklare: actually just setting an attribute according to another attribute seems a bit weird to me without set_unless.
[2014-07-22 10:56:22 -0400] iartarisi: jklare: I added a review to the change.
[2014-07-22 11:00:14 -0400] jklare: iartarisi: ah ok, so basically we could just use node['openstack']['mq']['image']['notifier_strategy'] without any modification in the attributes file?
[2014-07-22 11:03:06 -0400] iartarisi: jklare: right
[2014-07-22 11:03:19 -0400] iartarisi: that should work(tm) :)
[2014-07-22 11:07:27 -0400] jklare: cool :)
[2014-07-22 12:54:36 -0400] nacer: mmm i have update the openstacl icehouse cookbook
[2014-07-22 12:54:43 -0400] nacer: now i get that when creating a vm
[2014-07-22 12:54:43 -0400] nacer: 'Rbd' object has no attribute 'path'
[2014-07-22 12:59:11 -0400] nacer: libvirt_inject_key=false fix it

[2014-07-22 19:43:01 -0400] j^2: yo
[2014-07-22 21:23:38 -0400] galstrom: os-chef-bot ambush j^2: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/107833/ merged
[2014-07-22 21:23:39 -0400] os-chef-bot: Ambush prepared
[2014-07-22 21:29:51 -0400] j^2: Yo
[2014-07-22 21:29:51 -0400] os-chef-bot: j^2: while you were out, galstrom said: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/107833/ merged
[2014-07-22 21:29:58 -0400] j^2: Awesome!
[2014-07-22 21:44:43 -0400] markvan: galstrom:  j^2:  looks like I'll be traveling this week thur/fri, so won't be of much help with branching to juno.  Anything I can do to help prep for it?
[2014-07-22 21:45:26 -0400] j^2: markvan: honestly i have no idea
[2014-07-22 21:45:48 -0400] j^2: i think i'll just be picking matt's and justins brain trying to figure it out
[2014-07-22 21:46:18 -0400] markvan: j^2: I can certainly help with the icehouse lock files once that branch is created, but that will be Mon.
[2014-07-22 21:46:31 -0400] j^2: awesome, sounds great
[2014-07-22 21:46:39 -0400] j^2: i'll probably take a stab at it myself
[2014-07-22 21:47:59 -0400] markvan: j^2: the other thing we have done in the past at branch time is bump a few tool versions  (like maybe Chefspec 4.x ?)
[2014-07-22 21:48:19 -0400] j^2: yeah makes perfect sense
[2014-07-22 21:48:20 -0400] markvan: to try to keep master moving forward with latest tools
[2014-07-22 21:48:38 -0400] markvan: and that Chefsopec one seems like a reasonable one to go after.
[2014-07-22 21:49:13 -0400] markvan: it mainly minor refactoring changes to some spec files.
[2014-07-22 21:49:20 -0400] j^2: yeah the chefspec thng will require us to up date some tests though
[2014-07-22 21:49:26 -0400] j^2: exactly
[2014-07-22 21:50:01 -0400] markvan: so, maybe that's a good early blueprint for juno to focus on. and not tie to branching.
[2014-07-22 21:59:38 -0400] j^2: :D
[2014-07-22 23:03:11 -0400] j^2: yo
