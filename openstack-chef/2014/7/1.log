[2014-07-01 15:04:27 -0400] PaulCzar_: hrmmm, passwords and secrets only support encrypted_databags ?  I was hoping to use regular databags in my CI / Examples so that theyre easily readable by humans
[2014-07-01 15:05:31 -0400] iartarisi: PaulCzar_: there's also the option to use attributes
[2014-07-01 15:06:22 -0400] PaulCzar_: yeah,  I was hoping to use non-encrypted databags so its obvious to people how to format their encrypted databags by looking at the testkitchen examples
[2014-07-01 16:08:55 -0400] openstackgerrit: Paul Czarkowski proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: allow unencrypted databags for storing secrets.  https://review.openstack.org/103934
[2014-07-01 17:29:44 -0400] Sam_S: rtheis: Hi, are you Richard Theis?
[2014-07-01 17:30:02 -0400] rtheis: Sam_S: yes
[2014-07-01 17:31:07 -0400] Sam_S: rtheis: Thank you to review my code. I add a little more explain about my change at https://review.openstack.org/#/c/103702/.
[2014-07-01 17:32:11 -0400] rtheis: ok
[2014-07-01 17:33:38 -0400] Sam_S: rtheis: Thank you. If any comment, we can discuss more.
[2014-07-01 17:34:20 -0400] rtheis: Sam_S: I don't see the update yet.
[2014-07-01 17:35:57 -0400] Sam_S: rtheis:sorry, I forgot to submit it. can you check again?
[2014-07-01 17:36:08 -0400] rtheis: I see it now
[2014-07-01 17:37:53 -0400] rtheis: Sam_S: I understand why one may want this but I still don't think it should change behavior
[2014-07-01 17:38:38 -0400] rtheis: Sam_S: The user that only wants KVM does not want the cookbook to change it on them
[2014-07-01 17:38:58 -0400] rtheis: Sam_S: I would suggest a new attribute that can control this behavior
[2014-07-01 17:39:05 -0400] Sam_S: rtheis: if so, the current cookbook cannot support the situation.
[2014-07-01 17:39:52 -0400] Sam_S: rtheis: yes, we can do that also.
[2014-07-01 17:39:53 -0400] rtheis: Sam_S: The current cookbook can support both KVM and QEMU compute nodes via node attributes
[2014-07-01 17:40:49 -0400] Sam_S: rtheis: I don't see that. can you tell me how to do that?
[2014-07-01 17:43:03 -0400] rtheis: Sam_S: You can create an environment file that defaults the openstack.compute.libvirt.virt_type attribute to kvm.  Then for each node that needs to be qemu, you can set the openstack.compute.libvirt.virt_type attribute to qemu.  The node attribute will override the envrionment default attribute
[2014-07-01 17:43:44 -0400] rtheis: You set the openstack.compute.libvirt.virt_type attribute to qemu on the node itself.
[2014-07-01 17:45:02 -0400] Sam_S: rtheis: that means we need to identify all node that nees to be qemu, right?
[2014-07-01 17:45:15 -0400] rtheis: Sam_S: That is correct
[2014-07-01 17:45:54 -0400] rtheis: Sam_S: Which is why your patch set would be nice for users that want the cookbook do determine it for them
[2014-07-01 17:46:40 -0400] rtheis: Sam_S: But, I think we need to let the user control this behavior.
[2014-07-01 17:46:43 -0400] Sam_S: rtheis: I suppose the users to use the cookbooks actually don't need to understand the detail of openstack.
[2014-07-01 17:49:18 -0400] Sam_S: rtheis: and the cookbook should be smart to help users to handle some situation.
[2014-07-01 17:52:11 -0400] rtheis: Sam_S: That depends on the user.  As a user of the cookbooks, I don't want the cookbook changing my hypervisor type.  I would rather receive a WARNING so I can node to support kvm.
[2014-07-01 17:52:28 -0400] rtheis: *fix my node...
[2014-07-01 17:56:10 -0400] Sam_S: rtheis: ok, if so, I suggest to add an attribute to support qemu automaticlly.
[2014-07-01 17:56:58 -0400] rtheis: Sam_S: I think that would be fine.
[2014-07-01 17:58:25 -0400] Sam_S: rtheis: ok, I will update a patch later.
[2014-07-01 17:58:35 -0400] rtheis: Sam_S: Thank you
[2014-07-01 17:59:17 -0400] Sam_S: rtheis: thank you for your time.
[2014-07-01 17:59:36 -0400] rtheis: yw
[2014-07-01 18:09:45 -0400] lrr: anyone around that can help explain the remote certificate commit to me?
[2014-07-01 18:12:09 -0400] openstackgerrit: Sam Su proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Support qemu as virt_type  https://review.openstack.org/103702
[2014-07-01 18:14:46 -0400] Sam_S: rtheis: I just updated the change according to your comments, can you take a look again?
[2014-07-01 18:40:55 -0400] openstackgerrit: Sam Su proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Support qemu as virt_type  https://review.openstack.org/103702
[2014-07-01 18:50:11 -0400] PaulCzar_: Sam_S: I dont really get the need for this  wouldnt you just set a node attribute on the VM to set the virt_type to qemu ?
[2014-07-01 18:51:10 -0400] PaulCzar_: for testing purposes, you might actually want to set up kvm on a VM so that you can use serverspec or similar to make sure all the pieces were converged properly.
[2014-07-01 18:51:21 -0400] PaulCzar_: this would give that grief
[2014-07-01 22:01:51 -0400] spheromak: PaulCzar_: watching yer dockercon talk
[2014-07-01 22:02:08 -0400] PaulCzar_: its a trap!
[2014-07-01 22:02:22 -0400] spheromak: :P
[2014-07-01 22:03:41 -0400] spheromak: I was workign on a kitchen-drone  builder for the oss drone, need to get back to that.  Too many projects not enough time!
[2014-07-01 22:05:33 -0400] PaulCzar_: spheromak: yeah, that could be cool.   can get away with just using the drone command in the busser  something like `drone build /path/to/repo`
[2014-07-01 22:05:43 -0400] spheromak: yeap
[2014-07-01 22:06:48 -0400] spheromak: ezbake is exactly what I was thinking about doing at my current contract.
[2014-07-01 22:07:41 -0400] spheromak: so funny
[2014-07-01 22:13:16 -0400] spheromak: PaulCzar_: on OSS drone I was using kitchen-docker and passing in the hosts Docker as the docker_host   and have spheromak/chef-drone container with chefdk and docker on it (with kitchen-docker). This was working ok.. ran into some other issues
[2014-07-01 22:13:34 -0400] spheromak: with their deploy requirements
[2014-07-01 22:14:00 -0400] PaulCzar_: cool!
[2014-07-01 22:14:46 -0400] PaulCzar_: spheromak: have you looked at the knife container stuff?
[2014-07-01 22:14:53 -0400] spheromak: not much
[2014-07-01 22:15:04 -0400] spheromak: not knife container at all
[2014-07-01 22:15:36 -0400] spheromak: ah cool
