[2014-07-07 15:38:30 -0400] mattray: ok, we'll do the call
[2014-07-07 15:41:09 -0400] alanmeadows1: mattray: as an item I did want to bring up it did seem to me the gate jobs were failing for most stable/grizzly branches preventing some critical bugfixes without a lot of cleanup, I'm not sure all of them were brought into the fold after the latest round of updates
[2014-07-07 15:41:23 -0400] mattray: alanmeadows1: will bring it up and look into it
[2014-07-07 15:41:43 -0400] alanmeadows1: I can't recall if you can control it per branch, last time I tried to play with that it didn't work for me
[2014-07-07 15:41:55 -0400] alanmeadows1: As an example: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/103374/

[2014-07-07 16:09:10 -0400] markvan: mattray: posted new topic to ML for moving master to Juno sooner proposal.    Along with that, maybe at next mtg we can go thru the current BP/BUG lists and begin to sort them out a bit?
[2014-07-07 16:09:35 -0400] mattray: markvan: sounds good
[2014-07-07 16:12:09 -0400] nacer: mattray: where can we get the pass for the november event ?
[2014-07-07 16:12:47 -0400] nacer: mattray: i don't see the free ticket on oepnstack website
[2014-07-07 16:12:51 -0400] mattray: nacer: there were emails sent out from Stefano Maffuli?
[2014-07-07 16:13:01 -0400] mattray: with a registration code for ATCs
[2014-07-07 16:13:32 -0400] mattray: nacer: check your spam filters? Look for @openstack.org emails
[2014-07-07 16:13:33 -0400] nacer: mattray: i don't have receive the email, maybe i don't qualify
[2014-07-07 16:25:09 -0400] carlp: nacer: nope, if you haven't got an email yet you don't qualify. Don't feel bad, I don't either :)
[2014-07-07 16:25:28 -0400] carlp: nacer: you still have time to qualify, you just missed the first round
[2014-07-07 16:27:15 -0400] nacer: carlp: do you know how to qualify ?
[2014-07-07 16:29:23 -0400] carlp: nacer: You need to be an "Active Technical Contributer", there are several ways to accomplish this. The easiest is to get a commit into any of the official projects, or open/close bugs.
[2014-07-07 16:29:38 -0400] nacer: carlp: i have made commit
[2014-07-07 16:29:51 -0400] carlp: nacer: where? Not all projects qualify
[2014-07-07 16:29:59 -0400] nacer: carlp: stackforge
[2014-07-07 16:30:36 -0400] carlp: nacer: almost nothing in stackforge qualifies for ATC. Here is the list of integrated projects where commits do count: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Programs
[2014-07-07 16:31:08 -0400] nacer: carlp: ok so i don't qualify :)
[2014-07-07 16:31:10 -0400] nacer: too bad
[2014-07-07 16:35:13 -0400] carlp: nacer: sorry :(
[2014-07-07 16:45:12 -0400] ctracey: PaulCzar_: I recently added a SF project...not too hard
[2014-07-07 16:45:27 -0400] ctracey: its all documented, just more of a PITA than anything else
[2014-07-07 16:45:55 -0400] ctracey: good news is that this is related to the existing Chef stuff.  Mine was brand spankin new.
[2014-07-07 17:08:46 -0400] mattray: markvan: ping
[2014-07-07 17:09:13 -0400] mattray: markvan: in Chef 11.14 there will be a new Resource attribute "sensitive" to flag stuff to not be logged
[2014-07-07 17:13:17 -0400] ctracey: hah ^
[2014-07-07 17:24:08 -0400] mattray: paulczar: just hit the same files as this change: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/96332/
[2014-07-07 17:24:25 -0400] mattray: paulczar: that'll get you ATC ;)
[2014-07-07 18:10:59 -0400] markvan_: mattray: thx, I'll look into that.  Maybe there's a way to extend that to template rendering.
