[2014-07-28 15:05:53 -0400] j^2: hey everyone
[2014-07-28 15:07:14 -0400] galstrom: j^2: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/109868/ and https://review.openstack.org/#/c/109868/
[2014-07-28 15:07:15 -0400] os-chef-bot: galstrom: while you were out, j^2 said: good call on bug reports, thanks for taking care of some of them
[2014-07-28 15:08:22 -0400] j^2: lovely
[2014-07-28 15:08:44 -0400] j^2: :D
[2014-07-28 15:08:53 -0400] j^2: i was going to mention them in the status meeting actually :)
[2014-07-28 15:09:29 -0400] galstrom: j^2: those are a bit of a pain.. since they all depend on eachother..
[2014-07-28 15:09:35 -0400] galstrom: have to do them in order
[2014-07-28 15:09:37 -0400] galstrom: :(
[2014-07-28 15:09:40 -0400] j^2: oh
[2014-07-28 15:09:48 -0400] galstrom: yeah..
[2014-07-28 15:09:50 -0400] galstrom: so common
[2014-07-28 15:09:52 -0400] galstrom: then identity
[2014-07-28 15:09:59 -0400] galstrom: then you can do a couple in parallel
[2014-07-28 15:10:02 -0400] galstrom: then the rest
[2014-07-28 15:21:33 -0400] j^2: Status meeting: https://plus.google.com/events/clom0i8qbtsr8vfipqejqi7k3kg or view http://youtu.be/bQpvj-lz55U

[2014-07-28 15:30:41 -0400] markvan: j^2: omw
[2014-07-28 15:30:49 -0400] j^2: :D
[2014-07-28 15:30:56 -0400] carlp: I was going to join in, but I guess I'll just watch :)
[2014-07-28 15:31:11 -0400] PaulCzar_: the hangout link just takes me to the view page
[2014-07-28 15:31:23 -0400] j^2: hmm
[2014-07-28 15:31:32 -0400] j^2: https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/hoaevent/AP36tYfNxtonOlxjb7AiMUu1FpG3fHp5lh-rek-CoTAzKhVShk4b1Q?authuser=1&hl=en
[2014-07-28 15:31:34 -0400] j^2: try that
[2014-07-28 15:35:44 -0400] markvan: j^2: sorry having trouble with hangout account today
[2014-07-28 15:45:37 -0400] PaulCzar_: https://github.com/cloudcadre/giftwrap
[2014-07-28 16:00:28 -0400] j^2: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/109866/
[2014-07-28 16:30:27 -0400] j^2: markvan: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/109866/ i think i got it
[2014-07-28 16:30:31 -0400] j^2: i'm waiting on the build
[2014-07-28 16:30:35 -0400] j^2: i tested locally also
[2014-07-28 16:30:49 -0400] markvan: j^2: yup, doing testing here as well.
[2014-07-28 16:40:44 -0400] markvan: j^2: I updated bug to have list of order to do these in to get berksfile.lock's updated correctly.
[2014-07-28 16:42:05 -0400] j^2: oh rock on
[2014-07-28 16:42:08 -0400] j^2: thanks :)
[2014-07-28 16:48:13 -0400] markvan: j^2: just a nit, but I think we want to use that bug for all these changes, so Partial-Bug instead of Closes-Bug?
[2014-07-28 16:50:20 -0400] j^2: yeah that seems correct
[2014-07-28 16:55:29 -0400] ctracey: sorry - cant join most mondays. though my ears were ringing :)
[2014-07-28 16:56:11 -0400] j^2: ctracey: no worries
[2014-07-28 16:56:30 -0400] ctracey: would love to have people using giftwrap, so please let me know what you folks need
[2014-07-28 16:56:40 -0400] j^2: nice
[2014-07-28 16:57:03 -0400] ctracey: going to be making a heavy push on it this week - get it into our playbooks
[2014-07-28 17:07:59 -0400] galstrom: mattray: can you set the development focus for openstack-chef to juno?
[2014-07-28 17:08:54 -0400] markvan: j^2: I really don't like that tweaking commit msg loses all the review and respins.  but I did that to the common one.
[2014-07-28 17:09:03 -0400] j^2: kk
[2014-07-28 17:09:32 -0400] mattray: galstrom: done
[2014-07-28 17:11:29 -0400] galstrom: mattray: ty
[2014-07-28 17:14:29 -0400] galstrom: j^2: i marked havana series as no longer active, and marked icehouse rc1/stable as released
[2014-07-28 17:14:44 -0400] j^2: :-O
[2014-07-28 17:14:46 -0400] j^2: \o/
[2014-07-28 17:14:54 -0400] j^2: works for me thanks :)
[2014-07-28 17:29:28 -0400] galstrom: so why did we mark that common patch as partial-bug?
[2014-07-28 17:29:43 -0400] galstrom: i miss filed the identity bug against the common bug
[2014-07-28 17:30:11 -0400] galstrom: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/109868/ has the right bug in the commit msg
[2014-07-28 17:31:05 -0400] galstrom: j^2, markvan: ^
[2014-07-28 17:33:03 -0400] markvan: galstrom: ok, one bug per.  I was thinking we could use one for all.
[2014-07-28 17:33:30 -0400] galstrom: ah
[2014-07-28 17:49:08 -0400] markvan: j^2: galstrom_zzz: are you ok  with using the identity bug 1349154 for all the rest.  I have most of the other patches about ready to go once common and identity get in.
[2014-07-28 17:49:35 -0400] galstrom: i dont care either way.. i was just setting up seperate bugs for each repo.. but i am fine with using one bug
[2014-07-28 17:51:48 -0400] markvan: galstrom: k, thx.  I put the rest under that one.
[2014-07-28 18:13:38 -0400] markvan: j^2: I think common looks ready now.
[2014-07-28 18:17:37 -0400] ianrossi: Hey guys galstrom mattt PaulCzar_ Has anyone seen this error? My run list is included along with my environment file. cinder-manage db sync can't work because there is no cinder user: https://gist.github.com/ianrossi/8d4f670e21fd531d8495
[2014-07-28 18:19:01 -0400] PaulCzar_: ianrossi: do you need a a databag with cinders DB user/pass in it ?
[2014-07-28 18:23:01 -0400] ianrossi: Well, since developer_mode is true, I thought I didn't need that databag
[2014-07-28 18:25:00 -0400] PaulCzar_: hrmmm, good point
[2014-07-28 18:26:10 -0400] PaulCzar_: does mysql have a cinder user ?
[2014-07-28 18:26:22 -0400] PaulCzar_: I think it still creates the user, but sets the password to the username
[2014-07-28 18:26:29 -0400] PaulCzar_: so it should be cinder/cinder
[2014-07-28 18:26:54 -0400] ianrossi: I checked on that and there's no cinder user in the mysql user table  :(
[2014-07-28 18:27:22 -0400] ianrossi: I searched through the cookbooks to see where/how the user is getting created and I don't think I could find it. Do you happen to know where that happens?
[2014-07-28 18:27:27 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar_, ^
[2014-07-28 18:27:52 -0400] PaulCzar_: yeah, I think it happens in the openstack-common
[2014-07-28 18:28:09 -0400] PaulCzar_: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/libraries/database.rb#L31
[2014-07-28 18:30:03 -0400] ianrossi: Yeah so it should be happening since that cb is a dep of the block-storage cookbook. BTW, I'm using stable/havana. Would like icehouse, but didn't see a stable/icehouse for the openstack-chef-repo.
[2014-07-28 18:30:27 -0400] PaulCzar_: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-ops-database/blob/6d5e7043b4044c6af6c10903b6b4a01cfb9d5bee/recipes/openstack-db.rb
[2014-07-28 18:32:17 -0400] PaulCzar_: blerg, thats pretty gross.  there should be some sort of attribute list showing which services are enabled and iterate through that.
[2014-07-28 18:51:01 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar_, Yeah that would look a bit nicer. Well, I guess I should take a look through the Chef run to see if Chef is trying to create the user.
[2014-07-28 19:01:22 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar_, Any ideas beyond that?
[2014-07-28 19:08:14 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar_, I think I found it. That recipe, openstack-ops-database::openstack-db, rolls up into roles/os-compute-single-controller.rb, which comes after the block-storage stuff in my run list. I'm going to change up the order and try again. Is there a place to find out what role ordering with this stuff.
[2014-07-28 19:30:15 -0400] j^2: markvan: i think we are just waiting on merge of the common cookbook now
[2014-07-28 19:33:09 -0400] markvan: yup,when that goes...I can start updating the Berks lock for the others and cascade them in
[2014-07-28 19:42:21 -0400] j^2: :)
[2014-07-28 19:46:38 -0400] ianrossi: Hi mattray, Can you comment on the issue I was discussing with PaulCzar_ ? I'm using openstack-chef-repo but on three nodes and I haven't found anything in the docs about how to order the roles in run lists? Can you shed any light?
[2014-07-28 19:48:24 -0400] mattray: ianrossi: the order of the allinone can be extrapolated to multiple machines
[2014-07-28 19:48:39 -0400] PaulCzar_: ianrossi: looking back at your roles  I think just just need os-compute-single-contriller then os-block-storage
[2014-07-28 19:48:49 -0400] mattray: ianrossi: yeah, what he said
[2014-07-28 19:48:52 -0400] PaulCzar_: I think the others you have are already covered in single-controller
[2014-07-28 19:49:10 -0400] mattray: something missing from single-controller?
[2014-07-28 19:49:20 -0400] j^2: it looks like for a all in one: https://github.com/jjasghar/singlestack/blob/master/test.rb#L19-L25
[2014-07-28 19:49:22 -0400] j^2: that's all you need
[2014-07-28 19:49:24 -0400] mattray: it's probably a little stale
[2014-07-28 19:49:28 -0400] j^2: granted that's chef-metal
[2014-07-28 19:49:36 -0400] ianrossi: mattray, PaulCzar_ I'm running it like that now and testing. Just have to bind mysql to non 127.0.0.1. That's for the pointer! I hadn't thought of that. :)
[2014-07-28 19:50:27 -0400] mattray: but 3 nodes would probably be 1 single-controller and 2 compute-workers
[2014-07-28 19:50:45 -0400] mattray: or the single-controller could possibly run compute too if it's beefy enough
[2014-07-28 19:50:57 -0400] PaulCzar_: j^2: oh man, would love to see a chef-metal for a 3 or 4 node openstack
[2014-07-28 19:51:06 -0400] mattray: he's working on it :)
[2014-07-28 19:51:31 -0400] j^2: PaulCzar_: i'm really close to getting the framework done
[2014-07-28 19:51:48 -0400] j^2: PaulCzar_: i just need to work with jkeiser a little bit to top it off
[2014-07-28 19:54:55 -0400] ianrossi: Oh mattray any time frame on when the openstack-chef-repo will have a stable/icehouse?
[2014-07-28 19:55:09 -0400] j^2: ianrossi: it's on my list to get done
[2014-07-28 19:55:29 -0400] ianrossi: j^2, Awwwwsum, thank you
[2014-07-28 19:56:04 -0400] j^2: ianrossi: with the crazyness with vagrant and chef-zero right now, that's why i'm focusing on chef-metal to wrap it all up in one thing
[2014-07-28 19:56:20 -0400] j^2: i'm not far off, but still have a bit to go
[2014-07-28 19:56:27 -0400] j^2: don't worry it's very much on my radar
[2014-07-28 19:59:04 -0400] j^2: markvan: common is merged to origin/stable/icehouse
[2014-07-28 20:00:52 -0400] galstrom: i am fixing identity
[2014-07-28 20:00:59 -0400] markvan: yup, just pushed up  ops-db, ops-msg, dashboard, obj-storage   the others that only rely on common.  Once identity goes, most of the rest can go.
[2014-07-28 20:02:41 -0400] j^2: galstrom: awesome i'll review identiy when it's ready
[2014-07-28 20:06:06 -0400] galstrom: stupid berksfile
[2014-07-28 20:06:18 -0400] galstrom: getting a failed to download 'openstack-common'
[2014-07-28 20:07:03 -0400] j^2: :-/
[2014-07-28 20:10:11 -0400] markvan: galstrom:  I'm berks installing common at ref: b8633843349809e2675744f211c89bf06d249b7e without issues.
[2014-07-28 20:11:04 -0400] galstrom: markvan: give me a sec to slap berksfile around
[2014-07-28 20:23:26 -0400] galstrom: markvan: i am not sure what is going on.. but i can not get berks to install openstack-common
[2014-07-28 20:23:49 -0400] markvan: galstrom: humm, odd
[2014-07-28 20:25:19 -0400] galstrom: nvm.. it is my network
[2014-07-28 20:25:28 -0400] galstrom: i am getting connection refused errors
[2014-07-28 20:25:31 -0400] galstrom: :(
[2014-07-28 20:44:37 -0400] j^2: just +2'd https://review.openstack.org/#/c/109868/
[2014-07-28 20:44:50 -0400] j^2: still need a +1 or 2 +1, iirc
[2014-07-28 20:46:41 -0400] galstrom: j^2: that patchset has the wrong openstack-common repo ref
[2014-07-28 20:46:45 -0400] galstrom: it needs to be updated
[2014-07-28 20:47:00 -0400] galstrom: and my network hates me at the moment.. so no berks install from github for me
[2014-07-28 20:47:01 -0400] galstrom: :(
[2014-07-28 20:48:34 -0400] j^2: :-O
[2014-07-28 20:49:37 -0400] j^2: i'm assuming markvan's suggestion above?
[2014-07-28 20:49:39 -0400] j^2: b8633843349809e2675744f211c89bf06d249b7e
[2014-07-28 20:50:59 -0400] markvan: j^2:  yup, that should do the trick
[2014-07-28 20:51:06 -0400] j^2: k, making teh change
[2014-07-28 20:56:09 -0400] j^2: pushed up
[2014-07-28 21:00:57 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-ceph: Normalizing this cookbook  https://review.openstack.org/109341
[2014-07-28 21:14:50 -0400] markvan: j^2: looks like something happened to zuul, backlog is almost off the chart.   I'll check back later tonight and get the rest of these done.
[2014-07-28 21:37:30 -0400] j^2: ah cool
[2014-07-28 21:37:33 -0400] j^2: :)
