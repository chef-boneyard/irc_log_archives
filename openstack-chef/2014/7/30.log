[2014-07-30 15:36:30 -0400] markvan: j^2:   yeah, need the +2's to happen first.
[2014-07-30 15:36:53 -0400] j^2: heh
[2014-07-30 16:06:41 -0400] j^2: wow ReST is hard to make tables in
[2014-07-30 16:06:59 -0400] j^2: im trying to get the first doc in the specs directory today
[2014-07-30 16:07:20 -0400] j^2: this ischallanging
[2014-07-30 16:16:49 -0400] galstrom: ok.. the stable/icehouse reviews should be gating now
[2014-07-30 16:21:29 -0400] j^2: \o/
[2014-07-30 16:25:30 -0400] galstrom: I unblocked https://review.openstack.org/#/c/110359/ since common has merged
[2014-07-30 16:27:49 -0400] j^2: rock on
[2014-07-30 16:28:11 -0400] galstrom: all of the master reviews.. that dep on only common should be gating as well

[2014-07-30 16:42:53 -0400] markvan: j^2: about the blue print process.  Since we have some that are already in launchpad, does it sound right to create the rst in specs repo and then add a link to the launchpad one.  And maybe set the definition status to "discussion" ?
[2014-07-30 16:43:30 -0400] j^2: discussion
[2014-07-30 16:43:51 -0400] j^2: and probably link it too
[2014-07-30 16:43:52 -0400] markvan: I mean to have the owners create the specs docs, I was not implying that we would push them all over.
[2014-07-30 16:43:59 -0400] j^2: ohh
[2014-07-30 16:44:28 -0400] markvan: but when they do move, would be nice to know which ones those are and be able to link to the review discussion.
[2014-07-30 16:44:30 -0400] j^2: anything for juno i think we should push over till its been blessed but thats my opnion
[2014-07-30 16:44:41 -0400] j^2: ah
[2014-07-30 16:45:15 -0400] markvan: I did not want to create unnecessary spec doc's if the owners are not around or willing anymore.
[2014-07-30 16:45:16 -0400] j^2: yeah makes sense, so when its in discussion that means its commentable via the specs directory, then when we mark it as yes lets do this then we change the status again
[2014-07-30 16:45:33 -0400] markvan: yup, that would help with the status part of it.
[2014-07-30 16:46:00 -0400] markvan: Now, we just need to get owners on board to start creating/using the specs repo.
[2014-07-30 16:46:59 -0400] j^2: agreed
[2014-07-30 16:47:29 -0400] j^2: i guess thats why im trying to get the first one up ;) all you need is one pebble to start an avalanche or something poetic like that
[2014-07-30 16:50:06 -0400] markvan: yeah, maybe we need to tweak the readme a bit more to cover some of these small details  (a what happend to existing new blueprints in launchpad; move content to specs, adding link and set definition status to discussion.
[2014-07-30 16:50:25 -0400] markvan: happens
[2014-07-30 16:51:27 -0400] j^2: makes sense
[2014-07-30 16:51:46 -0400] j^2: have a one stop shop for how we want our process to get done
[2014-07-30 16:51:59 -0400] j^2: granted i think its safe to say we are still making it ;)
[2014-07-30 16:54:16 -0400] markvan: j^2: looks like all the icehouse branch is locked down now.  Did you decide on what to do with that icehouse openstack-chef-repo?  I can at least update the berks, gem and .git files.
[2014-07-30 16:54:43 -0400] markvan: If your going to focus metal on Juno, then we can just put basics into icehouse for now.
[2014-07-30 16:54:56 -0400] j^2: yeah i was going to focus on metal for juno
[2014-07-30 16:55:15 -0400] markvan: ok, I'll push something up for icehouse repo for basic locking updates.
[2014-07-30 16:55:35 -0400] j^2: if you want to lock down icehouse be my guest. i still cant get it to boot, ill give it another shot here soon to see if any patches have been released
[2014-07-30 16:55:39 -0400] markvan: and then we can branch it a bit later for juno.
[2014-07-30 16:56:48 -0400] j^2: +1

[2014-07-30 21:29:12 -0400] markvan: j^2: that updating environment:  is the difference between your back to back runs, not sure what that means.
[2014-07-30 21:30:03 -0400] j^2: yeah there is no difference, i just run the tox command once it fails, second time it succeeds
[2014-07-30 21:30:08 -0400] j^2: i think thats what your asking
[2014-07-30 21:32:08 -0400] markvan: j^2: I meant take a look at the "updating environment:" line in the output, seems like intersting difference.
