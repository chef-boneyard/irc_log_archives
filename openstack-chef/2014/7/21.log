[2014-07-21 13:28:23 -0400] nacer: hi tehre
[2014-07-21 13:28:49 -0400] nacer: how can i relaunch the gate test for my patch ?
[2014-07-21 13:33:31 -0400] iartarisi: Hi, nacer. Check out this page: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GerritJenkinsGithub#Test_Failures
[2014-07-21 13:34:10 -0400] iartarisi: feel free to ask if something is still unclear after reading that
[2014-07-21 13:34:50 -0400] nacer: iartarisi: hi
[2014-07-21 13:35:00 -0400] nacer: iartarisi: it look like i need to reverify bug ####
[2014-07-21 13:35:30 -0400] iartarisi: right
[2014-07-21 13:35:44 -0400] iartarisi: replace the '####' though :)
[2014-07-21 13:35:49 -0400] nacer: yeah :)
[2014-07-21 13:35:52 -0400] nacer: let's try that
[2014-07-21 13:36:18 -0400] iartarisi: I saw a 'reverify bug ####' comment a few days ago ;)
[2014-07-21 13:36:56 -0400] nacer: hehe :)
[2014-07-21 13:44:10 -0400] iartarisi: nacer: ah, just saw your Change. You'll want to do 'recheck bug ###' there since this is still the verification jenkins job.
[2014-07-21 13:44:27 -0400] iartarisi: The gate job runs after the commit has been approved by reviewers and is ready to be committed to git.
[2014-07-21 13:45:03 -0400] iartarisi: nacer: also, the bug number in the recheck query should be the bug responsible for fixing the jenkins issue that you're having, not the bug that your commit is fixing.
[2014-07-21 13:59:01 -0400] nacer: iartarisi: i have made a recheck bug 1311778
[2014-07-21 14:00:07 -0400] iartarisi: nacer: cool!
[2014-07-21 14:01:17 -0400] nacer: iartarisi: are you going to go to the paris event ?
[2014-07-21 14:01:38 -0400] iartarisi: nacer: I might, but I don't know yet.
[2014-07-21 14:01:45 -0400] nacer: iartarisi: i did not get a invite because people who commit to stackforge don't get one :)
[2014-07-21 14:01:59 -0400] iartarisi: yeah :)
[2014-07-21 14:02:15 -0400] iartarisi: I think you still have a few days left, don't you?
[2014-07-21 14:58:02 -0400] nacer: iartarisi: :)

[2014-07-21 15:26:47 -0400] markvan_: mattray: ok on mtg, my topic was the Juno branch.   The blueprint topic in the ML has not gotten much feedback, so I take that as a good sign.
[2014-07-21 15:27:47 -0400] j^2: \o/
[2014-07-21 15:28:42 -0400] j^2: oh, so we aren't having the meeting today?

[2014-07-21 15:29:38 -0400] mattray: I'm leaving right now

[2014-07-21 16:11:58 -0400] iartarisi: there's a table at the bottom and we have two reviewers who are not core and have more reviews than the core so they might be good candidates for core :)
[2014-07-21 16:12:45 -0400] iartarisi: but we'll need to do something about the one-company rule :)

[2014-07-21 18:16:17 -0400] markvan_: galstrom: ^^    Do we need a job defined for that new repo, we call out gate-{name}-docs, but don't define that anywhere.
[2014-07-21 18:17:44 -0400] galstrom: so.. i am not sure
[2014-07-21 18:18:01 -0400] galstrom: i have the gate-chef-openstack-specs-docs job defined
[2014-07-21 18:18:04 -0400] galstrom: which is a macro
[2014-07-21 18:18:12 -0400] galstrom: we will have to do some tox and sphinx doc stuff
[2014-07-21 18:18:16 -0400] galstrom: but i think we can do it
