[2014-07-23 11:25:27 -0400] jklare: anybody any ideas on integreting methods for using vault to store secrets in the openstack-common-cookbook?
[2014-07-23 14:00:37 -0400] ianrossi: I have three nodes in my lab and I'm looking to setup Openstack with Chef but I want the Openstack services to be HA. Can someone point me in the right direction? Does the stackforge openstack-chef-repo and cookbooks support this?
[2014-07-23 14:45:51 -0400] ianrossi: Hi PaulCzar, saw your work on the openstack-docker cookbook. Nice work, hope to be able to use it. Can you shed any light on my above question? The last time I deployed Openstack HA was with Juju but I'd like to do it with Chef.
[2014-07-23 14:46:10 -0400] ianrossi: carlp, ctracey ^ Anything to add?
[2014-07-23 14:48:19 -0400] PaulCzar: ianrossi: unfortunately thats a pretty outdated cookbook,  a lot has changed since in the nova-docker driver
[2014-07-23 14:48:29 -0400] PaulCzar: in fact,  Id completely forgotten Id even done it :D
[2014-07-23 14:48:39 -0400] ianrossi: That's great info, thanks
[2014-07-23 14:49:19 -0400] PaulCzar: it is however on my list of things to fix to get ready for the openstack-paas cookbook
[2014-07-23 14:49:23 -0400] ianrossi: Noticed it was rewritten for Havana.
[2014-07-23 14:51:29 -0400] ianrossi:  PaulCzar, Nice, Solum looks cool. Well, do you have any suggestion on where to start with a 3 node Openstack deployment using Chef? I would prefer to run the controller services HA.
[2014-07-23 14:51:42 -0400] PaulCzar: yeah, it probably ( maybe? ) still works for Havana  but for icehouse its useless
[2014-07-23 14:51:43 -0400] iartarisi: ianrossi: the stackforge cookbooks don't support HA, but FWIW the cookbooks we use in SUSE Cloud do support HA. You can take a look at: https://github.com/crowbar/barclamp-pacemaker/tree/master/chef/cookbooks and then replace pacemaker in that url with other openstack components.
[2014-07-23 14:52:52 -0400] PaulCzar: ianrossi: the folks running HA openstack controller based on the chef cookbooks are doing it via their own wrapper cookbooks for those components
[2014-07-23 14:53:44 -0400] PaulCzar: ianrossi: so youd want to run your own wrapper cookbooks to create HA mysql and HA rabbit  then youd need to write a wrapper cookbook to put haproxy or something similar in front of the APIs
[2014-07-23 14:54:48 -0400] PaulCzar: ianrossi: the cookbook-openstack-ops-messaging and cookbook-openstack-ops-database can be used as a reference for writing HA cookbooks for mysql/rabbit
[2014-07-23 14:55:03 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar, Thanks, I thought that might be the case, was just checking if there was something already done or in progress that I could utilize.
[2014-07-23 14:55:42 -0400] ianrossi: iartarisi, Thanks for the tip, I'll check it out. The nodes are runnning Ubuntu 14.04, not sure if those cookbooks will support that or if I'd have to move to SUSE.
[2014-07-23 14:55:47 -0400] PaulCzar: ianrossi: theres been some talk about some folks working on reference implementations of HA  but everyone does it differently :D
[2014-07-23 14:56:04 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar, Yeah that's true
[2014-07-23 14:56:36 -0400] PaulCzar: ianrossi: also if youre running ubuntu 14.04  you might need to monkeypatch the service calls like this - https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+bug/1313646
[2014-07-23 14:56:54 -0400] PaulCzar: because of some changes they made to the services/upstart stuff in the openstack packages for 14.04
[2014-07-23 14:57:36 -0400] ianrossi: Oh shoot, I thought there would be some gotchas with 14.04, have you found 12.04 to be better for Icehouse?
[2014-07-23 14:57:42 -0400] iartarisi: ianrossi: right, those cookbooks were mostly untested on distros other than SLES.
[2014-07-23 14:58:52 -0400] PaulCzar: ianrossi: 12.04 is a better choice for general supportablity  for instance the apache chef cookbook doesnt work on 14.04 yet either
[2014-07-23 14:59:25 -0400] ianrossi: PaulCzar, Nice thanks
