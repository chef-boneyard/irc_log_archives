[2014-07-09 14:51:03 -0400] markvan: jklare: np
[2014-07-09 14:51:23 -0400] mattray: markvan: I'll +2 them again
[2014-07-09 15:02:13 -0400] markvan: mattray: thx.    iartarisi: ^^^
[2014-07-09 15:03:21 -0400] markvan: j^2:  I asked a few questions on your Havana gem changes...the main one being why you had to bump any cookbook levels?
[2014-07-09 15:21:50 -0400] j^2: markvan: completely agree with you and the stable berksfile comments, i'll comment back, and i'm going to revisit the changes i made
[2014-07-09 15:28:09 -0400] openstackgerrit: JJ Asghar proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: Updating Berks to 2.0.18  https://review.openstack.org/105768
[2014-07-09 15:28:21 -0400] j^2: markvan: ^^^
[2014-07-09 15:28:29 -0400] j^2: that should be the correct set up now
[2014-07-09 15:35:31 -0400] markvan: j^2: just peeked at that one, I think you might run into the rspec and hashie issue I had, that's why I had to add them to the gem file for master.  I see the your lock now has rspec 2.99.1 which will cause some unit test grief I believe.
[2014-07-09 15:36:35 -0400] j^2: markvan: ah nice, thanks for the heads up. I'll see where this goes and i'll make the changes as needed. Man that strainerfile was a nasty stumbling block
[2014-07-09 15:37:14 -0400] markvan: yup, recursive bundle is way bad...
[2014-07-09 15:37:38 -0400] j^2: heh
[2014-07-09 15:38:24 -0400] iartarisi: markvan: I'm back. So you want me to +2 everything? :)

[2014-07-09 15:56:18 -0400] j^2: then also a strainer issue that i just talked to mattray about
[2014-07-09 15:56:39 -0400] j^2: oh bundler i love and hate you so much
[2014-07-09 15:57:09 -0400] j^2: granted i do love figuring this stuff out
[2014-07-09 15:57:18 -0400] j^2: it's like a never ending puzzle

[2014-07-09 15:57:46 -0400] markvan: j^2: for strainer, do you think we also might need this on the master branch?
[2014-07-09 15:59:17 -0400] j^2: the strainer fix was due to your comment about the spec_helper earlier. it seems that it isnt needed any more the reason why i commented it out. Taking mattray's advice i'm attempted to pin the version so we dont need to change and underlying code
[2014-07-09 15:59:29 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image: Update Gemfile and remove lock  https://review.openstack.org/105572
[2014-07-09 16:00:34 -0400] j^2: markvan: tl;dr i'm not sure about the master branch yet ;)
[2014-07-09 16:01:08 -0400] mattray: markvan: I'm more inclined to remove Strainer altogether, I'm not sure the value it's providing anymore
[2014-07-09 16:01:42 -0400] mattray: (in master)
[2014-07-09 16:01:45 -0400] j^2: it seem like it really is just a wrapper for like four commands
[2014-07-09 16:01:51 -0400] j^2: it is pretty in the cli though ;P
[2014-07-09 16:02:19 -0400] markvan: mattray: yeah, maybe a good topic for next mtg.  I have don't see a major benefit from using it.
[2014-07-09 16:02:46 -0400] mattray: yeah, no rush
[2014-07-09 16:03:01 -0400] mattray: for now let's pin the version in the stable branches and leave it alone in master
[2014-07-09 16:03:08 -0400] j^2: +1
[2014-07-09 16:03:43 -0400] markvan: mattray: ok.  maybe a juno blueprint to improve testing a bit?

[2014-07-09 16:06:04 -0400] mattray: if we're branching for juno soon, we can leave this alone until then
[2014-07-09 16:08:29 -0400] markvan: mattray: yup, agreed
[2014-07-09 16:09:05 -0400] j^2: grr https://review.openstack.org/#/c/105768/ didnt take the strainer pinning

[2014-07-09 19:49:23 -0400] mattray: markvan: galstrom_zzz: ctracey: ??
[2014-07-09 19:49:32 -0400] mattray: since we're both working for Chef and all?
[2014-07-09 19:54:48 -0400] j^2: \o/
[2014-07-09 20:06:09 -0400] mattt: markvan: k trying now

[2014-07-09 20:41:31 -0400] j^2: man this object-store proxy chefspec failure is killing me
[2014-07-09 20:41:52 -0400] j^2: it seems there'se been a refactor since the havana/stable branch was cut too
[2014-07-09 20:42:01 -0400] j^2: plus an update on chefspec
[2014-07-09 20:42:07 -0400] j^2: and fauxhai

[2014-07-09 20:43:27 -0400] mattt: so we don't need Gemfile.lock in master branch?
[2014-07-09 20:43:49 -0400] j^2: mattt: we decided no, Gemfile.lock is for "stable" branches is the logic ATM
[2014-07-09 20:45:55 -0400] mattt: j^2: k thanks !

[2014-07-09 20:46:50 -0400] j^2: if i could tackle this issues i'm complaining about :P, that was next on my list

[2014-07-09 20:47:40 -0400] mattt: that'd be great, thanks j^2
[2014-07-09 20:47:53 -0400] mattt: i probably need to fix havana too, but i'll see how this does first
[2014-07-09 20:48:11 -0400] j^2: i've been doing all the havana branches ;) i can take care of it
[2014-07-09 20:48:22 -0400] j^2: as soon as i tackle this thing
[2014-07-09 20:48:27 -0400] mattt: sweet

[2014-07-09 20:53:39 -0400] j^2: ha! welcome to my world. :P I mean i could try to pull in the refactor'd spec directory, but man that seems like overkill

[2014-07-09 20:57:23 -0400] j^2: you need to add hashie to gem file it seems
[2014-07-09 20:57:26 -0400] j^2: deps
[2014-07-09 20:57:34 -0400] mattt: bollox

[2014-07-09 21:05:46 -0400] mattt: j^2: i'm not even understanding what it's saying about hashie
[2014-07-09 21:06:18 -0400] j^2: mattt: give me a couple i'll ping you in just a sec, i think i may have beaten this thing

[2014-07-09 21:07:28 -0400] j^2: get it? gist/gist? :P
[2014-07-09 21:08:18 -0400] mattt: hehe
[2014-07-09 21:08:25 -0400] mattt: yeah i saw the error, but do not compute
[2014-07-09 21:08:26 -0400] mattt: :P
[2014-07-09 21:08:35 -0400] j^2: heh
[2014-07-09 21:08:40 -0400] mattt: i get it locally also
[2014-07-09 21:09:09 -0400] j^2: add:
[2014-07-09 21:09:11 -0400] j^2: gem 'hashie', '~> 2.0'
[2014-07-09 21:09:13 -0400] j^2: gem 'rspec', '~> 2.14.1'Y
[2014-07-09 21:09:15 -0400] j^2: to the Gemfile
[2014-07-09 21:09:19 -0400] j^2: that should get it done for you
[2014-07-09 21:11:28 -0400] mattt: guessing berkshelf 3 would help here :P
[2014-07-09 21:11:42 -0400] j^2: heh, true dat
[2014-07-09 21:11:59 -0400] mattt: not sure why it needs us to specify that hashie requirement when it's already specified by berkshelf itself
[2014-07-09 21:12:03 -0400] mattt: but that's for another day
[2014-07-09 21:12:49 -0400] j^2: :D
[2014-07-09 21:14:01 -0400] mattt: j^2: i shouldn't need that rspec dependency since we're not testing anything on that repo
[2014-07-09 21:14:06 -0400] mattt: (openstack-chef-repo)
[2014-07-09 21:14:56 -0400] j^2: ah good call

[2014-07-09 21:15:14 -0400] j^2: yeah i just copypasta'd that from my notes trynig to get this damn havana build works
[2014-07-09 21:15:18 -0400] j^2: working*
[2014-07-09 21:15:41 -0400] mattt: no dice w/ that yet ?
[2014-07-09 21:16:23 -0400] j^2: the object-storage has been the bain of my existance
[2014-07-09 21:16:28 -0400] j^2: testing that is
[2014-07-09 21:16:30 -0400] j^2: yeah
[2014-07-09 21:16:56 -0400] j^2: turns out if i update/downgrade chefspec too, more tests fail
[2014-07-09 21:17:16 -0400] j^2: which makes me uncomfortable for future testing needless to say
[2014-07-09 21:17:53 -0400] j^2: luckly only "1" test fails with 3.4.0 so i'm sticking with that
[2014-07-09 21:17:57 -0400] j^2: but it's this cpu dude
[2014-07-09 21:18:32 -0400] mattt: and those tests all pass on master for that cookbook?
[2014-07-09 21:18:38 -0400] j^2: https://gist.github.com/jjasghar/79fb8fa4d5866b2511ce
[2014-07-09 21:18:40 -0400] j^2: that's the gist
[2014-07-09 21:18:42 -0400] mattt: bit slow, it's 10:20 PM here and it's been a very long day :P
[2014-07-09 21:18:47 -0400] j^2: heh no worries
[2014-07-09 21:19:16 -0400] j^2: i'm on the stable/havana branch trynig to get the last repo up to 2.0.18 berkshelf
[2014-07-09 21:19:32 -0400] j^2: everything but that node[cpu] test passes
[2014-07-09 21:20:32 -0400] mattt: bump chefspec and be done w/ it ;P
[2014-07-09 21:21:00 -0400] j^2: ha! 17 tests fail then ;)
[2014-07-09 21:21:06 -0400] j^2: or something like that
[2014-07-09 21:21:14 -0400] mattt: including that cpu one?  :P
[2014-07-09 21:21:24 -0400] j^2: that's actaully a great question
[2014-07-09 21:21:40 -0400] j^2: https://gist.github.com/jjasghar/79fb8fa4d5866b2511ce#file-blah-sh-L53
[2014-07-09 21:21:46 -0400] j^2: that's the issue right there ^
[2014-07-09 21:21:48 -0400] j^2: grrrrrrrrrr
[2014-07-09 21:21:59 -0400] mattt: :(
[2014-07-09 21:22:05 -0400] j^2: i need that to be a 5
[2014-07-09 21:22:06 -0400] j^2: not 1
[2014-07-09 21:22:09 -0400] j^2: boooo
[2014-07-09 21:22:41 -0400] j^2: plus we only have 33% test coverage on this cookbook too...that seems disappointing
[2014-07-09 21:22:44 -0400] j^2: but one thing at a time
[2014-07-09 21:23:41 -0400] mattt: i've never used that cookbook
[2014-07-09 21:23:43 -0400] mattt: not once

[2014-07-09 21:25:50 -0400] mattt: andymccr made that change, can't remember the specifics but that's the only thing in teh back of my head regarding fauxhai and cpus
[2014-07-09 21:29:41 -0400] j^2: oh nice thanks
[2014-07-09 21:30:43 -0400] mattt: j^2: doesn't fail for me :(
[2014-07-09 21:31:13 -0400] mattt: 76 examples, 0 failures, 6 pending
[2014-07-09 21:31:46 -0400] j^2: ah yeah
[2014-07-09 21:31:52 -0400] j^2: but you havent updated berkshelf yet ;)
[2014-07-09 21:32:06 -0400] j^2: done the bundle update
[2014-07-09 21:32:17 -0400] j^2: and then started to cry inside
[2014-07-09 21:32:20 -0400] j^2: that's required for this
[2014-07-09 21:32:22 -0400] j^2: btw ;0
[2014-07-09 21:32:24 -0400] j^2: ;)
[2014-07-09 21:32:59 -0400] mattt: why make life so difficult
[2014-07-09 21:33:57 -0400] j^2: heh, very good question. i'm starting back over and going to just lock stuff down
[2014-07-09 21:35:09 -0400] j^2: wow

[2014-07-09 21:36:10 -0400] mattt: j^2: still got no failure
[2014-07-09 21:36:21 -0400] mattt: j^2: added that junk to Gemspec, then did a bundle update berkshelf
[2014-07-09 21:36:32 -0400] j^2: hmm
[2014-07-09 21:36:34 -0400] j^2: ok
[2014-07-09 21:37:06 -0400] mattt: that updated a crap ton of stuff in Gemfile.lock tho
[2014-07-09 21:37:27 -0400] j^2: it really does
[2014-07-09 21:39:31 -0400] mattt: not sure why i got that hashie failure again
[2014-07-09 21:39:53 -0400] j^2: just updating berkshelf to 2.0.18 and running bundle update then rspec spec
[2014-07-09 21:39:55 -0400] j^2: 76 examples, 7 failures
[2014-07-09 21:39:58 -0400] j^2: come on!
[2014-07-09 21:41:11 -0400] mattt: this night is full of fail
[2014-07-09 21:41:16 -0400] j^2: totally
[2014-07-09 21:50:02 -0400] mattt: i don't get this hashie error
[2014-07-09 21:50:10 -0400] mattt: even w/ my Gemfile updated it still sometimes fails
[2014-07-09 21:50:39 -0400] j^2: crazy
[2014-07-09 21:50:52 -0400] j^2: can you put a couple gists together? I'd like to take a look

[2014-07-09 21:58:10 -0400] j^2: round three? :P
[2014-07-09 21:59:07 -0400] mattt: honestly i'm sure berkshelf 2 just doesn't work
[2014-07-09 22:00:00 -0400] j^2: :-/
[2014-07-09 22:00:27 -0400] mattt: i added rspec to Gemfile for giggles, but i don't think that should be in there
[2014-07-09 22:00:52 -0400] j^2: heh
[2014-07-09 22:01:48 -0400] mattt: after i added hashie i could do a bundle install
[2014-07-09 22:02:04 -0400] mattt: went back after the subsequent failure and bundle install failed again after removing Gemfile.lock
[2014-07-09 22:02:16 -0400] mattt: added rspec to Gemfile and of course a bundle install works
[2014-07-09 22:02:28 -0400] mattt: tried removing Gemfile.lock a few times and doing bundle install again and it worked
[2014-07-09 22:02:31 -0400] mattt: but i'm sure the gate will fail
[2014-07-09 22:02:40 -0400] j^2: ouch
[2014-07-09 22:04:10 -0400] mattt: heh success
[2014-07-09 22:04:12 -0400] mattt: wtf.

[2014-07-09 22:10:34 -0400] j^2: mattt: +1'd
[2014-07-09 22:12:25 -0400] mattt: j^2: thanks, still don't get why it took w/ rspec, since we're not even using rspec there
[2014-07-09 22:12:29 -0400] mattt: but i give up
[2014-07-09 22:12:38 -0400] j^2: heh
[2014-07-09 22:12:48 -0400] j^2: smile and nod man smile and nod ;)
[2014-07-09 22:13:12 -0400] j^2: it's crazy how much the berkshelf upgrade has changed the dependancies
[2014-07-09 22:14:01 -0400] mattt: j^2: i'm out, good luck tracking down that bug
[2014-07-09 22:14:17 -0400] j^2: thanks :D
