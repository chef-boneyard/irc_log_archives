[2014-06-17 15:49:49 -0400] nacer: gleam: i don't see it !
[2014-06-17 15:49:58 -0400] nacer: :)

[2014-06-17 15:54:14 -0400] gleam: god, where did I see that? now I'm going to kill myself trying to figure it out
[2014-06-17 15:54:59 -0400] gleam: oh, i was looking at the ceph openstack documentation at the same time I was looking at the block-storage cookbook and must have conflated them
[2014-06-17 15:55:16 -0400] gleam: that said, the block storage cookbook does have the ability to pass arbitrary settings
[2014-06-17 15:55:23 -0400] gleam: so you should be able to pass the backup_* settings
[2014-06-17 15:55:27 -0400] nacer: oh nice

[2014-06-17 16:49:59 -0400] mattray: not really. In a meeting, leaving for lunch
[2014-06-17 16:50:14 -0400] mike`: kk. eta to chat?
[2014-06-17 16:50:58 -0400] mattray: ~45 minutes
[2014-06-17 16:51:05 -0400] mike`: kk. I'll be here
[2014-06-17 16:58:56 -0400] PaulCzar: hey mattray do we have a skeleton openstack-cookbook that a person would use to create a new cookbook for say a project like Solum ?
[2014-06-17 16:59:00 -0400] PaulCzar: (asking for a friend)
[2014-06-17 16:59:50 -0400] mattray: PaulCzar: no, but if I did I'd check it in to the new -database, -data-processing and -client cookbooks
[2014-06-17 17:00:07 -0400] PaulCzar: cool beans
[2014-06-17 17:01:22 -0400] PaulCzar: been a while since Ive looked over the cookbooks   anything change recently I should look out for?  we up to berkshelf3 yet?  any issues with any of the vagrant plugins ( chef-zero??? ) ?

[2014-06-17 17:56:54 -0400] Sam_S: Hello Markvan
[2014-06-17 18:00:58 -0400] Sam_S: I want to disscuss with you about a bugfix, do you have a short timeslot?
[2014-06-17 18:05:40 -0400] Sam_S: markvan: ping
[2014-06-17 18:09:28 -0400] Sam_S: mattray: can you talk a look at https://review.openstack.org/#/c/97958/   ?
[2014-06-17 18:11:36 -0400] cannonball: I have a controller node that I added role[single-network-node] b/c I wanted to experiment with neutron.  Simply removing the role leaves all the services in place and started.  Is there an easier, chef-managed way to get rid of it without wiping and re-installing the controller?
[2014-06-17 18:11:56 -0400] Sam_S: mattray: this bugfix is going to enable users to set arbitary rabbitmq password as they want.
[2014-06-17 18:13:19 -0400] mattray: Sam_S: yeah, that would remove the existing behavior of setting the password in the data bag
[2014-06-17 18:13:25 -0400] mattray: Sam_S: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/libraries/passwords.rb
[2014-06-17 18:13:43 -0400] mattray: really we should look at updating get_password to support both
[2014-06-17 18:14:52 -0400] mattray: if you're not using developer mode but still want to use attributes, that could be a change made in https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/libraries/passwords.rb#L49 possibly
[2014-06-17 18:15:07 -0400] mattray: probably want to have a blue print to discuss that change
[2014-06-17 18:15:10 -0400] mattray: which I thought we had
[2014-06-17 18:15:27 -0400] Sam_S: mattray: yes, I have another related bugfix here to update the password https://review.openstack.org/#/c/97948/
[2014-06-17 18:17:18 -0400] Sam_S: mattray: I am using developer mode
[2014-06-17 18:18:03 -0400] mattray: unfortunately I have to run, I'll look at this some more in a bit
[2014-06-17 18:28:55 -0400] markvan: Sam_S: hi

[2014-06-17 18:34:17 -0400] markvan: Sam_S:  looks like this is being discussed in ML https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/opscode-chef-openstack/3w0xpy5S2JM   I would like to see a blueprint come out of that.
[2014-06-17 18:41:32 -0400] Sam_S: markvan: I agree, we can disscuss more thoroughly in a BP, is there any existing BP with this topic?
[2014-06-17 18:42:38 -0400] markvan: Sam_S: I don't see anything right now
[2014-06-17 18:43:12 -0400] Sam_S: markvan: ok, I can create a BP to getting it start.
[2014-06-17 18:45:43 -0400] markvan: Sam_S: Sure, and post that to the ML and we can get some more eyes on this then.
[2014-06-17 18:46:51 -0400] Sam_S: markvan: Sure, I will post it to the ML after lunch.
[2014-06-17 18:47:58 -0400] Sam_S: markvan: Thank you. I am going to lunch, BRB
[2014-06-17 18:58:48 -0400] PaulCzar: anyone know what happened to the chef notes from the juno summit - https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/juno-summit-ops-chef ?  looks to be empty,  but Im sure we were writing content to it during the summit session
[2014-06-17 20:09:02 -0400] mike`: Using knife openstack, does knife[:openstack_ssh_key_id] in knife.rb replace the -S arguement?
[2014-06-17 20:27:13 -0400] PaulCzar: Trying to access this from within attributes of another cookbook - https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/3a9695366baec27de0633c23580bdbc639dedd64/libraries/passwords.rb#L66
[2014-06-17 20:27:31 -0400] PaulCzar: I was hoping I could use - db_pass = ::Openstack::get_password('db', 'solum')
[2014-06-17 20:27:58 -0400] PaulCzar: but I get  undefined method `get_password' for Openstack:Module
[2014-06-17 20:28:06 -0400] PaulCzar: any tips?  or is this wishful thinking ?
[2014-06-17 20:31:31 -0400] mike`: Anyone know anything about knife openstack assigning 2 floating IPs?
[2014-06-17 20:51:43 -0400] markvan: PaulCzar: Did you include the openstack module?
[2014-06-17 20:51:43 -0400] markvan: class ::Chef::Recipe # rubocop:disable Documentation
[2014-06-17 20:51:44 -0400] markvan:   include ::Openstack
[2014-06-17 20:51:45 -0400] markvan: end
[2014-06-17 20:52:55 -0400] markvan: and have dependency on Common cookbook in metadata.  See the other cookbooks for examples.
[2014-06-17 21:04:05 -0400] PaulCzar: markvan: yeah,  it seems to have issues trying to access it from attributes rather than in a recipe
[2014-06-17 22:03:29 -0400] Sam_S: markvan: I create a BP https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+spec/user-define-password-support
