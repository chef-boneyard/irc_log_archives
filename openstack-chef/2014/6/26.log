[2014-06-26 11:54:57 -0400] mattt: srenatus: ping
[2014-06-26 11:58:22 -0400] srenatus: mattt: pong
[2014-06-26 11:59:01 -0400] mattt: srenatus: just updated that bug report
[2014-06-26 11:59:10 -0400] mattt: srenatus: last i checked the apache2 service had no upstart script :(
[2014-06-26 11:59:18 -0400] mattt: so we'll have to manually set that back to use the chef init thingy
[2014-06-26 11:59:51 -0400] srenatus: hmm
[2014-06-26 12:00:09 -0400] mattt: i noticed that rabbit attribute too
[2014-06-26 12:00:24 -0400] mattt: feels a bit dirty :(
[2014-06-26 12:00:34 -0400] srenatus: yep
[2014-06-26 12:00:41 -0400] mattt: because it deletes the package's /etc/init.d/ script
[2014-06-26 12:00:42 -0400] srenatus: I wonder if we should really touch that though...
[2014-06-26 12:00:45 -0400] mattt: which is totally unacceptable if you ask me
[2014-06-26 12:01:08 -0400] srenatus: since the next chef-client will use upstart on ubuntu 14.04 by default,
[2014-06-26 12:01:34 -0400] srenatus: the apache2 cookbook (or package, rather) really has the issue if it doesn't provide an upstart script on ubuntu 14.04
[2014-06-26 12:01:51 -0400] mattt: yeah, but good luck getting the debian/ubuntu guys to change that
[2014-06-26 12:01:54 -0400] mattt: seems unlikely
[2014-06-26 12:01:59 -0400] mattt: we already tried w/ the openstack services :P
[2014-06-26 12:02:07 -0400] srenatus: oh really?
[2014-06-26 12:02:16 -0400] mattt: yeah let me find the report
[2014-06-26 12:02:37 -0400] srenatus: but the cause really is ubuntu deciding not to ship "compat" /etc/init.d/* scripts anymore, so...
[2014-06-26 12:02:52 -0400] mattt: srenatus: actually it's the link i provided https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/keystone/+bug/1315188
[2014-06-26 12:03:04 -0400] mattt: there are two issues
[2014-06-26 12:03:15 -0400] mattt: one is that there is no enforcement to use either upstart or sysvinit
[2014-06-26 12:03:22 -0400] mattt: and secondly they're moving to systemd
[2014-06-26 12:03:27 -0400] srenatus: mattt: ah this one.  that makes sense, though, using upstart only (for real now), you would stop shipping compat stuff;
[2014-06-26 12:03:33 -0400] mattt: so very little impetus to fix any of this right now
[2014-06-26 12:03:41 -0400] srenatus: with apache2 it's the other way round, isn't it?  they would have to ship upstart scripts now
[2014-06-26 12:03:52 -0400] mattt: srenatus: but why bother, they're going to systemd :P
[2014-06-26 12:04:13 -0400] mattt: (this is what i was told in #openstack by one of the devs)
[2014-06-26 12:05:15 -0400] srenatus: hmm yes, that's true, too.  but 14.04 LTS has quite a long future ahead of it
[2014-06-26 12:06:12 -0400] srenatus: well, anyways, the cleanest way might be using the platform attributes for a service provider?
[2014-06-26 12:06:45 -0400] srenatus: so we could choose that one in those service definitions that should use upstart now
[2014-06-26 12:06:50 -0400] srenatus: (and not touch apache2)
[2014-06-26 12:07:25 -0400] srenatus: (the apache problem will come back soon when people start using the next chef version, though,)
[2014-06-26 12:08:39 -0400] mattt: srenatus: yeah i'm not sure ... because i think the setup of apache itself happens in the apache cookbook, so now sure how we'd manage that service using Chef::Provider::Service::Init::Debian
[2014-06-26 12:08:40 -0400] srenatus: so this, https://github.com/onehealth-cookbooks/apache2/blob/master/recipes/default.rb#L188, will explode with ubuntu 13.10+ and chef-client from github/master, right?
[2014-06-26 12:08:57 -0400] mattt: yeah :P
[2014-06-26 12:09:01 -0400] mattt: exactly what i was talking about
[2014-06-26 12:09:15 -0400] srenatus: mattt: well, it's a pressing issue for the apache cookbook, isn't it?
[2014-06-26 12:09:22 -0400] mattt: srenatus: one would think
[2014-06-26 12:09:37 -0400] mattt: but i got bored and stopped looking into this
[2014-06-26 12:09:40 -0400] srenatus: I'm a little surprised, really, that aprils is quite long ago now and chef-land is stuck with ubuntu 12.04
[2014-06-26 12:09:43 -0400] mattt: because it affected too many different projects
[2014-06-26 12:10:17 -0400] mattt: srenatus: yeah adoption of 14.04 has been slow, surprised me also
[2014-06-26 12:10:39 -0400] srenatus: 12.04 is dead before 16.04, right? ;)
[2014-06-26 12:10:44 -0400] mattt: nope
[2014-06-26 12:10:51 -0400] mattt: it has a very long support cycle, 8 years or something
[2014-06-26 12:11:00 -0400] srenatus: so you would be able to just skip 14.04? amazing
[2014-06-26 12:11:43 -0400] srenatus: I'll just create a preemptive issue for the apache cookbook, I think.
[2014-06-26 12:11:55 -0400] srenatus: I'll link it in the bug comments when done.
[2014-06-26 12:12:51 -0400] mattt: srenatus: cool, i'll bump that apache issue to give it more weight
[2014-06-26 12:13:25 -0400] srenatus: :)
[2014-06-26 12:13:57 -0400] mattt: not that my name carries weight, but hopefully there is weight in numbers :P
[2014-06-26 12:22:54 -0400] srenatus: hmm might be a little condensed, https://github.com/onehealth-cookbooks/apache2/issues/150, so you're welcome to add whatever comes to your mind ;)
[2014-06-26 12:27:49 -0400] srenatus: 14.04 is not officially supported by the rabbitmq cookbook either, btw
[2014-06-26 12:28:19 -0400] srenatus: no wait, it's in .kitchen.yml, not in README.md
[2014-06-26 12:49:52 -0400] srenatus: aaand rabbitmq https://github.com/kennonkwok/rabbitmq/pull/126
[2014-06-26 13:56:07 -0400] mattt: srenatus: cool, looking now !
[2014-06-26 14:01:50 -0400] mattt: srenatus: do you think we need to node["platform_version"].to_f <= 14.04 ?
[2014-06-26 14:04:18 -0400] srenatus: mattt: I don't follow :D where...?
[2014-06-26 14:05:10 -0400] srenatus: I do not think that we need to do anything, actually.  Maybe add to a README that for trusty, please use the very latest chef-client available?
[2014-06-26 14:05:55 -0400] mattt: srenatus: was thinking maybe locking that down to ubuntu/version specifically, sort of like the example in https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-5276
[2014-06-26 14:06:08 -0400] mattt: srenatus: i have absolutely no idea how it is on debian, and if the problem will persist > 14.04
[2014-06-26 14:08:21 -0400] srenatus: mattt: the github PRs I sent are basically just making things explicit.  So far, people used to expect ubuntu to use Provider::Server::Debian
[2014-06-26 14:11:05 -0400] mattt: srenatus: yeah, i was just wondreing if that should be limited to ubuntu explicitly, and versions <= 14.04
[2014-06-26 14:11:12 -0400] mattt: srenatus: but perhaps that's unnecessary
[2014-06-26 14:11:50 -0400] mattt: srenatus: for examlpe
[2014-06-26 14:11:51 -0400] mattt: service "mything" do provider Chef::Provider::Service::Upstart if platform?("ubuntu") && node["platform_version"].to_f >= 13.10
[2014-06-26 14:11:54 -0400] mattt: end
[2014-06-26 14:11:58 -0400] srenatus: mattt: hmm I don't think so.  For Debian, it's restating the obvious only
[2014-06-26 14:12:31 -0400] srenatus: mattt: ah, I see.  For rabbitmq, there's a case surrounding the service, only acting on platform_family == debian
[2014-06-26 14:14:18 -0400] srenatus: for apache2, it's right below `when "debian"`, too
[2014-06-26 14:16:28 -0400] mattt: srenatus: yeah, my point is that i have no idea how the package looks on debian itself, as i've not tested it on that platform
[2014-06-26 14:16:39 -0400] mattt: i know ubuntu packages come from debian for the most part, but i'm not sure what changes are made along the way
[2014-06-26 14:19:46 -0400] srenatus: oh I misunderstood you all along... the changes I PR'ed are for using Debian (/etc/init.d/mything) where the new defaults of chef would use Upstart.
[2014-06-26 14:20:18 -0400] srenatus: the issue comes from Ubuntu being recognised as platform_family debian BUT still using Upstart from 13.10+
