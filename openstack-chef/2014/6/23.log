[2014-06-23 09:46:38 -0400] nacer: hey there
[2014-06-23 09:46:57 -0400] nacer: do we have way to have the openstack pub IP on a node with Ohai ?
[2014-06-23 09:48:42 -0400] srenatus: node = VM?
[2014-06-23 09:49:43 -0400] srenatus: if so, ohai can get that via node[cloud][public_ipv4] when properly hinted that it's openstack
[2014-06-23 09:50:10 -0400] srenatus: i.e. 'mkdir -p /etc/chef/ohai/hints; touch $_/openstack.json'
[2014-06-23 09:51:52 -0400] nacer: node.cloud does not exist
[2014-06-23 09:52:06 -0400] nacer: do i need to setup ohai to use hte openstack plugins ?
[2014-06-23 09:54:28 -0400] srenatus: nacer: probably, if there's no hint there already
[2014-06-23 09:54:39 -0400] srenatus: nacer: also add -ldebug to ohai to check what happens (ohai -l debug | less)
[2014-06-23 10:19:43 -0400] nacer: [2014-06-23T10:19:16+00:00] DEBUG: NOT ohai openstack

[2014-06-23 17:10:33 -0400] Mike`: mattray: Are you available?
[2014-06-23 17:13:04 -0400] mattray: nacer: I had an spot on my team to have someone work on Chef and OpenStack fulltime
[2014-06-23 17:13:35 -0400] mattray: Mike`: what's up?
[2014-06-23 17:14:25 -0400] Mike`: mattray: Just the usual questions I can't seem to find answers to :P
[2014-06-23 17:14:41 -0400] Mike`: What's the best way to segregate availability zones between user groups?
[2014-06-23 17:14:52 -0400] Mike`: Or should I bet using host aggregates? I want to make one cabinet of compute nodes only available to developers, and both cabinets available to admins.
[2014-06-23 17:14:59 -0400] nacer: nice
[2014-06-23 17:15:11 -0400] Mike`: I understand the difference between aggregates and zones, BUT I see some people using aggregates AS AZs
[2014-06-23 17:16:31 -0400] mattray: That's probably a good question for spheromak, galstrom_zzz or ctracey, folks who actually use it in production
[2014-06-23 17:18:17 -0400] ctracey: I'm curious as to why you would want to do that
[2014-06-23 17:18:41 -0400] ctracey: i dont know how you woudl do that with AZ's
[2014-06-23 17:19:05 -0400] Mike`: I have a 2 cabinets of compute nodes. we need a certification environment that mocks production for the devs to build/destroy at their will (with quota's of course)
[2014-06-23 17:19:08 -0400] ctracey: might be possible via the policy file
[2014-06-23 17:19:19 -0400] Mike`: and the additional stack is for admins to spin up new images, test apps, etc
[2014-06-23 17:19:34 -0400] Mike`: but, admins need to be able to administrate the devs as, as always
[2014-06-23 17:19:36 -0400] ctracey: yeah but why do they need to be separate AZ's?
[2014-06-23 17:19:58 -0400] Mike`: Am I using AZs wrong?
[2014-06-23 17:20:11 -0400] ctracey: OpenStack has the concept of tenancies
[2014-06-23 17:20:26 -0400] ctracey: which is meant to address precisely what you are talking about
[2014-06-23 17:20:57 -0400] ctracey: tenant was also known as project historically
[2014-06-23 17:21:13 -0400] ctracey: AZ is really meant to describe failure domains - not tenancies
[2014-06-23 17:22:25 -0400] spheromak: was gonna answer, but looks like ctracey beat me too it
[2014-06-23 17:22:27 -0400] spheromak: :P
[2014-06-23 17:25:43 -0400] Mike`: ctracey: AH!
[2014-06-23 17:25:50 -0400] Mike`: So i'll break them up into tenants.
[2014-06-23 17:25:57 -0400] Mike`: and give it a shot again :)
[2014-06-23 17:34:06 -0400] ctracey: Mike`: yes - the hardest part about tenancies will be networking.  Hopefully you have a fir amount of control over your networking infrastructure.
[2014-06-23 17:34:49 -0400] Mike`: ctracey: Luckily, this whole cage is setup for dev/sandbox/testing. Hopefully the kickstart templates I have to re-kicking the OS infra should suffice :)
[2014-06-23 17:39:21 -0400] Sam_S: mattray: Hi, the weekly meeting is today, right? where can I find the access info?
[2014-06-23 17:40:51 -0400] Sam_S: mattray: no hangout info at https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings/ChefCookbook
[2014-06-23 17:40:56 -0400] mattray: Sam_S: I posted to the mailing list
[2014-06-23 17:41:29 -0400] mattray: the meeting had technical difficulties and conflicts, so went email-only
[2014-06-23 17:42:15 -0400] Mike`: ctracey: looking here - http://docs.openstack.org/havana/install-guide/install/apt/content/keystone-users.html
[2014-06-23 17:42:29 -0400] Mike`: Does this work the same way if I intergrate keysone with LDAP
[2014-06-23 17:43:10 -0400] ctracey: yes
[2014-06-23 17:43:23 -0400] Mike`: beautiful
[2014-06-23 17:43:31 -0400] ctracey: ldap is just (one of) the backends
[2014-06-23 17:43:38 -0400] ctracey: the logic is the same
[2014-06-23 17:43:58 -0400] ctracey: remember if you use ldap you need at least 2 backends
[2014-06-23 17:44:04 -0400] ctracey: (unless that has changed)
[2014-06-23 17:44:39 -0400] Mike`: really? The keystone default doesn't count as one?
[2014-06-23 17:45:52 -0400] ctracey: the backends for keystone
[2014-06-23 17:46:05 -0400] ctracey: ldap does not provide a token backend rric
[2014-06-23 17:46:41 -0400] Mike`: K.
[2014-06-23 17:46:50 -0400] Mike`: (This is going to be fun to use in production, lol) :)
[2014-06-23 17:46:56 -0400] Mike`: Thanks for all your hard work, guys
[2014-06-23 17:47:18 -0400] Sam_S: mattray: I found it, thank you for the info.
[2014-06-23 17:58:27 -0400] spheromak: Mike`: you have an interesting definition of 'fun' :)
[2014-06-23 17:59:05 -0400] Mike`: Ha. yup...
[2014-06-23 17:59:10 -0400] Mike`: Any experience with using it in production?>
[2014-06-23 18:00:56 -0400] galstrom: Mike`: so the authN stuff lives in LDAP and the authZ stuff still needs to live in a database
[2014-06-23 18:01:13 -0400] galstrom: Mike`: you can then keep tokens in either the DB or something like memcache
[2014-06-23 18:02:14 -0400] galstrom: Mike`: also running it in production is not too bad.. however you used to really need the dogpile caching stuff for keystone with ldap.. not sure if you still do or not
[2014-06-23 18:16:25 -0400] PaulCzar: mattray: lolz  did you say people that use openstack in production ?
[2014-06-23 18:17:35 -0400] mattray: PaulCzar: People who have informed opinions
[2014-06-23 18:19:34 -0400] Mike`: what's wrong with openstack in production?
[2014-06-23 21:52:32 -0400] spheromak: Mike`: it's just not fun
