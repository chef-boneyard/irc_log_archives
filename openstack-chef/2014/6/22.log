[2014-06-22 16:11:57 -0400] Salec: hey everyone!  I'm looking to tinker with openstack in a home lab (2 physical machines, controller + compute).  Rather than deploy manually, I'm thinking about using chef (which I'm also new to).  But reading the docs has me a bit confused.  Does chef require a server?  Is Vagrant required?
