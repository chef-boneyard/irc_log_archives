[2014-06-11 14:33:06 -0400] srenatus: jklare: ^^
[2014-06-11 14:34:06 -0400] mattt: do you have the latest openstack-common ?

[2014-06-11 14:36:36 -0400] mattt: srenatus: let me know ... i'm really hoping i can avoid making any further changes to this cookbook until it merges :P
[2014-06-11 14:39:11 -0400] srenatus: mattt: oh dear. haven't merged openstack-common/upstream into master in a while. sorry about the noise.

[2014-06-11 19:56:24 -0400] cannonball: Possibly a dumb question.  I'm just starting to grok the openstack-chef system.  I have a cluster with 4 machines.  If I want to make block devices (volumes) available, I just pick one of them and add the role cinder-all, correct?
[2014-06-11 19:57:10 -0400] cannonball: Then when I try to create volumes from the admin, it will use whatever disk space is available on that machine to serve the volume(s) ?  Or is there more configuration involved before I can make volumes and use them.
