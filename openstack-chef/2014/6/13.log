[2014-06-13 15:34:41 -0400] mrodden: markvan: do you want me to rebase my amqp attributes patch on the spec coverage one for heat?
[2014-06-13 15:35:26 -0400] markvan: mrodden: yeah, was thinking that would make sense...if you like those spec changes
[2014-06-13 15:35:33 -0400] mrodden: yeah
[2014-06-13 15:35:39 -0400] mrodden: kind of worried about turn around time of that one
[2014-06-13 15:35:53 -0400] mrodden: i'll rebase though
[2014-06-13 15:36:45 -0400] markvan: mrodden: I'll ask around to get it going

[2014-06-13 17:13:00 -0400] alanmeadows: mattray: is there a reason there is no templating facility for keystone-paste in identity?
[2014-06-13 17:13:11 -0400] alanmeadows: it seems oddly alone in this regard
[2014-06-13 17:13:28 -0400] mattray: alanmeadows: not that I'm aware of. Probably an oversight
[2014-06-13 17:14:17 -0400] alanmeadows: ok, just making sure before I move forward on that
[2014-06-13 17:15:17 -0400] galstrom: alanmeadows: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity/commit/5c264be5c02bfc53404674add6ed253fcf044e9a
[2014-06-13 17:15:32 -0400] alanmeadows: galstrom: right saw that
[2014-06-13 17:15:47 -0400] galstrom: we were trying to cut out files which were not actually being templated
[2014-06-13 17:16:05 -0400] galstrom: i dont think we got all the way through all of the projects yet
[2014-06-13 17:16:50 -0400] alanmeadows: galstrom: the problem is, specifically something like https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute/blob/master/templates/default/api-paste.ini.erb#L126
[2014-06-13 17:16:55 -0400] alanmeadows: should be available everywhere
[2014-06-13 17:17:09 -0400] alanmeadows: not exactly a fan of the naming of course
[2014-06-13 17:17:15 -0400] alanmeadows: but the concept is very useful
[2014-06-13 17:17:20 -0400] galstrom: agreed
[2014-06-13 17:17:35 -0400] galstrom: i was just explaining why it was removed
[2014-06-13 17:17:42 -0400] alanmeadows: makes sense :)
[2014-06-13 17:18:42 -0400] alanmeadows: I'm not sure anyone in this room is successfully running ML2 with openvswitch in this room using openstack-network? It needs a lot of love from my latest trial
[2014-06-13 17:18:50 -0400] alanmeadows: There is a lot of either/or logic which isn't going to work
[2014-06-13 17:20:23 -0400] alanmeadows: and from the brief silence, I take that as agreement :)
[2014-06-13 17:20:29 -0400] galstrom: haha
[2014-06-13 17:20:49 -0400] galstrom: we have been working on getting ml2/linuxbridge working
[2014-06-13 17:21:03 -0400] galstrom: but it has not been committed back to the cookbooks
[2014-06-13 17:21:49 -0400] alanmeadows: I'm in the process of getting ml2/openvswitch going and when that is operational I'll make sure to include you galstrom so we can make sure its not going in the wrong direction of where you need it to go for ml2/linuxbridge
[2014-06-13 17:22:06 -0400] galstrom: alanmeadows: thanks
[2014-06-13 17:22:14 -0400] galstrom: alanmeadows: will try to do the same from my side
[2014-06-13 17:25:56 -0400] lrr: is there a way to update the dashboard cookbook to add SSLCertificateChainFile to the vhosts file?
[2014-06-13 17:43:00 -0400] markvan: lrr: seems like reasonable request, have you seen: https://github.com/optimis-cookbooks/vhosts
[2014-06-13 17:44:29 -0400] lrr: i have not seen that yet
[2014-06-13 17:45:14 -0400] gleam: it might make more sense to just have an array of extra options to be put into the vhost blocks, like the openstack service cookbooks do. e.g. node['openstack']['compute']['misc_nova']
[2014-06-13 17:45:26 -0400] lrr: i like gleam's idea
[2014-06-13 17:47:27 -0400] markvan: lrr: for that single one, seems like an easy add to the existing template.  maybe include other ssl options to be more robust on that topic.
