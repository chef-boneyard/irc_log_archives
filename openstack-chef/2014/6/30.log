[2014-06-30 11:06:57 -0400] openstackgerrit: Ionut Artarisi proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-database: fix endpoints in spec after they were changed in -common  https://review.openstack.org/103517
[2014-06-30 15:01:31 -0400] alanmeadows1: has an issue like https://review.openstack.org/#/c/103374/ come up before?
[2014-06-30 15:02:52 -0400] iartarisi: alanmeadows1: the sorting or the jenkins failure?
[2014-06-30 15:03:34 -0400] alanmeadows1: iartarisi: mostly the jenkins failures across most stable/grizzly branches - they were never brought into compliance
[2014-06-30 15:03:55 -0400] alanmeadows1: granted legacy is legacy, but legacy still enjoys bug fixes
[2014-06-30 15:03:59 -0400] iartarisi: there was someone discussing that somewhere
[2014-06-30 15:04:16 -0400] iartarisi: oh, it was you :)
[2014-06-30 15:04:37 -0400] iartarisi: on the object-storage cookbook
[2014-06-30 15:04:47 -0400] alanmeadows1: I don't think its specific to this cookbook
[2014-06-30 15:05:05 -0400] alanmeadows1: but I'd have to validate that first
[2014-06-30 15:07:50 -0400] iartarisi: hm... I'd say it's just a dependency issue?
[2014-06-30 15:07:58 -0400] iartarisi: maybe we just need to fix the Gemfile
[2014-06-30 16:04:26 -0400] alanmeadows1: iartarisi: since I have you... updated https://review.openstack.org/#/c/101625/
[2014-06-30 16:10:29 -0400] iartarisi: alanmeadows1: reviewed :)
[2014-06-30 16:11:44 -0400] alanmeadows1: need some clarity on that comment :)
[2014-06-30 16:12:19 -0400] iartarisi: oh
[2014-06-30 16:12:24 -0400] alanmeadows1: with should include source?
[2014-06-30 16:12:33 -0400] iartarisi: I think that test isn't really testing the file path
[2014-06-30 16:12:44 -0400] iartarisi: it's just setting the attribute, but it's not tested anywhere
[2014-06-30 16:13:01 -0400] alanmeadows1: understood now
[2014-06-30 16:13:02 -0400] iartarisi: and the attribute ends up in the source attribute of the template block
[2014-06-30 16:13:08 -0400] iartarisi: ok
[2014-06-30 16:55:50 -0400] gleam_: I know HA cookbooks are on the roadmap, does anyone know if there's a WIP version somewhere?
[2014-06-30 18:18:05 -0400] Mike``: Hey all - is there a way for keystone to rely on local accounts for authentication?
[2014-06-30 18:23:19 -0400] Mike``: oops, just noticed - wrong chan
[2014-06-30 18:54:43 -0400] openstackgerrit: Alan Meadows proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity: Additional options for keystone-paste.ini  https://review.openstack.org/101625
[2014-06-30 21:15:53 -0400] lrr: I've just done a fresh deploy using nova-network of icehouse
[2014-06-30 21:16:17 -0400] lrr: however when i try to log in, horizon crashes because it's trying to communicate with neutron, even though i told it to use nova as the networking service
[2014-06-30 21:17:56 -0400] lrr: pastebin.osuosl.org/8441/
[2014-06-30 21:18:02 -0400] lrr: any suggestions?
[2014-06-30 21:26:48 -0400] lrr: and keystone endpoint-list returns nothing
