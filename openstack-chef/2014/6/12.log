[2014-06-12 08:39:25 -0400] jklare: mattt: hi, i am currently trying to inculde an upload of the needed images to openstack-integration-test ( http://paste.openstack.org/show/83765/ ) and am kind of stuck with the chefspec ( http://paste.openstack.org/show/83764/ ) which keeps failing and telling me that i didnt cover the resources and upload_openstack_image_image is not defined ( http://paste.openstack.org/show/83766/ ). Any ideas?
[2014-06-12 08:51:20 -0400] mattt: jklare: sec, lemme see
[2014-06-12 09:00:54 -0400] iartarisi: jklare: do you have a chefspec resource matcher for that?
[2014-06-12 09:01:04 -0400] mattt: yeah, was just looking at https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image/blob/master/spec/image_upload_spec.rb#L7
[2014-06-12 09:01:07 -0400] mattt: ^^^ jklare
[2014-06-12 09:05:18 -0400] jklare: mattt: no i don't, ill look into that. thanks
[2014-06-12 09:06:37 -0400] srenatus: isnt that for testing LWRPs? c.f. https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec#testing-lwrps
[2014-06-12 09:07:28 -0400] mattt: srenatus: but isn't that you're effectively doing there?
[2014-06-12 09:07:45 -0400] srenatus: I think jklare is wants to chefspec the call to the resource, as in https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec#testing-lwrps
[2014-06-12 09:08:07 -0400] srenatus: i.e. expect(chef_run).to upload_openstack_image_image('blah').with(...)
[2014-06-12 09:08:31 -0400] iartarisi: but you still need a matcher for upload_openstack_image_image
[2014-06-12 09:09:10 -0400] srenatus: iartarisi: hmm shouldn't that one be defined in openstack-image, then?
[2014-06-12 09:09:45 -0400] iartarisi: sure
[2014-06-12 09:09:58 -0400] iartarisi: srenatus: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/98459/3
[2014-06-12 09:09:59 -0400] iartarisi: :)
[2014-06-12 09:10:37 -0400] srenatus: iartarisi: heh, great; and while we're at it, https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image/blob/master/spec/image_upload_spec.rb#L7 isn't the proper way to do it, is it?  It might be better to have the image_upload_spec.rb spec the recipe, and have another spec that does the step_into, spec'ing the LWRP?
[2014-06-12 09:11:49 -0400] iartarisi: srenatus: yup, I think https://review.openstack.org/#/c/98459/3/spec/image_provider_spec.rb is doing the LWRP specing
[2014-06-12 09:12:53 -0400] jklare: iartarisi: srenatus: guess ill just w8 then
[2014-06-12 09:13:23 -0400] mattt: sorry, i can't provide much more info, i'm hopeless at testing :)
[2014-06-12 09:14:04 -0400] iartarisi: srenatus: and right about your first point, too. Maybe we should get rid of that step_into in image_upload_spec.rb
[2014-06-12 09:14:25 -0400] srenatus: iartarisi: hmm is it?  I'd expect something wit step_into, basically spec'ing the dynamically defined execute[..]
[2014-06-12 09:14:40 -0400] srenatus: iartarisi: that was typed before your last line
[2014-06-12 09:14:54 -0400] srenatus: :)
[2014-06-12 09:14:58 -0400] iartarisi: ok, so we agree? :)
[2014-06-12 09:15:16 -0400] srenatus: yup
[2014-06-12 09:15:42 -0400] iartarisi: srenatus: do you want to write that in the review or should I?
[2014-06-12 09:16:06 -0400] srenatus: I'll take care of it
[2014-06-12 09:16:22 -0400] iartarisi: thanks!
[2014-06-12 09:16:26 -0400] srenatus: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/98459/3 is what you're referring to, right?
[2014-06-12 09:17:04 -0400] iartarisi: yes
[2014-06-12 09:18:53 -0400] srenatus: I think what really bit jklare is the warning here: https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec#testing-lwrps about cookbooks with LWRP and dashes in their names
[2014-06-12 09:20:52 -0400] iartarisi: that would be bad
[2014-06-12 09:22:17 -0400] mattt: jklare: so what did you do to fix that ?
[2014-06-12 09:26:33 -0400] openstackgerrit: Ionut Artarisi proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: add mq and endpoint attributes for Trove  https://review.openstack.org/99395
[2014-06-12 09:28:02 -0400] jklare: mattt: basically nothing right now, i am currently working on a cleanup recipe in for the openstack-integration-test cookbook and will w8 until your things are merged and if i find some time ill try to propose a change for the openstack-image cookbook to fix my problem externally
[2014-06-12 09:32:51 -0400] jklare: mattt: another thing that should be fixed is the basic naming of the cookbook, because if you call openstack-image_image (as the lwrp image from the cookbook openstack-image might suggest) it will just explode and you have to use openstack_image_image to make it work
[2014-06-12 09:33:54 -0400] srenatus: hmm I noticed that the register specs for openstack-identity look very similar; but it's shelling out instead of using execute/bash resources...

[2014-06-12 09:55:36 -0400] srenatus: ^^ so, with a custom matcher, chefspec'ing the image LWRP works: http://hastebin.com/ageduxopox.mel
[2014-06-12 09:57:05 -0400] iartarisi: cool!
[2014-06-12 09:58:40 -0400] mattt: jklare: i think it's unlikely we'll end up renaming the cookbooks to be honest

[2014-06-12 10:03:56 -0400] srenatus: ok, made it a proper change request.  I suppose it makes sense to break that small change out of https://review.openstack.org/#/c/98459/3
[2014-06-12 10:04:12 -0400] jklare: mattt: ofc not, all the cookbooks would have to be renamed following my logic

[2014-06-12 10:13:37 -0400] mattt: jklare: well i'm not even sure that would happen for _all_, that'd be a huge undertaking involving infra etc.

[2014-06-12 12:47:45 -0400] cannonball: In previous uses of chef, I added chef-client::init_service recipe to each of my nodes' run list by including it in a "common" recipe as part of a "base" role.  Looking through the openstack-chef roles and recipes, nothing seems to include that recipe.  Is it generally expected that I need to manually add that recipe?  I'm curious why is it not included in the base role?
