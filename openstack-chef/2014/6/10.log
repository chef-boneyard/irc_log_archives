[2014-06-10 08:14:40 -0400] srenatus: iartarisi: could you re-consider https://review.openstack.org/#/c/95521/ please? ;)
[2014-06-10 08:18:25 -0400] iartarisi: srenatus: oh, sure. I don't know why my -1 stayed. It should've reset after your new commit.
[2014-06-10 08:21:31 -0400] srenatus: hmm yep. weird.

[2014-06-10 15:44:41 -0400] galstrom: markvan: i think that is just waiting on another infra-core to approve? correct?
[2014-06-10 15:45:10 -0400] markvan: galstrom: yup, I think so.  I have not done much with infra, so not sure who to ping.
[2014-06-10 15:47:20 -0400] galstrom: markvan: i asked one of the infra-core guys to take a look at it..
[2014-06-10 15:47:42 -0400] markvan: galstrom: ty
[2014-06-10 15:47:49 -0400] galstrom: hopefully he will.. but he lives in the future.. so it will probably be tonight before he takes a look at it
