[2014-06-04 09:58:23 -0400] mattt: srenatus: way to go breaking everything :P
[2014-06-04 09:59:29 -0400] srenatus: mattt: so sorry
[2014-06-04 09:59:51 -0400] srenatus: really
[2014-06-04 10:00:03 -0400] mattt: srenatus: these things happen, i'm just giving you grief :)
[2014-06-04 10:00:07 -0400] srenatus: :)
[2014-06-04 10:00:08 -0400] mattt: (and i have nothing urgent pending anyway)
[2014-06-04 10:00:52 -0400] mattt: anyone at the openstack london conference thingy today?
[2014-06-04 14:51:46 -0400] srenatus: 16:49 < openstackgerrit> A change was merged to openstack-infra/config: Fix Chef cookbook-related strainer issue  https://review.openstack.org/97196
[2014-06-04 15:13:46 -0400] markvan_: srenatus: that's good news, I kicked the current patches to go through checks again.
[2014-06-04 15:14:41 -0400] markvan_: but zuul shows that gates are very slow...
[2014-06-04 15:52:48 -0400] srenatus: :o our Strainerfiles don't work on openstack-infra's jenkins.  I'll go home crying now.
[2014-06-04 15:53:24 -0400] srenatus: If we remove them, the jobs should fall back to the old behaviour, though
[2014-06-04 15:54:22 -0400] openstackgerrit: Stephan Renatus proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Improve ChefSpec coverage  https://review.openstack.org/97217
[2014-06-04 15:55:00 -0400] srenatus: that said, this time a possible fix is fixing our strainerfiles, I suppose
[2014-06-04 15:58:07 -0400] openstackgerrit: Stephan Renatus proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Make retrieval of vmware_host_pass optional  https://review.openstack.org/95521
[2014-06-04 15:58:49 -0400] markvan_: srenatus: What is the current issue with our Strainerfiles?
[2014-06-04 15:59:19 -0400] markvan_: srenatus: Or are you saying we rename them until we can make them work right in jenkins?
[2014-06-04 16:01:15 -0400] srenatus: markvan_: some bundle issue: http://logs.openstack.org/21/95521/5/check/gate-cookbook-openstack-compute-chef-lint/4f56875/console.html
[2014-06-04 16:01:45 -0400] srenatus: markvan_: testing it like this now: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/95521/6/Strainerfile
[2014-06-04 16:03:07 -0400] srenatus: but yes, renaming/deleting the Strainerfile would be an option, too
[2014-06-04 16:06:34 -0400] openstackgerrit: Stephan Renatus proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Improve ChefSpec coverage  https://review.openstack.org/97217
[2014-06-04 16:21:54 -0400] markvan_: srenatus: yeah, saw that bundle error.
[2014-06-04 17:30:32 -0400] jmickle: hey guys
[2014-06-04 17:33:11 -0400] jmickle: to use the cloud-init chef module i need to back that into the cloud init config to the image
[2014-06-04 17:33:12 -0400] jmickle: right?
[2014-06-04 18:12:18 -0400] markvan_: srenatus: wow, I think the remove of the bundle exec rom Strainer worked, but we hit that 30min timeout on the spec/unit tests.  can't catch a break.
[2014-06-04 19:35:32 -0400] markvan_: srenatus: Hey, we got thru and passed the tests.  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/95521/
[2014-06-04 19:37:15 -0400] galstrom: HOORAY
[2014-06-04 19:47:33 -0400] markvan_: galstrom: What's your opinion on the Strainer change?   I think it's fine for now, but we need to work on this more.
[2014-06-04 19:55:45 -0400] galstrom: markvan_: i have been swamped this week.. so i barely know where we are on that one
[2014-06-04 19:56:30 -0400] galstrom: what is the change you would like my opinion on?
[2014-06-04 20:00:42 -0400] markvan_: That patch  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/95521/    made a simple change to the Strainer file
[2014-06-04 20:01:00 -0400] markvan_: And that seems to to the trick to make this work again using Strainer.
[2014-06-04 20:02:14 -0400] markvan_: We have 3 choices, another infra patch to revert using Strainer, temp rename the Strainer file, or make this change across the cookbooks and move forward with Strainer.
