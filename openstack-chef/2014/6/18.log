[2014-06-18 16:02:15 -0400] markvan: srenatus: For the query uuid patches, do you want to put in the python-xxxclient package resource for now until we can come up with a better solution for using the Common CLI methods?
[2014-06-18 16:03:27 -0400] srenatus: markvan: hmm would this work?  package resources in libraries?  I thought this was only possible in providers
[2014-06-18 16:04:36 -0400] markvan: srenatus: yeah, I think we would need to do down the lwrp path to try to handle that.
[2014-06-18 16:05:27 -0400] srenatus: markvan: and then we don't have any easy way to pass back data, do we?
[2014-06-18 16:05:36 -0400] markvan: That's also why I was thinking about switching to using something curl/REST instead of the python clients.  Or maybe even just use the new openstack general client to make it a bit easier.
[2014-06-18 16:06:01 -0400] markvan: srenatus: yeah, getting data out is not pretty today.
[2014-06-18 16:06:35 -0400] srenatus: markvan: tried aviator the other day, but not much luck with that
[2014-06-18 16:07:47 -0400] markvan: srenatus: so if we change  the cli methods to hide much of the cli-ness details, it would be easier down the road to switch to curl/rest with just a change to Common.
[2014-06-18 16:09:08 -0400] srenatus: markvan: yep.  gtg sorry.
[2014-06-18 16:09:24 -0400] srenatus: back on monday (yippie)
