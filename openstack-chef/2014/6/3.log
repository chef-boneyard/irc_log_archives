[2014-06-03 10:36:05 -0400] srenatus: mattt: :/ lots of +1s but not yet: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/97196/
[2014-06-03 10:37:01 -0400] srenatus: but afaict the openstack-infra-infrastructure is still recovering from the setuptools issue
[2014-06-03 10:42:30 -0400] mattt: srenatus: is that why jenkins is taking so long?
[2014-06-03 10:42:47 -0400] mattt: markvan_: i just re-enabled hughsaunders gating
[2014-06-03 10:44:35 -0400] srenatus: mattt: I suppose so, yes
[2014-06-03 10:45:31 -0400] srenatus: mattt: not that familiar with reading zuul stats, http://status.openstack.org/zuul/, but the job queue (near the bottom) looks pretty full
[2014-06-03 14:18:23 -0400] markvan_: mattray: I was seeing the 30+ only with the unit/spec test job.
[2014-06-03 14:19:11 -0400] markvan_: mattt: Thx. it will be good to see that gate in action again.
[2014-06-03 14:20:30 -0400] markvan_: srenatus: I'll ask a few others to look at the infra change, maybe a few more +1's will get some attention.

[2014-06-03 15:57:06 -0400] mattt: markvan_: cool, heard your comment on the meeting yesterday so figured i'd speak to hughsaunders to see what the prob is :)
[2014-06-03 15:57:46 -0400] markvan_: mattt: looking at log...is this right?  ./exercise.sh havana cinder-cli.sh glance.sh keystone.sh nova-cli.sh     not icehouse?
[2014-06-03 15:58:13 -0400] mattt: markvan_: technically no
[2014-06-03 15:58:34 -0400] mattt: markvan_: but i don't think there are any icehouse specific tests anyway
[2014-06-03 15:58:47 -0400] hughsaunders: mattt: Jenkins build is back to normal : Stackforge_Cookbooks_AIO_Matrix  performance14-precise #1678
