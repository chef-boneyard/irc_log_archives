[2014-01-27 15:37:36 -0500] claco: what mancdaz said. Got an internal meeting at the normal Stackforge time. Just don't volunteer me for everything. :-)
[2014-01-27 15:38:16 -0500] mancdaz: claco: fix all the things
[2014-01-27 15:43:09 -0500] invsblduck: when there are two pending reviews (commits) based on the same parent commit, does the second one to be approved fail (ie., need rebase)?
[2014-01-27 15:44:33 -0500] invsblduck: ...for example, if a core reviewer approves one and then the other
[2014-01-27 15:51:55 -0500] aspiers: mattray: I can't make the call today, but I have successfully written ChefSpec tests for the pacemaker primitive LWRP and am moving onto the LWRPs now

[2014-01-27 16:23:20 -0500] mrodden: thats a good idea... node attributes is (obviously) tied to the node vs roles or environment
[2014-01-27 16:35:35 -0500] mrodden: nova-manage and neutron-db-manage come with openstack
[2014-01-27 16:35:44 -0500] mrodden: but neutron-server-setup etc are RHEL scripts
[2014-01-27 16:35:49 -0500] mrodden: RHEL / fedora

[2014-01-27 17:15:14 -0500] mancdaz: would be great if someone could take a peek at this and test/comment: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/69385/
[2014-01-27 17:15:26 -0500] mancdaz: it's a reference vagrantfile/environment for a havana allinone
[2014-01-27 17:19:48 -0500] s_renatus: gtg in a minute, but could someone lend me a hand with the chefspec test in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/69406/ ? I must have missed something, I just can't get it right.  (The file is there on a test-kitchen run...)
[2014-01-27 17:28:11 -0500] claco: s_renatus: sure. bive me a sec to check it out and tinker. passes locally for you I assume?
[2014-01-27 17:34:42 -0500] claco: so, my first issue locally... it includes yum::epel.. but the berks has install 3.0.2
[2014-01-27 17:35:48 -0500] claco: so, now that we've canned the Berksfile.lock files...
[2014-01-27 17:36:15 -0500] claco: what's our stackforge wide yum strategy?  are we locked down to 2.x, or pushing things up to 3.x ?
[2014-01-27 17:39:29 -0500] claco: paulczar: ctracey: who was on the decouple soapbox last week?
[2014-01-27 17:41:59 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: you now have magical new reviewer powers, use them wisely
[2014-01-27 17:42:18 -0500] claco: with great power, comes great banhammering possibilities
[2014-01-27 17:43:11 -0500] paulczar: claco: we should get to 3.x on yum for sure
[2014-01-27 17:43:38 -0500] paulczar: but I say that with no intention to work on it myself ;)
[2014-01-27 17:43:54 -0500] claco: this got me last night, which has changed my sway https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-4265
[2014-01-27 17:44:25 -0500] claco: and now.. nova-compute including yum::epel when yum-epel is nor berked
[2014-01-27 17:44:32 -0500] claco: hard to compose
[2014-01-27 17:44:58 -0500] claco: and pretty sure it's the cause of this: http://logs.openstack.org/06/69406/1/check/gate-cookbook-openstack-compute-chef-unit/eb55562/console.html
[2014-01-27 17:45:37 -0500] claco: still digging on that though... playing the berks shuffle atm

[2014-01-27 17:57:24 -0500] ctracey: claco, say wha?
[2014-01-27 17:57:55 -0500] claco: ctracey: ohai!
[2014-01-27 17:58:02 -0500] claco: fauxhai!
[2014-01-27 17:58:37 -0500] ctracey: ohai
[2014-01-27 17:58:42 -0500] ctracey: decouple?
[2014-01-27 17:59:25 -0500] claco: the magical yum includes in other recipes
[2014-01-27 17:59:38 -0500] ctracey: yeah i started looking into that
[2014-01-27 18:00:19 -0500] claco: seems like in these cases...repos are a sidedways concern... compared to include one recipe into another (in the same cookbook)
[2014-01-27 18:01:14 -0500] claco: OT: can gerrit quarum be changed per group?
[2014-01-27 18:01:30 -0500] claco: like... require a +3 instead of a +2 for approvals
[2014-01-27 18:17:49 -0500] mattray: anyone want to give some more +1s to this to get Rubocop on the gating? https://review.openstack.org/#/c/67964/
[2014-01-27 18:19:31 -0500] rtheis: mattray: sure, I can take a look
[2014-01-27 18:42:11 -0500] salmanbaset: claco: i reviewed https://review.openstack.org/#/c/68197/ with a 0 :) if you can update the cookbook name and copyright year files, the patch is good to go.
[2014-01-27 18:42:37 -0500] claco: uhm... that's an unrelated change... of which I thought we were avoiding doing
[2014-01-27 18:49:10 -0500] salmanbaset: claco: typically, we have been fixing any cookbook names and copyrights in the recipes etc. i can +2 the change and open a 'defect' for the name.
[2014-01-27 18:49:46 -0500] claco: name, yeah. seems like copyright is a cross cutting task for someone
[2014-01-27 18:50:30 -0500] salmanbaset: so shall we only fix names or let it go to a separate patch?
[2014-01-27 18:50:33 -0500] claco: I'm more impressed the name made it this long. ha
[2014-01-27 18:50:40 -0500] salmanbaset: :)
[2014-01-27 18:50:56 -0500] salmanbaset: more reviewers needed :)
[2014-01-27 18:52:36 -0500] salmanbaset: ok, +2 it is. I will open a defect
[2014-01-27 18:52:44 -0500] salmanbaset: thanks for all the changes
[2014-01-27 18:52:53 -0500] claco: and I shall fix that defect now :-)
[2014-01-27 18:53:16 -0500] salmanbaset: hehe
[2014-01-27 18:53:37 -0500] claco: $20 says jenkins can't merge it after 5 days :-)
[2014-01-27 18:55:48 -0500] salmanbaset: arghh
[2014-01-27 18:56:06 -0500] salmanbaset: but now i do not need to open a defect :)
[2014-01-27 18:56:32 -0500] claco: yes. I meant I will fix the defect your opening immediately, like... in the next hours :-)
[2014-01-27 19:27:50 -0500] invsblduck: so the ::Openstack#memcached_servers() function in openstack-common library always returns an Array object; it never returns nil
[2014-01-27 19:28:43 -0500] invsblduck: this means the <% if @memcache_servers %> conditional in keystone.conf.erb always includes a [memcache] section, but the "servers = " line will be empty if there are no memcached servers.
[2014-01-27 19:31:01 -0500] invsblduck: is this intended/desirable behavior, or do we care?  i ask because i'm writing the keystone.conf template spec tests
[2014-01-27 19:33:22 -0500] invsblduck: (still relatively new to openstack, so not sure if keystone requires a [memcache] config section or not)
[2014-01-27 19:35:19 -0500] claco: well, does keystone mind an empty "servers =" setting, or does it error out?
[2014-01-27 19:37:25 -0500] invsblduck: claco: attempting to find out myself in the meanwhile :)
[2014-01-27 19:40:07 -0500] claco: salmanbaset: what _is_ the proper copyright in this context... changing the year to a -2014
[2014-01-27 19:40:22 -0500] claco: doing a patchset on the cookbook name now
[2014-01-27 19:40:22 -0500] salmanbaset: claco: 2012-2014
[2014-01-27 19:41:03 -0500] claco: what's our group habit on this? update it if it's yours...added yours if you're adding things? (totally clueless on maintaing that in a diverse group)
[2014-01-27 19:41:46 -0500] salmanbaset: good question
[2014-01-27 19:42:26 -0500] salmanbaset: i do not think we have a clear policy on this
[2014-01-27 19:42:38 -0500] claco: reeeeealy   :-P
[2014-01-27 19:42:54 -0500] claco: I pull true nerd, and every time I see one outdagte, I just pretend I didn't see it
[2014-01-27 19:42:56 -0500] claco: :-)
[2014-01-27 19:43:05 -0500] salmanbaset: the general direction has been: update all copyright years, and append yours
[2014-01-27 19:43:22 -0500] salmanbaset: but i do not think this is well followed or documented.
[2014-01-27 19:44:31 -0500] salmanbaset: for example in the compute recipes https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute/blob/master/recipes/
[2014-01-27 19:45:11 -0500] salmanbaset: there are copyrights by rackspace, suse, and craig
[2014-01-27 19:45:24 -0500] salmanbaset: and only some have years in them :)
[2014-01-27 19:45:52 -0500] salmanbaset: so it is not consistent like 'some' other stuff in the cookbooks
[2014-01-27 19:46:17 -0500] claco: another bp on the 'fix these before release' pule
[2014-01-27 19:46:23 -0500] claco: pile even
[2014-01-27 19:46:33 -0500] salmanbaset: yeah. the pile keeps growing
[2014-01-27 19:46:41 -0500] salmanbaset: take a look at the identity recipe
[2014-01-27 19:46:42 -0500] salmanbaset: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity/blob/master/recipes/server.rb
[2014-01-27 19:47:20 -0500] claco: Who's "Opecode"?  :-D
[2014-01-27 19:47:44 -0500] salmanbaset: so my suggestion is: add your copyright along with the year, update years copyright for rackspace, and mention it in the commit message
[2014-01-27 19:47:51 -0500] salmanbaset: will find out if someone objects
[2014-01-27 19:48:07 -0500] salmanbaset: and may be, send an email to the mailing list too.
[2014-01-27 19:49:22 -0500] claco: ^ well volunteered. I blame you for this. :-P
[2014-01-27 19:54:16 -0500] claco: salmanbaset: ok, for the sake of this patchset... I'll update the cookbook names.. leave the years...and send an email :-)
[2014-01-27 19:54:32 -0500] salmanbaset: claco: many thanks
[2014-01-27 19:54:55 -0500] claco: also, maybe chime in on the bp for the attribute renames in this cookbook :-)
[2014-01-27 19:55:12 -0500] salmanbaset: ok
[2014-01-27 19:55:16 -0500] claco: ty
[2014-01-27 20:04:17 -0500] openstackgerrit: Christopher H. Laco proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-object-storage: Update cookbook name in file headers  https://review.openstack.org/69456
[2014-01-27 20:12:11 -0500] claco: is jenkins asleep...
[2014-01-27 20:12:51 -0500] claco: guess not. ha.
[2014-01-27 20:25:05 -0500] salmanbaset: claco: reviewed https://review.openstack.org/69456
[2014-01-27 20:25:08 -0500] salmanbaset: thanks
[2014-01-27 20:25:14 -0500] claco: no, ty
[2014-01-27 20:26:52 -0500] markvan: salmanbaset: I added some comments to  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+spec/centos-rhel-for-network  maybe you have some comments to add.
[2014-01-27 20:40:25 -0500] invsblduck: claco: so if you remove the [memcache] section from keystone.conf, it defaults to using memcached server 127.0.0.1:11211
[2014-01-27 20:40:43 -0500] invsblduck: claco: and if you have an empty `servers' line, it won't use any.
[2014-01-27 20:41:47 -0500] claco: so, seems things are correct all around imo
[2014-01-27 20:42:28 -0500] claco: empty array, section exists, empty servers=, nothing used. seems like least surprised compared to defaults to localhost if that line is gone
[2014-01-27 20:42:48 -0500] claco: this assumes, we don't want to bark loudly if it's an empty array
[2014-01-27 20:42:51 -0500] invsblduck: yea
[2014-01-27 20:42:59 -0500] mattray: claco: hahaha, I should've looked in IRC before responding to the ML
[2014-01-27 20:43:30 -0500] invsblduck: but i can't test the setting of memcache_servers attribute the way the search function is stubbed right now
[2014-01-27 20:44:08 -0500] invsblduck: so i might change that to get better coverage
[2014-01-27 20:44:54 -0500] invsblduck: mattray: never look in irc when claco's there :-)
[2014-01-27 20:45:27 -0500] mattray: invsblduck: 3 hours of meetings kept me from reading the backlog, yet somehow I felt the need to respond to email
[2014-01-27 20:46:04 -0500] claco: mattray: tis the sickness
[2014-01-27 20:54:10 -0500] salmanbaset: marvan: this looks good
[2014-01-27 20:54:16 -0500] salmanbaset: markvan: this looks good
[2014-01-27 20:55:42 -0500] markvan: Salmanbaset: I'll start on the patches to remove those scripts. thx
[2014-01-27 21:28:07 -0500] claco: the libraries in object-storage  make the babby jebus cry. :-)

[2014-01-27 22:44:10 -0500] mattray: looks like https://review.openstack.org/#/c/69456/ will be the first to go test it
