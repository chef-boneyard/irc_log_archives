[2014-01-16 01:33:57 -0500] claco: galstrom: so yeah, reading https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Gerrit_Workflow#Add_dependency again. :-/
[2014-01-16 01:34:21 -0500] galstrom: probably a smart move
[2014-01-16 01:34:25 -0500] claco: I guess the trick is knowing when it's a dep due to a file conflict up front vs a real feature dep in my case.
[2014-01-16 01:34:38 -0500] claco: because, what's going on now is sucky for you and mattray
[2014-01-16 01:34:50 -0500] claco: or, I should work slower. :-)
[2014-01-16 01:35:20 -0500] galstrom: haha
[2014-01-16 01:36:12 -0500] claco: that dep flow is essentually the same as submitted 3 commits/patchsets except it splits them out into 3 reviews
[2014-01-16 01:36:26 -0500] claco: at least I think that's what david was telling me

[2014-01-16 15:04:46 -0500] claco: nothing in the queue/blueprint for metering... taking a crack at it.
[2014-01-16 16:01:38 -0500] claco: what are peoples thought's on making a blueprint for a second pass across all the cookbooks to ensure the Gemfiles/rubocops are the same, and maybe also the move to a single rubo yml?
[2014-01-16 16:01:57 -0500] claco: more or less just don't want that those thoughts to get lost
[2014-01-16 16:02:04 -0500] paulczar: o/
[2014-01-16 16:02:24 -0500] claco: it's clear after most of the current work is done, we need a second pass imho
[2014-01-16 16:04:10 -0500] mancdaz: claco: can you also fix all the spec tests to be consistent?
[2014-01-16 16:04:48 -0500] claco: mancdaz: you know me too well. This is a trick question.
[2014-01-16 16:05:30 -0500] mancdaz: claco: maybe we should switch to using tailor?
[2014-01-16 16:05:59 -0500] claco: mancdaz: now you're just being a jerk. :-)
[2014-01-16 16:06:10 -0500] mancdaz: haha
[2014-01-16 16:06:32 -0500] mattt: claco: or maybe you could just teach us how to write tests
[2014-01-16 16:06:45 -0500] claco: mattt: see mattray :-P

[2014-01-16 16:11:26 -0500] mattray: claco: isn't that what this is? https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+spec/lint-and-unit-testing-for-havana
[2014-01-16 16:12:01 -0500] claco: mattray: I guess. should I just update that to include the second pass kinda of stuff we've been encountering over the last few days?
[2014-01-16 16:12:13 -0500] mattray: claco: sure
[2014-01-16 16:12:24 -0500] mattray: the spirit of that blueprint is to "fix all this crap"
[2014-01-16 16:12:32 -0500] claco: lol
[2014-01-16 16:12:34 -0500] mattray: so it's all in sync
[2014-01-16 16:12:41 -0500] claco: handy wavy magicals
[2014-01-16 16:17:13 -0500] claco: mattray: anyone at Chef ever try making cops specific to recipes? like "use 5 num version of mode instead of string".. things, etc?
[2014-01-16 16:25:29 -0500] paulczar: what are people's thoughts to moving the unit tests to test/unit/spec ?
[2014-01-16 16:26:32 -0500] paulczar: and then make a testing category in the Gemfile and put all the testing gems in that  or even a separate gem file in test/Gemfile
[2014-01-16 16:26:42 -0500] claco: spec is the normal rspec location. I'd hate to move it.
[2014-01-16 16:26:53 -0500] paulczar: with a Rakefile to wrap around the testing
[2014-01-16 16:27:13 -0500] paulczar: so someone can just rake unit or rake integrate or rake all
[2014-01-16 16:28:01 -0500] claco: so, rails-ish-y then?

[2014-01-16 16:29:29 -0500] paulczar: sure if that's how rails does it
[2014-01-16 16:29:38 -0500] paulczar: I stole that pattern from somewhere for some of my cookbooks
[2014-01-16 16:32:57 -0500] claco: I'd be curious where Chef is going in terms of the old style kitchen test layout towards the future.
[2014-01-16 16:33:15 -0500] claco: ChfSpec tests in spec seems right to me. It's the other ones that are the oddballs. Not the other way round imho.
[2014-01-16 16:33:22 -0500] claco: But I get the want to have them all in one spot.
[2014-01-16 16:51:35 -0500] paulczar: this is where I'm currently thinking I like ( but I'm not married to it ) - https://github.com/lusis/chef-logstash/tree/master/test

[2014-01-16 17:08:38 -0500] salmanbaset: mattt: the change looks good
[2014-01-16 17:10:21 -0500] salmanbaset: mattt: a minor nit about spaces in endpoints.rb
[2014-01-16 17:10:34 -0500] mattt: salmanbaset: i've just modified the remaining cookbooks to work w/ that change and have got all tests passing; doing an allinone test now on VMs now to validate stuff still works :P

[2014-01-16 17:34:00 -0500] salmanbaset: mattt: one question about the change
[2014-01-16 17:34:06 -0500] mattt: salmanbaset: sure
[2014-01-16 17:34:30 -0500] salmanbaset: I was wondering if we should also add a host parameter, e.g., default['openstack']['mq']['host']
[2014-01-16 17:35:08 -0500] salmanbaset: which we can then be added as a host parameter for every cookbook - just like port
[2014-01-16 17:35:17 -0500] mattt: salmanbaset: yeah, we can certainly do that
[2014-01-16 17:35:40 -0500] mattt: salmanbaset: there is going to be more work to be done after this -- i just wanted to do an initial pass otherwise i'll never make any progress
[2014-01-16 17:35:55 -0500] claco: mattt: welcome to my world :-)
[2014-01-16 17:35:57 -0500] salmanbaset: sure, thanks
[2014-01-16 17:35:58 -0500] mattt: salmanbaset: the name space on some of the attributes is still not quite right, 2nd pass will be to make it more consistent
[2014-01-16 17:36:00 -0500] ctracey: paulczar, thanks for the PR
[2014-01-16 17:36:21 -0500] mattt: salmanbaset: i'm going to add that to my TODO for the 2nd pass, or may just update this existing review since that change doesn't impact anythign else
[2014-01-16 17:36:24 -0500] mattt: claco: ohai2u
[2014-01-16 17:38:01 -0500] paulczar: ctracey: np,  not sure if its all that useful,  ran out of time this morning to do a performance comparison
[2014-01-16 17:38:27 -0500] salmanbaset: mattt: may be best to updaet this review since this is mostly cosmetic
[2014-01-16 17:39:29 -0500] paulczar: also ctracey, did you see the 'issue' I pushed talking about adding -j options to the make command ENVs ?

[2014-01-16 17:44:51 -0500] galstrom: i pulled it down, and chefspec is throwing the error localy on my system as well
[2014-01-16 17:45:12 -0500] mattray: galstrom: yeah, I'm going through reviews right now, then I'll rebase and fix
[2014-01-16 17:45:27 -0500] mattray: throw some pry debug in there and it'll sort out
[2014-01-16 17:45:55 -0500] galstrom: :)
[2014-01-16 17:46:33 -0500] claco: galstrom: gist the failure?
[2014-01-16 17:46:51 -0500] galstrom: it is in the jenkins link on the review
[2014-01-16 17:47:21 -0500] claco: ha. everytime I follow the lint one, I get nothing usefull. so +1 for the test one.

[2014-01-16 17:48:36 -0500] mattray: claco: probably something changed in common if I'm guessing
[2014-01-16 17:48:46 -0500] mattray: or I screwed up something

[2014-01-16 18:09:01 -0500] salmanbaset: mattt: completed my review :) great work.
[2014-01-16 18:17:16 -0500] claco: mattray: galstrom: so, platform_options is empty, because the platform at the time of setting attributes in the case/when is "chefspec"..so we fall out of the else case
[2014-01-16 18:17:41 -0500] claco: so, not setting up the plaform properly somewheres...yet it all looks correct... :-/
[2014-01-16 18:19:54 -0500] claco: mattray: galstrom: oooh...
[2014-01-16 18:20:23 -0500] claco: spec_helper.. when I convert, it's symbols from 1.8 to 1.9 syntax... in this patchset, it's strings... herm...
[2014-01-16 18:21:15 -0500] claco: yup. that was it.
[2014-01-16 18:21:46 -0500] claco: platform: 'ubuntu'  works.  'platform' => 'ubuntu' does not.
[2014-01-16 18:21:54 -0500] claco: k, updating the patchset
[2014-01-16 18:28:06 -0500] mattray: claco: good catch, I assume I whacked that somewhere with the rubocop 1.9 hash rocket fixes?
[2014-01-16 18:28:22 -0500] claco: yeah, spec_helper
[2014-01-16 18:28:37 -0500] claco: also have some identity_reg spec failures..
[2014-01-16 18:29:03 -0500] claco: so once I get this tweaked...that's just a --amend and a git review right?
[2014-01-16 18:29:11 -0500] claco: never tweaked someone elses patchset
[2014-01-16 18:33:31 -0500] claco: mattray: so...
[2014-01-16 18:33:49 -0500] mattray: git review -R
[2014-01-16 18:34:37 -0500] claco: I've been converting blocks like variables() from :keys to keys: ... you went :keys to 'keys'
[2014-01-16 18:34:59 -0500] claco: which in this case, is the other failure....some expects went from :keys to 'keys'
[2014-01-16 18:37:02 -0500] claco: so, should I start form the top and rework back to 1.9 symbols like the others?
[2014-01-16 18:45:16 -0500] claco: quick lunch. gonna just to that after. Seems like the right thing to do and puts the patchset just back to a pure rubo reshuffle w/o string/synbol meaning changes.
[2014-01-16 18:48:32 -0500] mattray: claco: yeah, I wasn't thinking when I was doing it, it was late last night
[2014-01-16 18:48:57 -0500] mattray: oops, I just noticed the "next" link on the Watched Changes page
[2014-01-16 18:49:10 -0500] mattray: hadn't been looking at the second page...

[2014-01-16 19:27:46 -0500] mattray: hmm looks like almost a 2 hour lag on Jenkins testing these reviews
[2014-01-16 19:28:03 -0500] galstrom: yeah.. it is bogged down a bit
[2014-01-16 19:30:18 -0500] galstrom: and it is taking a while once jenkins has run the test.. for it to update gerrit
[2014-01-16 19:33:03 -0500] mattray: I think I'm going to take a break on reviews and code until it unclogs a bit (unless someone pings me for a review). Gonna go dig into Spiceweasel's backlog

[2014-01-16 21:41:14 -0500] mattray: galstrom: I don't think so
[2014-01-16 21:43:15 -0500] claco: galstrom: link?

[2014-01-16 22:04:30 -0500] galstrom: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/66089/
[2014-01-16 22:04:49 -0500] mattray: galstrom: good to know
[2014-01-16 22:05:05 -0500] galstrom: mattray: yeah.. so a -2 is "THOU SHALT NOT PASS!"
[2014-01-16 22:05:27 -0500] galstrom: s/THOU/YOU/
[2014-01-16 22:07:13 -0500] mattray: galstrom: removed the 2, added a comment
[2014-01-16 22:07:56 -0500] galstrom: you want a comment on the offending line in the provider also?
[2014-01-16 22:08:00 -0500] galstrom: that what you mean?
[2014-01-16 22:08:06 -0500] galstrom: mattray: ^^
[2014-01-16 22:08:31 -0500] mattray: galstrom: you can put # rubocop: disable foo
[2014-01-16 22:08:34 -0500] mattray: in the code
[2014-01-16 22:08:45 -0500] mattray: so the cop is still tested everywhere else
[2014-01-16 22:08:51 -0500] galstrom: ah.. ok

[2014-01-16 22:19:32 -0500] galstrom: mattray, claco: any feelings on MethodLength?
[2014-01-16 22:19:47 -0500] galstrom: just pragma disable? or disable in rubocop.yml
[2014-01-16 22:19:50 -0500] claco: I think 10 is a little small
[2014-01-16 22:19:56 -0500] mattray: galstrom: I know I put a couple in the code to ignore it
[2014-01-16 22:20:07 -0500] galstrom: mattray: ok.. pragma disable for now
[2014-01-16 22:20:08 -0500] galstrom: :)
[2014-01-16 22:20:11 -0500] claco: the ones related to spec_helper.. I've been marking them as a todo to convert to spec contexts
[2014-01-16 22:20:23 -0500] claco: and ignore in the code
[2014-01-16 22:20:25 -0500] galstrom: claco: link?
[2014-01-16 22:20:45 -0500] galstrom: ill do the same..
[2014-01-16 22:20:58 -0500] claco: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image/blob/master/spec/spec_helper.rb#L18
[2014-01-16 22:21:25 -0500] claco: in some cases.. just not wrapping might undo the too long issue as well
[2014-01-16 22:25:09 -0500] claco: also, I think I've got the one rubo file UTF thing tweaked.. (or we just put it in Gemfile too....

[2014-01-16 22:43:28 -0500] claco: or not. we know there's a 2nd pass coming when they're all mostly fixed anyways.

[2014-01-16 23:16:03 -0500] mattray: claco: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/66089/3/.rubocop.yml that works?
[2014-01-16 23:16:20 -0500] mattray: claco: I couldn't find an example of that in the rubocop wiki or examples
[2014-01-16 23:20:59 -0500] claco: me neither. had to read it like 10 times..then tried it and watched the -d output to make sure
[2014-01-16 23:21:10 -0500] claco: I'm still not even sure after that...lol
[2014-01-16 23:23:13 -0500] mattray: claco: maybe submit a doc fix :)
[2014-01-16 23:23:19 -0500] claco: I'm also having some strange results using rubocop . vs the strainer test
[2014-01-16 23:23:25 -0500] claco: but they should be just the same
[2014-01-16 23:25:42 -0500] claco: "All cops support the Exclude param."
[2014-01-16 23:25:59 -0500] claco: but neither example show include/exclude on a specific cop...just on DefaultScope
