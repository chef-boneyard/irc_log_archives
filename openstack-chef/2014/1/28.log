[2014-01-28 01:37:20 -0500] galstrom: invsblduck: got it.. i did not notice the difference between service and service_name..

[2014-01-28 17:50:58 -0500] andymccr: claco: re: rubocop on templates files, we'll probably have to look at that across the board right? because of the .rubocop.yml file format it won't mess up gating or anything, but I think you're probably right that we should do those ones also.

[2014-01-28 20:14:32 -0500] salmanbaset: guys, I have merged the attribute reorg for common
[2014-01-28 20:15:02 -0500] salmanbaset: I am now looking to merge these changes for other cookbooks. looking for another core reviewer :)
[2014-01-28 20:15:37 -0500] salmanbaset: mattt: if you can submit changes for other cookbooks, they should go through the gate
[2014-01-28 20:15:41 -0500] salmanbaset: resubmit
[2014-01-28 20:36:13 -0500] hughsaunders: salmanbaset: thanks for reviewing my patch re python version
[2014-01-28 20:37:49 -0500] hughsaunders: salmanbaset: I haven't tested on non-ubuntu, however the python cookbook was only recently version bumped to 1.4.6, so if it previously worked on those platforms, it should continue.
[2014-01-28 20:38:02 -0500] salmanbaset: hughsaunders: you welcome
[2014-01-28 20:38:03 -0500] salmanbaset: ok
[2014-01-28 20:40:26 -0500] hughsaunders: salmanbaset: I am hoping to gate on centos once mattt's patches are in, which should help with that question in future
[2014-01-28 20:40:42 -0500] hughsaunders: also can turn ubuntu gating back on once that python version patch is in
[2014-01-28 20:41:23 -0500] salmanbaset: i have merged the patch for common.
[2014-01-28 20:41:41 -0500] salmanbaset: now i am waiting for other reviewers for remaining attribute patches
[2014-01-28 20:41:50 -0500] salmanbaset: or shall i use my newly granted reviewing powers :)
[2014-01-28 20:43:52 -0500] hughsaunders: salmanbaset: I dont think its a bug that the common patch failed CI, its more that CI can only apply patches from one repo at a time :(
[2014-01-28 20:44:08 -0500] hughsaunders: I'm not really sure how to work around that
[2014-01-28 20:44:49 -0500] hughsaunders: salmanbaset: if galstrom has reviewed the other attribute patches, theres no reason why you shouldn't approve them
[2014-01-28 20:45:02 -0500] hughsaunders: mattt: will explode if he has to rebase them again
[2014-01-28 20:46:01 -0500] salmanbaset: hehe
[2014-01-28 20:48:43 -0500] salmanbaset: ok, i am approving matt's patches. they look. hopefully, folks will not be mad at me :)

[2014-01-28 21:03:04 -0500] claco: :-)
[2014-01-28 21:03:39 -0500] hughsaunders: also I want to see if any don't merge in which case we can rebase them and try again
[2014-01-28 21:04:00 -0500] salmanbaset: technically, i abused my review power here, but i think these patches were reviewed by ppl and were waiting on -common merge
[2014-01-28 21:04:25 -0500] hughsaunders: messaging failed... will have a look why
[2014-01-28 21:05:25 -0500] salmanbaset: :(
[2014-01-28 21:06:09 -0500] claco: salmanbaset: maybe, but I think someone just had to pull the cork and get things moving towards done

[2014-01-28 21:48:57 -0500] hughsaunders: claco: it was the nova one that I couldn't reproduce locally
[2014-01-28 21:53:53 -0500] hughsaunders: invsblduck: I'm sure your spec skills will come in most handy, you should come to london and teach us ;-)
[2014-01-28 21:54:24 -0500] invsblduck: hughsaunders: haha! I appreciate your efforts in getting me there my friend :-)
[2014-01-28 21:58:26 -0500] claco: hughsaunders: its the berkfile.lock/meta...

[2014-01-28 22:00:01 -0500] hughsaunders: for the orchestration cookbook

[2014-01-28 22:27:17 -0500] invsblduck: claco: should i git review and mark as WIP?
[2014-01-28 22:27:40 -0500] hughsaunders: invsblduck: or push to personal github if not ready for review?
[2014-01-28 22:27:57 -0500] invsblduck: hughsaunders: thought of that, but never forked repo.  i could fork
[2014-01-28 22:28:01 -0500] claco: invsblduck: or -D draft and add me as a reviewer
[2014-01-28 22:28:22 -0500] invsblduck: I seem to recall reading that drafts don't work or not to use them... not true?
[2014-01-28 22:28:45 -0500] claco: I have. once you draft, you can mark it as ready for review in the ui
[2014-01-28 22:28:57 -0500] claco: you just can't un-draft in the git-review iirc
[2014-01-28 22:29:02 -0500] invsblduck: claco: ok will draft
