[2014-01-21 16:55:01 -0500] claco: got a little side tracked at the end of the week. going back to finishing up the rubocop for object-store
[2014-01-21 16:56:36 -0500] claco: andymccr: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/68081/
[2014-01-21 16:56:46 -0500] claco: did we need upper W?
[2014-01-21 16:57:38 -0500] andymccr: claco: i figured if somebody changed it to use a #{} it would be futureproofed
[2014-01-21 16:57:48 -0500] andymccr: other than that i didn't see any downsides, but feel free to enlighten me ;)
[2014-01-21 16:58:40 -0500] claco: -40
[2014-01-21 16:58:42 -0500] claco: :-)
[2014-01-21 16:58:46 -0500] andymccr: hahaha
[2014-01-21 16:58:58 -0500] claco: nah, never worth not taking contrib for that.. just curious if I missed something
[2014-01-21 16:59:22 -0500] andymccr: not really! what is the downside of using %W over %w then?
[2014-01-21 16:59:39 -0500] andymccr: i figured it made sense to use the %W in the case that somebody in the future adds a #{var}
[2014-01-21 16:59:56 -0500] claco: well.. in theory.. the same as using "" w/o interpolation instead of ''
[2014-01-21 17:00:07 -0500] claco: surprised rubo doesn't flag that one
[2014-01-21 17:00:37 -0500] andymccr: rubo is a corrupt cop!
[2014-01-21 17:01:21 -0500] claco: or it needs a lesson (PR)
[2014-01-21 17:01:40 -0500] claco: a tern talking too by the UK :-)
[2014-01-21 17:27:48 -0500] claco: what does everyone think about making a blueprint to hold some of the inconsistencies we find along the way as a reminder to clean them up later?
[2014-01-21 17:29:35 -0500] claco: for example... sometimes we do mode 00755, and sometimes mode "0755"... case/when over if platform?().. and platform? rather than platform_family?
[2014-01-21 17:30:33 -0500] ctracey: do we need a BP?
[2014-01-21 17:30:43 -0500] ctracey: i have a few I plan to kill this week
[2014-01-21 17:30:59 -0500] ctracey: seems more like a bug to me
[2014-01-21 17:31:06 -0500] claco: well, not specifically..but it's one of those things that if it doesn't get documented as a todo.. it never gets todone
[2014-01-21 17:31:25 -0500] claco: they don't effect anything other than being not the same :-)
[2014-01-21 17:32:34 -0500] ctracey: im less worried about those as I am something like this: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image/blob/master/recipes/api.rb#L37
[2014-01-21 17:32:47 -0500] ctracey: this seems to be repeated elsewhere too
[2014-01-21 17:33:45 -0500] andymccr: hmm yeh not a fan of that!
[2014-01-21 17:33:59 -0500] claco: I'm ok with just scouring and fixing... just didn't want to stir the muck w/o either a bp, or some sort of style guide
[2014-01-21 17:34:19 -0500] ctracey: wish we had a test that demanded that a package name comes from attrs
[2014-01-21 17:34:41 -0500] ctracey: dont misunderstand me...im all for it
[2014-01-21 17:34:50 -0500] ctracey: i just tend to lean on the less process side of things
[2014-01-21 17:34:56 -0500] claco: ctracey: make a custom cop :-)
[2014-01-21 17:34:59 -0500] ctracey: #gsd
[2014-01-21 17:35:07 -0500] claco: does fc support custom critics?
[2014-01-21 17:36:01 -0500] claco: seems like the right answer. if we find something we're not fond of as a collective... write a cop/critic for it.
[2014-01-21 17:36:12 -0500] ctracey: that kinda stuff breaks the whole value prop of something like omnibus
[2014-01-21 17:36:34 -0500] ctracey: claco, problem is how do you tell?
[2014-01-21 17:36:35 -0500] claco: the explicit instaall?
[2014-01-21 17:36:39 -0500] ctracey: yes
[2014-01-21 17:37:04 -0500] claco: how do I tell what?
[2014-01-21 17:37:06 -0500] ctracey: i guess you probably could with a cop
[2014-01-21 17:37:18 -0500] ctracey: but not with something like a spec test
[2014-01-21 17:37:44 -0500] claco: either or. being a Perlhead, tests to check code is an old hat for me.
[2014-01-21 17:37:57 -0500] ctracey: sounds like you just volunteered :)
[2014-01-21 17:38:09 -0500] claco: but the more we can automate pre review, the better I'd think
[2014-01-21 17:38:19 -0500] ctracey: yes
[2014-01-21 17:38:37 -0500] ctracey: we should have a script that drops a precommit hook
[2014-01-21 17:38:45 -0500] claco: I'm just going to change my title to Mundane Consistency Specialist
[2014-01-21 17:38:46 -0500] ctracey: that forces a test prior to commit
[2014-01-21 17:38:57 -0500] ctracey: heh - im with ya
[2014-01-21 17:39:17 -0500] ctracey: omnibus stuff is all about consistency between the cb's
[2014-01-21 17:39:55 -0500] claco: I'm a little surprised that Chef doesn't have some custom cops outside of the fc recommendations
[2014-01-21 17:40:14 -0500] ctracey: here is your opportunity to be a pioneer :)
[2014-01-21 17:40:40 -0500] ctracey: and maybe if you bribe nathan you could submit it as a chefconf talk
[2014-01-21 17:41:00 -0500] claco: I've got too many of those in the pool already

[2014-01-21 19:53:02 -0500] claco: on a completely unrelated topic... while doing the recipes in object-storage... it's old...
[2014-01-21 19:53:19 -0500] claco: I'm assuming there are bits to steal from here and other places...
[2014-01-21 19:53:23 -0500] claco: https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-lite
[2014-01-21 19:54:03 -0500] claco: it was a redo from our old swift book... with wrappering in mind
[2014-01-21 19:59:59 -0500] claco: mattray: so does that mean you will, or won't push the big green approve on that review then. :-)
[2014-01-21 20:01:56 -0500] mattray: claco: talking testing right now
[2014-01-21 20:03:30 -0500] mattray: claco: Seth clearly has opinions on testing and knows a lot more about all of this than most
[2014-01-21 20:06:44 -0500] mattray: claco: he was +1 on all of those except cautious about #4&5, since this is consolidation of separate tests that are rarely documented well-enough to understand the behavior they're consolidating
[2014-01-21 20:07:19 -0500] claco: the shared_context/examples right?
[2014-01-21 20:08:12 -0500] claco: so, would he advocate putting them back in the specs...duplicated specs as the spec...vs worrying about duplicated it blocks?
[2014-01-21 20:08:42 -0500] claco: I'm ok w/ that too. I have no issue with duplicated specs across difference recipes
[2014-01-21 20:08:46 -0500] claco: but I wasn't a fan of the non-rspecy use of methods
[2014-01-21 20:09:39 -0500] claco: mattray: or tell him to become one of us. one. of. us. :-)
[2014-01-21 20:10:51 -0500] claco: the exception maybe being the context w/ the image stubs
[2014-01-21 21:13:29 -0500] mattray: claco: updating the openstack-infra/config review request now. I think I'd like to make the foodcritic update in another review
[2014-01-21 21:13:38 -0500] mattray: to drop FC023
[2014-01-21 21:14:13 -0500] claco: was just a thought, not knowing what our goals were
[2014-01-21 21:14:16 -0500] claco: <--- newb
[2014-01-21 21:14:59 -0500] mattray: I agree with removing it, just trying to slow down the breakages
[2014-01-21 21:15:26 -0500] mattray: of course I say that as I'm adding style checks to every cookbook
[2014-01-21 21:15:36 -0500] claco: good news. jenkins is slow today. we've got all the time in the worlds. :-)
[2014-01-21 21:18:25 -0500] claco: filing a rubocop issue.  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/68094/1/recipes/compute.rb

[2014-01-21 21:18:48 -0500] claco: that seems broken
[2014-01-21 21:19:44 -0500] claco: testing master rubo now just to make sure it's not already fixed
[2014-01-21 21:20:21 -0500] claco: also seems to be related on how far from the top the class is...
[2014-01-21 21:20:29 -0500] claco: like if I remove most of the comments.. then it kicks in
