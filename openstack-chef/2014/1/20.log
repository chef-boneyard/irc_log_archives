[2014-01-20 20:40:07 -0500] ctracey: galstrom, i took a  look at the others and the ones i looked at were the actual service name
[2014-01-20 20:40:14 -0500] ctracey: not the type of project
[2014-01-20 20:40:19 -0500] ctracey: so i followed suit
[2014-01-20 20:40:43 -0500] galstrom: ctracey: cool.. was just checking
[2014-01-20 20:40:48 -0500] ctracey: tbh...i like that better anyway - i know to expect the "glance-api" service on the host
[2014-01-20 20:42:47 -0500] ctracey: galstrom, plus I am to blame :)

[2014-01-20 20:43:34 -0500] ctracey: heh...it was me :)
[2014-01-20 20:46:23 -0500] galstrom: i hate it when git-blame fails you.. and doesn't tell you some one else did it

[2014-01-20 21:03:16 -0500] mattray: looking at updating our gates, I started to break up the bundler & berkshelf into separate steps 5 seconds added time per run
[2014-01-20 21:03:25 -0500] mattray: is that worth fixing?
[2014-01-20 21:03:46 -0500] claco: the spec rewrite will make up for it. :-)
[2014-01-20 21:03:57 -0500] mattray: foodcritic & rubocop don't need the .cookbooks
[2014-01-20 21:04:32 -0500] mattray: I guess that saves 10 seconds per gat
[2014-01-20 21:04:33 -0500] mattray: e
[2014-01-20 21:05:24 -0500] mattray: guess that makes it worthwhile, saving minutes of gerrit time per day
[2014-01-20 21:05:48 -0500] claco: I think we're the leave of it's problems :-)
[2014-01-20 21:09:00 -0500] mattray: claco: yeah, but there are a few things I can do while I'm in here to clean and speed it and up.
[2014-01-20 21:09:35 -0500] claco: flip the more magic switch
[2014-01-20 21:20:31 -0500] galstrom: mattray, ctracey, retr0h, spheromak: would like to get https://review.openstack.org/#/c/66873/ out of the way tomorrow morning.. (the mq/db attribute remaping)

[2014-01-20 21:23:15 -0500] claco: dealing with the double-runner now. can change anything else.
[2014-01-20 21:26:56 -0500] claco: also.. there is no ::default recipe...but there's an empty spec context block for it...
[2014-01-20 21:27:11 -0500] claco: and a default_spec.rb.  delete?
[2014-01-20 21:27:21 -0500] claco: or should cookbooks always have a ::default.rb ?

[2014-01-20 21:27:50 -0500] claco: ha.. and the spec in the image books is..   describe 'openstack-dashboard::default' d
[2014-01-20 21:29:13 -0500] ctracey: andymccr, you here?
[2014-01-20 21:30:29 -0500] ctracey: andymccr, I updated that commit thinking I could just change those quotes and leave you as the author...apparently that is not how gerrit works.
[2014-01-20 21:30:42 -0500] ctracey: dont want to steal  your hard work...was just trying to get that one in
[2014-01-20 21:30:43 -0500] claco: --fix :-)
[2014-01-20 21:30:51 -0500] ctracey: say what?
[2014-01-20 21:31:12 -0500] claco: joke. (--force). Don't do that.
[2014-01-20 21:31:14 -0500] claco: :-)
[2014-01-20 21:31:18 -0500] ctracey: oh heh
[2014-01-20 21:31:40 -0500] ctracey: its stupid that it made me the committer when I did an amend
[2014-01-20 21:32:50 -0500] claco: --amend --author= .. but that's playing with fire in gerrit
[2014-01-20 21:32:50 -0500] ctracey: i wonder what happens if I do it with his email address :)

[2014-01-20 22:06:10 -0500] mattt: if only i knew that i could steal andymccr's commits :P
[2014-01-20 22:09:11 -0500] ctracey: mattt, well I think he should make another change and take them back
[2014-01-20 22:09:20 -0500] ctracey: had no idea it would behave that wya
[2014-01-20 22:10:04 -0500] mattt: ctracey: yeah, surprised also
[2014-01-20 22:10:41 -0500] claco: he's still the originator. not as good as git blame though
[2014-01-20 22:10:43 -0500] claco: :-)

[2014-01-20 23:43:46 -0500] ctracey: it is a subtle problem
[2014-01-20 23:44:17 -0500] ctracey: i will look deeper
[2014-01-20 23:45:41 -0500] andymccr: ctracey: no problem on the commit! thanks for sorting it out!
[2014-01-20 23:50:25 -0500] ctracey: it was nothing really...just some quotes
[2014-01-20 23:50:39 -0500] ctracey: thought I could bang it through while you were away :(
