[2014-01-09 16:29:18 -0500] galstrom: so we currently have a broken gate on cookbook-openstack-network (chefspec-coverage issue)
[2014-01-09 16:30:58 -0500] openstackgerrit: Justin Shepherd proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: Filling out initial rubocop support for metadata.rb and the Gemfile.  https://review.openstack.org/65569
[2014-01-09 16:31:22 -0500] galstrom: ^^ contains the update to the Gemfile to correct the gate issue
[2014-01-09 16:32:14 -0500] mattray: galstrom: looking
[2014-01-09 16:32:58 -0500] galstrom: mattray: so we added a ChefSpec::Coverage call at the end of spec_helper.. but the gemfile was locked on a version that did not have support for coverage
[2014-01-09 16:33:00 -0500] galstrom: :(
[2014-01-09 16:34:05 -0500] mattray: galstrom: assuming Jenkins lets that one through, I'll go back and update all my rubocop pulls from yesterday to move ChefSpec to 3.1.4
[2014-01-09 16:34:06 -0500] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image: Update spec_helper to include 'chefspec/berkshelf'  https://review.openstack.org/65642
[2014-01-09 16:34:24 -0500] galstrom: mattray: :)
[2014-01-09 16:34:36 -0500] mattray: galstrom: the ChefSpec coverage thing was only done to network I think, by paulczar?
[2014-01-09 16:35:05 -0500] galstrom: i think so
[2014-01-09 16:35:33 -0500] galstrom: i am a bit confused how it gated though
[2014-01-09 16:35:36 -0500] galstrom: in the first place
[2014-01-09 16:35:39 -0500] mattray: so who can +2 this? I wrote the first and you updated it second :)
[2014-01-09 16:35:46 -0500] galstrom: unless it is some sort of a gemcache issue
[2014-01-09 16:36:00 -0500] galstrom: mattray: any other cores around?
[2014-01-09 16:36:08 -0500] paulczar: hey, yeah I did it to network.    have the feeling I updated the .lock for it ?
[2014-01-09 16:36:38 -0500] mattray: paulczar: doesn't look that way, the patch bumps ChefSpec from 3.0.2 to 3.1.4
[2014-01-09 16:36:48 -0500] galstrom: alanmeadows, ctracey, retr0h, spheromak: can any of you look at  https://review.openstack.org/65569
[2014-01-09 16:37:47 -0500] galstrom: https://review.openstack.org/65011
[2014-01-09 16:37:54 -0500] galstrom: that is the commit
[2014-01-09 16:38:09 -0500] galstrom: gemfile bumped to 3.1.0 in that commit
[2014-01-09 16:38:50 -0500] galstrom: mattray: maybe a merge issue on yours?
[2014-01-09 16:38:58 -0500] galstrom: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/65569/1/Gemfile
[2014-01-09 16:39:19 -0500] galstrom: old: 3.1.0 .. new: 3.0.2
[2014-01-09 16:39:26 -0500] mattray: galstrom: damn, yup
[2014-01-09 16:39:53 -0500] mattray: I'd planned to do ChefSpec in phase 2 of the commits, so I whacked paulczar's earlier commit inadvertently
[2014-01-09 16:39:59 -0500] galstrom: mattray: code review.. working as expected
[2014-01-09 16:40:00 -0500] galstrom: :)
[2014-01-09 16:40:26 -0500] mattray: I was trying to get a baseline of the same Rubocop everywhere, but paulczar had already started working on network
[2014-01-09 16:40:27 -0500] paulczar: hand crafted artisinal bespoke Gemfiles
[2014-01-09 16:40:27 -0500] galstrom: yeah.. feel free to blast my update to that patch.. if you want to go back and repush yours as 3.1.0
[2014-01-09 16:40:45 -0500] galstrom: paulczar: that is crazy talk sir..
[2014-01-09 16:40:54 -0500] galstrom: :)
[2014-01-09 16:41:04 -0500] mattray: paulczar: not quite artisinal, I was trying to use the same one everywhere
[2014-01-09 16:41:26 -0500] mattray: it would be nice if we could enforce the same baseline files in every cookbook
[2014-01-09 16:41:49 -0500] mattray: same testing framework everywhere
[2014-01-09 16:42:31 -0500] mattray: since we definitely want these to behave identically
[2014-01-09 16:42:37 -0500] paulczar: yeah, should we go and set versions for all the gems in the Gemfiles  pick a standard  then maybe gate on the contest ?
[2014-01-09 16:42:39 -0500] paulczar: contents
[2014-01-09 16:42:53 -0500] mattray: paulczar: that's what I was trying to do, as part of the unit testing blueprint
[2014-01-09 16:43:10 -0500] mattray: which is why I did all those identical PRs yesterday
[2014-01-09 16:43:18 -0500] mattray: which whacked your snowflake :)
[2014-01-09 16:43:23 -0500] paulczar: can always pull the coverage report out for now
[2014-01-09 16:43:39 -0500] mattray: paulczar: no, I like it
[2014-01-09 16:43:58 -0500] mattray: if we're putting everything in, we should standardize to the latest
[2014-01-09 16:44:17 -0500] mattray: much easier to enforce if we start the same
[2014-01-09 16:44:50 -0500] paulczar: cool.   don't forget .coverage in .gitignore also
[2014-01-09 16:45:20 -0500] mattray: yeah
[2014-01-09 16:45:36 -0500] mattray: I'll go re-submit all those starter rubocops
[2014-01-09 16:45:46 -0500] paulczar: should we group them in the Gemfile   maybe  'test',  'unit-test',  'integration-test'
[2014-01-09 16:46:05 -0500] paulczar: would be cool to get TK + server spec in there at some point for integration
[2014-01-09 16:46:17 -0500] mattray: wait, where did webmock come from?
[2014-01-09 16:47:03 -0500] paulczar: I don't think I did that
[2014-01-09 16:54:54 -0500] mattray: I'm gonna leave it out and see what happens. Try to re-standardize

[2014-01-09 17:01:12 -0500] galstrom: paulczar: I was playing with TK+serverspec+lxc.. http://build.monkeypuppetlabs.com:8080/job/testkitchen-cookbook-openstack-common/35/console
[2014-01-09 17:02:26 -0500] galstrom: we still need to work with openstack-infra about how to do lxc, docker, or vagrant TK on openstack jenkins
[2014-01-09 17:02:38 -0500] galstrom: then we could actually gate on that as well
[2014-01-09 17:16:17 -0500] openstackgerrit: Abel Lopez proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-block-storage: Adds misc options  https://review.openstack.org/65731
[2014-01-09 17:29:58 -0500] spheromak: galstrom: i had issues with lxc + openstack  even running nova fake driver
[2014-01-09 17:30:46 -0500] mattray: galstrom: feel free to update https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+spec/integration-testing-for-havana with whatever you find
[2014-01-09 17:31:21 -0500] galstrom: spheromak: yeah.. i had not messed with the nova bit .. and was thinking it might be an issue with qemu/libvirt/lxc
[2014-01-09 17:31:34 -0500] galstrom: but i did not know there were issues with the fakedriver as well
[2014-01-09 17:41:33 -0500] galstrom: mattray: I think we should talk about what we would test for a TK gate
[2014-01-09 17:41:53 -0500] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: Bugfix missing quantum-ovs-cleanup on startup  https://review.openstack.org/65098
[2014-01-09 17:42:12 -0500] galstrom: do we test the same things as we do with chefspec? do we test functionality of the openstack bits with serverspec?
[2014-01-09 17:42:28 -0500] mattray: galstrom: test functionality with serverspec
[2014-01-09 17:42:31 -0500] mattray: create a VM
[2014-01-09 17:42:35 -0500] paulczar: I would think we could use the openstack provider for vagrant for test kitchen ?
[2014-01-09 17:42:35 -0500] mattray: list networks
[2014-01-09 17:42:40 -0500] mattray: that kinda stuff
[2014-01-09 17:42:58 -0500] galstrom: mattray: ok.. openstack command line type stuff
[2014-01-09 17:43:11 -0500] mattray: galstrom: that seems pretty functional to me
[2014-01-09 17:43:21 -0500] galstrom: that is what i was thinking as well.. but just wanted to see if there was agreement
[2014-01-09 17:43:22 -0500] mattray: and when it moves to multi-node, those tests can be extended
[2014-01-09 17:43:34 -0500] paulczar: check services are running,  ports are open, and basic CLI commands work
[2014-01-09 17:43:39 -0500] mattray: agreed
[2014-01-09 17:43:49 -0500] mattray: doesn't Tempest do that?
[2014-01-09 17:45:07 -0500] paulczar: of course integration testing will be hard for individual cookbooks  because they have some may reliances on all the other services running from the other cookbooks
[2014-01-09 17:45:28 -0500] galstrom: yeah.. a tempest test against the image cookbook alone would be painful
[2014-01-09 17:46:14 -0500] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Delete the rootwrap.d filters  https://review.openstack.org/65417
[2014-01-09 17:46:21 -0500] spheromak: galstrom: iirc a couple things had to happen in the host. some modules needed to get loaded, and then there was still some cgroup perms issues.  I eneded up with a  custom lxc config, and in the end i just ditched lxc for "real" hypervisor
[2014-01-09 17:46:43 -0500] galstrom: spheromak: fair enough
[2014-01-09 17:47:27 -0500] galstrom: i was just concentrating on lxc cause it was light and fast for tests
[2014-01-09 17:47:36 -0500] galstrom: but i was really thinking about the non-nova cookbooks
[2014-01-09 17:53:24 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2014-01-09 17:53:28 -0500] spheromak: its great i love it
[2014-01-09 17:54:01 -0500] spheromak: we used it for everything but 2 cooks. our galera and nova cooks were having issues, in the end had to move the backend for jenkins to that.
[2014-01-09 17:54:31 -0500] spheromak: Ideally we (openstack-chef) could use kitchen-openstack to run our integration
[2014-01-09 17:54:52 -0500] spheromak: I should bwrite up some blogs on what we(KT) do for openstack CI
