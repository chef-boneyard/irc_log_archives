[2014-01-12 18:36:31 -0500] paulczar: ctracey: you around ?
[2014-01-12 20:34:33 -0500] ctracey: paulczar: I am now
[2014-01-12 20:34:37 -0500] ctracey: whaz up?
[2014-01-12 20:37:53 -0500] paulczar: poking around with your omnibus stuff ...    i get a failed build because of a bad checksum on cacerts
[2014-01-12 20:38:08 -0500] paulczar: thought I'd check if you've seen that before I start digging too far
[2014-01-12 20:40:38 -0500] paulczar: it appears to be fetching an old version of cacerts as the checksum it matches is correct against https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-software/blob/master/config/software/cacerts.rb
[2014-01-12 20:47:37 -0500] ctracey: paulczar: there will be big changes coming
[2014-01-12 20:47:55 -0500] ctracey: paulczar: you will need to update your omnibus-software
[2014-01-12 20:48:09 -0500] ctracey: problem is that cacerts have changed...i'll get the PR for you
[2014-01-12 20:48:44 -0500] ctracey: i have a new way of doing this, and I hope to ship it tonight
[2014-01-12 20:49:12 -0500] ctracey: paulczar: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-software/pull/112
[2014-01-12 20:49:38 -0500] ctracey: root of the problem is that cacerts aren't really "versioned"
[2014-01-12 20:49:47 -0500] paulczar: but that's merged!    unless omnibus stores a cache of omnibus-software somewhere ?
[2014-01-12 20:49:52 -0500] paulczar: locally
[2014-01-12 20:51:34 -0500] ctracey: are you running in bundler?
[2014-01-12 20:52:07 -0500] ctracey: omnibus-software is a dependency
[2014-01-12 20:52:21 -0500] ctracey: so you will need to update that gem regardless of being in bundler or not
[2014-01-12 20:53:19 -0500] ctracey: when this is being done via the -build repo, it will all be pulled fresh in and in a vagrant context
[2014-01-12 20:53:29 -0500] ctracey: i have an update for that Vagrantfile as well
[2014-01-12 20:55:03 -0500] paulczar: oh ya should have mentioned  I'm using the -build repo so its in vagrant ...
[2014-01-12 20:55:38 -0500] paulczar: specifically so I don't have to fuck with the omnibus gems in userspace
[2014-01-12 20:56:13 -0500] paulczar: I'll just sit on it for a few days if you're about to push some major changes anyways
[2014-01-12 20:56:23 -0500] ctracey: yeah i am
[2014-01-12 20:56:32 -0500] ctracey: it will be much more usable
[2014-01-12 20:56:45 -0500] ctracey: i had been carving it up into different packages
[2014-01-12 20:57:01 -0500] ctracey: but I think i will just ship everything in one package that is defined by a manifest
[2014-01-12 20:57:30 -0500] ctracey: much easier that way...and more in line with the "omnibus" thing
[2014-01-12 20:57:55 -0500] paulczar: cool
[2014-01-12 20:59:24 -0500] paulczar: I'm messing about with building a set of docker images for each openstack component ... and was going to see if I should just piggyback off openstack-omnibus
[2014-01-12 20:59:52 -0500] ctracey: heh
[2014-01-12 21:00:01 -0500] ctracey: i had thought of that as well
[2014-01-12 21:00:19 -0500] ctracey: the packages will not have configs associated with them
[2014-01-12 21:00:20 -0500] ctracey: but...
[2014-01-12 21:00:41 -0500] ctracey: i have an idea for using a wrapper cookbook of sorts
[2014-01-12 21:01:34 -0500] ctracey: basically that cookbook would be high in the runlist and set all of the various cookbook package attributes to the omnibus package
[2014-01-12 21:01:46 -0500] ctracey: and then do things like upstart and whatnot
[2014-01-12 21:02:45 -0500] ctracey: paulczar: you on ubuntu?
[2014-01-12 21:02:49 -0500] paulczar: yeah that's cool,  I'm not sure if I want to include them in the docker images either ...  thinking of a shared volume with all the configs in them that can be attached at runtime
[2014-01-12 21:02:50 -0500] paulczar: yeah
[2014-01-12 21:03:37 -0500] ctracey: ok...want to break down that vagrantfile
[2014-01-12 21:03:50 -0500] ctracey: get rid of smartos and freebsd, etc
[2014-01-12 21:04:20 -0500] paulczar: poor smartos
[2014-01-12 21:05:37 -0500] ctracey: hah
