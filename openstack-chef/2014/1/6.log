[2014-01-06 19:02:09 -0500] spheromak: ctracey: https://gist.github.com/spheromak/8287143 new prob in the vagrant build of it.  I pushed a pr if you want to try. Old issue was my crufty gem install
[2014-01-06 19:02:17 -0500] spheromak: crufty bundle i should say
[2014-01-06 19:09:05 -0500] ctracey: spheromak, guessing you dont have cmake
[2014-01-06 19:09:21 -0500] ctracey: I also have a chef cookbook to get the build tools you need
[2014-01-06 19:09:26 -0500] ctracey: i will get that checked in as well
[2014-01-06 19:09:35 -0500] ctracey: if this isnt a yak shave, i dont know what is
[2014-01-06 19:32:16 -0500] spheromak: we can add to the vagrant
[2014-01-06 19:32:22 -0500] spheromak: and let the vagrant box do the shaving
[2014-01-06 19:32:25 -0500] spheromak: ;)
[2014-01-06 19:38:44 -0500] ctracey: indeed
[2014-01-06 20:21:00 -0500] ctracey: this is a general question...
[2014-01-06 20:21:29 -0500] ctracey: how do folks feel about moving from dashes in the namespaced attribute keys to underscores?
[2014-01-06 20:21:51 -0500] ctracey: :'identity-admin' => 'foo' is ugly
[2014-01-06 20:25:49 -0500] ctracey: ccope, welcome You got Myles spun up yet? :)
[2014-01-06 20:32:22 -0500] ccope: ctracey: haha, he's getting there. a lot of stuff to cover
[2014-01-06 20:32:46 -0500] ctracey: ccope, i bet!
[2014-01-06 20:33:33 -0500] ctracey: how's openstack coming?
[2014-01-06 21:14:27 -0500] openstackgerrit: Alan Meadows proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: Bugfix missing quantum-ovs-cleanup on startup  https://review.openstack.org/65098
[2014-01-06 21:17:58 -0500] spheromak: ctracey: I hate dashes :) mainly cause i like symbols
[2014-01-06 21:32:59 -0500] ctracey: spheromak, I'm with ya
[2014-01-06 22:25:18 -0500] openstackgerrit: Justin Shepherd proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image: Adding rubocop todo list  https://review.openstack.org/65163
[2014-01-06 22:33:33 -0500] paulczar: the rubocop --autofix is pretty solid for Cops like Space* and StringLiterals
[2014-01-06 23:29:41 -0500] ccope: @ctracey had to pivot to some urgent stuff last month, did a ton of refactoring in our chef repo to use cookbook wrappers, started digging into LXC, hopefully going to swing back to openstack stuff in the next month
[2014-01-06 23:31:00 -0500] openstackgerrit: Justin Shepherd proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image: Removing rubocop StringLiterals violations  https://review.openstack.org/65176
