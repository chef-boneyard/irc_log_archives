[2014-01-29 00:01:19 -0500] claco: np. same. I'll update that one in the morning. I'm assuming it will start a storm of comments hopefully once people are forced to observe the horrors. :-)
[2014-01-29 00:01:41 -0500] invsblduck: so we don't like commenting the 'end' mountains of nested loops?!
[2014-01-29 00:02:18 -0500] claco: personally, I hate it. Aside from my feeling, I don't see a lot of people doing it.
[2014-01-29 00:02:19 -0500] invsblduck: is there an openstack standard for that?  those comments make it so much easier to maintain IMO :-(
[2014-01-29 00:02:43 -0500] invsblduck: claco: people also name things poorly and have horrible habits.  :-)
[2014-01-29 00:02:45 -0500] claco: I think in some circles... folding means you never see them anyways
[2014-01-29 00:03:10 -0500] invsblduck: yea i don't fold my code enough
[2014-01-29 00:05:46 -0500] mattt: so is gating working now that those patches have gone through ?

[2014-01-29 03:00:50 -0500] ctracey: where would we like that?
[2014-01-29 03:00:57 -0500] ctracey: openstack-common?

[2014-01-29 03:01:08 -0500] claco: :-)
[2014-01-29 03:01:23 -0500] mrodden: pretty sure that 'stamp' is not hte correct operation

[2014-01-29 03:02:32 -0500] ctracey: yeah
[2014-01-29 03:02:39 -0500] ctracey: i dont like that
[2014-01-29 03:02:46 -0500] ctracey: and i didnt in review iirc
[2014-01-29 03:02:59 -0500] ctracey: or maybe not
[2014-01-29 03:03:19 -0500] ctracey: i really dont like any of this "upgrade" with chef stuff
[2014-01-29 03:03:20 -0500] mrodden: i need to fix that
[2014-01-29 03:03:29 -0500] mrodden: its broken
[2014-01-29 03:03:35 -0500] mrodden: stamp sets the database version tag to havana
[2014-01-29 03:03:36 -0500] ctracey: upgrades need to be highly orchestrated
[2014-01-29 03:03:41 -0500] mrodden: but will not run any migrations
[2014-01-29 03:03:47 -0500] ctracey: and i do not trust chef or any CM solution to do that
[2014-01-29 03:04:13 -0500] galstrom: ctracey: that is where you need to kick mattray about opensourcing pushy
[2014-01-29 03:04:23 -0500] ctracey: galstrom: you think i havent?
[2014-01-29 03:04:35 -0500] ctracey: we dont need pushy...
[2014-01-29 03:04:41 -0500] galstrom: ctracey: oh i know we both have.. but it never hurts to keep kicking
[2014-01-29 03:04:49 -0500] ctracey: this can be done with serf i think
[2014-01-29 03:05:02 -0500] ctracey: id also love a chef runtime that let you do:
[2014-01-29 03:05:07 -0500] galstrom: ctracey: isn't serf essentialy the first pass at pushy
[2014-01-29 03:05:07 -0500] ctracey: run_list:

[2014-01-29 03:05:49 -0500] claco: galstrom: ansible *cough* :-P
[2014-01-29 03:06:06 -0500] ctracey: claco: how much have you used ansible?
[2014-01-29 03:06:08 -0500] galstrom: claco: haha.. i figured ctracey was going to say that.. cause i know he loves him some ansible
[2014-01-29 03:06:34 -0500] mrodden: lol
[2014-01-29 03:06:38 -0500] mattt: any reason we don't drop in a .my.cnf ?
[2014-01-29 03:06:53 -0500] ctracey: we are not mysql? :)
[2014-01-29 03:06:53 -0500] claco: ctracey: a lot actually.. so pfffft

[2014-01-29 03:07:27 -0500] claco: ctracey: here's what I've learned: all tools suck, because openstack (upgrades) are some complex shiz
[2014-01-29 03:07:29 -0500] claco: :-)
[2014-01-29 03:07:58 -0500] mrodden: only neutron
[2014-01-29 03:08:08 -0500] mattt: upgrades will no longer be possible thanks to my attribute changes
[2014-01-29 03:08:09 -0500] mattt: :P
[2014-01-29 03:08:10 -0500] ctracey: claco: id have more respect for it if in the 2 months ive used it i didnt see *multiple* people get banned from the ML for disagreeing
[2014-01-29 03:08:33 -0500] claco: hrm. apparently I'm not trying hard enough.
[2014-01-29 03:08:35 -0500] claco: thanks for the tip!
[2014-01-29 03:08:37 -0500] claco: :-)
[2014-01-29 03:08:44 -0500] claco: does that work here too? :-)
[2014-01-29 03:09:05 -0500] ctracey: anyway...we are off topic
[2014-01-29 03:09:16 -0500] mattt: mrodden: my aio just came up, neutron db empty
[2014-01-29 03:09:29 -0500] ctracey: mattt: .my.cnf should come from mysql cookbook, no?
[2014-01-29 03:09:39 -0500] mrodden: mattt: i am going to revert that commit
[2014-01-29 03:09:41 -0500] mrodden: and test
[2014-01-29 03:09:45 -0500] ctracey: we dont touch the databases
[2014-01-29 03:09:53 -0500] mrodden: SUPPOSEDLY, neutron does the database migration itself on startup
[2014-01-29 03:10:01 -0500] mrodden: from what i have been told anyways
[2014-01-29 03:10:07 -0500] ctracey: do folks have opinions on where openrc should be? nova-common is wrong IMO
[2014-01-29 03:10:10 -0500] mattt: ctracey: i'm not sure, i know it's dropped in the rackspace cookbook and i find it helpful so i don't have to dig up the root password
[2014-01-29 03:10:18 -0500] mattt: ctracey: i'll poke to see where that comes from
[2014-01-29 03:10:31 -0500] ctracey: mattt: the password is password
[2014-01-29 03:10:32 -0500] mrodden: ctracey: openstack-common or identity
[2014-01-29 03:10:35 -0500] ctracey: ;)
[2014-01-29 03:10:42 -0500] galstrom: ctracey: +1 for openstack-common
[2014-01-29 03:10:47 -0500] claco: this ^
[2014-01-29 03:10:51 -0500] ctracey: ok common it is
[2014-01-29 03:11:04 -0500] ctracey: only weird part is it lays down OS_REGION_NAME
[2014-01-29 03:11:13 -0500] ctracey: and that shiz is copied everywhere
[2014-01-29 03:11:40 -0500] ctracey: and im gonna drop legacy NOVA envvars
[2014-01-29 03:12:31 -0500] galstrom: ctracey: ++
[2014-01-29 03:12:50 -0500] galstrom: on droping the legacy vars
[2014-01-29 03:13:16 -0500] mattt: mrodden: which commit broke neutron ?
[2014-01-29 03:13:23 -0500] mrodden: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/67368/4
[2014-01-29 03:13:31 -0500] mrodden: mattt: ^
[2014-01-29 03:13:48 -0500] ctracey: thoughts on RegionName?
[2014-01-29 03:14:14 -0500] galstrom: ctracey: i have not looked at the regionname thing
[2014-01-29 03:14:21 -0500] galstrom: should i?
[2014-01-29 03:14:36 -0500] ctracey: all the CB's redefine region
[2014-01-29 03:15:44 -0500] ctracey: but i dunno if that belongs in common
[2014-01-29 03:16:00 -0500] ctracey: ive honestly never used region
[2014-01-29 03:16:07 -0500] ctracey: you rackers do tho
[2014-01-29 03:16:12 -0500] galstrom: ctracey: yeah.. i am not sure on that one
[2014-01-29 03:16:24 -0500] galstrom: would need to think that thru against a multi region deployment
[2014-01-29 03:16:39 -0500] galstrom: i think it could be moved into common..
[2014-01-29 03:17:00 -0500] galstrom: since two regions are most likely 2 seperate environments.. if not 2 seperate chef-servers
[2014-01-29 03:17:52 -0500] ctracey: yeah...tis weird
[2014-01-29 03:18:03 -0500] mattt: mrodden: not sure why that broke it
[2014-01-29 03:18:46 -0500] mrodden: (9:03:34 PM) mrodden: stamp sets the database version tag to havana
[2014-01-29 03:18:46 -0500] mrodden: (9:03:39 PM) mrodden: but will not run any migrations
[2014-01-29 03:19:15 -0500] mattt: how was the migration getting run before this tho ?
[2014-01-29 03:19:20 -0500] mattt: because it doesn't remove any code
[2014-01-29 03:19:24 -0500] mrodden: neutron server does it at startup
[2014-01-29 03:19:35 -0500] mattt: ah
[2014-01-29 03:19:37 -0500] mrodden: which i think we should probably leave it to that
[2014-01-29 03:19:47 -0500] mrodden: gonna test it
[2014-01-29 03:19:50 -0500] mattt: k
[2014-01-29 03:27:17 -0500] ctracey: can we just get common stable?
[2014-01-29 03:27:25 -0500] ctracey: jeez...this shit keeps changin
[2014-01-29 03:29:52 -0500] ctracey: so have we abaondoned the search_for $role unless i am that role?
[2014-01-29 03:30:05 -0500] ctracey: that was mighty handy
[2014-01-29 03:30:57 -0500] ctracey: i need to read this histoty
[2014-01-29 03:31:01 -0500] ctracey: history*

[2014-01-29 03:37:37 -0500] ctracey: now that i think about it...that is probably right anyhow
[2014-01-29 03:38:31 -0500] mattt: hehe
[2014-01-29 03:39:00 -0500] ctracey: that assumed you only ever had one node with that role
[2014-01-29 03:39:03 -0500] ctracey: which is wrong
[2014-01-29 03:45:16 -0500] mrodden: oh boy stuff is breaking since i dont have the latest openstack-common with its new attributes :)
[2014-01-29 03:48:06 -0500] mattt: sorry :(
[2014-01-29 03:48:18 -0500] mattt: going forward i imagine we'll need to properly deprecate attributes
[2014-01-29 03:48:19 -0500] mrodden: lol np
[2014-01-29 03:48:30 -0500] mattt: that change was like a bull in a china shop
[2014-01-29 03:48:37 -0500] mrodden: kind of getting pissed at the berksfile.lock
[2014-01-29 03:48:41 -0500] mrodden: just give me the latest
[2014-01-29 03:53:15 -0500] mattt: hehe
[2014-01-29 03:53:22 -0500] mattt: yeah, i just removed that file from all my checkouts
[2014-01-29 03:58:49 -0500] mrodden: i wish there was a config or something to have berkshelf just ignore it all the time
[2014-01-29 03:59:22 -0500] mrodden: i like my cookbooks like my devstacks, bleeding edge and broken on 8 out of 10 deploys
[2014-01-29 04:00:34 -0500] mrodden: actually its probably not htat bad anymore
[2014-01-29 04:18:31 -0500] mrodden: -----> Kitchen is finished. (29m27.59s)
[2014-01-29 04:18:35 -0500] mrodden: wow new record
[2014-01-29 04:27:26 -0500] mrodden: apparently i need to do more research into the database migrations for neutron
[2014-01-29 04:27:35 -0500] mrodden: i don't think it runs them on startup as i was told
[2014-01-29 04:31:05 -0500] mattt: i also just realised i had provisioned old cookbooks
[2014-01-29 04:31:35 -0500] mattt: so i'm not sure if i was hitting that bug or not, but my neutron db was in fact empty :)
[2014-01-29 04:32:14 -0500] mattt: tho that may be due to me not even using neutron on that node :x
[2014-01-29 04:34:29 -0500] mrodden: well mine always ends up with an empty database
[2014-01-29 04:34:46 -0500] mrodden: and an alembic_sqlalchemy_version talbe or something
[2014-01-29 04:34:48 -0500] mrodden: but nothing else
[2014-01-29 04:35:08 -0500] mrodden: and i know that stamp just marks the database with a version
[2014-01-29 04:35:19 -0500] mrodden: doesnt run any migration
[2014-01-29 04:36:07 -0500] mattt: i'll flip to neutron in a sec and test this
[2014-01-29 04:41:15 -0500] mrodden: i actually need to call it a night
[2014-01-29 04:41:43 -0500] mrodden: i will pick through more code and bug our local neutron expert until i figure out the migration crap though
[2014-01-29 04:41:47 -0500] mrodden: tomorrow*

[2014-01-29 23:12:08 -0500] galstrom: was that a violation you were fixing?
[2014-01-29 23:12:14 -0500] invsblduck: violation
[2014-01-29 23:12:20 -0500] invsblduck: no clue why it didn't trigger the one above it......
[2014-01-29 23:12:49 -0500] galstrom: no.. i am asking .. originally there is a wordarray.each
[2014-01-29 23:12:58 -0500] galstrom: you did a var=wordarray.. then var.each
[2014-01-29 23:13:01 -0500] invsblduck: i can put it back to the way it was before (%w{}.each), i just wanted it to be consistent originally
[2014-01-29 23:13:39 -0500] invsblduck: galstrom: right...i don't really care how it is, just made them all uniform (which they're not, now that i've changed one).
[2014-01-29 23:13:51 -0500] invsblduck: galstrom: i can put it back the way it was.
[2014-01-29 23:13:57 -0500] galstrom: um.. i do not know the right answer.. and it is not something i will -1.. but i personally like the array.each instead of the variable assignment
[2014-01-29 23:14:07 -0500] galstrom: i am not saying you should change it..
[2014-01-29 23:14:20 -0500] galstrom: as i am not sure we have a style guide for that specifically
[2014-01-29 23:14:29 -0500] invsblduck: galstrom: i also like the %{}.each in this case
[2014-01-29 23:15:02 -0500] galstrom: yeah.. there are 3 array.each blocks that you moved over to var assignment blocks..
[2014-01-29 23:15:16 -0500] galstrom: i was just wondering about the reasoning on moving them..
[2014-01-29 23:15:22 -0500] galstrom: i get the consistency thing
[2014-01-29 23:15:39 -0500] invsblduck: galstrom: i just wanted it to be consistent.  feel like future maintenance easier that way.
[2014-01-29 23:15:44 -0500] galstrom: like i said.. it is not anything i would -1 on..
[2014-01-29 23:15:54 -0500] invsblduck: i can change them all to ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'].each
[2014-01-29 23:16:03 -0500] invsblduck: then they will be the same...
[2014-01-29 23:17:03 -0500] invsblduck: galstrom: changing 'em back.
[2014-01-29 23:17:51 -0500] galstrom: invsblduck: any ['a','b',c'] of more than 3 entries needs to be a word array.. per rubocop
[2014-01-29 23:17:58 -0500] invsblduck: ahhhh
[2014-01-29 23:18:02 -0500] galstrom: so the big one is going to have to ba a word array any way
[2014-01-29 23:18:32 -0500] galstrom: so line #28 could be a word array
[2014-01-29 23:18:33 -0500] invsblduck: that seems...silly somehow.
[2014-01-29 23:18:39 -0500] invsblduck: i understand why you'd do it with larger arrays
[2014-01-29 23:18:49 -0500] galstrom: same with #50
[2014-01-29 23:18:54 -0500] galstrom: i agree..
[2014-01-29 23:19:02 -0500] galstrom: i dont think you are going to get them consistent
[2014-01-29 23:19:11 -0500] galstrom: since a 3 entry word array looks odd..
[2014-01-29 23:19:16 -0500] invsblduck: galstrom: i wondered why it was barking about that single array
[2014-01-29 23:19:17 -0500] galstrom: and >5 has to be a word array
[2014-01-29 23:19:30 -0500] invsblduck: np.
[2014-01-29 23:21:51 -0500] galstrom: to stir up the pot a little.. the nova ptl announced over night.. that they are not deprecating nova-net for icehouse as neutron is essentially not ready yet..
[2014-01-29 23:22:13 -0500] galstrom: they are going to be working bugs, and will add features (assessing on a one by one basis) in nova-net

[2014-01-29 23:30:22 -0500] galstrom: invsblduck: nah.. the new patchset looks good to me
[2014-01-29 23:31:33 -0500] galstrom: the #109-115 annoys me.. but i dont know what is a better alternative right now
[2014-01-29 23:32:02 -0500] invsblduck: galstrom: that's what i was referring to.
[2014-01-29 23:32:50 -0500] invsblduck: i don't care for that much; should probably make it more compact
[2014-01-29 23:32:52 -0500] galstrom: yeah.. it is ugly.. and probably needs to be refactored.. but that can be another patchset
[2014-01-29 23:32:57 -0500] invsblduck: (but /less/ compact than it was before ;-))
[2014-01-29 23:33:56 -0500] invsblduck: galstrom: an alternative it to make those structures hashes with meaningful key names
[2014-01-29 23:34:18 -0500] invsblduck: *shrug* up to you.
