[2014-01-24 04:10:04 -0500] ctracey: invsblduck, nice work
[2014-01-24 04:10:27 -0500] ctracey: these are not used atm, but I am of the opinion that they should be
[2014-01-24 04:10:58 -0500] ctracey: (im only finding these things bc I am the only one not using packages :) )
[2014-01-24 04:11:20 -0500] ctracey: welcome to the club btw :)

[2014-01-24 04:12:28 -0500] invsblduck: ctracey: haha, thanks. :)  earlier today i asked if we intended to use these
[2014-01-24 04:13:35 -0500] invsblduck: mattray and alanmeadows suggested i could remove them, fwiw
[2014-01-24 04:14:27 -0500] invsblduck: mostly just learning the process... i will pick up some real bugs and bp's!
[2014-01-24 04:15:09 -0500] ctracey: yeah i can see why they should go
[2014-01-24 04:15:50 -0500] ctracey: i missed the discussion, and I can can get by without them...
[2014-01-24 04:15:58 -0500] ctracey: this is why we have source control :)

[2014-01-24 12:08:49 -0500] nacer_: hi there
[2014-01-24 12:09:05 -0500] nacer_: does someone have started the work for ceph integration ?
[2014-01-24 12:10:54 -0500] s2r2_: hi.  i'm curious, too, would like to help with that if possible.
[2014-01-24 12:12:24 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: i'm starting to work on it
[2014-01-24 12:12:35 -0500] nacer_: making some test
[2014-01-24 12:12:59 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: i'm starting from here -> http://ceph.com/docs/master/rbd/rbd-openstack/#configuring-cinder
[2014-01-24 12:14:00 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: for what i can see for now, i'm making a recipe ceph::openstack_client
[2014-01-24 12:14:10 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: that document is lying a bit... the nova part is outdated, nothing has to be added to nova.conf (with havana)
[2014-01-24 12:14:20 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: oh tks
[2014-01-24 12:14:35 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: you mean all the libvirtd setting uuid ect ... are not needed ?
[2014-01-24 12:15:16 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: cinder knows the uuid, libvirt has the secret and nova-compute is told the uuid when instructed to mount this rbd volume
[2014-01-24 12:15:29 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: okay
[2014-01-24 12:17:12 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: uhm looking at nova/virt/libvirt/utils.py, I'm confused again.
[2014-01-24 12:17:25 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: :)
[2014-01-24 12:18:26 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/utils.py#L268  I was wrong.  the libvirt settings rbd_user and images_rbd_ceph_conf can have an effect
[2014-01-24 12:19:27 -0500] s2r2_: sorry about that.  just had a weird error after enabling them yesterday (some function receiving 7 instead of 6 arguments), I'll verify that quickly
[2014-01-24 12:20:46 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: okay
[2014-01-24 12:21:06 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1233188
[2014-01-24 12:21:31 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: but sorry for the noise, it's probable premature to bring that up now
[2014-01-24 12:21:51 -0500] nacer_: that's okay
[2014-01-24 12:24:38 -0500] nacer_: i think ceph cookbook need to be enchanced with a databag where you can store all the client key
[2014-01-24 12:25:37 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: is that the established practice, storing that stuff in a data bag?
[2014-01-24 12:26:20 -0500] nacer_: established i can't say but it seem the way to go
[2014-01-24 12:26:34 -0500] nacer_: because all you openstack need to have acces to them
[2014-01-24 12:26:39 -0500] nacer_: you need de generate them
[2014-01-24 12:26:53 -0500] nacer_: and databag can be crypted
[2014-01-24 12:32:43 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: true.  it wouldn't be important whether the ceph cookbook creates the users and creates the databag the operator uses some other way to provision the ceph cluster and users...
[2014-01-24 12:34:52 -0500] masteinhauser: s2r2_: it seems like that would be the best way to go. Let ceph cookbooks manage ceph, and use search/encrypted databags for users/mounts.
[2014-01-24 12:35:37 -0500] masteinhauser: basically, it allows for integration while still reducing the amount of code we would need to maintain/could be in conflict over another ceph cookbook.
[2014-01-24 12:37:06 -0500] s2r2_: masteinhauser: totally agree
[2014-01-24 12:38:15 -0500] masteinhauser: s2r2_: It's funny to me how often cookbooks/recipes need to follow the SOLID principles just like most other software
[2014-01-24 12:39:26 -0500] s2r2_: you got me google'ing.  now I'm a little embarrassed.  but you're right.
[2014-01-24 12:40:07 -0500] masteinhauser: s2r2_: No worries, I sit on both sides of the whole Dev/Ops fence. And learning should never be embarrassing! :)
[2014-01-24 12:40:13 -0500] s2r2_: :)
[2014-01-24 12:41:59 -0500] s2r2_: should there be a blueprint for ceph integration?
[2014-01-24 12:42:49 -0500] masteinhauser: (also, about that fence... it shouldn't exist IMHO!)
[2014-01-24 12:43:01 -0500] masteinhauser: s2r2_: Not sure, but it would probably make sense. I don't know enough about either side anymore like I used to.
[2014-01-24 12:47:30 -0500] s2r2_: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+spec/rbd-for-block-storage  here we go
[2014-01-24 12:48:34 -0500] masteinhauser: s2r2_: Heh, it's a start at least!
[2014-01-24 12:49:26 -0500] s2r2_: masteinhauser: feel free to add/edit
[2014-01-24 12:50:54 -0500] masteinhauser: s2r2_: Once I learn more about the existing Chef cookbooks I'll try to. I've been out of the OpenStack world since May, 2013 after moving/changing jobs.
[2014-01-24 12:51:03 -0500] masteinhauser: Diving back into it again right now.
[2014-01-24 12:51:53 -0500] s2r2_: s2r2_: I'm barely deeper into this, unfortunately...
[2014-01-24 12:53:51 -0500] nacer_: so first of all we need to work on ceph cookbook :)
[2014-01-24 12:54:25 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: while I'd love to (the cookbook definitely needs work), do you really think we should do that first?
[2014-01-24 12:54:44 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: yeah without it we are kind of stuck
[2014-01-24 12:54:46 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: we could just assume the ceph cluster (and the databag) a given and do the openstack stuff
[2014-01-24 12:55:22 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: people might use *whatever* to deploy their ceph cluster
[2014-01-24 12:56:17 -0500] masteinhauser: s2r2_: +1, people *will* use whatever to deploy. Like the Puppet cookbooks are cep's own tools
[2014-01-24 12:56:31 -0500] masteinhauser: We should definitely focus on the openstack side first since most people won't be replicating that functionality.
[2014-01-24 12:56:32 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: i don't want us to create a new cookbook and add it to stackforge
[2014-01-24 12:56:58 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: we shouldn't think about how to deploy ceph (well, I do, but...) now
[2014-01-24 12:57:05 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_:a official ceph cookbook exist i want to patch it
[2014-01-24 12:57:12 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: go for it :)
[2014-01-24 12:57:26 -0500] nacer_: :)
[2014-01-24 12:57:37 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: that cookbook needs a lot of work, and I, too, want to spend some work there, but it shouldn't stop our stackforge effort
[2014-01-24 12:58:05 -0500] mattt: ceph integration ++
[2014-01-24 12:58:22 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: i don't know what we need to add stackforge , my mind is stuck on the ceph part :)
[2014-01-24 12:58:55 -0500] nacer_: mattt: yeah , i have seen it's on you roadmap. Did you think about it ?
[2014-01-24 12:58:55 -0500] mattt: nacer_: we tested openstack ceph integration w/ rcbops openstack cookbooks and upstream ceph cookbook, all worked together
[2014-01-24 12:59:35 -0500] nacer_: mattt: who did you manage the ceph client key ?
[2014-01-24 13:00:14 -0500] mattt: nacer_: it wasn't a databag, that much i know :(
[2014-01-24 13:00:20 -0500] nacer_: mattt: :)
[2014-01-24 13:00:26 -0500] mattt: but it's been a while since i looked, so i can't remember the specifics :(
[2014-01-24 13:00:31 -0500] nacer_: mattt: ok
[2014-01-24 13:00:45 -0500] nacer_: i need to start thinking where you left
[2014-01-24 13:02:40 -0500] nacer_: mattt: what's rcbops ?
[2014-01-24 13:03:13 -0500] s2r2_: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-block-storage/blob/master/recipes/volume.rb#L58-L59
[2014-01-24 13:03:42 -0500] s2r2_: there's already something in the cinder cookbook for the rbd secret.
[2014-01-24 13:06:08 -0500] mattt: nacer_: https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/
[2014-01-24 13:06:21 -0500] nacer_: ok
[2014-01-24 13:06:29 -0500] nacer_: it's the work from rackspace ?
[2014-01-24 13:06:43 -0500] mattt: nacer_: correct
[2014-01-24 13:07:08 -0500] s2r2_: nvm that last thing is just the secret uuid; not the actual secret key...
[2014-01-24 13:07:20 -0500] nacer_: for what i see they don't bother to create ceph client key in the cookbook
[2014-01-24 13:07:43 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: correct
[2014-01-24 13:08:33 -0500] s2r2_: librbd (from rbd.py) would (AFAIK) lookup /etc/ceph/ceph.conf for the initial_mon_hosts and search for the ceph.client.cinder.keyring file there
[2014-01-24 13:08:45 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: it's like what you said earlier
[2014-01-24 13:10:51 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: https://github.com/ceph/ceph-cookbooks/blob/master/attributes/default.rb
[2014-01-24 13:11:50 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: https://github.com/ceph/ceph-cookbooks/blob/cc28eeac90a9aebfdb49484ad49cdcab7f552d76/recipes/mon.rb#L44-L47 this will not store actual stuff inside a databag, just use a databag for input
[2014-01-24 13:12:25 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: yeah it's a start
[2014-01-24 13:21:57 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: i think the attribute name rbd_user is missleading
[2014-01-24 13:23:20 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: because you define a user but the is going to look for the key file <- I need to validate that
[2014-01-24 13:28:26 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: yes.  there's a user (such as cinder)
[2014-01-24 13:29:09 -0500] s2r2_: but there has to be a ceph.client.cinder.keyring file... you can verify that everything should work with "rbd -p <pool> --id cinder ls" for example
[2014-01-24 13:29:38 -0500] s2r2_: withtout rbd_user, it will be done as admin, looking for ceph.client.admin.keyring...
[2014-01-24 13:46:55 -0500] mancdaz: s2r2_ nacer_ we did some basic work to use the ceph cookbooks with the rcbops cookbooks
[2014-01-24 13:47:02 -0500] mancdaz: see https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/cinder/blob/master/recipes/cinder-volume.rb#L126-L179
[2014-01-24 13:47:33 -0500] nacer_: mancdaz: oh tks  ! :)
[2014-01-24 13:47:44 -0500] mancdaz: it basically says 'if you used the ceph cookbooks to deploy ceph, we will configure the ppenstack stuff using the admin client/ceph.conf etc
[2014-01-24 13:48:02 -0500] mancdaz: it was working with the ceph cookbooks last I checked
[2014-01-24 13:48:11 -0500] mancdaz: it's a bit crufty though
[2014-01-24 13:48:25 -0500] nacer_: i love this comment : # do all this in a ruby_block so it doesn't get executed at compile time
[2014-01-24 13:49:02 -0500] mancdaz: yep - thanks chef!
[2014-01-24 13:49:41 -0500] mancdaz: cant' run ceph commands unless ceph is installed
[2014-01-24 13:49:50 -0500] mancdaz: = fail at compile time
[2014-01-24 13:50:24 -0500] nacer_: mancdaz: i think we have all failed in this trap
[2014-01-24 14:04:24 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: did you mancdaz link ?

[2014-01-24 14:54:59 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: have you seen this one? https://github.com/wonko/ceph-cookbook  interesting too, with LWRPs for stuff
[2014-01-24 14:55:15 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: I think there was a PR to integrate this into the ceph cookbook...
[2014-01-24 15:02:15 -0500] s2r2_: nacer_: sorry for the noise from the blueprint... (just noticed I got a mail from every small change...)
[2014-01-24 15:17:12 -0500] nacer_: s2r2_: it's ok

[2014-01-24 21:44:06 -0500] mrodden: pretty sure they could offload a lot of the dep. tree overhead to a C subroutine since CPython is pretty good at that
[2014-01-24 21:44:26 -0500] mrodden: plenty of improvements could be made anyways
[2014-01-24 21:44:45 -0500] mrodden: did you know that google's chromeos is built with portage/emerge as well?
[2014-01-24 21:44:56 -0500] mrodden: which more or less makes it Gentoo
[2014-01-24 21:47:12 -0500] invsblduck: no clue.  ah, looks like they switched from ubuntu
[2014-01-24 21:47:27 -0500] mrodden: when were they on ubuntu?
[2014-01-24 21:47:39 -0500] invsblduck: they partnered with canonical at some point
[2014-01-24 21:47:42 -0500] mrodden: oh
[2014-01-24 21:47:53 -0500] mrodden: maybe that was after emerge/portage
[2014-01-24 21:47:58 -0500] mrodden: could have dropped it i guess
[2014-01-24 21:48:18 -0500] invsblduck: no, before it seems: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS
[2014-01-24 21:48:23 -0500] invsblduck: Never touched it :)
[2014-01-24 21:49:18 -0500] mrodden: lol
[2014-01-24 21:49:35 -0500] mrodden: too funny
[2014-01-24 21:49:58 -0500] mrodden: although there is always that point when using something liek ubuntu or RHEL where you just get pissed off at how badly some package is built
[2014-01-24 21:50:06 -0500] mrodden: and then i wish i was back with Gentoo again
[2014-01-24 21:50:22 -0500] invsblduck: that's right
[2014-01-24 21:50:32 -0500] invsblduck: and i do that on a macro level with BSD and Linux
[2014-01-24 21:50:38 -0500] invsblduck: haha
[2014-01-24 21:50:44 -0500] mrodden: nice
[2014-01-24 21:53:04 -0500] mrodden: https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec#writing-custom-matchers sweet
[2014-01-24 21:53:09 -0500] mrodden: i didn't know we could do that
[2014-01-24 21:53:25 -0500] mrodden: test all the LWRPs!
[2014-01-24 21:53:37 -0500] invsblduck: dude that's really weird because that's the page i'm browsing while we were chatting :)
[2014-01-24 21:53:44 -0500] mrodden: lol
[2014-01-24 21:53:52 -0500] mrodden: yeah i'm really new to chefspec
[2014-01-24 21:54:02 -0500] mrodden: haven't forced myself to use it in previous projects enough
[2014-01-24 21:54:07 -0500] invsblduck: <-- decided to learn it today
[2014-01-24 21:54:17 -0500] mrodden: i like it
[2014-01-24 21:54:28 -0500] mrodden: although there are a lot of resource matchers missing
[2014-01-24 21:56:04 -0500] invsblduck: even though it's a mock converge, i'm afraid to run it on my Arch dev workstation (without reading the code)
[2014-01-24 21:56:56 -0500] mrodden: it makes some tempfiles sometimes
[2014-01-24 21:57:00 -0500] invsblduck: kind of want to run it in a sandbox/vm anyway, without bleeding edge Arch interpreters/tools
[2014-01-24 21:57:03 -0500] mrodden: most of the time its safe
[2014-01-24 21:57:17 -0500] invsblduck: mrodden: for sure... I would guess.
[2014-01-24 21:57:26 -0500] mrodden: i run in a dev env
[2014-01-24 21:57:31 -0500] mrodden: dev env VM
[2014-01-24 21:59:11 -0500] invsblduck: mrodden: how did you do yours? (vagrant, etc)
[2014-01-24 21:59:15 -0500] mrodden: openstack
[2014-01-24 21:59:17 -0500] mrodden: :)
[2014-01-24 21:59:30 -0500] mrodden: libvirt KVM driver
[2014-01-24 21:59:32 -0500] invsblduck: ah, cool.
[2014-01-24 21:59:38 -0500] invsblduck: 'course :P
[2014-01-24 21:59:42 -0500] mrodden: just an ubuntu precise VM
[2014-01-24 22:00:27 -0500] invsblduck: yea i have a ton of bash tooling around libvirt/Qemu/KVM on my workstation
[2014-01-24 22:00:38 -0500] invsblduck: i kick ubuntu precise that way
[2014-01-24 22:00:54 -0500] mrodden: yeah, TBH, nova isn't much different than a bunch of bash automation
[2014-01-24 22:01:03 -0500] invsblduck: (in fact, those are the VMs i use to run StackForge/OpenStack)
[2014-01-24 22:01:16 -0500] mrodden: yeah me too
[2014-01-24 22:01:51 -0500] mrodden: i have a precise VM for hacking on the cookbooks, then i use test kitchen with the openstack driver pointed at the same openstack to test out the cookbooks on various OSes
[2014-01-24 22:02:22 -0500] mrodden: it works pretty slick
[2014-01-24 22:02:32 -0500] invsblduck: hm
[2014-01-24 22:02:47 -0500] invsblduck: relatively new to all this, haven't touched test kitchen yet either
[2014-01-24 22:03:16 -0500] mrodden: i find that it works better with chef-zero than vagrant
[2014-01-24 22:03:33 -0500] mrodden: but fills the same role in spinning up a VM and loading the cookbooks onto it
[2014-01-24 22:04:02 -0500] mrodden: i did have to hack all the role files into JSON instead of ruby DSL
[2014-01-24 22:04:09 -0500] mrodden: i have a python script that converts them though...
[2014-01-24 22:04:10 -0500] mrodden: :)
[2014-01-24 22:04:13 -0500] claco: mr
[2014-01-24 22:04:16 -0500] claco: mr
[2014-01-24 22:04:20 -0500] claco: damnit
[2014-01-24 22:04:45 -0500] claco: mrodden: there's a hack:  knife role from file some.rb -z
[2014-01-24 22:04:58 -0500] mrodden: oh nice
[2014-01-24 22:05:03 -0500] claco: converts it more of less... sans chef/type entry
[2014-01-24 22:05:05 -0500] mrodden: didn't think of that
[2014-01-24 22:05:17 -0500] claco: same for env
[2014-01-24 22:05:33 -0500] claco: I think it's an accident... but I stumbled upon it
[2014-01-24 22:06:15 -0500] mrodden: i am pretty good at python after hacking on nova a lot, so it didn't take much to build a script that prints JSON from something else
[2014-01-24 22:06:36 -0500] mrodden: but the knife way probably understands how to parse better
[2014-01-24 22:06:45 -0500] claco: https://gist.github.com/claco/ced996318b65423413bb
[2014-01-24 22:07:14 -0500] mrodden: cool
[2014-01-24 22:07:26 -0500] claco: somehow I messed up the gist...  https://gist.github.com/claco/ced996318b65423413bb/revisions
[2014-01-24 22:07:52 -0500] claco: knife it..then add the json_class and chef_type.. and it worked every time for me
[2014-01-24 22:08:12 -0500] claco: and I had some long nasty old env files to convert :-)
[2014-01-24 22:08:18 -0500] mrodden: lol
[2014-01-24 22:08:31 -0500] mrodden: some of those openstack roles are pretty big too
[2014-01-24 22:08:38 -0500] mrodden: more the quantity of them though
[2014-01-24 22:10:58 -0500] invsblduck: claco: you use tk w/vagrant or chef0?
[2014-01-24 22:11:13 -0500] invsblduck: er
[2014-01-24 22:11:23 -0500] invsblduck: that may be a poor question :)
[2014-01-24 22:14:36 -0500] claco: test? I just sling patches. This is what Jenkins is for. :-P
[2014-01-24 22:18:09 -0500] mrodden: does ruby have something against single quotes....
[2014-01-24 22:18:24 -0500] mrodden: there are double quotes everywhere in our cookbooks
[2014-01-24 22:18:47 -0500] claco: they're getting weeded out w/ the rubocop compliance patchsets
[2014-01-24 22:19:00 -0500] mrodden: rubocop requires double?
[2014-01-24 22:19:06 -0500] claco: singles
[2014-01-24 22:19:11 -0500] mrodden: ok
[2014-01-24 22:19:14 -0500] mrodden: thats what i thought...
[2014-01-24 22:19:21 -0500] claco: not that it matters in ruby
[2014-01-24 22:19:33 -0500] mrodden: depends if you want #{} or not
[2014-01-24 22:19:36 -0500] claco: I doubt there's a perf hit like in perl land...I could be wrong
[2014-01-24 22:19:46 -0500] mrodden: probably not
[2014-01-24 22:19:52 -0500] invsblduck: mrodden: technically, with other projects, you can have a coding standard where single quotes are used for all string literals (to prevent accidental variable interpolation) and double quotes are used when you need them
[2014-01-24 22:19:56 -0500] claco: I personally always just use " across the board
[2014-01-24 22:20:10 -0500] mrodden: i use ' unless i need "
[2014-01-24 22:20:16 -0500] mrodden: same as python pretty much
[2014-01-24 22:20:29 -0500] claco: now funnily enough.. rubo does'nt flag the use of %W with no interpolation over %w
[2014-01-24 22:20:46 -0500] mrodden: lol
[2014-01-24 22:21:20 -0500] claco: I would count that as a bug
[2014-01-24 22:22:25 -0500] mrodden: yeah definitely a bug
[2014-01-24 22:23:30 -0500] claco: speaking of.. can someone move this along so I can get to the rest? :-)  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/68197/
[2014-01-24 22:23:33 -0500] mrodden: sweet my custom matchers work...
[2014-01-24 22:23:54 -0500] claco: ha
[2014-01-24 22:24:08 -0500] mrodden: i have no +A :(
[2014-01-24 22:24:28 -0500] claco: lol  http://imgur.com/s5HqWUg
[2014-01-24 22:24:38 -0500] mrodden: lol
[2014-01-24 22:24:50 -0500] mrodden: bookmarking that...
[2014-01-24 22:28:59 -0500] openstackgerrit: Mathew Odden proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: Add enable flag for RDO yum repository on RHEL  https://review.openstack.org/66803
