[2014-01-13 16:00:22 -0500] paulczar: how do I join ?  that link looks like its just to watch

[2014-01-13 16:06:03 -0500] aspiers: my googletalk plugin is broken :(
[2014-01-13 16:06:22 -0500] paulczar: try firefox  mine wouldn't work in chrome

[2014-01-13 16:10:42 -0500] mrodden: ++ to vagrant...
[2014-01-13 16:10:46 -0500] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Update the Gemfile to sync with latest Chef and ChefSpec.  https://review.openstack.org/65783
[2014-01-13 16:10:54 -0500] mattt: what work needs to be done w/ vagrant ?
[2014-01-13 16:13:21 -0500] aspiers: *sigh* can't get googletalk plugin working, even with firefox or various other workarounds
[2014-01-13 16:13:30 -0500] mrodden: i'm currently deploying with test kitchen using the kitchen-openstack plugin, which works really well, but requires an OpenStack already set up to do deployments
[2014-01-13 16:14:04 -0500] mrodden: clarkb from the infra team didn't like the vagrant method because of the virtualbox requirement
[2014-01-13 16:14:31 -0500] mrodden: for integration testing using openstack-infra setup
[2014-01-13 16:15:08 -0500] mattt: mrodden: ok, that makes sense
[2014-01-13 16:15:20 -0500] mrodden: i tried vagabond with LXC
[2014-01-13 16:15:35 -0500] mrodden: that worked great except for the problem where LXC isn't really done on ubuntu 12.04 LTS
[2014-01-13 16:15:46 -0500] mrodden: which is what the openstack-infra stuff is all running on again
[2014-01-13 16:16:10 -0500] mrodden: ran into issues installing openiscsi in a container without device namespaces
[2014-01-13 16:20:52 -0500] paulczar: we could use the openstack or ?? driver for vagrant
[2014-01-13 16:22:39 -0500] mrodden: the infra nodes come with libvirt+QEMU installed
[2014-01-13 16:22:52 -0500] mrodden: so if that driver worked i think they would really like that
[2014-01-13 16:23:12 -0500] galstrom: paulczar: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/65013/ needs to be rebased.. :(
[2014-01-13 16:23:15 -0500] mrodden: (i haven't had a lot of luck with vagrant plugins)
[2014-01-13 16:23:30 -0500] paulczar: galstrom: ya I saw that just before
[2014-01-13 16:23:32 -0500] mattt: so vagrant is more for openstack-infra rather than getting users easily on board ?
[2014-01-13 16:23:35 -0500] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Adds misc options  https://review.openstack.org/63027
[2014-01-13 16:23:42 -0500] paulczar: I always fail at rebase
[2014-01-13 16:23:55 -0500] paulczar: also chances are we'd use testkitchen+??  for the actual gatingt
[2014-01-13 16:23:59 -0500] mrodden: mattt: ideally i think it shoudl be for both
[2014-01-13 16:25:09 -0500] mrodden: but i think its important to get a gating integration test suite working for the cookbooks
[2014-01-13 16:25:36 -0500] mrodden: individual developers will most likely figure out their own dev environment
[2014-01-13 16:26:13 -0500] mrodden: vagrant tends to be the path of least resistance at the moment for a dev. env. setup i think
[2014-01-13 16:26:31 -0500] ctracey: what about production? :)
[2014-01-13 16:27:00 -0500] paulczar: lola nobody uses openstack in production
[2014-01-13 16:27:04 -0500] paulczar: lolz even
[2014-01-13 16:27:06 -0500] mrodden: lol
[2014-01-13 16:27:09 -0500] paulczar: thanks autocorrect
[2014-01-13 16:27:49 -0500] ctracey: paulczar, word has it you guys have dabbled in it
[2014-01-13 16:28:11 -0500] galstrom: so there is a vagrant+kvm (have not tried)
[2014-01-13 16:28:13 -0500] paulczar: it's really eucalyptus with a reimplementation of the APIs
[2014-01-13 16:28:19 -0500] paulczar: but sshhhh
[2014-01-13 16:28:34 -0500] galstrom: so maybe kitchen-vagrant, with vagrant+kvm??
[2014-01-13 16:28:43 -0500] galstrom: that might make the infra guys happy
[2014-01-13 16:29:12 -0500] mrodden: i think the vagrant KVM plugin was in rough shape last time i checked...
[2014-01-13 16:29:27 -0500] ctracey: paulczar, think about how easy the aws compat debate would be
[2014-01-13 16:29:34 -0500] mattt: do any other OS projects use vagrant for gating?
[2014-01-13 16:29:35 -0500] spheromak: i didn't have much luck with kvm  *vagrant/kvm* and no kitchen-kvm tho kitchen drivers aren't that hard to make
[2014-01-13 16:29:45 -0500] ctracey: not that I know of
[2014-01-13 16:29:46 -0500] paulczar: infra doesn't have an openstack cluster for testing ?
[2014-01-13 16:29:50 -0500] ctracey: kind of the old dog food thing
[2014-01-13 16:30:02 -0500] mrodden: paulczar: i think they use all public clouds
[2014-01-13 16:30:02 -0500] ctracey: they do
[2014-01-13 16:30:09 -0500] mrodden: they do?
[2014-01-13 16:30:15 -0500] galstrom: yes
[2014-01-13 16:30:17 -0500] galstrom: they do
[2014-01-13 16:30:26 -0500] paulczar: or maybe rackspace can donate cloud servers and we can use the vagrant-rackspace plugin
[2014-01-13 16:30:33 -0500] mrodden: test kitchen + openstack driver then...
[2014-01-13 16:30:38 -0500] spheromak: and yea i rather seee kitchen-ostack in the gating.
[2014-01-13 16:30:39 -0500] galstrom: i knew that was about to happen
[2014-01-13 16:30:40 -0500] galstrom: :)
[2014-01-13 16:30:41 -0500] mrodden: i have been using it for a month or so now
[2014-01-13 16:30:43 -0500] ctracey: i think we might be donating at some point as well
[2014-01-13 16:30:50 -0500] ctracey: dont quote me on that
[2014-01-13 16:30:54 -0500] mattt: ctracey: too late
[2014-01-13 16:30:58 -0500] ctracey: haha
[2014-01-13 16:31:01 -0500] mrodden: lol
[2014-01-13 16:31:04 -0500] ctracey: thats happened before
[2014-01-13 16:31:30 -0500] ctracey: might also be the reason i could never work at aws ;)
[2014-01-13 16:33:35 -0500] mrodden: i think there is a kitchen-fog driver as well
[2014-01-13 16:33:41 -0500] mrodden: one API to rule them all?
[2014-01-13 16:34:26 -0500] mrodden: pretty sure the openstack driver actually uses fog internally
[2014-01-13 16:38:41 -0500] mattt: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-ops-messaging/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L24-L29 has attributes that are defined in other cookbooks, is that right?
[2014-01-13 16:41:32 -0500] mrodden: right as in "correct thing to do" or right as in "thats how it is right now"
[2014-01-13 16:41:42 -0500] mattt: "correct thing to do"
[2014-01-13 16:42:05 -0500] mrodden: doesn't seem like two cookbooks should be defining different defaults
[2014-01-13 16:42:06 -0500] mrodden: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L37
[2014-01-13 16:42:35 -0500] mrodden: not very DRY
[2014-01-13 16:43:10 -0500] mattt: yeah, and it doesn't seem like we do something similar w/ the database cookbook (where it sets database host for each service based on the IP from an interface)
[2014-01-13 16:43:21 -0500] mrodden: no idea if there is a reason why its like that though
[2014-01-13 16:43:40 -0500] mrodden: git blame might shed some light on why
[2014-01-13 16:43:45 -0500] ctracey: are those even being used?
[2014-01-13 16:43:49 -0500] ctracey: probably not
[2014-01-13 16:44:09 -0500] mattray: mrodden: especially because of this: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-ops-messaging/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L24
[2014-01-13 16:44:22 -0500] mrodden: right
[2014-01-13 16:44:30 -0500] mattray: mrodden: pretty sure those were there from at&t or rackspace back in the day?
[2014-01-13 16:44:32 -0500] ctracey: rabbit work into openstack-common/messaging was added in later
[2014-01-13 16:44:38 -0500] ctracey: probably an oversight
[2014-01-13 16:44:44 -0500] ctracey: yes
[2014-01-13 16:44:51 -0500] mattray: because not everyone is using openstack-ops-messaging
[2014-01-13 16:45:00 -0500] mattray: and/or openstack-ops-database
[2014-01-13 16:45:17 -0500] ctracey: retr0h, would know
[2014-01-13 16:45:23 -0500] mattt: i'm asking because of https://review.openstack.org/#/c/65668/
[2014-01-13 16:45:29 -0500] mattray: ctracey: I'm pretty sure that's why they're redundant
[2014-01-13 16:45:32 -0500] mattt: looking at that is when i noticed dupe attributes
[2014-01-13 16:46:40 -0500] ctracey: i dont know what that review is trying to do
[2014-01-13 16:46:46 -0500] mattt: make it work :P
[2014-01-13 16:47:10 -0500] mattt: if i understand correctly, you need to converge 2x to get the value to be set correctly
[2014-01-13 16:47:27 -0500] mattray: this is suboptimal
[2014-01-13 16:47:30 -0500] mrodden: lol
[2014-01-13 16:47:51 -0500] mattray: the ops-messaging/attributes set should be enough
[2014-01-13 16:47:53 -0500] ctracey: yes it is
[2014-01-13 16:48:06 -0500] mattray: it seems the recipe would whack any changes in other cookbooks
[2014-01-13 16:48:14 -0500] mattray: which I kinda dislike anyway
[2014-01-13 16:48:17 -0500] ctracey: that, and it limits  you to those services
[2014-01-13 16:48:26 -0500] mattt: i don't like this being in ops-messaging
[2014-01-13 16:48:27 -0500] mattt: feels dirty
[2014-01-13 16:48:36 -0500] mattt: and isnt' consistent w/ the ops-database cookbook
[2014-01-13 16:48:40 -0500] mattray: yeah
[2014-01-13 16:48:42 -0500] ctracey: ops-messaging is a reference impl
[2014-01-13 16:48:52 -0500] ctracey: only
[2014-01-13 16:49:25 -0500] mrodden: but i use it for deploys
[2014-01-13 16:49:31 -0500] mattray: mrodden: me too
[2014-01-13 16:49:35 -0500] mattt: didn't realize yo udidn't have to use them
[2014-01-13 16:49:37 -0500] mrodden: and also, i think its a hard req. in some of the cookbooks
[2014-01-13 16:50:00 -0500] mrodden: although that might be just my berks file
[2014-01-13 16:50:06 -0500] mattray: I think the intention was you could use other recipes for the database configuration
[2014-01-13 16:50:07 -0500] mattt: welp
[2014-01-13 16:50:16 -0500] mattray: and messaging configuration
[2014-01-13 16:50:20 -0500] mattt: https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo/blob/master/Berksfile#L26-L27
[2014-01-13 16:50:37 -0500] mattray: mattt: and technically the chef-repo is optional too
[2014-01-13 16:50:50 -0500] mattray: ok, lemme explain
[2014-01-13 16:51:04 -0500] mrodden: yeah copied that chef repo for mine so thats why i am getting them i bet
[2014-01-13 16:51:09 -0500] mattray: AT&T (and others?) do not use the chef-repo or the database and messaging cookbooks
[2014-01-13 16:51:12 -0500] mattt: "let me explain, grown men shouldn't cry"
[2014-01-13 16:51:27 -0500] mattray: but the rest of us do
[2014-01-13 16:51:37 -0500] mattray: so we were trying to make them "reference implementations"
[2014-01-13 16:51:51 -0500] mrodden: so we *should* make sure they work with the cookbook set anyways
[2014-01-13 16:51:58 -0500] mattray: definitely
[2014-01-13 16:52:03 -0500] mattt: k
[2014-01-13 16:52:15 -0500] salmanbaset: indeed. ops-database and ops-messaging should be made reference implementations
[2014-01-13 16:52:18 -0500] mattt: so ripping out those attributes from ops-messaging shouldn't affect those using other implementations
[2014-01-13 16:52:29 -0500] salmanbaset: we are using them for various projects in ibm
[2014-01-13 16:52:35 -0500] mattray: mattt: that's where I'm a little unsure
[2014-01-13 16:52:55 -0500] mattray: I think if the attributes are in ops-messaging and database, that should be good enough for compute/network/etc.
[2014-01-13 16:52:55 -0500] ctracey: salmanbaset, they already are
[2014-01-13 16:53:35 -0500] mattray: so no need to redefine attributes in 2 places
[2014-01-13 16:53:56 -0500] mattray: where should node[openstack][compute][mq]  stuff get defined?
[2014-01-13 16:54:07 -0500] mattt: mattray: the messaging cookbook i'd imagine
[2014-01-13 16:54:17 -0500] mattt: but the service specific attributes should be handled in each service's cookbook
[2014-01-13 16:54:23 -0500] mattray: mattt: I'd agree, even though it's in the service namespace
[2014-01-13 16:54:51 -0500] mrodden: if one wants to have a different MQ server for each service i suppose
[2014-01-13 16:54:54 -0500] mattray: and the loop in there was to make sure they were set the same everywhere if you hadn't overridden them
[2014-01-13 16:55:03 -0500] ctracey: mattray, should this all be coming from openstack-common?
[2014-01-13 16:55:04 -0500] salmanbaset: sorry i meant, as core cookbooks like compute or identity so that we remove this confusion on ops-database and ops-messaging being optional
[2014-01-13 16:55:18 -0500] mattray: ctracey: which might be even better?
[2014-01-13 16:55:26 -0500] ctracey: i think it already is there
[2014-01-13 16:55:27 -0500] ctracey: no?
[2014-01-13 16:55:41 -0500] salmanbaset: for ops-messaging, we are already in the process of attribute rearrangement
[2014-01-13 16:55:44 -0500] mattray: ctracey: ugh, yes
[2014-01-13 16:55:55 -0500] ctracey: i dont think it is right to force users into a strictly opinionated messaging/database model
[2014-01-13 16:56:01 -0500] salmanbaset: rabbit goes under node[openstack][mq][rabbit]
[2014-01-13 16:56:01 -0500] mattray: so mq and db are defined in 3 cookbooks
[2014-01-13 16:56:08 -0500] salmanbaset: qpid goes udner rabbit goes under node[openstack][mq][qpid]
[2014-01-13 16:56:17 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: that's a side-note
[2014-01-13 16:56:31 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: this is the question of where do we define node[openstack][mq]
[2014-01-13 16:56:36 -0500] salmanbaset: right
[2014-01-13 16:56:43 -0500] mattray: and node[openstack][compute][mq]
[2014-01-13 16:56:47 -0500] salmanbaset: the idea was to eventally move them to common
[2014-01-13 16:56:58 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: I think I agree
[2014-01-13 16:57:01 -0500] ctracey: much of it is in common...or was
[2014-01-13 16:57:09 -0500] mattray: ctracey: did we get halfway?
[2014-01-13 16:57:09 -0500] salmanbaset: both node[openstack][mq] and node[openstack][SERVICE][mq]
[2014-01-13 16:57:15 -0500] mrodden: i think we shoudl put them in common
[2014-01-13 16:57:17 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: works for me
[2014-01-13 16:57:22 -0500] ctracey: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L376
[2014-01-13 16:57:24 -0500] mrodden: and then if someone needs to override per service
[2014-01-13 16:57:26 -0500] mattray: mrodden: I think we're in agreement
[2014-01-13 16:57:28 -0500] mrodden: they can do that in the cookbook
[2014-01-13 16:57:35 -0500] mrodden: for that service
[2014-01-13 16:57:35 -0500] mattray: mrodden: or environment
[2014-01-13 16:57:38 -0500] mrodden: right
[2014-01-13 16:57:49 -0500] mrodden: ok
[2014-01-13 16:57:52 -0500] ctracey: mattray, when i was at HS, I was using it from common
[2014-01-13 16:57:52 -0500] mattray: so who wants to write this up as a blueprint to clean up attributes for mq and database?
[2014-01-13 16:58:12 -0500] mattray: ctracey: that's probably fine too
[2014-01-13 16:58:18 -0500] salmanbaset: let me do that
[2014-01-13 16:58:38 -0500] ctracey: do we really think that folks will use multiple messaging infrastructures for openstack? and if so, is this really something we need to support today?
[2014-01-13 16:58:41 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: thanks! I'll be happy to review and help
[2014-01-13 16:58:49 -0500] mrodden: thx salmanbaset
[2014-01-13 16:58:53 -0500] mattray: ctracey: we do support it, but I have no idea if people use it
[2014-01-13 16:59:11 -0500] mattray: ctracey: which is why I put in the copying of mq to service.mq
[2014-01-13 16:59:17 -0500] mrodden: it might be useful if one is using qpid routing
[2014-01-13 16:59:19 -0500] mattt: salmanbaset: thanks!  i am happy to review/help too since i mentioned this, tho i feel like the conversation has moved on from my original question :P
[2014-01-13 16:59:20 -0500] ctracey: all masochists please raise your hands
[2014-01-13 16:59:23 -0500] mattray: because it was unevenly applied
[2014-01-13 16:59:26 -0500] ctracey: :)
[2014-01-13 16:59:53 -0500] mattray: ctracey: I was pedantically looking at attributes for awhile, the mq and database stuff was redundant and uneven
[2014-01-13 17:00:02 -0500] mattray: so I tried to clean up some to make it consistent
[2014-01-13 17:00:05 -0500] ctracey: it def needs clean up ...no doubt there
[2014-01-13 17:00:16 -0500] mattray: I think salmanbaset's blueprint will be a good start
[2014-01-13 17:00:26 -0500] ctracey: yeah
[2014-01-13 17:00:33 -0500] ctracey: we should probably talk it through
[2014-01-13 17:00:41 -0500] ctracey: it could break a whole lot of folks
[2014-01-13 17:00:46 -0500] mattt: ctracey: very much so
[2014-01-13 17:01:16 -0500] mattray: we're in agreement then, common for node[openstack][mq] and node[openstack][db]  and node[openstack][service][mq] and node[openstack][service][db]
[2014-01-13 17:01:17 -0500] mattt: would this be better suited for icehouse i wonder?
[2014-01-13 17:01:36 -0500] mattray: mattt: nah, Havana's still pretty slushy
[2014-01-13 17:01:47 -0500] mattray: we have lots of big cleanups already in progress
[2014-01-13 17:01:54 -0500] ctracey: pretty sure havana doesnt even work
[2014-01-13 17:02:08 -0500] ctracey: keystone seems borked to me
[2014-01-13 17:02:28 -0500] mrodden: i heard they were having issues with the new keystoneclient-0.4.2
[2014-01-13 17:02:31 -0500] ctracey: well...its an easy fix ;)
[2014-01-13 17:02:31 -0500] mrodden: like
[2014-01-13 17:02:43 -0500] mrodden: horizon is completely broken by it...
[2014-01-13 17:02:45 -0500] ctracey: latest neutronclient is also broked
[2014-01-13 17:02:53 -0500] ctracey: welll...it was
[2014-01-13 17:02:54 -0500] salmanbaset: here is the link to blue print: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+spec/clean-up-attr-for-mq-and-db
[2014-01-13 17:03:07 -0500] mrodden: well don't tell anyone.. but neutronclient is usually borked :)
[2014-01-13 17:03:44 -0500] ctracey: https://ask.openstack.org/en/question/10214/extensionmanager-object-does-not-support-item-assignment/#10277
[2014-01-13 17:03:54 -0500] mrodden: to be fair they have been doing a good job of fixing a lot of their issues lately
[2014-01-13 17:03:56 -0500] ctracey: just dont tell your customers :)
[2014-01-13 17:03:59 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: maybe a little more detail about the work to be done?
[2014-01-13 17:04:00 -0500] mattt: salmanbaset: very good, thank you
[2014-01-13 17:04:16 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: like going through the other cookbooks and moving their attributes out to common?
[2014-01-13 17:04:24 -0500] ctracey: in fairness, that was a change to a pip dependency
[2014-01-13 17:04:35 -0500] mattray: and removing ops-messaging and ops-database's versions of those attributes too?
[2014-01-13 17:05:21 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: just to point out that we're not just adding to openstack-common, we're cleaning up the other cookbooks to support that
[2014-01-13 17:05:31 -0500] mattray: 1 cookbook to rule them all
[2014-01-13 17:05:48 -0500] ctracey: as far as I see it, ops-messaging and ops-database should only stand up those services...nothing more
[2014-01-13 17:06:03 -0500] aspiers: hey Salman :) was interested to talk to you about the dedicated pacemaker recipe per cookbook idea
[2014-01-13 17:06:05 -0500] ctracey: no tentacles into openstack-<service>
[2014-01-13 17:06:16 -0500] mrodden: ctracey: ++
[2014-01-13 17:06:26 -0500] aspiers: salmanbaset: I think I like the idea, but wasn't sure how that would work
[2014-01-13 17:08:00 -0500] mattray: ctracey: I agree. If they're providing reference implementations but other cookbooks need their attributes, put it in common
[2014-01-13 17:08:01 -0500] aspiers: salmanbaset: do you have any published examples?
[2014-01-13 17:08:07 -0500] ctracey: ++
[2014-01-13 17:41:36 -0500] spheromak: if its a namespace in comon that would be great
[2014-01-13 17:42:17 -0500] mrodden: markvan: https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+bug/1268670
[2014-01-13 17:42:31 -0500] spheromak: we moved most of those attribs out and use some methods to populate the node attribs instead.
[2014-01-13 17:42:40 -0500] spheromak: would allow us to expand that maybe
[2014-01-13 18:36:52 -0500] salmanbaset: aspiers: the code is not publically available but here is a paste of pacemaker recipe for openstack-identity: http://paste.openstack.org/show/61137/
[2014-01-13 18:37:40 -0500] salmanbaset: aspiers: it works by stopping and disabling the service, and creating a resource agent for keystone
[2014-01-13 18:38:57 -0500] salmanbaset: mattray: thanks for updating the blueprint
[2014-01-13 18:39:38 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: thanks for getting it started, should be fairly straight-forward

[2014-01-13 19:26:27 -0500] paulczar: anyone around can help me rebase my review ?
[2014-01-13 19:26:30 -0500] paulczar: I fail at the git
[2014-01-13 19:28:37 -0500] galstrom: paulczar: which one.. the one i mentioned this morning?
[2014-01-13 19:30:10 -0500] paulczar: yeah
[2014-01-13 19:30:25 -0500] paulczar: I do rebase very rarely so I never remember quite how to do it
[2014-01-13 19:30:28 -0500] galstrom: paulczar: give me a sec.. looking at it
[2014-01-13 19:30:41 -0500] galstrom: so normal workflow.. would be..
[2014-01-13 19:30:49 -0500] galstrom: git checkout master && git pull
[2014-01-13 19:30:59 -0500] galstrom: git checkout <branch name> && git rebase -i master
[2014-01-13 19:31:05 -0500] galstrom: fixy broken..
[2014-01-13 19:31:24 -0500] galstrom: git add any of the fixed broken files..
[2014-01-13 19:31:27 -0500] galstrom: git commit --amend
[2014-01-13 19:31:29 -0500] galstrom: git review
[2014-01-13 19:31:46 -0500] paulczar: okay cool
[2014-01-13 19:32:36 -0500] galstrom: paulczar: let me know if you run into more trouble..
[2014-01-13 19:32:58 -0500] paulczar: will do    thanks

[2014-01-13 19:48:19 -0500] paulczar: that part seemed to go okay .. but git review is complaining about the change-id
[2014-01-13 19:48:51 -0500] paulczar: oh wait, I think I know why  I based it off a previous review

[2014-01-13 20:01:58 -0500] paulczar: ended up as a new review
[2014-01-13 20:02:47 -0500] openstackgerrit: Paul Czarkowski proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: rubocop compliance  https://review.openstack.org/65013
[2014-01-13 20:04:37 -0500] paulczar: okay that's better
[2014-01-13 20:04:49 -0500] paulczar: openstack is hard,  let's go shopping
[2014-01-13 20:06:45 -0500] ctracey: openstack *is* hard...thats why we are making $$$ doing it :)
[2014-01-13 20:23:42 -0500] mattray: paulczar: here's my workflow: https://gist.github.com/8407393
[2014-01-13 21:11:23 -0500] claco: mattray: which cookbook is the best one to use as the model in terms of .rubocop files and Strainer?  block-storage?
[2014-01-13 21:11:40 -0500] mattray: claco: that's where I started
[2014-01-13 21:11:47 -0500] mattray: alphabetical and all that
[2014-01-13 21:11:58 -0500] claco: also, hi! :-)
[2014-01-13 21:12:00 -0500] mattray: howdy
[2014-01-13 21:13:38 -0500] claco: I'll start tinkering with -identity then
[2014-01-13 21:15:34 -0500] mattray: works for me. I'll stay out of identity for you and object-storage for ctracey
[2014-01-13 21:17:02 -0500] galstrom: claco: i have a bunch of pending reviews against -identity
[2014-01-13 21:17:07 -0500] galstrom: claco: just fyi
[2014-01-13 21:17:22 -0500] mattray: https://review.openstack.org/#/q/status:open+project:stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity,n,z
[2014-01-13 21:17:31 -0500] galstrom: dang.. beat me to it
[2014-01-13 21:18:06 -0500] mattray: and https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+spec/rubocop-for-identity
[2014-01-13 21:18:20 -0500] mattray: claco: maybe image?
[2014-01-13 21:18:38 -0500] paulczar: oh hi claco
[2014-01-13 21:18:54 -0500] claco: lol. image it is. :-)
[2014-01-13 21:19:30 -0500] galstrom: claco: :)
[2014-01-13 21:19:40 -0500] claco: ah...blueprints... that is what I was looking for in the email thread. ty.
[2014-01-13 21:21:38 -0500] claco: also.. if you're doing say... one of these... https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+spec/centos-rhel-for-object
[2014-01-13 21:21:40 -0500] claco: claim them?
[2014-01-13 21:21:55 -0500] claco: crap... I meant the rubo
[2014-01-13 21:51:39 -0500] mattray: man, we need some more core reviewers up in here
[2014-01-13 21:52:12 -0500] mattray: I hate to +2 on top of galstrom already +2ing mine and vice-versa
[2014-01-13 21:53:08 -0500] claco: were we having issues w/ WordArray in attributes? (set to False in rubocop.yml)
[2014-01-13 21:55:17 -0500] claco: was that to keep it from complaining about simple   = ['foo'] attribute values?
[2014-01-13 21:56:40 -0500] mattray: claco: I added an exemption for WordArray in attributes because it's rarely used in other cookbooks
[2014-01-13 21:57:02 -0500] claco: WordArray has a MinSize attribute now, so we could allow [] with <=3, but stop abuse w/ >= 4 elements
[2014-01-13 21:57:03 -0500] mattray: see https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-block-storage/blob/master/attributes/.rubocop.yml
[2014-01-13 21:57:14 -0500] claco: right, that's where I noticed it
[2014-01-13 21:57:23 -0500] mattray: claco: if you want, it makes more sense then
[2014-01-13 21:57:39 -0500] claco: I ask, because I'm the one who added it :-)
[2014-01-13 21:58:02 -0500] mattray: yeah, I think I do that in ops-messaging
[2014-01-13 21:58:26 -0500] mattray: so feel free to update the .rubocop.yml for attributes with that, I'll +1 it
[2014-01-13 21:59:21 -0500] claco: is that a pending update for os-messaging?...still seems tailorish
[2014-01-13 22:00:02 -0500] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-block-storage: Add DB2 support to cinder on redhat platform  https://review.openstack.org/60146

[2014-01-13 22:22:23 -0500] paulczar: claco: mattray:  I find regular arrays more readable than word arrays so I'd be okay with disabling that cop alltogether
[2014-01-13 22:23:16 -0500] mattray: paulczar: I put the exception there because it seemed most cookbooks don't use word arrays, but some do, so why complain?
[2014-01-13 22:23:45 -0500] mattray: paulczar: but yeah, I generally prefer old-fashioned regular arrays
[2014-01-13 22:23:55 -0500] claco: this leads me to:  platform?(%w{ubuntu debian})
[2014-01-13 22:24:14 -0500] claco: I find it less readable than "a", "b"
[2014-01-13 22:24:17 -0500] mattray: claco: yeah yuck
[2014-01-13 22:24:41 -0500] claco: paulczar: yeah, it was disabled. now it's enabled...but for arrays of more than 3
[2014-01-13 22:24:47 -0500] claco: so readable... until abused
[2014-01-13 22:25:03 -0500] galstrom: claco: wasn't that a food critic violation for a while
[2014-01-13 22:25:42 -0500] paulczar: is a rubyist someone who hates ruby programmers ?   if so I'm a rubyist
[2014-01-13 22:25:49 -0500] claco: lol
[2014-01-13 22:26:52 -0500] claco: I thought those were pythonistas
[2014-01-13 22:27:16 -0500] galstrom: claco: wow
[2014-01-13 22:27:50 -0500] claco: what about supports :status => true, :restart => true  for "Use the new Ruby 1.9 hash syntax" cop?
[2014-01-13 22:28:32 -0500] mrodden: i don't agree with rubocop on a lot of things...
[2014-01-13 22:28:39 -0500] mrodden: my 2c
[2014-01-13 22:28:49 -0500] claco: me neither.. just wondering if we've hit consensus yet...
[2014-01-13 22:29:01 -0500] claco: or if this is a missed case this young in the process
[2014-01-13 22:29:17 -0500] mattray: mrodden: claco: I think we're still feeling it out, but deferring to it unless an objection is raised
[2014-01-13 22:29:37 -0500] mrodden: well, rubocop is supposedly a consensus established by ruby programmers
[2014-01-13 22:29:38 -0500] mattray: like claco's refinement of the %w for attributes
[2014-01-13 22:29:56 -0500] mattray: mrodden: and we're our own little enclave of ruby-haters :)
[2014-01-13 22:30:02 -0500] mrodden: well
[2014-01-13 22:30:07 -0500] claco: I nearly always go non 1.9 syntax...due to past knife issues testing using the local 1.8.7 ruby (ubuntu)
[2014-01-13 22:30:07 -0500] mattray: so we can make adjustments
[2014-01-13 22:30:13 -0500] mrodden: our context is more chef cookbooks, not necessarily ruby
[2014-01-13 22:30:17 -0500] claco: but maybe thats not valid any more
[2014-01-13 22:30:41 -0500] mattray: claco: over in our internal Hip Chat we're debating when to drop 1.8.7, it looks like 11.10
[2014-01-13 22:31:06 -0500] mattray: and Ruby 1.9.3 has already got an EOL on the calendar
[2014-01-13 22:31:15 -0500] mrodden: wow
[2014-01-13 22:31:29 -0500] claco: I'm actually good with whatever.. which is nice when everything is rubocopped and done
[2014-01-13 22:31:47 -0500] claco: but I'm sick like that. this is from my perl::critic days
[2014-01-13 22:32:13 -0500] mattray: claco: I'd say keep sticking to rubocop's suggestions and raising the issue here or on the mailing list when you have disagreements
[2014-01-13 22:32:17 -0500] mrodden: with openstack, we have been enabling the rules as people clean up the code
[2014-01-13 22:32:26 -0500] mrodden: but i think nova is almost 100% pep8 compliant
[2014-01-13 22:32:27 -0500] mattray: yeah
[2014-01-13 22:32:49 -0500] mattray: mrodden: we've been slowly cleaning the cookbooks for rubocop and staking out our exceptions
[2014-01-13 22:33:16 -0500] claco: mattray: so, 1.9.3...same goes for has_key? and key?
[2014-01-13 22:33:18 -0500] mattray: I actually think we don't have _that_many exceptions. Line lengths, UTF-8 on metadata, %w for attributes
[2014-01-13 22:33:30 -0500] mattray: claco: whatever is 1.9.3 go for that
[2014-01-13 22:33:38 -0500] claco: will do
[2014-01-13 22:33:40 -0500] claco: thanks
[2014-01-13 22:33:49 -0500] mattray: we put the 1.9.3 stake in the ground a long time ago
[2014-01-13 22:33:56 -0500] mattray: and Chef 11 is another stake
[2014-01-13 22:34:11 -0500] claco: mmmm..... steak.
[2014-01-13 22:35:00 -0500] galstrom: claco: i fixed the has_key? dep in -identity
[2014-01-13 23:06:43 -0500] claco: anyone have any opinion on this?  https://gist.github.com/claco/8409859
[2014-01-13 23:06:54 -0500] claco: is this a leave it until the namespace tweakings?
[2014-01-13 23:07:16 -0500] claco: if you move the require...or on a recipe w/o the require... you get no warning :-
[2014-01-13 23:12:49 -0500] galstrom: claco: i think you can throw a commant above the class line.. and pass the warning.. there is one cookbook that did this.. i think
[2014-01-13 23:12:58 -0500] galstrom: claco: dont remember which one though :(
[2014-01-13 23:14:04 -0500] claco: pragma it is. although a practice ripe for abuse :-/
[2014-01-13 23:19:53 -0500] galstrom: also.. comment* not commant
[2014-01-13 23:54:53 -0500] paulczar: perl::critic ???  is that like a tool that lets you know if your code is too readable ?
[2014-01-13 23:55:27 -0500] paulczar: FAILED - Function is not shaped like an animal
[2014-01-13 23:55:44 -0500] claco: E_GOLD_GAME_TOO_SHORT
[2014-01-13 23:56:07 -0500] claco: F
[2014-01-13 23:57:20 -0500] claco: doing all I can to not use let() syntax in specs as a go along. :-)
