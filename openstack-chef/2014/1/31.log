[2014-01-31 18:17:35 -0500] ctracey: lrr, whats up?
[2014-01-31 18:20:03 -0500] lrr: ctracey: see the pastebin link. this is in a vagrant all-in-one vm
[2014-01-31 18:20:11 -0500] lrr: i can't access the horizon dashboard
[2014-01-31 18:22:13 -0500] ctracey: lrr, what are the permssions on /var/lib/openstack-dashboard ?
[2014-01-31 18:23:15 -0500] lrr: . was horizon:horizon, .. was root:root and the secret key was root:root
[2014-01-31 18:23:22 -0500] lrr: this was after a fresh vagrant up
[2014-01-31 18:23:27 -0500] lrr: using ubuntu
[2014-01-31 18:24:16 -0500] ctracey: lrr, for giggles, just set it 777 temporarily

[2014-01-31 18:24:37 -0500] ctracey: up it?

[2014-01-31 18:25:01 -0500] lrr: ctracey: i had destroyed it trying to do something else
[2014-01-31 18:25:52 -0500] ctracey: well there is a good chance that directory just has bad perms
[2014-01-31 18:30:10 -0500] ctracey: verifying quickly

[2014-01-31 18:38:18 -0500] ctracey: probably wants 600
[2014-01-31 18:39:15 -0500] lrr: what should the perms on the secret key be?
[2014-01-31 18:39:33 -0500] lrr: i just tried to set it to 600, but i get a permission denied error in the apache log
[2014-01-31 19:02:53 -0500] ctracey: lrr, i suppose you are running apache as www-data?
[2014-01-31 19:25:20 -0500] lrr: ctracey: yeah. I'll have to get back with you later on the debugging. in it off my office for a few days.
[2014-01-31 19:25:30 -0500] lrr: thanks for the help though. :)
