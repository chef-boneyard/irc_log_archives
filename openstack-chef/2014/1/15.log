[2014-01-15 01:02:00 -0500] claco: galstrom: do blueprints close automatically? mine didn't. And I set if to "implemented", which closed it. All kinds of "whoops" for me in that.
[2014-01-15 01:02:18 -0500] galstrom: haha
[2014-01-15 01:02:26 -0500] galstrom: yeah.. i am not sure that they close automatically
[2014-01-15 01:02:38 -0500] galstrom: you could try "Implements: bug ###" that might close it
[2014-01-15 01:02:42 -0500] galstrom: dont really know
[2014-01-15 01:03:19 -0500] claco: when in doubt, delegate to original developer. :-)
[2014-01-15 01:05:56 -0500] galstrom: :)
[2014-01-15 01:06:09 -0500] galstrom: actually i think you setting it to implemented is fine
[2014-01-15 01:06:23 -0500] galstrom: it is no longer in the list of open bps so .. good?
[2014-01-15 01:07:09 -0500] claco: I'd think so since it merged. Buuut.. I could understand also wanting the bp author or reviewer doing it too.
[2014-01-15 01:07:46 -0500] claco: since we're low on those.. maybe dev after merge is ok.
[2014-01-15 01:15:48 -0500] galstrom: we should change https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GetOpenStack to point to stackforge instead of mattrays personal account..

[2014-01-15 16:16:53 -0500] mattray: I'm looking for something that quickly spins up a bunch of nodes, does some work and then finishes
[2014-01-15 16:17:06 -0500] galstrom: mattray: um.. our sales peoples might.. ill go check
[2014-01-15 16:17:13 -0500] mattray: thinking hadoop will make a compelling demo
[2014-01-15 16:17:22 -0500] claco: galstrom: ?
[2014-01-15 16:17:26 -0500] galstrom: mattray: actually if they have something.. it probably is not what you are looking for though.. now that i think about it
[2014-01-15 16:17:37 -0500] galstrom: claco: fixing the wiki
[2014-01-15 16:17:47 -0500] claco: galstrom: wasn't me ?

[2014-01-15 16:19:14 -0500] claco: mattray: ...and vim... and git.... and rspec....and.....
[2014-01-15 16:24:19 -0500] paulczar: mattray: demo with hadoop???  everyone knows if you're doing a cloud demo it has to be wordpress
[2014-01-15 16:24:38 -0500] mattray: paulczar: because I need 10 instances?

[2014-01-15 18:22:23 -0500] galstrom: andymccr: on those get_password changes, do you know the order they are going to need to merge in?
[2014-01-15 18:22:56 -0500] galstrom: or do we need to add the get_password routine first, without deleting the others..
[2014-01-15 18:23:24 -0500] galstrom: then migrate all cookbooks onto the get_password routine.. then delete the *_password methods once they are no longer used?
[2014-01-15 18:23:25 -0500] andymccr: galstrom: we will kinda need to do all together, since without common the others won't work, and if you change common the others won't work
[2014-01-15 18:23:32 -0500] andymccr: maybe thats sensible
[2014-01-15 18:23:34 -0500] andymccr: ok

[2014-01-15 18:23:47 -0500] andymccr: that will work

[2014-01-15 18:23:49 -0500] galstrom: yay
[2014-01-15 18:23:55 -0500] andymccr: we can change common to just include get_password
[2014-01-15 18:24:04 -0500] andymccr: then once everything is merged we remove the older ones
[2014-01-15 18:24:17 -0500] galstrom: yeah.. i am trying to think if there is another way..
[2014-01-15 18:24:21 -0500] andymccr: i dont thinkso
[2014-01-15 18:24:27 -0500] galstrom: yeah.. me either
[2014-01-15 18:24:35 -0500] galstrom: pain in the butt.. but what can you do

[2014-01-15 19:19:34 -0500] mattray: galstrom: claco: paulczar: this seems to work for a single rubocop file called once: https://gist.github.com/8442539
[2014-01-15 19:20:09 -0500] mattray: that seems preferable to multiple files and multiple calls in the strainerfile
[2014-01-15 19:20:32 -0500] galstrom: mattray: i'd buy that
[2014-01-15 19:20:33 -0500] claco: +5
[2014-01-15 19:20:46 -0500] claco: so, time to go back to yesterday and start again. :-)
[2014-01-15 19:20:56 -0500] galstrom: mattray: so the 3 cops below the allcops line only apply to the two excludes?
[2014-01-15 19:21:24 -0500] mattray: no, the allcops is a set of what to include, those get applied to everything
[2014-01-15 19:21:40 -0500] mattray: I mean, those rules are global
[2014-01-15 19:21:58 -0500] galstrom: ah.. so that will make rubocop not run against the excludes?
[2014-01-15 19:22:09 -0500] galstrom: so not rubocoping against recipes and specs
[2014-01-15 19:22:54 -0500] claco: and we should add providers/recipes/libraries to that... or will cop error out?
[2014-01-15 19:23:52 -0500] mattray: claco: the cookbook I'm on doesn't have those, so I didn't add them
[2014-01-15 19:24:06 -0500] mattray: right now it's just checking 3 files, metadata.rb Gemfile and attributes/default.rb
[2014-01-15 19:24:21 -0500] claco: I guess my q was, can we have the same file across all cookbooks when we do this?
[2014-01-15 19:24:24 -0500] mattray: yes
[2014-01-15 19:24:27 -0500] mattray: that's the goal

[2014-01-15 19:26:39 -0500] ctracey: probably write a wrapper cookbook soon

[2014-01-15 19:27:10 -0500] ctracey: spheromak: it incorporates what we talked about

[2014-01-15 19:27:33 -0500] ctracey: that venv comes from the manifest you provide

[2014-01-15 19:30:02 -0500] mattray: claco: haven't fixed them yet
[2014-01-15 19:30:06 -0500] mattray: bite-sized commits
[2014-01-15 19:30:09 -0500] claco: oh
[2014-01-15 19:30:21 -0500] galstrom: ctracey: you have to roll your own initscripts for that deb?
[2014-01-15 19:30:45 -0500] ctracey: yessir
[2014-01-15 19:30:51 -0500] galstrom: um..
[2014-01-15 19:30:57 -0500] ctracey: this is where the wrapper cookbook comes in
[2014-01-15 19:31:08 -0500] galstrom: fair enough
[2014-01-15 19:31:14 -0500] ctracey: same model as chef-client
[2014-01-15 19:31:31 -0500] galstrom: yeah.. git-buildpackage
[2014-01-15 19:31:33 -0500] galstrom: got it
[2014-01-15 19:31:55 -0500] claco: mattray: galstrom: I'm going to finish the patchsets for dashboard the old way. after that, if we're thing this one format will do it, I'll hit dashboard and image again. Cool?
[2014-01-15 19:32:15 -0500] mattray: claco: fine by me
[2014-01-15 19:32:25 -0500] galstrom: cool
[2014-01-15 19:32:30 -0500] claco: "the easy part" .. :-)
[2014-01-15 19:32:40 -0500] spheromak: yea galstrom ideally we could use this inplace of package/source install and make it compat with the cooks
[2014-01-15 19:32:43 -0500] mattray: I just put in a new ops-messaging review, going to do reviews, then go back to cleanup on block-storage
[2014-01-15 19:33:01 -0500] spheromak: adding 1 extra cook for handling the init and bits that might be in source/package installs
[2014-01-15 19:33:12 -0500] galstrom: spheromak: yeah.. i get the install from git part..
[2014-01-15 19:33:27 -0500] galstrom: i am just a bit confused by the git-buildpackage part..
[2014-01-15 19:33:48 -0500] galstrom: seems putting the whole damn process in a chef-recipe would be preferable?
[2014-01-15 19:34:04 -0500] galstrom: git checkout repo/sha.. drop init scripts.. etc
[2014-01-15 19:34:06 -0500] spheromak: this is building an omin package tho
[2014-01-15 19:34:18 -0500] spheromak: like in my situation. I can't clone from outside git repos
[2014-01-15 19:34:21 -0500] spheromak: no access
[2014-01-15 19:34:25 -0500] galstrom: ah..
[2014-01-15 19:34:28 -0500] spheromak: and I also have internal projects/patches
[2014-01-15 19:34:42 -0500] spheromak: so I need to build a compiled thing (right now debs for each ostack component)
[2014-01-15 19:34:58 -0500] galstrom: spheromak: so how do you get the code into your internal repo? you have to be pulling in from outside/upstream
[2014-01-15 19:35:00 -0500] galstrom: right?
[2014-01-15 19:35:17 -0500] spheromak: but managing the ubu python  packages and deps and shit is just super lame. Also it can shift. Omni package ensures what we test is what gets delviered until we deliver the next rev
[2014-01-15 19:35:24 -0500] spheromak: galstrom: no we build it
[2014-01-15 19:35:27 -0500] spheromak: we build packages.
[2014-01-15 19:35:36 -0500] galstrom: ok
[2014-01-15 19:35:38 -0500] spheromak: and deploy thing via nexus proxies
[2014-01-15 19:35:52 -0500] spheromak: *them
[2014-01-15 19:36:11 -0500] spheromak: problems we have hit with that  is that the OS packages may or may not change ;)
[2014-01-15 19:36:20 -0500] galstrom: :)
[2014-01-15 19:36:26 -0500] spheromak: and with every python dep being a package. It quickly gets into some dep hell.
[2014-01-15 19:36:40 -0500] galstrom: true..
[2014-01-15 19:36:43 -0500] spheromak: and I would like to not have to deploy ubu on all Cnodes
[2014-01-15 19:36:49 -0500] galstrom: although pip is not exactly a better dep hell
[2014-01-15 19:37:11 -0500] spheromak: galstrom: no but it's static
[2014-01-15 19:37:14 -0500] galstrom: yeah.. i see where you are going
[2014-01-15 19:37:17 -0500] spheromak: when it's in the omnipackage
[2014-01-15 19:37:20 -0500] galstrom: static-ish
[2014-01-15 19:37:41 -0500] spheromak: static cause no one will open it up
[2014-01-15 19:37:42 -0500] galstrom: pip blows me up more that package deps.. but i get what you are sayihng
[2014-01-15 19:37:48 -0500] spheromak: it ensures that what we test is what gets deployed
[2014-01-15 19:38:10 -0500] galstrom: that is a fair point
[2014-01-15 19:38:21 -0500] spheromak: i have a giant fence
[2014-01-15 19:38:26 -0500] spheromak: and I have to toss everyhthing over it
[2014-01-15 19:38:28 -0500] spheromak: ;)
[2014-01-15 19:38:37 -0500] galstrom: sounds like fun
[2014-01-15 19:39:00 -0500] spheromak: on the other side i have no controll really of anything other than what we toss(which now is the entire chef repo, but yea)
[2014-01-15 19:39:33 -0500] spheromak: anyhow so yep full waterfall fun ;)
[2014-01-15 19:39:46 -0500] galstrom: i was just figuring that location had access to your internal git repo..
[2014-01-15 19:39:51 -0500] galstrom: but it makes more sense now
[2014-01-15 19:39:51 -0500] spheromak: nope
[2014-01-15 19:39:58 -0500] spheromak: internal IT
[2014-01-15 19:40:03 -0500] spheromak: we do 2 diff clouds
[2014-01-15 19:40:04 -0500] spheromak: ;)
[2014-01-15 19:40:14 -0500] galstrom: yay team
[2014-01-15 19:40:18 -0500] spheromak: KT doesn't trust it's own public cloud enough to deploy their own shit on it
[2014-01-15 19:40:25 -0500] spheromak: theres lolz all around
[2014-01-15 19:40:30 -0500] galstrom: haha
[2014-01-15 19:44:33 -0500] spheromak: granted thats the cloudstack cloud ;)

[2014-01-15 20:04:52 -0500] claco: Query: Why do we exclude the utf8 comment from some files but not others?
[2014-01-15 20:05:16 -0500] claco: like, not in Gemfile, not in meta... but in recipes.. in specs...
[2014-01-15 20:05:45 -0500] claco: is it anything with a .rb as the rule?
[2014-01-15 20:08:17 -0500] mattray: claco: hmm I'd meant to exclude it for just metadata.rb and Gemfile, since those don't generally have it
[2014-01-15 20:08:23 -0500] mattray: and leave it in for the rest
[2014-01-15 20:08:49 -0500] claco: I'm wonky. I usuall have the ending and the ruby hint (damn you vim!)
[2014-01-15 20:09:08 -0500] claco: I was just doing the specs... and wondering if I'd mistakenly done the wrong thing in image as well
[2014-01-15 20:09:16 -0500] claco: seems like I did the right thing :-)
[2014-01-15 20:09:44 -0500] claco: sigh. usually...encoding...
[2014-01-15 20:09:50 -0500] claco: I need to hire someone to type for me.
[2014-01-15 20:10:26 -0500] claco: does DRAGON for OSX do code? :-)
[2014-01-15 20:17:19 -0500] mattray: I used to work with a blind guy, his text-to-speech reader was amazing
[2014-01-15 20:17:26 -0500] mattray: listening to it read Perl out loud
[2014-01-15 20:17:57 -0500] mattray: he still had to type though
[2014-01-15 20:18:09 -0500] claco: "shebang user bin perl. use strict colon.  sir why r u doing this to me? this is cruel."...
[2014-01-15 20:23:47 -0500] mattray: exactly

[2014-01-15 20:32:20 -0500] ctracey: shebang? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TS5tvbYJsc
[2014-01-15 20:32:37 -0500] claco: do not goole.
[2014-01-15 20:32:40 -0500] claco: google
[2014-01-15 20:34:08 -0500] ctracey: or goole for that matter
[2014-01-15 20:41:52 -0500] paulczar: claco: mattray:  I kinda think we should just require all our ruby files to have the shebang regardless
[2014-01-15 20:42:43 -0500] paulczar: sigh  that's what I get for reading ctracey's text as I'm writing my reply to mattray
[2014-01-15 20:44:28 -0500] mattray: claco: paulczar: galstrom: gonna take out the Encoding exception in the .rubocop.yml, might as well
[2014-01-15 20:44:40 -0500] mattray: probably never think about it again
[2014-01-15 20:45:40 -0500] ctracey: paulczar, ?
[2014-01-15 20:46:10 -0500] paulczar: nvm
[2014-01-15 20:47:14 -0500] claco: mattray: add it to the list of doesn't matter I was just curious :-)
[2014-01-15 20:47:53 -0500] mattray: claco: well, I figure we'll fix it to make the rubocop.yml as small as possible and probably never care that UTF-8 was added one way or another
[2014-01-15 20:48:38 -0500] claco: that's a 1.9 ism right? that's un necessary in a post 2.x world I think as it defaults to utf8.
[2014-01-15 20:48:44 -0500] claco: I could be way off on that one
[2014-01-15 20:49:52 -0500] claco: "The UTF-8 default encoding, which make many magic comments omissible"
[2014-01-15 20:49:56 -0500] claco: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/
[2014-01-15 20:50:05 -0500] claco: so in the end, rubocop will full circle us :-)
[2014-01-15 20:51:11 -0500] paulczar: so should we just disable the cop for everything then ?
[2014-01-15 20:51:46 -0500] paulczar: and sit on it
[2014-01-15 20:52:32 -0500] claco: well, depends. do we have any utf8 strings in our stuff? :-)
[2014-01-15 20:54:07 -0500] claco: yeah, that cop skips on ruby >=2.x
[2014-01-15 20:54:16 -0500] claco: https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/blob/master/lib/rubocop/cop/style/encoding.rb#L10
[2014-01-15 20:54:53 -0500] claco: so having them in the future won't hurt, and I assume rubo won't gripe.

[2014-01-15 21:07:33 -0500] mattray: and we'll probably go to Ruby 2.0 next year
[2014-01-15 21:07:44 -0500] mattray: or Chef 12, whatever's first
[2014-01-15 21:08:52 -0500] claco: mattray: welcome to the game. :-)
[2014-01-15 21:09:52 -0500] claco: and the race to rebase begins
[2014-01-15 21:15:10 -0500] mattt: mattray: hey matt, regarding https://review.openstack.org/#/c/66873/ -- i was planning on making all the db changes and then mq, which is why those mq ones have remained untouched -- do you think i should just do everything in one go ?
[2014-01-15 21:16:08 -0500] mattray: mattt: multiple reviews are fine if you prefer, just keep pinging people for reviews to move it fast
[2014-01-15 21:16:57 -0500] claco: this will be our first WirdArray quandry:  https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-dashboard/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L59
[2014-01-15 21:17:08 -0500] mattray: I think after that and the rubocop changes, it might be time to start versioning these
[2014-01-15 21:17:09 -0500] claco: it has 4. now I'm changing just one line in the block. loool.
[2014-01-15 21:17:41 -0500] mattt: mattray: i was trying to minimize breakage, but maybe i'll just put all the attribute chagnes into that one review
[2014-01-15 21:17:53 -0500] mattray: mattt: either way works for me
[2014-01-15 21:17:54 -0500] claco: Maybe I need to add an option to WordArray that accepts one line arrays regardless of the len... then hate multi line

[2014-01-15 21:47:00 -0500] claco: so back to the encoding comments.. we're in 1.9.3. I vote drop them in all ruby files (even Gemfile, meta, etc) because it's correct. No harm in them sticking around in 2.x future.
[2014-01-15 21:47:04 -0500] claco: ctracey: --fix
