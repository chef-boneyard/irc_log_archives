[2014-01-14 03:21:14 -0500] ctracey: so  youre doing rubocop for glance?
[2014-01-14 03:21:53 -0500] claco: git-review... is it Addresses:, or Implements: for blueprint tagging?
[2014-01-14 03:24:39 -0500] ctracey: it is Implements
[2014-01-14 03:24:48 -0500] ctracey: specifically...
[2014-01-14 03:24:58 -0500] ctracey: Implements: blueprint blahblahblah

[2014-01-14 03:26:19 -0500] claco: don't be coy. which is it.
[2014-01-14 03:26:21 -0500] claco: just tell me.
[2014-01-14 03:26:23 -0500] claco: :-)
[2014-01-14 03:29:20 -0500] claco: also, in TESTING.md.. we say:  bundle exec berks install --path=.cookbooks

[2014-01-14 16:41:23 -0500] mattray: greetings
[2014-01-14 16:47:44 -0500] mattt: mattray: apologies, just spammed you regarding that attribute blueprint
[2014-01-14 16:48:52 -0500] mattray: mattt: that sounds legit, moving stuff to node[openstack][mq][service]
[2014-01-14 16:49:07 -0500] mattray: to sync with node[openstack][db][service]
[2014-01-14 16:49:34 -0500] paulczar: mattray: your review on my openstack-network review   you want me to change anything on it before merging ?   figure any rubocop changes to what I did could be done after the review.
[2014-01-14 16:49:40 -0500] mattt: mattray: ok, just wanted to be sure -- otherwise moving namespace to node[openstack][SERVICE][mq] / node[openstack][SERVICE][db] would be a pretty deep-rooted change
[2014-01-14 16:50:26 -0500] mattray: paulczar: did you follow what I was saying about having multiple .rubocop.yml files?
[2014-01-14 16:50:46 -0500] mattray: so possibly the base rubocop.yml may need changing
[2014-01-14 16:50:55 -0500] mattray: since it's just for metadata.rb and Gemfile
[2014-01-14 16:51:06 -0500] mattray: unless there's a way in the .rubocop.yml to specify directories?
[2014-01-14 16:51:50 -0500] mattray: mattt: I agree with node[openstack][mq][service] and node[openstack][db][service]
[2014-01-14 16:52:01 -0500] paulczar: you can specify to Include/Exclude specific files/dirs
[2014-01-14 16:52:24 -0500] mattray: paulczar: that would be worthwhile, reduce the number of .rubocop.yml files right?
[2014-01-14 16:52:45 -0500] paulczar: ya - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/65013/2/.rubocop.yml
[2014-01-14 16:53:07 -0500] paulczar: the AllCops:\n  Includes: at the start of that
[2014-01-14 16:53:47 -0500] paulczar: and then you can turn specific cops off in the files themselves with # comments  for one-offs
[2014-01-14 16:54:55 -0500] mattray: mattt: wait
[2014-01-14 16:55:05 -0500] mattt: mattray: k
[2014-01-14 16:55:28 -0500] mattray: mattt: right now db is node[openstack][db][service] and mq is node[openstack][service][mq]?
[2014-01-14 16:56:29 -0500] mattt: mattray: sorta
[2014-01-14 16:56:46 -0500] mattt: mattray: node[openstack][SERVICE][mq][qpid], and node[openstack][SERVICE][rabbit]
[2014-01-14 16:57:04 -0500] mattray: mattt: ugh
[2014-01-14 16:57:11 -0500] mattray: and what's going on in the db space?
[2014-01-14 16:57:25 -0500] mattt: db space is correct, except for one attribute in each cookbook (username)
[2014-01-14 16:57:41 -0500] mattt: (ie. default["openstack"]["compute"]["db"]["username"])
[2014-01-14 16:58:17 -0500] mattt: mattray: so we're mainly wrangling the mq attributes
[2014-01-14 16:58:24 -0500] mattray: mattt: common has os.db.service
[2014-01-14 16:58:40 -0500] mattt: yeah, which i would imagine is correct for a common cookbook
[2014-01-14 16:59:08 -0500] mattray: and messaging has os.service.rabbit
[2014-01-14 16:59:15 -0500] mattray: shit
[2014-01-14 16:59:24 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: you around?
[2014-01-14 16:59:32 -0500] mattray: clearly we want consistent usage
[2014-01-14 16:59:56 -0500] mattt: openstack.service.mq makes no sense
[2014-01-14 17:00:08 -0500] mattt: unless those attributes are going to remain in service cookbooks
[2014-01-14 17:00:18 -0500] mattray: mattt: it kinda does, you're saying I want the openstack compute MQ settings
[2014-01-14 17:00:33 -0500] mattray: which may be different from the global openstack MQ settings
[2014-01-14 17:00:50 -0500] mattt: global would be openstack.mq, service-specific would be openstack.mq.service
[2014-01-14 17:00:50 -0500] mattray: but I could argue that either way
[2014-01-14 17:00:55 -0500] mattray: right
[2014-01-14 17:01:08 -0500] mattt: mattray: yeah, it's not entirely clear, which is why i figured i better get clarification :)
[2014-01-14 17:01:09 -0500] mattray: we just need to be consistent across mq and db
[2014-01-14 17:01:22 -0500] mattray: and I think I prefer os.mq.service os.db.service
[2014-01-14 17:01:43 -0500] openstackgerrit: Luis A. Garcia proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-block-storage: Add Storwize/SVC configuration attributes  https://review.openstack.org/66088
[2014-01-14 17:01:44 -0500] mattray: and os.mq.rabbit and os.mq.qpid and os.db.mysql
[2014-01-14 17:01:44 -0500] mattt: mattray: the reason i actually questioned this ... i was wondering what the benefit of moving openstack.service.mq under common cookbook
[2014-01-14 17:02:05 -0500] mattray: mattt: the #1 benefit is we only define those attributes in 1 place
[2014-01-14 17:02:07 -0500] mattt: mattray: i was trying to find a reasoning when i noticed that db was namespaced differently
[2014-01-14 17:02:29 -0500] mattray: right now (inconsistent) attributes are sprinkled between common, messaging and the service cookbooks
[2014-01-14 17:02:50 -0500] mattt: i guess, since the attributes are actually pertaining to a common service
[2014-01-14 17:02:54 -0500] mattray: and since ops-messaging and ops-database are "reference", they shouldn't hold attributes other cookbooks expect
[2014-01-14 17:03:13 -0500] mattt: mattray: yeah, that makes sense i think :)
[2014-01-14 17:03:15 -0500] mattray: so I'm going to take another whack at re-writing the blueprint
[2014-01-14 17:03:20 -0500] mattray: everything in common
[2014-01-14 17:03:28 -0500] mattray: os.mq.service
[2014-01-14 17:03:35 -0500] mattray: os.mq.rabbit|qpid
[2014-01-14 17:03:38 -0500] mattt: mattray: ignore those work items, i'll update those as the blueprint itself is updated
[2014-01-14 17:04:03 -0500] mattray: I feel a long email coming on :/
[2014-01-14 17:04:36 -0500] mattray: and there should be nothing on os.mq. except rabbit or qpid and service
[2014-01-14 17:04:45 -0500] mattray: and under service you should have rabbit or qpid
[2014-01-14 17:05:05 -0500] mattray: so node[openstack][mq][compute][rabbit][host] if you're so inclined
[2014-01-14 17:06:11 -0500] mattray: and you'd almost never hard-code "rabbit", you'd just get the value of ["openstack"]["mq"]["service_type"]
[2014-01-14 17:06:51 -0500] mattt: mattray: but there are different attributes for qpid that wouldn't be applicable to rabbit
[2014-01-14 17:06:56 -0500] mattray: right
[2014-01-14 17:07:05 -0500] mattray: but we don't want to muddy the namespace
[2014-01-14 17:07:06 -0500] mattt: so not sure you can abstract rabbit/qpid w/ service_type
[2014-01-14 17:07:29 -0500] mattray: well, we check the service_type before calling deeper into the hash
[2014-01-14 17:07:57 -0500] mattt: mattray: k
[2014-01-14 17:08:23 -0500] mattray: things like node[openstack][mq][host] might not even make sense for some hypothetical implementations of an mq
[2014-01-14 17:08:44 -0500] mattray: so push those into the namespace of the implementation
[2014-01-14 17:08:49 -0500] mattray: same with db
[2014-01-14 17:09:25 -0500] mattray: mattt: I feel like I'm causing work, but it's a mess right now
[2014-01-14 17:09:42 -0500] mattt: mattray: yeah, i'd rather it get done once and correctly
[2014-01-14 17:09:55 -0500] mattt: mattray: actually just jetting from the office now, i'll be back online later and will check if the blueprint is updated
[2014-01-14 17:10:10 -0500] mattray: ok, I'll update the blueprint and start an ML thread
[2014-01-14 17:10:36 -0500] mattt: mattray: excellent, thanks matt

[2014-01-14 18:58:12 -0500] salmanbaset: as you mentioned, this will be done in two steps: (1) first move all attributes to common

[2014-01-14 19:38:28 -0500] mattray: claco: sure, getting around to reviews shortly
[2014-01-14 19:40:27 -0500] claco: minor nit. please please please everyone assign the blueprint or Implements: blueprint n so I know you have outstanding work in the queue. :-) ty.
[2014-01-14 19:42:22 -0500] mattray: claco: galstrom's explanation to me was that Implements closes out the blueprint and Addresses leaves it open
[2014-01-14 19:42:47 -0500] mattray: claco: also, https://review.openstack.org/#/c/66492/ needs to be re-based
[2014-01-14 19:42:58 -0500] mattray: my earlier rubocop patch already went in
[2014-01-14 19:43:35 -0500] claco: if Addresses is it, that's fine. Kinda sucks it's not updating the blueprint.
[2014-01-14 19:44:10 -0500] claco: actually.. no assigns, or is github playing coy?  https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image/commit/19e2e1f2538f0c96a9cff9a21d250911ad785ab1
[2014-01-14 19:44:41 -0500] claco: mattray: yes, this was my issue. I did  not know about the outstanding work as no one claimg the blueprint, and it had no traffic from queued reviews.
[2014-01-14 19:44:46 -0500] claco: and you suggested it. :-)
[2014-01-14 19:44:49 -0500] mattray: claco: I think I wrote that one before galstrom had added the blueprints
[2014-01-14 19:45:02 -0500] mattray: we discussed whether to go back and update the commit messages and decided not to
[2014-01-14 19:45:07 -0500] claco: Great! Now I can blame him! This makes me happy. :-P
[2014-01-14 19:45:09 -0500] mattray: turns out we should have

[2014-01-14 19:46:21 -0500] mattray: and it looks like you and galstrom are on the same code :/
[2014-01-14 19:46:50 -0500] claco: sigh.
[2014-01-14 19:46:51 -0500] mattray: aren't you in the same (virtual) office?
[2014-01-14 19:47:01 -0500] claco: like 4 cubes over.
[2014-01-14 19:47:33 -0500] mattray: ok, I'm not currently working on anything. I'm going to go do reviews then look around for rubocop cleanups
[2014-01-14 19:47:50 -0500] mattray: stake something out :)
[2014-01-14 19:48:07 -0500] claco: I did. I took the blueprint. lol.  silly me! :-)
[2014-01-14 19:48:08 -0500] mattray: because I want to push another big batch this afternoon, then work on spiceweasel
[2014-01-14 19:48:24 -0500] claco: I call shenanigans!
[2014-01-14 20:17:07 -0500] claco: mattray: also, when I forget to do said things 3 times in the next month, feel free to send me a box of coal. :-)
[2014-01-14 20:20:40 -0500] openstackgerrit: Christopher H. Laco proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image: Implement Rubocop  https://review.openstack.org/66492
[2014-01-14 20:39:37 -0500] paulczar: yo claco   did you mean to update Berksfile.lock ? https://review.openstack.org/#/c/66492/2/Berksfile.lock ?
[2014-01-14 20:41:12 -0500] claco: Well, bundler did. Since it's not gitignored, I assumed that was the intent.
[2014-01-14 20:41:34 -0500] claco: aka, berks < 3 doesn't honor it...
[2014-01-14 20:42:09 -0500] claco: and we lock no versions in Berksfile itself
[2014-01-14 20:42:12 -0500] paulczar: blerg,  I really dislike the multiple runs of Rubocop with multiple Rubocop configs    I wish we could come up with a single set of rules for the whole cookbook
[2014-01-14 20:42:14 -0500] claco: should I roll it back?
[2014-01-14 20:42:31 -0500] claco: paulczar: +1
[2014-01-14 20:42:33 -0500] paulczar: mostly concerned about the mysql update
[2014-01-14 20:42:58 -0500] claco: paulczar: s/bundler/berks/
[2014-01-14 20:43:47 -0500] paulczar: i thought berks only updated .lock if you do a berks update vs berks install ?
[2014-01-14 20:43:56 -0500] paulczar: but I'm occasionally an idiot so I could be wrong
[2014-01-14 20:44:24 -0500] claco: I was just in this... https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image/blob/master/TESTING.md
[2014-01-14 20:44:30 -0500] claco: $ bundle exec berks install --path=.cookbooks # install cookbook dependencies
[2014-01-14 20:44:39 -0500] claco: I can certainly roll it back.
[2014-01-14 20:45:00 -0500] claco: but the issue stands... the lock is ignored by berks until v3, and it's not git ignored... so it's really a free for all right?
[2014-01-14 20:45:23 -0500] paulczar: *shrug* doesn't bother me just saw it as a potential thing    I think I've been pinged for doing it before ( but that could have been a different project )
[2014-01-14 20:45:41 -0500] claco: no, good catch and a valid q.
[2014-01-14 20:45:42 -0500] paulczar: mattray or someone can speak up if its a thing
[2014-01-14 20:45:59 -0500] paulczar: otherwise leave it be    I like to live dangerously
[2014-01-14 20:46:07 -0500] claco: ha
[2014-01-14 20:46:42 -0500] paulczar: gotta run,  will keep reviewing later
[2014-01-14 20:46:56 -0500] paulczar: we should separate these into a few runs to make it easier for reviews
[2014-01-14 20:47:04 -0500] paulczar: I did the same with networking and it was a nightmare for people
[2014-01-14 20:47:35 -0500] paulczar: +rubocop,  then fix " to '  then see how bad it is after that for final review or two
[2014-01-14 20:47:39 -0500] claco: yeah, noted for the next one. seems like people are doing it by topic (recipes, specs, etc)
[2014-01-14 20:47:55 -0500] claco: but I was on a roll :-)
[2014-01-14 20:52:49 -0500] mattray: paulczar: I thought you said earlier we could consolidate the .rubocop.ymls into a single file. That's why there are multiple runs
[2014-01-14 20:54:23 -0500] claco: seems like the differences are minor enough that we should just block pragma then in Gemfile/metadata and leave the others the same?
[2014-01-14 21:16:23 -0500] paulczar: yeah.   we can just have the single .rubocop.yml     include the extra files into it  then for Gemfile/metadata we can use this in the first line or two '# rubocop:disable LineLength'
[2014-01-14 21:20:25 -0500] paulczar: claco: were the privates in image.rb called out by a cop ?
[2014-01-14 21:29:25 -0500] claco: paulczar: spacing (above/below), yes...and once you change that.. no reason to label every one of them
[2014-01-14 21:29:54 -0500] claco: its implied they all are after the first private..unless you do another label
[2014-01-14 21:30:01 -0500] paulczar: cool
[2014-01-14 21:30:19 -0500] paulczar: got through it .  wasn't too bad, was mostly strings and spaces
[2014-01-14 21:30:36 -0500] claco: ', ", =>, oh my!
[2014-01-14 21:31:19 -0500] openstackgerrit: Matt Ray proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: Rubocop support for attributes.  https://review.openstack.org/66083
[2014-01-14 21:31:42 -0500] claco: paulczar: re chef::recipe::openstack...
[2014-01-14 21:32:13 -0500] claco: won't that just go away with a namespace refactor?... like just have a library that has the code in it in that namespace?
[2014-01-14 21:32:25 -0500] claco: I remember seeing the disussion somewhere, but I need to revisit it
[2014-01-14 21:33:29 -0500] paulczar: oh yeah that's probably true
[2014-01-14 21:34:14 -0500] claco: yeah... from the email threads.. #3... https://gist.github.com/spheromak/7875456
[2014-01-14 21:34:18 -0500] claco: seems the top vote
[2014-01-14 21:34:32 -0500] claco: so then the include goes away
[2014-01-14 21:35:35 -0500] mattt: claco: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+spec/clean-up-attr-for-mq-and-db ?

[2014-01-14 21:36:32 -0500] claco: mattt: no, https://gist.github.com/spheromak/7875456 .... for cleaning up the namespaceing of the recipe include
[2014-01-14 21:38:03 -0500] paulczar: hey claco  you used the knife rackspace plugin much ?
[2014-01-14 21:39:18 -0500] claco: paulczar: not in quite a while
[2014-01-14 21:39:31 -0500] mattt: paulczar: i've used it a tad
[2014-01-14 21:41:41 -0500] paulczar: meh,  never mind I was just having a blonde moment
[2014-01-14 21:42:48 -0500] claco: ha
[2014-01-14 21:55:14 -0500] claco: now that the newer chefspec has Cachier, any reason not to clean up the specs to make them more Rspec/let style? (totally not important right now)
[2014-01-14 22:02:56 -0500] spheromak: claco: Someone actially has to do that work tho :|
[2014-01-14 22:03:16 -0500] spheromak: I need to make my work allow me to work on it otherwise I won't get it done
[2014-01-14 22:03:17 -0500] claco: I'm ok with that.
[2014-01-14 22:04:04 -0500] claco: my non rack life is/was ruby, rails, rspec. I'm ok with the mundane make-it-consistenteries as long as we have decision concensus.
[2014-01-14 22:04:26 -0500] spheromak: think there was only a few that replied on thread
[2014-01-14 22:05:07 -0500] spheromak: def namespacing should get done, and I am not really partial to any of the 3 aproaches myself.
[2014-01-14 22:06:07 -0500] spheromak: I guess i am cause in my own chef stuffs I tend to run the singleton route. (ex1)
[2014-01-14 22:06:35 -0500] spheromak: I think #2 is more readable
[2014-01-14 22:06:39 -0500] spheromak: in recipe space
[2014-01-14 22:07:02 -0500] spheromak: but #3 is how it is exampled in chef docs
[2014-01-14 22:08:09 -0500] spheromak: as long as we stop mixing into Chef::Recipe  I am happy ;)
[2014-01-14 22:09:15 -0500] mattray: spheromak: I think there's enough buy-in for it
[2014-01-14 22:09:20 -0500] spheromak: yea for sure
[2014-01-14 22:09:24 -0500] spheromak: It's time/work
[2014-01-14 22:09:37 -0500] spheromak: I planned on doing it, but I got other #dayjob stuff in the way right now

[2014-01-14 22:20:21 -0500] paulczar: is there a way to just look at the diffs between two patch sets rather than re-reviewing the whole thing ?
[2014-01-14 22:22:41 -0500] mgagne: paulczar: Old Version History: Select previous patch set instead of Base.
[2014-01-14 22:23:54 -0500] mgagne: paulczar: hopefully, patch set didn't get rebased on master otherwise you will get diff from both change itself and rebase.
[2014-01-14 22:26:12 -0500] mattray: claco: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/66492/
[2014-01-14 22:30:12 -0500] claco: mattray: any pref on how that should be?
[2014-01-14 22:30:29 -0500] mattray: claco: the single-quote spanning multiple lines
[2014-01-14 22:30:36 -0500] mattray: that looked inadvertent
[2014-01-14 22:30:38 -0500] claco: and use of \n  or \ seemed like it would be worse...
[2014-01-14 22:30:56 -0500] mattray: oh, nevermind. I thought that was accidental
[2014-01-14 22:31:06 -0500] mattray: my mind confused the double-quote for a pair of single quotes
[2014-01-14 22:31:10 -0500] claco: same as the original, but wth the ' over "
[2014-01-14 22:31:15 -0500] claco: ha
[2014-01-14 22:31:19 -0500] mattray: going back

[2014-01-14 22:39:03 -0500] claco: is there a link to see all open changes for all of stackforge/ ?
[2014-01-14 22:39:47 -0500] claco: search.. nm
[2014-01-14 22:48:36 -0500] spheromak: claco: you can set watches
[2014-01-14 22:48:57 -0500] claco: oh I don't want to know that often. :-P
[2014-01-14 22:48:58 -0500] spheromak: on the chef stuffs then can see open stuff for those projects. I think jaypipes had a writeup on that in the ML
[2014-01-14 22:49:11 -0500] spheromak: just set the email filters so you don't get spammed
