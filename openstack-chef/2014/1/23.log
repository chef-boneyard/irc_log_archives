[2014-01-23 10:29:09 -0500] mattt: iartarisi: i was going to ask if it was necessary to add an attribute for rabbitmq's use_ssl -- since our ops-messaging cookbook doesn't do anything WRT ssl
[2014-01-23 10:29:23 -0500] mattt: iartarisi: but i suppose that doesn't stop someone from manually flipping some rabbit cookbook attributes in their env/node
[2014-01-23 10:30:31 -0500] iartarisi: right, but there are already config files which have this option and it might be nice to make it configurable, instead of hardcoding it
[2014-01-23 10:30:34 -0500] iartarisi: e.g. glance-api.conf
[2014-01-23 10:31:14 -0500] mattt: iartarisi: yeah, the config files all have it -- i was more concerned with us not exposing the enablement of ssl in rabbit via the ops-messaging cookbook
[2014-01-23 10:31:27 -0500] mattt: but looking at the rabbit cookbook that doesn't appear to be necessary -- it can all be done w/ attributes
[2014-01-23 10:31:43 -0500] iartarisi: right
[2014-01-23 10:31:54 -0500] mattt: iartarisi: i'll go ahead and get that config option enabled and add an attribute for it hten

[2014-01-23 13:31:10 -0500] david_paterson: I see the over all issue is that I have not pushed /etc/chef/openstack_data_bag_secret down to the node prior to the chef solo run. So I kind of have the gist of where my issue is.
[2014-01-23 13:32:30 -0500] david_paterson: My question is is there some documentation around the prerequisites and flow required prior to installing openstack with the stackforge cookbooks?

[2014-01-23 16:37:35 -0500] ctracey: rtheis, re: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/68455/ do we actually want the nova-network setup to happen?
[2014-01-23 16:38:54 -0500] rtheis: ctracey, I was think that we would need it for the default compute worker setup
[2014-01-23 16:39:40 -0500] rtheis: otherwise, I didn't see nova-network setup elsewhere
[2014-01-23 16:40:44 -0500] rtheis: but I was focused on compatibility with what was there before.
[2014-01-23 16:41:00 -0500] ctracey: yeah...i am trying to break that
[2014-01-23 16:41:10 -0500] rtheis: ok :-)
[2014-01-23 16:41:28 -0500] ctracey: though it begs a good question around aio
[2014-01-23 16:41:56 -0500] ctracey: allmost like we need an aio-neutron and aio-networks
[2014-01-23 16:42:17 -0500] ctracey: though i think the value of aio-networks is diminishing quickly
[2014-01-23 16:42:56 -0500] rtheis: yeah...although nice for a quick test or demo
[2014-01-23 16:43:20 -0500] ctracey: why cant neutron be like that? :)
[2014-01-23 16:43:45 -0500] ctracey: feel like our community has been kickin this can down the road a long time
[2014-01-23 16:43:52 -0500] ctracey: we should just bit the bullet :)
[2014-01-23 16:44:08 -0500] ctracey: our community being openstack in general
[2014-01-23 16:44:13 -0500] mattt: i really need to learn neutron :-/
[2014-01-23 16:44:27 -0500] rtheis: you mean move to neutron instead of nova-network as default?
[2014-01-23 16:44:41 -0500] ctracey: yeah
[2014-01-23 16:44:51 -0500] ctracey: its only a matter of time
[2014-01-23 16:45:07 -0500] ctracey: neutron really isnt that hard once you get your hands dirty
[2014-01-23 16:45:17 -0500] rtheis: yeah...we've focused on neutron here at IBM

[2014-01-23 16:49:13 -0500] mattray: ctracey: I agree, I wish aio was neutron-based
[2014-01-23 16:49:41 -0500] rtheis: The compute::network recipe appears to handle both nova-network and neutron...would that then allow aio to work for either
[2014-01-23 16:49:59 -0500] ctracey: rtheis, i do not like how that works
[2014-01-23 16:50:07 -0500] rtheis: ok
[2014-01-23 16:50:10 -0500] mattt: there is an attribute to choose networks or neutron, i use neutron on an AIO
[2014-01-23 16:50:19 -0500] ctracey: we should not be keying off of attrs to include or exclude recipes/functionality
[2014-01-23 16:50:34 -0500] ctracey: i think that is a recipe (no pun) for disaster
[2014-01-23 16:50:49 -0500] mattt: anyone know why the cookbook is openstack-block-storage and not openstack-volume ?
[2014-01-23 16:51:34 -0500] claco: it's not a volume until it's attached? :-P
[2014-01-23 16:52:36 -0500] ctracey: its the block storage service?
[2014-01-23 16:52:47 -0500] mattt: ctracey: it registers as the volume service

[2014-01-23 16:53:12 -0500] ctracey: well...that is cinder's fault :)
[2014-01-23 16:53:28 -0500] ctracey: cinder does a lot of things it shouldnt :)
[2014-01-23 16:54:00 -0500] mattt: ctracey: :P
[2014-01-23 16:54:03 -0500] claco: ss/cinder/*/ :-)
[2014-01-23 16:54:38 -0500] rtheis: ctracey, so you were thinking to now require the network recipe to be added to run list and not included in any roles provided?
[2014-01-23 16:54:50 -0500] ctracey: well no
[2014-01-23 16:55:01 -0500] ctracey: inclusion in a role is perfectly fine
[2014-01-23 16:55:22 -0500] ctracey: but if i include compute::scheduler, i expect only scheduler
[2014-01-23 16:55:31 -0500] ctracey: (that is a poor example)
[2014-01-23 16:55:59 -0500] ctracey: but this week I called on compute::compute and got compute, network, and metadata
[2014-01-23 16:59:50 -0500] ctracey: we should create a BP for "remove all traces of bash"

[2014-01-23 17:26:24 -0500] mattray: galstrom: yeah, the assumption of uniformity is probably worthwhile.
[2014-01-23 17:27:05 -0500] mattray: yeah, it's uniform :)
[2014-01-23 17:29:28 -0500] galstrom: mattray: i just wanted to check.. that felt like an "expected behavior" thing to me
[2014-01-23 17:29:48 -0500] ctracey: galstrom, i kinda agree with it
[2014-01-23 17:30:01 -0500] ctracey: there are times where you may want a service to bind on 0.0.0.0
[2014-01-23 17:30:04 -0500] galstrom: ok.. two agrees is good enough for me
[2014-01-23 17:30:06 -0500] galstrom: :)
[2014-01-23 17:30:23 -0500] ctracey: i mean i agree with the bug
[2014-01-23 17:30:25 -0500] ctracey: :)
[2014-01-23 17:30:43 -0500] galstrom: ctracey: i have no issue with binding to 0.0.0.0
[2014-01-23 17:30:51 -0500] ctracey: if im reading it correctly
[2014-01-23 17:30:52 -0500] galstrom: i did not read that bug that way..
[2014-01-23 17:31:25 -0500] ctracey: let me reread
[2014-01-23 17:32:35 -0500] ctracey: ok...
[2014-01-23 17:32:46 -0500] ctracey: i thought he was asking to bind to 0.0.0.0
[2014-01-23 17:32:52 -0500] ctracey: which should be a thing
[2014-01-23 17:32:55 -0500] ctracey: but...
[2014-01-23 17:33:03 -0500] ctracey: why can he not do this with overrides?
[2014-01-23 17:33:25 -0500] ctracey: shouldnt node overrides work here?
[2014-01-23 17:33:27 -0500] galstrom: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image/blob/master/recipes/api.rb#L144-L148
[2014-01-23 17:33:46 -0500] galstrom: if i look at that.. and set the attribute to 0.0.0.0 it will not bind to the ip of a specific interface
[2014-01-23 17:35:10 -0500] ctracey: it will?
[2014-01-23 17:35:20 -0500] galstrom: no.. i got that  wrong..
[2014-01-23 17:35:29 -0500] galstrom: that will go do endpoint call
[2014-01-23 17:35:37 -0500] ctracey: afaik there is no way to set 0.0.0.0
[2014-01-23 17:35:44 -0500] ctracey: which is a problem
[2014-01-23 17:35:53 -0500] galstrom: hm..
[2014-01-23 17:35:57 -0500] ctracey: but...
[2014-01-23 17:36:01 -0500] galstrom: ok.. i can agree with that being an issue..
[2014-01-23 17:36:23 -0500] ctracey: if he is asking to use eth0 on one host and eth1 on another host, then I think that is accomplished with overrides
[2014-01-23 17:36:31 -0500] galstrom: that block will check if you want it to bind to the ip on a specified interface..
[2014-01-23 17:36:45 -0500] galstrom: if no interface is provided.. it will fall back to the endpoint information in the attributes
[2014-01-23 17:36:59 -0500] ctracey: yeah...that seems....oddd
[2014-01-23 17:37:51 -0500] ctracey: im not sure I agree that nil should be the indicator for 0.0.0.0
[2014-01-23 17:37:52 -0500] galstrom: ctracey: agreed.. probably works fine for a single node/role.. but does not work correctly for a multinode setup
[2014-01-23 17:38:00 -0500] galstrom: neither do i
[2014-01-23 17:38:03 -0500] ctracey: *?
[2014-01-23 17:38:30 -0500] galstrom: however.. defining a unified interface for multi-node roles would allow the binds to work correctly
[2014-01-23 17:38:38 -0500] galstrom: not sure if everything else works beyond that or not
[2014-01-23 17:39:03 -0500] ctracey: yeah...nor i

[2014-01-23 18:27:40 -0500] mattray: ctracey: I suspected that
[2014-01-23 18:28:01 -0500] mattray: http://www.getchef.com/blog/events/ all sorts of stuff I didn't know about :)
[2014-01-23 18:29:22 -0500] mattray: it's especially nice to see training in Austin that I have nothing to do with
[2014-01-23 18:30:41 -0500] ctracey: haha
[2014-01-23 18:30:42 -0500] ctracey: yeah
[2014-01-23 18:44:08 -0500] invsblduck: hello, Gerrit_Workflow wiki page suggests i clone upstream github.com/stackforge/ repo and add gerrit remote for git-review; iow, i don't need to fork since i won't be making pr?  thanks
[2014-01-23 18:44:38 -0500] invsblduck: or do you guys all fork and create topic branches in your own repo
[2014-01-23 18:44:42 -0500] galstrom: invsblduck: that is correct
[2014-01-23 18:45:21 -0500] invsblduck: galstrom: sorry- the 1st or 2nd thing i wrote? :)
[2014-01-23 18:45:45 -0500] galstrom: invsblduck: 1st
[2014-01-23 18:45:51 -0500] invsblduck: ty.
[2014-01-23 18:45:58 -0500] galstrom: clone upstream.. make topic branch.. git review
[2014-01-23 18:45:59 -0500] galstrom: win
[2014-01-23 18:46:08 -0500] galstrom: mattray: are you doing the paris one?
[2014-01-23 18:46:53 -0500] mattray: galstrom: I'm not doing either
[2014-01-23 18:47:15 -0500] galstrom: mattray: wow.. did not realize we had paris peoples working on this
[2014-01-23 18:47:30 -0500] mattray: we're pretty international :)
[2014-01-23 18:47:52 -0500] alanmeadows: galstrom: little late but agree regarding https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+bug/1262995
[2014-01-23 18:47:57 -0500] galstrom: mattray: apparently.. but i do not recognize anyone on the attendee list
[2014-01-23 18:48:09 -0500] galstrom: alanmeadows: not late at all..
[2014-01-23 18:48:13 -0500] galstrom: alanmeadows: ty
[2014-01-23 18:48:44 -0500] galstrom: mattray: i wish the paris one was a bit later.. like mid feb.. when i will be in the UK
[2014-01-23 18:48:49 -0500] galstrom: :(
[2014-01-23 18:49:22 -0500] mattray: galstrom: interesting, I only recognize the CloudWatt names
[2014-01-23 18:50:25 -0500] mattray: and they were done with eNovance, but it's a Chef installation with their own cookbooks
[2014-01-23 18:50:40 -0500] mattray: according to carlp :)
[2014-01-23 18:51:30 -0500] galstrom: interesting
[2014-01-23 18:53:23 -0500] carlp: yeah, the CW guys are strange
[2014-01-23 19:11:16 -0500] invsblduck: so are the `*_process_name' platform attributes not used?  ie., monit or similar is not configured
[2014-01-23 20:21:15 -0500] ctracey: claco, sorry :(
[2014-01-23 20:21:39 -0500] claco: ? did you review-hammer me? ha.
[2014-01-23 20:22:08 -0500] claco: or did I just get volunteered for something? :-)
[2014-01-23 20:23:24 -0500] ctracey: claco, twitter
[2014-01-23 20:23:38 -0500] claco: oh, ha
[2014-01-23 20:24:47 -0500] claco: I'm afraid the even ask. :-)
[2014-01-23 20:46:39 -0500] invsblduck: just spun an aio... don't see monit or any supervisor;
[2014-01-23 20:46:54 -0500] invsblduck: is that something we're interested in, or should i remove the *_process_name attrs?
[2014-01-23 20:47:54 -0500] invsblduck: looking for something to commit so i can learn the gerrit/merge process :)
[2014-01-23 20:55:21 -0500] mattray: invsblduck: I suspect that's left over from when AT&T forked from Rackspace's version around Essex Rackspace put monitoring hooks in the cookbooks, I encouraged keeping that external. I don't know if we use the process names anymore.
[2014-01-23 20:55:37 -0500] mattray: galstrom: retr0h: ^^
[2014-01-23 20:56:51 -0500] galstrom: mattray: I believe you are correct.. that is an artifact of the rcbops monitoring bits
[2014-01-23 20:57:05 -0500] alanmeadows: Those belong completely external, if we have an opportunity to yank them we should
[2014-01-23 20:57:20 -0500] invsblduck: yes they are leftovers from the fork
[2014-01-23 20:57:29 -0500] invsblduck: i noticed some were missing, and i was going to improve them
[2014-01-23 20:57:33 -0500] invsblduck: then realized they're not used at all :)
[2014-01-23 20:57:40 -0500] mattray: so yeah, invsblduck sounds like removing them would be worthwhile :)
[2014-01-23 20:58:48 -0500] alanmeadows: I like to "visit" snow, not be in snow storms
[2014-01-23 20:59:42 -0500] invsblduck: mattray: alanmeadows: thanks
[2014-01-23 21:03:39 -0500] invsblduck: this isn't technically a bug; do i simply propose the change?
[2014-01-23 21:27:44 -0500] mattray: invsblduck: yeah, that's fine
[2014-01-23 21:28:03 -0500] mattray: invsblduck: we're not sticklers for bugs, but either way works
[2014-01-23 21:28:08 -0500] invsblduck: mattray: thanks!
[2014-01-23 21:28:31 -0500] mattray: invsblduck: thank you!
[2014-01-23 21:32:34 -0500] mattray: paulczar: Tuskar is what I was trying to think of last night
[2014-01-23 21:33:27 -0500] paulczar: aha!
[2014-01-23 21:36:10 -0500] mattray: paulczar: mesos probably isn't in Python
[2014-01-23 21:43:04 -0500] paulczar: yeah we're incubating an openstack projected based on mesos
[2014-01-23 21:43:14 -0500] paulczar: calling it fullretard
[2014-01-23 21:45:26 -0500] mattray: paulczar: I think they already called it Tuskar
[2014-01-23 23:08:15 -0500] masteinhauser: Wow, TripleO looks like it's coming along since I was last following OpenStack in April/May 2013.
[2014-01-23 23:13:05 -0500] mattray: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/68791/ for adding Tempest
[2014-01-23 23:13:24 -0500] mattray: it also has notifications in here for orchestration, ops-database and ops-messaging
[2014-01-23 23:34:49 -0500] masteinhauser: Would these cookbooks work with bootstrapping a TripleO deployment? Does it even make sense to compare? And is TripleO still gaining ground/functionality?
[2014-01-23 23:35:43 -0500] masteinhauser: Currently looking at/working on setting up a POC with these cookbooks and razor since we already use Chef extensively and have wanted to use Razor but are trying to understand the big picture and identify what we want to move towards.
