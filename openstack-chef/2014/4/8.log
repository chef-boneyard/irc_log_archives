[2014-04-08 15:35:55 -0400] mattt: galstrom: seems unrelated to my change, let me see what's going on

[2014-04-08 16:29:54 -0400] mrodden: heads up on some Nova config option Icehouse deprecation https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/05750de7da5605bc84db732777d3357a67fe869d
[2014-04-08 16:30:04 -0400] mrodden: markvan: that might affect one of your recent patches ^
[2014-04-08 16:31:14 -0400] markvan: mrodden: thx, updating the nova libvirt patch now.
[2014-04-08 16:32:26 -0400] mrodden: markvan: looks like it should just be locked to GenericVIFDriver...?
[2014-04-08 16:32:32 -0400] mrodden: i am not sure what they propose to use in favor
[2014-04-08 16:36:09 -0400] mrodden: markvan: looks like the configuration option is going to be dropped
[2014-04-08 16:36:20 -0400] mrodden: so we should just not include vif_driver in the nova.conf
[2014-04-08 16:36:26 -0400] mrodden: it will default to the correct thing
[2014-04-08 16:36:54 -0400] markvan: mrodden: ok, I can make a comment to that effect.
[2014-04-08 16:37:15 -0400] mrodden: would be good to include a link to the nova change in the commit message i think
[2014-04-08 16:37:20 -0400] mrodden: and it might be a new patch TBH
[2014-04-08 16:37:29 -0400] mrodden: independent of the current one
[2014-04-08 16:37:55 -0400] mrodden: separation of concerns and would make a better record as to why those were changed
[2014-04-08 16:43:55 -0400] markvan: mrodden: will leave the vif_driver default change for another patch.
[2014-04-08 16:44:36 -0400] mrodden: markvan: yeah thats probably the best option
