[2014-04-11 16:45:50 -0400] markvan: mattt: ping
[2014-04-11 20:14:32 -0400] mattt: markvan: hey there
[2014-04-11 20:15:38 -0400] markvan: mattt: was wondering about that json issue in the jenkins job.  see glance  api log
[2014-04-11 20:15:49 -0400] mattt: markvan: it's a packaging issue i believe
[2014-04-11 20:16:04 -0400] mattt: markvan: the anyjson thing right?
[2014-04-11 20:16:10 -0400] markvan: mattt: yup
[2014-04-11 20:16:31 -0400] mattt: markvan: yeah, that's a packaging bug ... not sure if we just wait for new packages or work around in the cookbooks ?
[2014-04-11 20:16:56 -0400] mattt: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1084540
[2014-04-11 20:20:17 -0400] markvan: mattt: ok.  what do you think the eta is on new packages?
[2014-04-11 20:24:34 -0400] mattt: i could swear this was an issue in grizzly also
[2014-04-11 20:24:37 -0400] mattt: (or maybe it was havana)
[2014-04-11 20:27:36 -0400] markvan: mattt: yeah I seem to recall something about his.  Would an option for now be to hack in a workaround?
[2014-04-11 20:27:49 -0400] mattt: markvan: asking in #openstack-dev
[2014-04-11 20:47:35 -0400] mattt: markvan: i think we may want to update cookbooks because i'm nto sure they're aware of the issue (the bug is for fedora)
[2014-04-11 20:47:52 -0400] mattt: markvan: i don't have a deployed node on me right now, need to dig into it and it's quite late here (10 PM)
[2014-04-11 20:48:01 -0400] mattt: markvan: want me to do this monday ?
[2014-04-11 20:48:11 -0400] mattt: (adding the dependency on the imaging cookbook)
[2014-04-11 20:48:31 -0400] markvan: mattt: yes, that would be great, thx.
[2014-04-11 20:49:27 -0400] markvan: mattt: fyi, I got lucky with this one as our internal ibm repo has this pkg issue already fixed.
[2014-04-11 20:49:55 -0400] mattt: markvan: i swear we had this exact same issue in grizzly, i need to dig up the bug
[2014-04-11 20:50:08 -0400] mattt: markvan: but i'll get it sorted on monday so we can start seeing the state of centos
[2014-04-11 20:50:34 -0400] markvan: mattt: very much appreciated...
[2014-04-11 20:50:40 -0400] mattt: markvan: np, have a good weekend !
[2014-04-11 20:50:56 -0400] markvan: mattt: tgif!
