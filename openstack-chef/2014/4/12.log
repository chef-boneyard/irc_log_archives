[2014-04-12 20:12:08 -0400] Deltachaos: hi
[2014-04-12 20:13:29 -0400] Deltachaos: i have seen a talk about openstack and chef and what i did not understood was: is this now part of the office openstack release? is openstack & chef an automation of setting up an openstack cloud or what is this project?
[2014-04-12 20:40:42 -0400] mattt: Deltachaos: yeah, the github.com/stackforge/cookbook-* cookbooks can be used to deploy openstack using chef
[2014-04-12 20:41:38 -0400] Deltachaos: mattt: okey thanks!
[2014-04-12 20:42:03 -0400] mattt: Deltachaos: the cookbooks are not an official openstack project though
[2014-04-12 20:42:58 -0400] mattt: Deltachaos: if you run into any issues deploying w/ them, please let us know in here or via launchpad ... but note that this channel is usually rather quiet on the weekend :)
[2014-04-12 20:48:50 -0400] Deltachaos: mattt: okey no problem. we are currently evaluating the usage of openstack in our environment. we currently have an small infrastructure but we want to be ready to scale up some time. so this is the main reason for starting with openstack. and chef is of cause one thing that sould be part of every node in the private cloud and of cause deploy new openstack nodes. but in general we ran into two problems: which storage soulution is scalable and
[2014-04-12 20:48:51 -0400] Deltachaos: cheap and we leak some good documentation on how to set up openstack. (best would be in german). for storage we currently evaluating ceph as a solution. but may someone could simply give me a hint on some kind of direction we should drill in or someone had the same problems and solved it already.
[2014-04-12 20:50:40 -0400] mattt: Deltachaos: if you're not familiar w/ chef then getting started with these cookbooks may take a while, because unfortunately there isn't a lot of documentation, but with enough questions we can get you through it :)
[2014-04-12 20:51:20 -0400] mattt: Deltachaos: and as for storage, ceph seems to be what most people are using since it can give you object storage and block storage for instances
[2014-04-12 20:52:09 -0400] mattt: Deltachaos: we just took control of the ceph cookbook (it was moved from intank to github.com/stackforge), so we have community members already working on integrating the two (ceph + openstack)
[2014-04-12 20:54:10 -0400] Deltachaos: mattt: okey. and for the general openstack setup by hand (as if someone sould learn how to use openstack the best would be to set it up by hand and then try to set it up using chef), do you know any good resource for this? kind of an "tutorial". or how did you setup your first openstack cloud?
[2014-04-12 20:54:49 -0400] mattt: Deltachaos: i think following the docs on http://docs.openstack.org/ would be your best bet
[2014-04-12 20:57:21 -0400] Deltachaos: okey. a other question i have is. which is the best distro for running openstack?
[2014-04-12 20:58:45 -0400] mattt: Deltachaos: i think you'd be relatively safe w/ either red hat or ubuntu, my personal preference is ubuntu tho
[2014-04-12 20:58:54 -0400] mattt: Deltachaos: i think most openstack development itself happens on ubuntu
[2014-04-12 21:02:20 -0400] Deltachaos: mattt: okey. thanks for your answers. i will now reside in this channel the next time :) but for now i go to bed. (i am in UTC+1 localtime is 23:01)
[2014-04-12 21:03:29 -0400] mattt: Deltachaos: have a good evening, me and my colleagues are UTC+1 also
[2014-04-12 21:03:41 -0400] mattt: Deltachaos: so ask your questions during the week :)
