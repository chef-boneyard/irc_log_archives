[2014-04-10 09:56:31 -0400] GoT: Hi guys, Anyone have an idea about how to create data bags for openstack-common cookbook? I'm new with Chef and don't really understand what kinds of values I must add in the data_bags to remove this error: Data Bag Items must contain a Hash or Mash!
[2014-04-10 10:17:21 -0400] mattt: GoT: not used data bags myself, all my work has been in development and setting the development flag will disable need for data bags
[2014-04-10 10:32:37 -0400] GoT: mattt, I know this condition to ignore the data bags, but want to make it secure even if i turn on development.
[2014-04-10 10:49:53 -0400] mattt: GoT: your data bag content is JSON
[2014-04-10 10:50:30 -0400] mattt: GoT: may be worth looking at http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html and https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/libraries/passwords.rb#L41-L47

[2014-04-10 14:33:52 -0400] markvan: mattt: howdy
[2014-04-10 14:35:12 -0400] mattt: markvan: hey there, can you do the needful on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/86540/?
[2014-04-10 14:35:20 -0400] mattt: markvan: this is in conjunction w/ the Berksfile change you made
[2014-04-10 14:37:05 -0400] mattt: lbragstad: ha!
[2014-04-10 14:37:09 -0400] mattt: lbragstad: just looking at your change there
[2014-04-10 14:37:41 -0400] lbragstad: hah nice timely huh?
[2014-04-10 14:38:15 -0400] lbragstad: I'd be lying if I said I planned that :)
[2014-04-10 14:38:16 -0400] markvan: mattt: yeah, these database changes probably need more tweaking as there's a new mysql v5 cookbook which appears not to be backward compatible. but we can start here.
[2014-04-10 14:38:45 -0400] mattt: markvan: maybe i should kill my review and we go w/ lbragstad
[2014-04-10 14:38:49 -0400] mattt: since i didn't include python
[2014-04-10 14:38:56 -0400] mattt: (oddly i get no issues w/out that one defined)
[2014-04-10 14:39:28 -0400] mancdaz: markvan would you mind taking a peek here: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/86290/
[2014-04-10 14:39:35 -0400] mancdaz: I have a raft of changes that depend on this
[2014-04-10 14:39:41 -0400] markvan: mattt: humm, I'm seeing some issues when mysql v5 is pulled in.
[2014-04-10 14:39:46 -0400] mancdaz: but I can't proceed
[2014-04-10 14:40:10 -0400] mattt: markvan: yeah i think we should use 2.0.0 for the time being
[2014-04-10 14:40:29 -0400] mattt: markvan: not tried 5 yet but mancdaz did mention this morning that it's not backwards compatible
[2014-04-10 14:40:38 -0400] markvan: mattt: ok, I agree.
[2014-04-10 14:41:15 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: sure...

[2014-04-10 15:05:36 -0400] mattray: markvan: glad to keep things moving. Wish I had more time for reviews right now, slammed with ChefConf preparation
[2014-04-10 15:07:29 -0400] markvan: mattray: yeah, I figured your swamped with the high price of session prep... wish I could attend some of these.
[2014-04-10 15:08:09 -0400] mattray: markvan: I'm also working the Red Hat Summit across town

[2014-04-10 15:09:55 -0400] mattray: oh yeah, 1 press interview and managing a speaker track
[2014-04-10 15:10:26 -0400] markvan: mattray: link to your blog posts?
[2014-04-10 15:10:34 -0400] mattray: still writing them
[2014-04-10 15:10:44 -0400] mattray: tied to marketing announcements

[2014-04-10 15:26:29 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: looking...
[2014-04-10 15:28:11 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: pls add bp to commit msg, then it lgtm.

[2014-04-10 15:31:10 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: OK I've added it to an existing bp that was targeted at havana
[2014-04-10 15:31:17 -0400] mancdaz: but it's all related
[2014-04-10 15:31:51 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: yeah, it's good to tie these types of changes together with bps

[2014-04-10 15:37:18 -0400] mancdaz: markvan andymccr mattray same change, but for stable/havana : https://review.openstack.org/86634
[2014-04-10 15:40:56 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: bp for that one as well? (sorry getting picky...helps with my sanity)
[2014-04-10 15:41:06 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: yep just did it
[2014-04-10 15:41:10 -0400] mancdaz: noticved it myself
[2014-04-10 15:41:11 -0400] mancdaz: sorry
[2014-04-10 15:42:12 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: identity-bind missing port?
[2014-04-10 15:42:44 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: I'm leaving that as it's a single bind for both admin/service endpoints
[2014-04-10 15:42:59 -0400] mancdaz: later I might go ans plit those out if needed
[2014-04-10 15:43:42 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: maybe cmt to that effect?
[2014-04-10 15:44:39 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: in the commit message?
[2014-04-10 15:46:10 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: inline code
[2014-04-10 15:49:51 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: I'll add a NOTE, because I'm unlikely to split it due to the way keystone presents those 2 different ports
[2014-04-10 15:49:59 -0400] mancdaz: rather than a TODO

[2014-04-10 15:51:32 -0400] mancdaz: it's a real pain adding stuff to both havana and master :/
[2014-04-10 15:52:50 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: thx
[2014-04-10 15:55:36 -0400] mancdaz: andymccr / markvan thank you both!
[2014-04-10 15:55:44 -0400] andymccr: you are welcome!
[2014-04-10 15:56:05 -0400] andymccr: markvan: have you got the ml2 neutron thing working with icehouse? I'm struggling a bit - just to get it going on an all-in-one for testing!
[2014-04-10 15:56:32 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: ty for your progress on binding
[2014-04-10 15:56:56 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: there's a ton more to come on that so expect more poking :-)
[2014-04-10 15:57:22 -0400] markvan: andymccr: it's been a while now since I've run that one, what type of fireworks are you seeing?
[2014-04-10 15:57:38 -0400] andymccr: im just struggling to boot up instances, wondering if I'm doing something stupid though
[2014-04-10 15:57:48 -0400] andymccr: which is probably the case, so if you've got it to work then it is no doubt me :)
[2014-04-10 16:00:08 -0400] markvan: andymccr: Ah, that would probably be the other issue with the nova <> neurton interactions patches.
[2014-04-10 16:00:41 -0400] markvan: See: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/83560/
[2014-04-10 16:01:56 -0400] markvan: andymccr: somehow the nova <> neutron folks made this interaction the default and I have not found a way to make it work without it. The hard part here was that one of the conf values is the service UUID which I struggled trying to figure out a way to do that.
[2014-04-10 16:02:20 -0400] markvan: Hence the new CLI in Common:  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/86211/
[2014-04-10 16:02:56 -0400] andymccr: thanks markvan! I'll take a look
[2014-04-10 16:03:13 -0400] markvan: So, if you update your neutron.conf with those interaction values, it should allow nova and neutron to play nice together
[2014-04-10 16:03:36 -0400] andymccr: will give it a go. Hopefully works!
[2014-04-10 16:05:08 -0400] markvan: for basic idea, go with eariler patch: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/83560/3  then just update the ugly UUID conf item.
[2014-04-10 16:05:51 -0400] markvan: andymccr: I will setup this up again myself, maybe something else has changed.
[2014-04-10 16:08:19 -0400] andymccr: i'll give this a go now, and see if i get better results!
