[2014-04-09 08:24:26 -0400] mattt: we need this one resolved, it's breaking spec tests on image cookbook
[2014-04-09 08:30:09 -0400] andymccr: checking now mattt
[2014-04-09 08:46:24 -0400] mancdaz: andymccr: I am going to make a pr on common to add the attrs for all the [servicename]-bind stuff for each service, so that I can independently bind a service to an ip/interface that is different from the actual endpoint (load balanced)
[2014-04-09 08:46:28 -0400] mancdaz: that will be the prep for then doing the change in each cookbook to actually use those attrs for binding, instead of what they currently do which is try to bind to the endpoint (which may be the load balancer IP)
[2014-04-09 08:46:43 -0400] mancdaz: I'm gonna do this for both master and stable/havana

[2014-04-09 08:51:50 -0400] andymccr: ok cool sounds good mancdaz. seems the most sensible way to get this added without breaking other things mid flight!
[2014-04-09 08:52:05 -0400] mancdaz: yarp that's the idea

[2014-04-09 13:35:05 -0400] GoT: Hi, I tried to use identity  cookbook but something wen wrong when I ran the chef-solo command line. Here the error: http://pastebin.com/0xFRBMtP
[2014-04-09 13:38:10 -0400] GoT: If someone have and idea about this problem? :/
[2014-04-09 13:39:28 -0400] Mr_D: Looks like you are missing the common cookbook: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common
[2014-04-09 13:49:36 -0400] Mr_D: Also, the cookbooks have not been tested with chef-solo, so not sure what issues you will run into.  You should probably use chef-zero, or chef-server instead
[2014-04-09 13:52:19 -0400] JensOfSweden: I know some things like cross node attributes and stuff wont work with chef-solo, just know rackspace cookbooks doesnt work with chef solo
[2014-04-09 14:09:58 -0400] GoT: Mr_D, JensOfSweden I try to use cookbook with chef as masterless like a simple "puppet apply" directly on the target
