[2014-04-28 14:53:35 -0400] galstrom: I am not going to be able to attend the meeting..
[2014-04-28 14:56:51 -0400] ctracey: We can postpone or cancel... Do your thing. Good luck.
[2014-04-28 14:59:30 -0400] markvan: galstrom: ctracey:  would like your opinions on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/90246/  and https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+spec/neutron-recipe-cleanup
[2014-04-28 15:00:14 -0400] markvan: trying to push network cookbook forward a bit...

[2014-04-28 16:10:37 -0400] lrr: i would really like some help on figuring out which cookbooks are required for what node in a 1 controller + n compute node setup. All the links in documentation sya "there is an example for controller + n compute in _______ link" but those locations no longer exist. In fact, most of the "example" documentation doesn't exists any more. Can anyone provide me with some examples for a controller + n
[2014-04-28 16:10:38 -0400] lrr: compute node w/ nova network?
[2014-04-28 16:11:47 -0400] lrr: it is not exactly clear on how to do this when trying to dissect the nova-network aio vagrant file
[2014-04-28 16:26:10 -0400] mattray: lrr: if you're using the openstack-chef-repo, the Vagrant builds are using a role
[2014-04-28 16:26:45 -0400] mattray: "role[allinone-compute]","role[os-image-upload]"
[2014-04-28 16:26:54 -0400] lrr: mattray: yeah, but decomposing the role to see what required for a controller node and what's required for a compute only node is not very striaght forward
[2014-04-28 16:27:01 -0400] mattray: you can dissect allinone-compute, but essentially it's everything but the object storage
[2014-04-28 16:27:20 -0400] mattray:   "role[os-compute-worker]"
[2014-04-28 16:27:29 -0400] mattray: that should be a compute node
[2014-04-28 16:28:01 -0400] lrr: is that the only role a compute node needs? because I tried doing that before and the supposed compute node wasn't registered with the contrroller node
[2014-04-28 16:28:38 -0400] lrr: if I can work through this, I can work on creating some documentation for an example like this since I'm sure a good amount of people are looking for examples like this
[2014-04-28 16:29:13 -0400] mattray: lrr: there is documentation, it's dated to Grizzly but it hasn't changed _that_ much
[2014-04-28 16:29:19 -0400] mattray: docs.opscode.com/openstack.html
[2014-04-28 16:29:36 -0400] mattray: same patterns and cookbooks mostly
[2014-04-28 16:29:53 -0400] lrr: mattray: i've scoured that page,  but i'm obviously missing something
[2014-04-28 16:29:59 -0400] lrr: and the links on that page
[2014-04-28 16:32:20 -0400] mattray: yeah, I haven't been anything but Vagrant lately, it was working at one point
[2014-04-28 16:32:29 -0400] mattray: I'll be happy to work with you to update the docs as we sort it out
[2014-04-28 16:32:47 -0400] lrr: that would be awesome.
[2014-04-28 16:40:26 -0400] mattray: lrr: right now I'm mostly using the stable/havana branch for testing with knife-openstack, just using nova-network
[2014-04-28 16:40:47 -0400] mattray: hopefully I'll be hiring someone soon to work on this stuff to get the docs revisited
[2014-04-28 16:41:41 -0400] lrr: mattray: yeah,my setup will be using stable/havanah as well. After finding a good description of the services required on a dedicated compute node, i think i'm not as lost on this anymore
[2014-04-28 16:42:26 -0400] mattray: the newer OpenStack docs have moved to a 1+1+N model
[2014-04-28 16:42:32 -0400] mattray: where there's a networking node
[2014-04-28 16:42:38 -0400] mattray: but that's mostly for Neutron
[2014-04-28 16:42:45 -0400] lrr: which docs? the official openstack project ones or the chef-openstack?
[2014-04-28 16:42:53 -0400] mattray: official openstack ones
[2014-04-28 16:42:56 -0400] lrr: ah
[2014-04-28 16:43:29 -0400] lrr: i would try to work through neutron, but for where I work it would require too much time and adds too much complexity.
[2014-04-28 16:44:03 -0400] lrr: and the time i have left there (i'm currently an under grad about to graduate), spending the extra time on neutron isn't work it
[2014-04-28 16:44:11 -0400] lrr: worth*
[2014-04-28 16:47:25 -0400] mattray: yeah, the openvswitch backend changed from havana to icehouse, so that adds even more complexity
[2014-04-28 16:47:36 -0400] mattray: nova-network will never die
[2014-04-28 17:00:16 -0400] lrr: heh, good to hear nova-network won't die
[2014-04-28 17:00:18 -0400] lrr: :)
[2014-04-28 18:16:42 -0400] lrr: mattray: ping
[2014-04-28 18:16:55 -0400] mattray: lrr: pong
[2014-04-28 18:17:31 -0400] lrr: mattray: do you know if the os-network role goes on the controller or compute node?
[2014-04-28 18:18:19 -0400] mattray: I believe controller
[2014-04-28 18:18:41 -0400] lrr: ok, that's what I thought
[2014-04-28 18:22:50 -0400] mattray: ctracey: carlp: spheromak: Why Omnibus? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ruby2.0/+bug/1310292
[2014-04-28 18:24:46 -0400] spheromak: heh
[2014-04-28 18:53:31 -0400] ctracey: i saw that on the twitters
[2014-04-28 18:53:53 -0400] mattt: ctracey: how's the omnibussings coming along?
[2014-04-28 18:54:05 -0400] ctracey: which part? :)
[2014-04-28 18:54:22 -0400] mattt: allthethings-omnibussings
[2014-04-28 18:54:54 -0400] ctracey: it has been back-burnered for a week
[2014-04-28 18:55:08 -0400] ctracey: but have some local commits
[2014-04-28 18:55:18 -0400] ctracey: thinking about using it?
[2014-04-28 18:56:22 -0400] mattt: ctracey: not in the immediate term, but it sounds like a neat project
[2014-04-28 18:56:38 -0400] ctracey: what do you use now?
[2014-04-28 18:56:44 -0400] ctracey: where you at?
[2014-04-28 19:00:16 -0400] mattt: ctracey: rackspace
[2014-04-28 19:00:30 -0400] mattt: ctracey: so we use standard packaging
[2014-04-28 19:00:42 -0400] ctracey: yes i am familiar ;)
[2014-04-28 19:00:50 -0400] ctracey: one of the first alamo users i think
[2014-04-28 19:01:07 -0400] mattt: yeah i don't go that far back :P
[2014-04-28 19:39:47 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: fyi https://review.openstack.org/#/c/90796/2 related to your binding changes.
[2014-04-28 19:49:44 -0400] carlp: ctracey: about the omnibusing of all the things...I was curious your opinions on making an omnibus per OpenStack component vs the whole thing. Maybe just having it as an option, as I can see a need for both.
[2014-04-28 19:50:05 -0400] ctracey: yes i have an opinion on that
[2014-04-28 19:50:18 -0400] ctracey: (you missed my talk)
[2014-04-28 19:50:25 -0400] carlp: I did, sorry :(
[2014-04-28 19:50:29 -0400] ctracey: create one package for all the things :)
[2014-04-28 19:50:37 -0400] carlp: It's on my queue to watch however :)
[2014-04-28 19:50:41 -0400] carlp: OK
[2014-04-28 19:50:48 -0400] ctracey: its not on my queue
[2014-04-28 19:50:56 -0400] ctracey: i cant watch myself speak
[2014-04-28 19:51:07 -0400] ctracey: this is already an option tho
[2014-04-28 19:51:15 -0400] ctracey: depends on what you are asking i guess
[2014-04-28 19:51:34 -0400] ctracey: if you are asking if you will always need a huge package the answer is No
[2014-04-28 19:52:09 -0400] carlp: Ah! If it can be made both ways than excellent. I was going to try and spend some time plugging your stuff into my OpenStack CD packaging project over the next several days
[2014-04-28 19:52:11 -0400] ctracey: carlp: https://github.com/craigtracey/omnibus-openstack-build/blob/master/openstack-config.yml
[2014-04-28 19:52:20 -0400] ctracey: that manifest tells omnibus what to build
[2014-04-28 19:52:53 -0400] ctracey: but...i wouldnt create a package for nova and a package for keystone, etc
[2014-04-28 19:53:20 -0400] ctracey: otherwise to some degree you end up back in dependency helll
[2014-04-28 19:54:55 -0400] carlp: ctracey: understood. As I said, I can see it both ways. A lot of time you are in dependency hell either way. For a CD environment, it may be harder to accurately trigger a full stack build. I'll have to look into that.
[2014-04-28 19:55:23 -0400] ctracey: i guess my stance is that disk is cheap
[2014-04-28 19:55:47 -0400] ctracey: so its easier to ship everything and then flip services on or off
[2014-04-28 19:56:21 -0400] mattray: ctracey: your talk should be up soon, they're going up quickly https://www.youtube.com/user/getchef/videos

[2014-04-28 19:57:32 -0400] mattray: ahh, I was searching on omnibus
[2014-04-28 19:57:50 -0400] carlp: mattray: it's already up, I just haven't had a chance to watch all of it yet :)
[2014-04-28 19:58:05 -0400] mattray: carlp: yeah, I've got a few days of videos to watch
[2014-04-28 20:29:06 -0400] retr0h: yeah, I passed craigs talk to the other guys in the office
[2014-04-28 20:29:22 -0400] retr0h: we likely using omnibus packaging
[2014-04-28 20:29:29 -0400] retr0h: in the near future

[2014-04-28 21:17:50 -0400] galstrom: i think youtube is trying to tell me something.. i am just not sure what
[2014-04-28 21:18:15 -0400] luisg_: lol
