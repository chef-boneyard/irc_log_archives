[2014-04-14 14:47:33 -0400] markvan: andymccr: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/83560/10   how'bout it I add a attr for that nova version for now, then maybe a future patch in common can make that available from the base (reverse uri)
[2014-04-14 14:47:52 -0400] andymccr: yeh i think that sounds sensible.
[2014-04-14 14:48:06 -0400] andymccr: otherwise it looks like it all works ok (in an all-in-one at least!)
[2014-04-14 14:49:29 -0400] markvan: andymccr: thx, yeah I ran a bunch of tests over the weekend with the ML2 and this patch, seems to be working well.
[2014-04-14 14:50:00 -0400] markvan: These seems like the biggest huddles getting icehouse branch right now.
[2014-04-14 14:50:06 -0400] andymccr: yeh definitely
[2014-04-14 14:50:19 -0400] andymccr: its tricky once you branch because its not in a really "working" state
[2014-04-14 14:50:24 -0400] andymccr: lot of changes happening.
[2014-04-14 14:52:14 -0400] markvan: yeah, and there were some late changes in base that also caused some churn.
[2014-04-14 14:52:36 -0400] markvan: but this nova<>neutron interactions is a real winner  ;)

[2014-04-14 15:07:56 -0400] mrodden: neutron just had too many race conditions
[2014-04-14 15:08:03 -0400] mrodden: so they had to make it more synchonous
