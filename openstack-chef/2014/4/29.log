[2014-04-29 14:48:33 -0400] mattt: markvan: hey there, i had a few questions about that policy.json change you put through
[2014-04-29 14:53:30 -0400] markvan: mattt: sure, the basic idea was that without a way to CRUD policy entries, we really don't have a good reason to touch them from the cookbooks.
[2014-04-29 14:55:34 -0400] mattt: markvan: yeah, i agree  but if we want to give an override option, what would be the best way to do that?
[2014-04-29 14:57:14 -0400] markvan: mattt: for the file? or individual entries?   For entries, I would think a lwrp could do the trick well using something like sed or ruby json lib.
[2014-04-29 14:57:40 -0400] mattt: markvan: i was thinking more giving the option to replace the whole file verbatim
[2014-04-29 14:58:37 -0400] markvan: I would think maybe using the remotefile resource might be a good option for that.
[2014-04-29 15:15:40 -0400] mancdaz: Hey all.  Trying to get test-kitchen going on icehouse (to replace vagrant/vagrant-berkshelf) to build some example environments
[2014-04-29 15:15:47 -0400] mancdaz: it doesn't like ruby for roles
[2014-04-29 15:15:59 -0400] mancdaz: would there be much objection if I converted all role files to json?

[2014-04-29 15:36:29 -0400] mattt: luisg_: ping
[2014-04-29 15:41:35 -0400] luisg_: mattt, hi
[2014-04-29 15:42:05 -0400] mattt: luisg_: hey, quick question about https://review.openstack.org/#/c/90488/
[2014-04-29 15:42:51 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: Yeah, we ran in to that as well and converted them all internally.  I would not mind the change.
[2014-04-29 15:43:08 -0400] luisg_: sure whats up
[2014-04-29 15:43:25 -0400] mattt: luisg_: if you load balance keystone you need the same ssl key/certs on your nodes, should that be something handled by the cookbooks or left as a wrapper ?
[2014-04-29 15:46:05 -0400] luisg_: hmm my first instinct is to do it as a wrapper, just because it's not part of the barebones setup of a standalone keystone, but it could be done
[2014-04-29 15:46:24 -0400] luisg_: relatively easily if we pulled them in via remote_files
[2014-04-29 15:47:07 -0400] mattt: luisg_: on ubuntu at least the keystone installation runs a pki_setup, and that creates you key/cert
[2014-04-29 15:47:23 -0400] mattt: luisg_: so by default if you have multiple keystone servers they'd all have unique key/certs and that'd cause issues
[2014-04-29 15:50:52 -0400] luisg_: yeah that is a problem, unless they can be generated and moved somewhere where they can be pulled down by the other nodes? or we could provide the option to pass in a cert/key pair, like we do with horizon
[2014-04-29 15:51:12 -0400] mattt: luisg_: yeah that is a good idea, i'm going to look at doing that tomorrow
[2014-04-29 15:51:31 -0400] luisg_: so that we can use the same cert/key even if those need to be generated before the run outside the convergen
[2014-04-29 15:52:42 -0400] luisg_: with horizon we ship a default cert/key, but most likely someone would want to use their third-party issued (not self-signed) certificate, so they can now use a URL to pass it in
[2014-04-29 15:52:58 -0400] luisg_: this is the patch for that: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/90467/
[2014-04-29 15:53:08 -0400] luisg_: I am thinking we could do somethign similar
[2014-04-29 15:53:29 -0400] mattt: luisg_: i think that is a good idea, i'd like to offset as much work to operator as possible
[2014-04-29 15:53:47 -0400] mattt: luisg_: heading out, but going to revisit tomorrow
[2014-04-29 15:53:51 -0400] luisg_: mattt, cool
[2014-04-29 15:53:55 -0400] luisg_: ttyl
[2014-04-29 15:53:58 -0400] mattt: later!
[2014-04-29 15:55:12 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: OK I'll get a review up tomorrow
[2014-04-29 16:01:50 -0400] lrr: anyone know how I can grab the admin password from a vagrant-aio-nova setup? i can't do a vagrant up since my vagrant environemnt is fucked when it comes to vagrant-berkshelfand vagrant-chef-zero
[2014-04-29 16:03:40 -0400] mancdaz: lrr: I feel that pain. vagrant/vagrant-berkshelf/vagrant-chef-zero is a mess
[2014-04-29 16:03:50 -0400] mancdaz: I'm working on moving stuff to test-kitchen for icehouse
[2014-04-29 16:04:29 -0400] mancdaz: lrr - what admin pass do you mean?
[2014-04-29 16:04:47 -0400] mancdaz: your admin user/tenant details are in /root/openrc
[2014-04-29 16:05:02 -0400] lrr: mancdaz: yeah, the infor in openrc
[2014-04-29 16:05:05 -0400] mancdaz: you can just source that file and then use any of the cli clients
[2014-04-29 16:05:07 -0400] lrr: i can't get a vm up and going
[2014-04-29 16:05:12 -0400] lrr: so i don't have that file
[2014-04-29 16:05:25 -0400] mancdaz: lrr so you don't have a running openstack?
[2014-04-29 16:05:26 -0400] lrr: and i have a manually setup (actually torn apart) is another testing scenario
[2014-04-29 16:05:51 -0400] lrr: mancdaz: i have a very manually put together openstack
[2014-04-29 16:06:07 -0400] mancdaz: lrr how did you create the admin tenant/user?
[2014-04-29 16:07:28 -0400] lrr: mancdaz: http://pastebin.osuosl.org/6946/
[2014-04-29 16:08:01 -0400] mancdaz: lrr so you did install with chef?
[2014-04-29 16:08:06 -0400] lrr: yep
[2014-04-29 16:08:23 -0400] mancdaz: ok, just not with vagrant
[2014-04-29 16:08:26 -0400] lrr: yep
[2014-04-29 16:08:50 -0400] mancdaz: lrr so you should still have the openrc file
[2014-04-29 16:09:14 -0400] lrr: i don't see it :(
[2014-04-29 16:09:39 -0400] lrr: is the pass on this file generated randomly?
[2014-04-29 16:10:11 -0400] lrr: er is the admin tenant/user password generated randomly?
[2014-04-29 16:13:03 -0400] lrr: mancdaz: it's not on my system :(
[2014-04-29 16:13:36 -0400] mancdaz: lrr did you define any databags for your users/pass?
[2014-04-29 16:14:03 -0400] lrr: nope. i was just trying to mimic the vagrant-aio-nova environment
[2014-04-29 16:14:42 -0400] lrr: and once i had the roles and layout understood, i would move to an environment with the databags for user/pass
[2014-04-29 16:15:52 -0400] lrr: i'll just redo this computer and use the same roles as in vagrant to see if i can get the openrc
[2014-04-29 16:15:56 -0400] mancdaz: lrr try admin/admin
[2014-04-29 16:16:17 -0400] mancdaz: openrc gets dropped by the nova-common recipe in the compute cookbook
[2014-04-29 16:16:35 -0400] lrr: ah
[2014-04-29 16:16:37 -0400] lrr: ok
[2014-04-29 16:16:43 -0400] mancdaz: you'vegot no compute roles/recipes anywhere
[2014-04-29 16:16:54 -0400] lrr: yep
[2014-04-29 16:17:16 -0400] lrr: i'm doing a manual piece together to create a 1 controller + n compute node setup
[2014-04-29 16:17:25 -0400] mancdaz: even though that node is not going to be a compute node, it still  needs to run a bunch of compute services
[2014-04-29 16:17:32 -0400] lrr: yeah
[2014-04-29 16:17:52 -0400] lrr: i'm not done with it yet ;)
[2014-04-29 16:18:04 -0400] lrr: but thanks for the help. it's much appreciated
[2014-04-29 16:18:10 -0400] mancdaz: might be worth looking at the vagrant-multi-neutron vagrantfile and copying roles from there
[2014-04-29 16:18:22 -0400] mancdaz: that provisions a controller plus a compute
[2014-04-29 16:24:40 -0400] lrr: thanks! :)
[2014-04-29 17:07:17 -0400] lrr: what is this error related to: http://pastebin.osuosl.org/6966/
[2014-04-29 17:07:37 -0400] lrr: it seems when keystone was setup, it didn't create member stuff correclty for the admin user?
[2014-04-29 17:08:13 -0400] lrr: i cannot create different projects
[2014-04-29 17:08:15 -0400] lrr: :(

[2014-04-29 17:32:57 -0400] lrr: actually, i think it may be because i forgot the registration recipe
[2014-04-29 17:39:45 -0400] lrr: nope. same error when trying to create a new project
