[2014-04-17 08:18:07 -0400] openstackgerrit: Darren Birkett proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image: Allow binding locally to different IP than endpoint IP  https://review.openstack.org/86619
[2014-04-17 08:40:31 -0400] mancdaz: andymccr: please could you take a look https://review.openstack.org/#/c/88211/
[2014-04-17 08:40:43 -0400] mancdaz: and any other cores online?
[2014-04-17 08:40:45 -0400] andymccr: i refuse!!
[2014-04-17 08:42:00 -0400] andymccr: is that because some changes went into other stable repos?
[2014-04-17 08:46:09 -0400] mancdaz: andymccr that is correct
[2014-04-17 08:46:37 -0400] mancdaz: I almost wonder if we need to lock to specific shas, or just to the repo stable/havana branches
[2014-04-17 08:46:56 -0400] mancdaz: cos every single update to any cookbook is goping to require an update to this parent repo berksfile.lock
[2014-04-17 08:51:16 -0400] andymccr: repo stable branch seems more sensible in my opinion
[2014-04-17 08:53:30 -0400] mancdaz: yeah, then you just assume that each repo commit was itself reviewed and gated, and the parent repo then always gets the latest commit for that cookbook in the stable branch
[2014-04-17 08:53:52 -0400] mancdaz: or when we have proper CI gating, you could have a post commit hook that updates the Berksfile.lock
[2014-04-17 08:55:07 -0400] andymccr: well i feel like CI is a pretty important piece.

[2014-04-17 18:09:24 -0400] markvan: galstrom: yup, so does anybody mess with changing them?   Seems like if we get into that game, we need it across the cookbooks.

[2014-04-17 18:10:15 -0400] galstrom: that is the merge for it.. i can not find the original review though
[2014-04-17 18:10:20 -0400] galstrom: i still dont think we need it
[2014-04-17 18:11:37 -0400] markvan: yeah, I don't see a need for this.   If we want to go into that business, I would think a new policy lwrp would be needed.
[2014-04-17 18:12:09 -0400] markvan: galstrom: Ok, I go the route of removing then and see if anyone speaks up in the reviews with a use case.
