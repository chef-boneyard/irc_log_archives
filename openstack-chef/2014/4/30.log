[2014-04-30 13:45:25 -0400] mancdaz: lrr try using the role os-compute-single-controller
[2014-04-30 13:45:37 -0400] mancdaz: that gives you all the right roles, since it is a meta role
[2014-04-30 14:31:19 -0400] lrr: mancdaz: i used that yesterday and things seem to be working. I did have to do a replacement of "Member" to "_member_" in /etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings in order for me to be able to modify/add/remove projects
[2014-04-30 14:34:03 -0400] lrr: mancdaz: the next step I need to do is figure out how to change the IP of the endpoints from 127.0.0.1 to the public IP of the controller node
[2014-04-30 14:34:42 -0400] mancdaz: lrr in your env, you need to set ['openstack']['endpoints']['host'] = <controllerip>
[2014-04-30 14:35:12 -0400] mancdaz: that's a kind of meta attribute that sets all of the individual endpoint IPs to that same host
[2014-04-30 14:35:50 -0400] mancdaz: lrr https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L142
[2014-04-30 14:36:00 -0400] mancdaz: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L149
[2014-04-30 14:36:01 -0400] mancdaz: etc
[2014-04-30 14:36:21 -0400] lrr: aha!
[2014-04-30 14:36:28 -0400] lrr: thanks! :)
[2014-04-30 14:37:23 -0400] lrr: is the openstack-chef gerrit still accepting patches for the stable/havana branch?
[2014-04-30 14:37:43 -0400] mancdaz: lrr yes
[2014-04-30 14:38:08 -0400] mancdaz: just do 'git-review stable/havana'
[2014-04-30 14:38:16 -0400] lrr: ok. once I get this setup and figured out, I'll be submitting a few patches.
[2014-04-30 14:38:23 -0400] mancdaz: lrr excellent
[2014-04-30 14:39:12 -0400] mancdaz: lrr if the patches are likely to be applicable to icehouse, could I ask that you also submit patches to the current master branch
[2014-04-30 14:39:21 -0400] mancdaz: else your patches will not get carried forward
[2014-04-30 14:39:36 -0400] lrr: mancdaz: yeah sure thing
[2014-04-30 14:39:51 -0400] lrr: i just know right now in the havana branch the rdo pgp key location is no longer valid
[2014-04-30 14:40:09 -0400] mancdaz: k
[2014-04-30 14:40:32 -0400] lrr: since redhat moved it to a different location on their github

[2014-04-30 15:05:00 -0400] openstackgerrit: Mark Vanderwiel proposed a change to stackforge/openstack-chef-repo: Add in new openrc to all in one  https://review.openstack.org/87770
[2014-04-30 15:12:26 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: do you have neutron ml2/ovs/gre working on multinode?
[2014-04-30 15:12:40 -0400] mancdaz: from what I can see, some config is missing from our ml2 ini template
[2014-04-30 15:14:28 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: It's working on redhat with my latest proposed patch.  redhat starts neutron with ml2_conf and plugin.ini, so we can keep the ovs/gre stuff in the ovs conf with that sym link.
[2014-04-30 15:15:02 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: so the ovs config still goes in the openvswitch ini
[2014-04-30 15:16:13 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: yes that seems to be the way to do this.
[2014-04-30 15:16:51 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: ok, since ubuntu doesn't use that symlink the ovs ini doesn't seem to be being picked up/passed to neutron
[2014-04-30 15:16:57 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: but I'm open to better suggestions.  I had tried a patch that would put the ovs stuff in the ml2 conf, but that got messy.
[2014-04-30 15:17:11 -0400] mancdaz: I had managed to get it working by dropping an [ovs] section into the ml2 ini
[2014-04-30 15:17:33 -0400] mancdaz: since it seems the rest of the options in the ovs ini are covered in the ml2 ini
[2014-04-30 15:17:50 -0400] mancdaz: since they are generic to the other l2 mechanisms
[2014-04-30 15:19:00 -0400] mancdaz: markvan any chance I could see the running command for your neutron server?
[2014-04-30 15:19:04 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: humm, I thought that ovs conf was picked up differently on ubuntu for ml2, but looks like I might be wrong here.  It really seems like ML2/ovs was not completed from a base dev conf point of view.
[2014-04-30 15:19:50 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: it starts neutron with the main config file, plus the plugin file (which in this case is ml2)
[2014-04-30 15:20:01 -0400] mancdaz: so it never 'sees' the ovs options in the ovs ini file
[2014-04-30 15:20:16 -0400] markvan: with my patch, it switches that sym link back to OVS.
[2014-04-30 15:20:39 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: so how does it use ml2?
[2014-04-30 15:21:10 -0400] mancdaz: this is what runs when the core_plugin is ml2
[2014-04-30 15:21:17 -0400] mancdaz: '/usr/bin/python /usr/bin/neutron-server --config-file /etc/neutron/neutron.conf --log-file /var/log/neutron/server.log --config-file /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini'
[2014-04-30 15:23:02 -0400] markvan: --config-file /etc/neutron/neutron.conf --config-file /etc/neutron/plugin.ini --config-file /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini
[2014-04-30 15:23:29 -0400] markvan: It has the ml2_conf hard coded, and then adds the sym link plugin.ini.
[2014-04-30 15:23:36 -0400] mancdaz: ah
[2014-04-30 15:24:20 -0400] mancdaz: so maybe we just need to work out how to pass both plugin config files as options to neutron-server
[2014-04-30 15:24:27 -0400] mancdaz: in ubuntu
[2014-04-30 15:25:13 -0400] markvan: or, we can go back to trying to dup the needed ovs entries into ml2 conf.
[2014-04-30 15:25:57 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: well it seems cleaner to have plugin specific entries in it's own config file
[2014-04-30 15:26:01 -0400] markvan: not sure what plugini.ini sym link is supposed to be doing in the ml2 case.
[2014-04-30 15:26:27 -0400] mancdaz: though the ovs ini actually needs very little in it as most of it is covered by the generic ml2 options
[2014-04-30 15:26:52 -0400] mancdaz: markvan where is it hardcoded to use the ml2 config?
[2014-04-30 15:26:53 -0400] markvan: yeah, but with ML2, ovs is not really a plugin, is a mechanism, and could be one of many, but that does not fit plugin conf file
[2014-04-30 15:27:29 -0400] mancdaz: so would all other mechanism specific config then need to go into it's own section in the ml2 config
[2014-04-30 15:27:38 -0400] mancdaz: if you weren't using ovs
[2014-04-30 15:28:12 -0400] markvan: humm, that's a good question.  I believe that was the intent, but the base code never got that far it seems.
[2014-04-30 15:28:38 -0400] mancdaz: ok so for now we could just drop an ovs section into the ml2 template?
[2014-04-30 15:29:29 -0400] markvan: yeah, that was my last patch....which I can restore and rebase.
[2014-04-30 15:29:39 -0400] mancdaz: ah ok
[2014-04-30 15:29:45 -0400] mancdaz: sorry I've not seen the patches
[2014-04-30 15:29:59 -0400] markvan: Let me check, there was another issue with that approach, but I don't recall right now.
[2014-04-30 15:30:16 -0400] mancdaz: that means on thel, you can then just let the normal symlink process link to the ml2 plugin
[2014-04-30 15:30:30 -0400] mancdaz: without needing to pass the ovs plugin config
[2014-04-30 15:31:01 -0400] mancdaz: and on ubuntu it just directly loads the specified plugin config
[2014-04-30 15:31:12 -0400] markvan: yes, thats how it worked.  But what about the compute nodes, I think there's an issue there.
[2014-04-30 15:33:10 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: how so
[2014-04-30 15:34:22 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: I believe it's because of how that cookbook uses a common recipe between agents and the server.  It means the server is installed and started on the compute nodes.
[2014-04-30 15:34:40 -0400] markvan: but that's another issue besides these ovs settings.
[2014-04-30 15:34:52 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: no I think the recipe tries to restart the server, and it's not installed, so we just ignore_failure
[2014-04-30 15:34:56 -0400] mancdaz: which is hideous
[2014-04-30 15:35:02 -0400] mancdaz: but I have a plan to fix that
[2014-04-30 15:35:19 -0400] mancdaz: I was about to open a blueprint to do so, and saw that you had already done the same :)
[2014-04-30 15:35:30 -0400] markvan: ah, yeah, that's in there as well, 3 places where the server service is defined.
[2014-04-30 15:35:53 -0400] mancdaz: yeah I will happily work on that patch, unless you have already started
[2014-04-30 15:35:56 -0400] markvan: yes, we need to flush out the blueprint a bit more to try to get this cleaned up.
[2014-04-30 15:36:39 -0400] markvan: in the mean time, I can restore my other patch that simple adds the ovs section to the ml2 conf.
[2014-04-30 15:36:41 -0400] mancdaz: i think moving to a model where the service  subscribes to the relevant configs
[2014-04-30 15:36:54 -0400] mancdaz: and getting all the plugin specific stuff out of common
[2014-04-30 15:37:15 -0400] mancdaz: and into the plugin recipes, where they can just include common
[2014-04-30 15:37:28 -0400] markvan: agreed, and I would like to see the conf work for the server/old plugins/agents pushed put to there own recipes, not in common.
[2014-04-30 15:37:45 -0400] mancdaz: markvan: yup
[2014-04-30 15:38:12 -0400] mancdaz: though I think the main neutron.conf would sit in common
[2014-04-30 15:38:21 -0400] markvan: ok, let me get that patch restored.    Please go ahead and add more details to that blueprint.
[2014-04-30 15:38:40 -0400] mancdaz: since you still need it even when you're not running server
[2014-04-30 15:38:45 -0400] mancdaz: ok sounds like a plan
[2014-04-30 15:39:05 -0400] markvan: yes, I believe main neutron conf is needed in all three cases (server ml2, server old plugin, agents)

[2014-04-30 16:26:53 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: What does the cmd to start the ovs agent look like on ubuntu?  what conf files are ref'd?
[2014-04-30 16:35:01 -0400] markvan: mancdaz: It appears that the doc might be wrong, and those OVS items are needed by the agent, not the server, so no need for them in the ml2 conf.  Can you confirm that.
