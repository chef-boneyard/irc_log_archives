[2014-04-23 19:06:06 -0400] retr0h: spheromak: yo
[2014-04-23 19:06:31 -0400] spheromak: retr0h: yo
[2014-04-23 19:06:46 -0400] retr0h: have you gotten vagrant-chef-zero to work in vagrant 1.5?
[2014-04-23 19:07:51 -0400] spheromak: retr0h: haven't been using it, but old co-worker has not afaik
[2014-04-23 19:08:37 -0400] retr0h: spheromak: okay.. off to dig in heh
[2014-04-23 19:08:53 -0400] retr0h: seems busted for me.. so will need to figure out why
[2014-04-23 19:09:07 -0400] spheromak: ill ping said coworker and see if hes made progress
[2014-04-23 19:09:57 -0400] retr0h: sure no worries... i was fighting with chef-solo vagrant provisioner and the apt cookbook
[2014-04-23 19:10:02 -0400] retr0h: so figured i'd go chef-zero route
[2014-04-23 19:10:12 -0400] retr0h: I just keep getting bit by stuff not working LOL
[2014-04-23 19:10:33 -0400] mattray: hmm I'm using 1.4.3
[2014-04-23 19:10:46 -0400] mattray: (and it works)
[2014-04-23 19:10:52 -0400] retr0h: 1.4.3 vagrant?
[2014-04-23 19:11:40 -0400] spheromak: retr0h: looks like they have started using metal
[2014-04-23 19:11:48 -0400] retr0h: yeah, 1.5 vagrant is quite different
[2014-04-23 19:12:29 -0400] spheromak: retr0h: i've been using goiardi for tesitng stuff. easy to setup test env, and  feature complete (cept like 1 api endpoint for webui)
[2014-04-23 19:12:51 -0400] spheromak: also supports auth, which i need for the chef-golang stuff
[2014-04-23 19:13:16 -0400] retr0h: man.. i play with ansible for a few months and when I come back everything is different LOL
[2014-04-23 19:13:22 -0400] spheromak: :)
[2014-04-23 19:13:26 -0400] spheromak: shit moves fast
[2014-04-23 19:13:41 -0400] retr0h: hehe
[2014-04-23 19:13:52 -0400] spheromak: tho goiardi is pretty fringe i would think
[2014-04-23 19:14:02 -0400] spheromak: I think only me and the author use it daily
[2014-04-23 19:14:13 -0400] mattray: spheromak: yeah, pretty fringe but cool
[2014-04-23 19:14:29 -0400] spheromak: mattray: sql backend, and the indexer is instant
[2014-04-23 19:14:43 -0400] retr0h: maybe i should use that
[2014-04-23 19:14:43 -0400] mattray: that's cool
[2014-04-23 19:14:55 -0400] retr0h: i'm setting this vagrant up for a go project anyways lol
[2014-04-23 19:14:56 -0400] spheromak: mysql backend is still verry early
[2014-04-23 19:14:57 -0400] mattray: zero's indexer is fast too ;)
[2014-04-23 19:15:15 -0400] spheromak: i setup a test  tho for the chef-golang which has pre-seeded sserver data
[2014-04-23 19:15:39 -0400] spheromak: https://github.com/spheromak/chef-golang/blob/testing/test/support/start_server.sh
[2014-04-23 19:15:44 -0400] retr0h: golang + kafka == my sensu/nagios and logstash killer :P
[2014-04-23 19:15:45 -0400] retr0h: heh
[2014-04-23 19:15:48 -0400] spheromak: pre-setup keys and data
[2014-04-23 19:16:08 -0400] spheromak: retr0h: lol thats where we were ehaded @ kt
[2014-04-23 19:16:29 -0400] spheromak: prob exact same thoughts, just use kafka as the data mover for all events
[2014-04-23 19:16:42 -0400] spheromak: and attach consumers on topics for whatever thing.
[2014-04-23 19:16:48 -0400] retr0h: yeah
[2014-04-23 19:16:51 -0400] retr0h: its mostly for fun
[2014-04-23 19:16:52 -0400] retr0h: to learn golang
[2014-04-23 19:16:56 -0400] spheromak: yea good stuff
[2014-04-23 19:16:59 -0400] retr0h: but hope it turns out to be more
[2014-04-23 19:17:02 -0400] spheromak: also you could just rewrite sensu server
[2014-04-23 19:17:19 -0400] retr0h: yeah, but i dont like how sensu requires redis
[2014-04-23 19:17:21 -0400] spheromak: it could see health perf increase
[2014-04-23 19:17:28 -0400] spheromak: don't need to have that
[2014-04-23 19:17:40 -0400] spheromak: just for the lookback / event count
[2014-04-23 19:17:55 -0400] spheromak: I don't like that it requires rabbit ;)
[2014-04-23 19:18:06 -0400] spheromak: but yea both those things should/could be pluggable
[2014-04-23 19:18:19 -0400] retr0h: yeah me either
[2014-04-23 19:18:24 -0400] spheromak: I also don't like hainvg a bazzilion checks that sping ruby up
[2014-04-23 19:18:29 -0400] spheromak: *spin
[2014-04-23 19:18:32 -0400] retr0h: openstack has made me hate rabbit lol
[2014-04-23 19:18:38 -0400] spheromak: but the in-process checks make things better
[2014-04-23 19:18:40 -0400] spheromak: retr0h: same ;)
[2014-04-23 19:18:44 -0400] mattt: luisg__: i am now
[2014-04-23 19:18:52 -0400] retr0h: plus if u cant HA rabbit
[2014-04-23 19:18:55 -0400] retr0h: with sensu
[2014-04-23 19:18:59 -0400] retr0h: whats the point of using sensu
[2014-04-23 19:19:07 -0400] retr0h: they rely on a single rabbit endpoint
[2014-04-23 19:19:09 -0400] spheromak: but then your running ruby daemon and other things in-process and the mem-leak monster will eat you
[2014-04-23 19:19:30 -0400] spheromak: ya fixable tho
[2014-04-23 19:19:33 -0400] luisg__: mattray, hey sorry i was having a hard time running glance with qpid after the latest changes
[2014-04-23 19:19:45 -0400] retr0h: yeah it is.. i just rather play in my own yard for a while
[2014-04-23 19:19:48 -0400] luisg__: sorry not mattray, ^ mattt
[2014-04-23 19:19:51 -0400] luisg__: :)
[2014-04-23 19:19:59 -0400] luisg__: but i think i found the problem https://review.openstack.org/#/c/89918/
[2014-04-23 19:20:04 -0400] retr0h: once I get the problem more.. can think about adding kafka work to sensu
[2014-04-23 19:20:22 -0400] spheromak: retr0h: i feel ya. I've been refactoring the chef-golang stuff since summit. hopefully have an announce on something fun i've been working on soon
[2014-04-23 19:20:36 -0400] retr0h: oh nice
[2014-04-23 19:20:50 -0400] retr0h: well will deff see u at the summit
[2014-04-23 19:20:53 -0400] mattt: luisg__: yeah, transport_url ... we don't set that do we?
[2014-04-23 19:21:06 -0400] luisg__: it was set to transport_host
[2014-04-23 19:21:14 -0400] spheromak: er sorry since conf.. summit next!
[2014-04-23 19:21:14 -0400] mattt: luisg__: son of a :(
[2014-04-23 19:21:22 -0400] luisg__: hehe
[2014-04-23 19:21:34 -0400] luisg__: shuld be good now
[2014-04-23 19:21:45 -0400] spheromak: retr0h: yea dunno if we met in person before. me and ctracey hung out alot @ the conf this year.
[2014-04-23 19:22:17 -0400] retr0h: spheromak: I think we met in portland for 5 min - you told me about razor
[2014-04-23 19:22:48 -0400] retr0h: yeah, we have the ctracey buddy in common heh
[2014-04-23 19:22:59 -0400] retr0h: ctracey: :P
[2014-04-23 19:23:15 -0400] mattt: luisg__: thanks for fixing, what a shoddy patch i put through :(
[2014-04-23 19:23:45 -0400] luisg__: sure np
[2014-04-23 19:24:08 -0400] mattt: luisg__when we actually get gating going, we should maybe look at doing a qpid gate also
[2014-04-23 19:24:29 -0400] luisg__: mattt, yeah that would be helpful
[2014-04-23 20:27:21 -0400] mattray: Is anyone using the keystone API through Vagrant?
[2014-04-23 20:27:36 -0400] mattray: I can hit the dashboard, but not keystone
[2014-04-23 21:33:39 -0400] galstrom: mattray: which vagrant file?
[2014-04-23 21:34:11 -0400] galstrom: mattray: cause i dont see any forwarded ports for keystone in the vagrant files
[2014-04-23 21:34:17 -0400] mattray: aio-nova is what I'm using
[2014-04-23 21:34:32 -0400] galstrom: https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo/blob/master/Vagrantfile-aio-nova#L59-L62
[2014-04-23 21:34:45 -0400] galstrom: you will need a forward port for port 5000 and 35357
[2014-04-23 21:34:51 -0400] mattray: oh yeah, I haven't committed these
[2014-04-23 21:34:54 -0400] galstrom: :)
[2014-04-23 21:35:00 -0400] mattray: 35357?
[2014-04-23 21:35:09 -0400] mattray: that must be what I'm missing
[2014-04-23 21:35:10 -0400] galstrom: v2 api.. admin port
[2014-04-23 21:35:20 -0400] galstrom: v2 api (5000) is user port
[2014-04-23 21:35:31 -0400] mattray: yeah, 5000 isn't working
[2014-04-23 21:36:21 -0400] galstrom: 5000 is basically for user token generation and token scoping
[2014-04-23 21:36:31 -0400] galstrom: 35357 is for all of the crud actions
[2014-04-23 21:36:49 -0400] mattray: that must be what I'm missing. Assuming this works I'll finally put it back in :)
[2014-04-23 21:37:14 -0400] galstrom: :)
[2014-04-23 21:54:25 -0400] mattray: galstrom: no love
[2014-04-23 21:54:33 -0400] galstrom: hm..
[2014-04-23 21:54:38 -0400] galstrom: what are your forwards?
[2014-04-23 21:54:51 -0400] galstrom: and what are you using that is failing on keystone?
[2014-04-23 21:54:58 -0400] galstrom: nova cli?
[2014-04-23 21:55:00 -0400] mattray: https://gist.github.com/11233768
[2014-04-23 21:55:08 -0400] mattray: knife-openstack
[2014-04-23 21:55:11 -0400] mattray: works inside the vm
[2014-04-23 21:55:20 -0400] mattray: dashboard works
[2014-04-23 21:58:13 -0400] galstrom: mattray: what does your service catalog look like?
[2014-04-23 21:58:50 -0400] galstrom: keystone catalog from inside the vm
[2014-04-23 22:00:10 -0400] mattray: https://gist.github.com/mattray/11233927
[2014-04-23 22:00:59 -0400] galstrom: mattray: when you are running knife-openstack what is the address you are pointing it at?
[2014-04-23 22:01:17 -0400] mattray: I've tried a couple, including 127.0.0.1
[2014-04-23 22:01:39 -0400] galstrom: mattray: firing up a vagrant
[2014-04-23 22:02:13 -0400] mattray: I can hit 127.0.0.1:8443 for the admin console
[2014-04-23 22:02:25 -0400] mattray: err, dashboard
[2014-04-23 22:03:26 -0400] mattray: galstrom: I've gotta go get my son from school, thanks for looking into it. If we can sort it out I think it'll be easier for testing weird network variations for knife-openstack
[2014-04-23 22:03:35 -0400] galstrom: ok
[2014-04-23 22:03:36 -0400] mattray: right now my network choices are vanilla
[2014-04-23 22:04:53 -0400] mattray: I'm also using the stable/havana branch FWIW
[2014-04-23 22:05:27 -0400] galstrom: ok
