[2014-03-14 03:06:36 -0400] zhiwei: galstrom: hi
[2014-03-14 03:06:49 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: hey
[2014-03-14 03:07:08 -0400] zhiwei: I want to add db2 server.rb recipe to ops-database cookbook.
[2014-03-14 03:07:26 -0400] zhiwei: but need also add db2 cookbook depends to metadata.rb file.
[2014-03-14 03:07:40 -0400] zhiwei: and db2 cookbook is not opensourced
[2014-03-14 03:08:16 -0400] zhiwei: I wonder if I can add the service recipe without add db2 cookbook to ops-database/metadata.rb file.
[2014-03-14 03:08:26 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: so if there is not an opensource db2 cookbook available, you will never get a review accepted with that as a dependency in the metadata file
[2014-03-14 03:08:43 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: does the db2 server.rb recipe do anything without the db2 cookbook?
[2014-03-14 03:08:55 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: i doubt that will pass a review either
[2014-03-14 03:09:20 -0400] zhiwei: this service.rb recipe only contains a db2 install lwrp.
[2014-03-14 03:09:28 -0400] zhiwei: no other code
[2014-03-14 03:09:57 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: and the lwrp is provided by the db2 cookbook
[2014-03-14 03:10:02 -0400] zhiwei: yes
[2014-03-14 03:10:15 -0400] galstrom: yeah.. that does not sound like something that will get passed a review
[2014-03-14 03:10:29 -0400] galstrom: can i ask why the db2 cookbook is not opensourced?
[2014-03-14 03:11:08 -0400] zhiwei: I don't really know the reasons, but I already wrote it.
[2014-03-14 03:11:17 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: fair enough
[2014-03-14 03:14:03 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: i am not sure about the other core reviewers, but I personally would not vote to allow a dependencie on a non opensourced cookbook
[2014-03-14 03:14:52 -0400] galstrom: but others might feel differently
[2014-03-14 03:15:13 -0400] zhiwei: I meant I can leave the dependency blank, and only add the lwrp to db2 server.rb recipe.
[2014-03-14 03:15:46 -0400] zhiwei: and if we use ops-database cookbook, we can manually add the dependency.
[2014-03-14 03:17:17 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: so you end up having a recipe.. that calls a LWRP from a cookbook that no one has access to, and is not opensourced
[2014-03-14 03:17:29 -0400] galstrom: not sure that would work either
[2014-03-14 03:17:44 -0400] galstrom: by work i mean pass a review
[2014-03-14 03:18:22 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: not real sure what the best answer is in that situation
[2014-03-14 03:18:43 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: obviously the best possible solution would be to opensource the db2 cookbook..
[2014-03-14 03:18:47 -0400] zhiwei: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/libraries/database.rb#L65
[2014-03-14 03:19:06 -0400] galstrom: but i get that is not necessarilly something that can happen, or will take a long time to happen
[2014-03-14 03:19:07 -0400] zhiwei: yes, I want opensource it.
[2014-03-14 03:19:21 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: :)
[2014-03-14 03:19:44 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: i know it sometimes takes a long time to go through the legal team to get permission to do that
[2014-03-14 03:19:57 -0400] zhiwei: yes
[2014-03-14 03:20:07 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: hm.. so that already went through
[2014-03-14 03:21:19 -0400] zhiwei: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-telemetry/blob/master/recipes/common.rb#L46
[2014-03-14 03:21:24 -0400] zhiwei: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/libraries/endpoints.rb#L82
[2014-03-14 03:21:46 -0400] zhiwei: galstrom: can you open these two URLs?
[2014-03-14 03:22:10 -0400] galstrom: yes
[2014-03-14 03:23:00 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: also.. i did the original review on the libraries/database.rb
[2014-03-14 03:23:13 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: i completely missed the db2 lwrp call
[2014-03-14 03:23:39 -0400] galstrom: i should have raised my objection at that time
[2014-03-14 03:23:47 -0400] zhiwei: oh. So you said you would not approve .
[2014-03-14 03:24:04 -0400] zhiwei: :) it's late.
[2014-03-14 03:24:18 -0400] galstrom: zhiwei: very true.. since it is already in the code
[2014-03-14 03:25:00 -0400] zhiwei: I think I should put this lwrp to commit message
[2014-03-14 03:25:16 -0400] zhiwei: so you can easily see it.
[2014-03-14 03:25:17 -0400] galstrom: haha
[2014-03-14 03:25:26 -0400] zhiwei: I am sorry for this.
[2014-03-14 03:25:31 -0400] galstrom: not a problem
[2014-03-14 03:25:39 -0400] galstrom: this is how it goes sometimes
[2014-03-14 03:25:59 -0400] zhiwei: I am not really know the differences between metering and telemetry.
[2014-03-14 03:26:04 -0400] galstrom: plus i am just one reviewer.. 2 other reviewers can overrule my opinion
[2014-03-14 03:26:05 -0400] galstrom: :)
[2014-03-14 03:26:16 -0400] galstrom: that is how it is supposed to work..
[2014-03-14 03:26:20 -0400] zhiwei: maybe
[2014-03-14 03:26:28 -0400] galstrom: metering was renamed to telemetry this week
[2014-03-14 03:26:38 -0400] zhiwei: I know this.
[2014-03-14 03:26:49 -0400] galstrom: oh.. ok
[2014-03-14 03:27:05 -0400] zhiwei: but the ceilometer's default service name is still metering.
[2014-03-14 03:27:16 -0400] galstrom: um..
[2014-03-14 03:27:19 -0400] zhiwei: service_type is still metering
[2014-03-14 03:27:23 -0400] galstrom: that actually changed this afternoon i think
[2014-03-14 03:27:54 -0400] galstrom: nevermind
[2014-03-14 03:27:59 -0400] galstrom: that is still a true statement
[2014-03-14 03:28:13 -0400] galstrom: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-telemetry/blob/master/recipes/identity_registration.rb#L72
[2014-03-14 03:28:45 -0400] zhiwei: yes, I leaved this to metering.
[2014-03-14 03:28:59 -0400] zhiwei: but here https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-telemetry/blob/master/recipes/common.rb#L46, I changed to telemetry.
[2014-03-14 03:30:08 -0400] galstrom: yeah.. that seems right
[2014-03-14 03:30:11 -0400] zhiwei: should I changed back to metering? or change https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/libraries/endpoints.rb#L82 to telemetry?
[2014-03-14 03:30:14 -0400] galstrom: will work for a new install
[2014-03-14 03:31:06 -0400] galstrom: hm..
[2014-03-14 03:31:19 -0400] zhiwei: Eric Zhou pointed this, https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/libraries/endpoints.rb#L82 and https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-telemetry/blob/master/recipes/common.rb#L46 has the different value.
[2014-03-14 03:31:40 -0400] zhiwei: need a patch to correct this.
[2014-03-14 03:31:57 -0400] galstrom: so.. if i am reading the common.rb right.. you would need to change the if statement in endpoints.rb to be 'telemetry'
[2014-03-14 03:31:59 -0400] zhiwei: But I am not sure which is the best file to correct.
[2014-03-14 03:32:10 -0400] galstrom: that way it will return the other db connection string
[2014-03-14 03:32:43 -0400] galstrom: i was thinking that was pulling the service uri.. for the endpoint
[2014-03-14 03:33:00 -0400] galstrom: since it is creating the db uri.. need to patch endpoints.rb
[2014-03-14 03:34:54 -0400] zhiwei: ok, I will submit the patch for endpoints.rb .

[2014-03-14 05:15:37 -0400] noorul: rather upgrading
[2014-03-14 05:16:09 -0400] noorul: I think it will fail initially.
