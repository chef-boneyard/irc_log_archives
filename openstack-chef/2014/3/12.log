[2014-03-12 15:24:25 -0400] markvan: mrodden: Did you see the https://review.openstack.org/79547  discussion.  Seems like upgrade type scenario which is a whole different focus then whats in the cookbooks now.  Maybe we need to squash these internally first before poluting the community.
[2014-03-12 15:37:00 -0400] mattt: markvan: hey there, so what exactly is the benefit in removing the sorts in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/79437/ ?
[2014-03-12 15:38:49 -0400] markvan: mattt: I was going after consistency here, between the two use cases in the code (input from attributes or from a search).  And then look at making changes in upper code if/when any sorting would be required.
[2014-03-12 15:53:27 -0400] nacer: mmm i have a big table full of token in keystone db
[2014-03-12 15:53:34 -0400] nacer: this does not feel right
[2014-03-12 15:55:23 -0400] markvan: nacer: keystone-manage token-flush  ?

[2014-03-12 15:56:00 -0400] nacer: chef should add a cron for that no ?
[2014-03-12 15:58:03 -0400] nacer: hum i have new token at each chef run ...
[2014-03-12 15:58:17 -0400] nacer: it look like this
[2014-03-12 15:58:21 -0400] nacer: i'm not sure yet
[2014-03-12 16:00:11 -0400] nacer: markvan: tks :)
[2014-03-12 16:16:08 -0400] srenatus: nacer: afaik, no such cron tab entry will be added so far
[2014-03-12 16:16:20 -0400] srenatus: nacer: it'd be a nice addition when the keystone token backend in use is sql
[2014-03-12 16:48:39 -0400] mattt: markvan: ok, thanks  need to look more closely when i get a sec !
[2014-03-12 19:55:05 -0400] mrodden: markvan: re: https://review.openstack.org/79547 , seems like they are wanting to use the cookbooks to do cleanup on old installs that aren't chef deploys....
[2014-03-12 19:55:28 -0400] mrodden: which i think is outside the scope of community cookbooks
[2014-03-12 20:58:45 -0400] markvan: mrodden: I agree, current assumption is a fairly clean slate.
