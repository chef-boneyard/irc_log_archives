[2014-03-26 15:28:44 -0400] galstrom: mattray: sorry.. just got online
[2014-03-26 15:31:25 -0400] mattray: galstrom: no worries, things seem to be tracking well
[2014-03-26 15:33:33 -0400] galstrom: yeah.. so the one bug in havana-rc1 has merged.. but it was a partial..
[2014-03-26 15:33:51 -0400] galstrom: but the bug is templates for compute cookbook
[2014-03-26 15:34:15 -0400] galstrom: and the commit seems to address the compute cookbook..
[2014-03-26 15:34:21 -0400] galstrom: so i would vote that as completed
[2014-03-26 15:35:15 -0400] galstrom: are there any outstanding reviews that are blocking the branching?
[2014-03-26 15:36:42 -0400] galstrom: mattray: ^^
[2014-03-26 15:37:43 -0400] mattray: galstrom: there was some talk about trying to get https://review.openstack.org/#/c/80795/ in today
[2014-03-26 15:37:55 -0400] galstrom: yeah.. i was just reading that one
[2014-03-26 15:37:56 -0400] mattray: markvan: salmanbaset_: ^^
[2014-03-26 15:38:17 -0400] mattray: the other 2 reviews for that blueprint are done, that was the only one we ID'd as a candidate
[2014-03-26 15:38:34 -0400] galstrom: so minus a test for the cache_mode if block in the template that one looks good
[2014-03-26 15:40:15 -0400] galstrom: mattray: so i would be ok.. accepting that one with out tests.. and filing a bug for adding tests around that bit
[2014-03-26 15:41:35 -0400] mattray: yeah, let's see if they plan on checking in tests today or if we should merge and go
[2014-03-26 15:44:36 -0400] salmanbaset_: mattray: i checked with bill
[2014-03-26 15:44:50 -0400] salmanbaset_: he will try to submit a patch eod (california time:)
