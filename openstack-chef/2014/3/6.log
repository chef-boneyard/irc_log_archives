[2014-03-06 16:22:17 -0500] mancdaz: markvan: that fixes the no-innodb table issues for neutron
[2014-03-06 16:22:23 -0500] mancdaz: or at least the ones I saw
[2014-03-06 16:22:46 -0500] nacer: iartarisi: my bad for the link with the wrong bug report
[2014-03-06 16:22:46 -0500] markvan: mancdaz: hey that looks promising
[2014-03-06 16:23:41 -0500] iartarisi: nacer: no worries
[2014-03-06 16:24:42 -0500] mancdaz: iartarisi: that would be me
[2014-03-06 16:25:08 -0500] iartarisi: mancdaz: ah :)
[2014-03-06 16:25:13 -0500] mancdaz: markvan: if that goes in, I think it would be a good candidate for havana backport
[2014-03-06 16:25:44 -0500] mancdaz: but that won't be quick
[2014-03-06 16:25:57 -0500] iartarisi: mancdaz: so I Was looking at https://review.openstack.org/#/c/71854 and was wondering if there should be a final-my.cnf template in that commit as well
[2014-03-06 16:26:03 -0500] iartarisi: also wondering why jenkins didn't fail
[2014-03-06 16:26:45 -0500] markvan: mancdaz: yeah, I was going to suggest that in the bug.  thx for the updates.
[2014-03-06 16:26:46 -0500] mancdaz: iartarisi: no because the template exists in the upstream cookbook
[2014-03-06 16:28:01 -0500] iartarisi: mancdaz: ah, that's the answer I was looking for, but why didn't jenkins fail?
[2014-03-06 16:28:21 -0500] mancdaz: iartarisi: sorry - the template doesn't exist, but the resource named 'final-my.cnf' does
[2014-03-06 16:28:27 -0500] mancdaz: in the upstream cookbook
[2014-03-06 16:28:34 -0500] mancdaz: and that's what we're effectively rewinding
[2014-03-06 16:28:51 -0500] mancdaz: iartarisi: why would jenkins fail?
[2014-03-06 16:29:02 -0500] iartarisi: because it can't find the template
[2014-03-06 16:29:10 -0500] iartarisi: @chef_run.template 'final-my.cnf'
[2014-03-06 16:29:41 -0500] iartarisi: it fails for me locally
[2014-03-06 16:29:51 -0500] mancdaz: well the template resource exists
[2014-03-06 16:30:09 -0500] iartarisi: actually it fails at:
[2014-03-06 16:30:10 -0500] iartarisi: 50>> r = resources("template[#{mycnf_template}]")
[2014-03-06 16:30:13 -0500] iartarisi: in recipes/mysql-server.rb
[2014-03-06 16:30:25 -0500] iartarisi: Cannot find a resource matching template[final-my.cnf] (did you define it
[2014-03-06 16:30:25 -0500] iartarisi: first?)
[2014-03-06 16:30:35 -0500] mancdaz: iartarisi: on suse?
[2014-03-06 16:31:03 -0500] iartarisi: i don't know if it matters that it's suse, I'm doing bundle exec rspec
[2014-03-06 16:31:27 -0500] mancdaz: iartarisi: hrm
[2014-03-06 16:32:06 -0500] mancdaz: it should not fail since that resource does exist when rhel is the platform
[2014-03-06 16:32:20 -0500] mancdaz: since it gets defined by the mysql cookbook
[2014-03-06 16:33:23 -0500] mancdaz: iartarisi: and it works for me locally
[2014-03-06 16:33:39 -0500] mancdaz: running bundle exec, that is
[2014-03-06 16:34:09 -0500] mancdaz: I do wonder though if that recipe would fail in a real world run on suse
[2014-03-06 16:34:23 -0500] mancdaz: since we are not handling it
[2014-03-06 16:35:20 -0500] iartarisi: it would probably not fail in the real world indeed
[2014-03-06 16:35:40 -0500] mancdaz: iartarisi: I was thinking it would
[2014-03-06 16:35:50 -0500] iartarisi: oh? :)
[2014-03-06 16:35:53 -0500] mancdaz: since we don't actually set the variable to anything
[2014-03-06 16:35:58 -0500] iartarisi: maybe I just need to do a bundle update
[2014-03-06 16:36:12 -0500] iartarisi: bundle exec berks update that is
[2014-03-06 16:36:15 -0500] iartarisi: or somesuch
[2014-03-06 16:36:19 -0500] mancdaz: mycnf_template never gets set on a suse run
[2014-03-06 16:36:31 -0500] mancdaz: so the search for the resource should fail
[2014-03-06 16:36:39 -0500] openstackgerrit: Mark Vanderwiel proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: Remove unused package attributes  https://review.openstack.org/78659
[2014-03-06 16:36:40 -0500] iartarisi: ah, good point
[2014-03-06 16:36:44 -0500] mancdaz: I don't even know what the template would be on suse
[2014-03-06 16:36:57 -0500] mancdaz: since there is no recipe in the upstream cookbook for suse
[2014-03-06 16:37:09 -0500] mancdaz: iartarisi: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql/blob/master/recipes/server.rb
[2014-03-06 16:37:11 -0500] iartarisi: the fact is I never test mysql on SLES
[2014-03-06 16:37:17 -0500] mancdaz: AH
[2014-03-06 16:37:21 -0500] mancdaz: that would explain it
[2014-03-06 16:37:42 -0500] mancdaz: I did wonder how mysql ever got installed on a SLES system
[2014-03-06 16:37:53 -0500] mancdaz: ok so, that commit is still good :-)
[2014-03-06 16:38:09 -0500] mancdaz: I'd say your spec test fails are probably local issues, as you said
[2014-03-06 16:38:16 -0500] iartarisi: hm, right

I don't see it doc'd in the attributes here https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute#attributes .. Am I looking in the wrong place?
