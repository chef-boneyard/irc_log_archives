[2014-03-20 15:04:50 -0400] nacer: srenatus: hi
[2014-03-20 15:05:09 -0400] nacer: srenatus: did you accounter this error when having swap into vm
[2014-03-20 15:05:12 -0400] nacer: rbd import --pool volumes /var/lib/nova/instances/_base/swap_1024 instance-00000040_disk.swap --new-format --id None --conf /etc/ceph/ceph.conf
[2014-03-20 15:05:24 -0400] nacer: srenatus: i'm telling you this because i use rbd
[2014-03-20 15:05:30 -0400] nacer: notice the --id None
[2014-03-20 15:08:07 -0400] nacer: srenatus: nova.conf miss
[2014-03-20 15:08:10 -0400] nacer: rbd_user=cinder

[2014-03-20 15:15:41 -0400] srenatus: nacer: really? works fine without here
[2014-03-20 15:15:51 -0400] nacer: srenatus: do you use swap ?
[2014-03-20 15:16:12 -0400] srenatus: srenatus: no...is swap supposed to be a cinder volume?
[2014-03-20 15:16:17 -0400] nacer: srenatus: because when you use swap the nova-compute exec ths command
[2014-03-20 15:16:36 -0400] nacer: srenatus: like it is now only libvirt can acces the volume
[2014-03-20 15:17:44 -0400] nacer: srenatus: no , it seem swap is not a cinder volume
[2014-03-20 15:18:01 -0400] nacer: srenatus: i'm only guessing because the compute node try to create the swap volume by himself
[2014-03-20 15:18:11 -0400] srenatus: hmm
[2014-03-20 15:19:36 -0400] nacer: srenatus: i thin we should simply use the same settings in libvirt for nova.conf
[2014-03-20 15:19:58 -0400] srenatus: nacer: probably... who knows what else might depend on that.  I'll push something asap
[2014-03-20 15:20:12 -0400] nacer: srenatus: ok i let you do the fix
[2014-03-20 15:20:53 -0400] nacer: srenatus: yeah maybe snapshoot are in the same scenario

[2014-03-20 15:59:45 -0400] srenatus: oh.
[2014-03-20 15:59:50 -0400] srenatus: nacer: here we go
[2014-03-20 15:59:54 -0400] nacer: srenatus: hehe
[2014-03-20 16:12:16 -0400] nacer: srenatus: mmmm
[2014-03-20 16:12:27 -0400] nacer: why it's not with the other rbd params
[2014-03-20 16:12:53 -0400] nacer: because you have a condition to add rbd param to nova.conf file
[2014-03-20 16:15:01 -0400] nacer: look line 150 of nova.conf
