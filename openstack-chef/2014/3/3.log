[2014-03-03 16:35:32 -0500] mrodden: tripleo is image based provisioning from what i understand
[2014-03-03 16:35:41 -0500] mrodden: its fundamentally different than chef/puppet
[2014-03-03 17:21:41 -0500] nacer: mmmm
[2014-03-03 17:22:34 -0500] nacer: i'm late
[2014-03-03 17:22:48 -0500] nacer: what about the ceph cookbook ?
[2014-03-03 17:26:53 -0500] nacer: i use it
[2014-03-03 17:26:57 -0500] nacer: the ceph cookbook
[2014-03-03 17:28:49 -0500] nacer: it's a good idee !
[2014-03-03 17:29:15 -0500] nacer: my bad
[2014-03-03 17:29:31 -0500] nacer: watching the old stream and thinking it's the live
[2014-03-03 17:30:47 -0500] mattray: nacer: it's happening, I'll get it going
[2014-03-03 18:24:22 -0500] ultimex: Hi all
[2014-03-03 18:24:45 -0500] ultimex: I'm "guilhem" on GH and maintainer of ceph cookbook
[2014-03-03 18:25:13 -0500] ultimex: I just released a new version for anyone to test it
[2014-03-03 18:26:04 -0500] ultimex: If you have any question / remarks don't hesitate to ping me when I'm here or by mail
[2014-03-03 19:36:59 -0500] bpokorny: mattray:  Just wanted to give you a quick update on what mrodden, markvan, and I are doing at IBM to work around not having the Icehouse branch.
[2014-03-03 19:37:48 -0500] bpokorny: We need to keep making progress on Icehouse, so the developers will have their own internal branches to contain changes specific to Icehouse.
[2014-03-03 19:38:30 -0500] bpokorny: So for testing Icehouse, we'll be able to pick up changes from those.
[2014-03-03 19:38:59 -0500] bpokorny: Once the Icehouse branch is created in Stackforge, we'll start submitting what we have for reviews.
[2014-03-03 19:39:35 -0500] bpokorny: We realize there will probably be review comments on what we've got, but it will at least give us a start on submitting changes we've tested.
[2014-03-03 19:40:04 -0500] bpokorny: mrodden: markvan: Anything you want to add to that?
[2014-03-03 19:41:07 -0500] markvan: bpokorny: That's a good summary.
[2014-03-03 19:53:39 -0500] mrodden1: there aren't that many differences between icehouse and havana in terms of configuration details
[2014-03-03 19:54:00 -0500] mrodden1: its would be easy to have the same set be able to deploy both
[2014-03-03 21:49:48 -0500] openstackgerrit: Mark Vanderwiel proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: Remove old database comment lines  https://review.openstack.org/77708
[2014-03-03 22:42:15 -0500] [1]Mr_D: Hey folks, trying to run the tests in cookbook-openstack-common and every test is blowing up with the following error:
[2014-03-03 22:42:17 -0500] [1]Mr_D: undefined local variable or method `expand_run_list' for #<Chef::Client:0x0000000352cda0>
[2014-03-03 22:43:43 -0500] [1]Mr_D: in this example, it blew up on line 45 of ceph_spec.rb: runner.converge(described_recipe)
[2014-03-03 22:44:22 -0500] [1]Mr_D: near as I can tell, there's something wrong with the gems that are being pulled in
[2014-03-03 22:44:25 -0500] [1]Mr_D: any thoughts?
[2014-03-03 23:22:13 -0500] galstrom: markvan: ping
