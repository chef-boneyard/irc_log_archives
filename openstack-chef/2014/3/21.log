[2014-03-21 09:06:50 -0400] nacer: okay srenatus :)
[2014-03-21 09:08:53 -0400] srenatus: nacer: just noticed I had my reply there forgotten in "draft" state...
[2014-03-21 09:09:18 -0400] nacer: srenatus: It work ok awith the openstack fix
[2014-03-21 09:09:52 -0400] srenatus: nacer: cool, thanks for testing
[2014-03-21 09:10:12 -0400] srenatus: nacer: have you found where it's used in nova's code?
[2014-03-21 09:10:20 -0400] nacer: srenatus: i have a DEV openstack cluster with dev vm
[2014-03-21 09:10:35 -0400] nacer: srenatus: non
[2014-03-21 09:10:37 -0400] nacer: srenatus: no
[2014-03-21 09:13:07 -0400] nacer: srenatus: 1/ Creating swap disk
[2014-03-21 09:13:20 -0400] nacer: redrobot: 2 / i think snapshoot too
[2014-03-21 09:13:23 -0400] srenatus: nacer: did it change anything? from looking at the code, rbd_user seems to be used only here: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/volume.py#L217-L228
[2014-03-21 09:14:13 -0400] srenatus: nacer: and these settings would be provided by cinder, as part of netdisk_properties
[2014-03-21 09:14:36 -0400] nacer: srenatus: yeah it work
[2014-03-21 09:14:47 -0400] nacer: srenatus: i can create vm with swapfile now
[2014-03-21 09:14:55 -0400] srenatus: nacer: plus, getting those settings from cinder allows for separate different cinder rbd pools as backends
[2014-03-21 09:15:06 -0400] nacer: srenatus: because it's not  cinder how create swap disk, it's the compute
[2014-03-21 09:15:32 -0400] nacer: rbd -p volumes ls
[2014-03-21 09:15:32 -0400] nacer: instance-00000044_disk.swap
[2014-03-21 09:15:48 -0400] srenatus: nacer: a volume as swap?
[2014-03-21 09:16:02 -0400] srenatus: nacer: I'm still not convinced this is rbd-for-block-storage related
[2014-03-21 09:16:18 -0400] srenatus: nacer: are you using images_type = rbd, too?
[2014-03-21 09:16:27 -0400] srenatus: nacer: that would be swap-related, but totally different
[2014-03-21 09:18:15 -0400] nacer: srenatus: yeah i use images_type rbd
[2014-03-21 09:18:45 -0400] nacer: the compute node created this disk
[2014-03-21 09:18:46 -0400] srenatus: nacer: and you use cinder's cephx credentials for that, too?
[2014-03-21 09:18:57 -0400] nacer: srenatus: yes
[2014-03-21 09:19:14 -0400] srenatus: because "instance-00000044_disk.swap" is not what a volume rbd image would look like, i.e. volume-$ID
[2014-03-21 09:19:32 -0400] nacer: srenatus: i have volume-* too
[2014-03-21 09:19:40 -0400] srenatus: nacer: hehe you've been so right btw
[2014-03-21 09:19:45 -0400] srenatus: rbd_user is used for image_type=rbd
[2014-03-21 09:19:52 -0400] srenatus: and hence should be in the conditional after all
[2014-03-21 09:20:05 -0400] nacer: srenatus: \o/ :)
[2014-03-21 09:20:13 -0400] nacer: srenatus: it's in the ceph + openstack doc
[2014-03-21 09:21:10 -0400] srenatus: nacer: I'll fix the change
[2014-03-21 09:21:37 -0400] nacer: srenatus: so next problem
[2014-03-21 09:22:28 -0400] nacer: i have two attr that seem to tell the same thing
[2014-03-21 09:22:31 -0400] nacer:           "volume_backend": "rbd",
[2014-03-21 09:22:31 -0400] nacer:           "images_type": "rbd",
[2014-03-21 09:22:43 -0400] srenatus: no no no
[2014-03-21 09:22:48 -0400] srenatus: not the same thing
[2014-03-21 09:22:58 -0400] srenatus: for example, we use images_type=lvm with volume_backend=rbd
[2014-03-21 09:23:05 -0400] nacer: oh images is for the source and volumes destination
[2014-03-21 09:23:07 -0400] nacer: ok ok
[2014-03-21 09:23:10 -0400] srenatus: different things.  images_type is where the ephemeral disks will end up
[2014-03-21 09:23:11 -0400] nacer: sound good
[2014-03-21 09:23:11 -0400] nacer: :)
[2014-03-21 09:26:26 -0400] srenatus: oh dear. this calls for another data bag secret...
[2014-03-21 09:26:34 -0400] nacer: yeah
[2014-03-21 09:27:18 -0400] srenatus: I'm not convinced that this feature (of nova) makes sense at all... when you can boot from a volume, why not do that? ;)  can you put swap on a volume?
[2014-03-21 09:27:53 -0400] nacer: srenatus: because openstack only copy the content of image -> volume
[2014-03-21 09:29:22 -0400] nacer: we should have image for swap and nova should ask for a swap volume
[2014-03-21 09:29:28 -0400] nacer: at cinder
[2014-03-21 09:38:50 -0400] srenatus: nacer: this needs another libvirt-secret-define, too...
[2014-03-21 09:39:25 -0400] srenatus: nacer: before I copy the stuff needed for that, it might be better to create a LWRP for libvirt secrets?  Others probably need that, too.
[2014-03-21 09:41:07 -0400] srenatus: nacer: since right now, there's no way to use different users for cinder/nova rbd images anyway, I think I'll refrain from introducing a proper separation now
[2014-03-21 09:41:11 -0400] srenatus: doesnt make much sense.
[2014-03-21 09:52:33 -0400] srenatus: hmm just noticed that the issue is resolved in nova/master
