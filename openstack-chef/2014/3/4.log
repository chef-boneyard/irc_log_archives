[2014-03-04 13:48:35 -0500] nacer: srenatus: grr your patch try to create a ceph.conf
[2014-03-04 13:52:09 -0500] nacer: srenatus: do you think we can remove the   include_recipe 'openstack-common::ceph_client'  from openstack-block-storage/recipes/volume.rb
[2014-03-04 13:52:58 -0500] nacer: because i already have a ceph.conf generated by the ceph cookbook i use on the same node
[2014-03-04 14:06:07 -0500] mattt: iartarisi: ping you there ?  :)
[2014-03-04 14:06:43 -0500] iartarisi: mattt: yes
[2014-03-04 14:07:25 -0500] mattt: iartarisi: can you tell me what the neutron-lbaas-agent service is called on suse ?
[2014-03-04 14:08:00 -0500] iartarisi: openstack-neutron-lbaas-agent
[2014-03-04 14:08:08 -0500] iartarisi: mattt: I thought I already fixed that bug :)
[2014-03-04 14:08:19 -0500] mattt: iartarisi: you fixed packages i believe
[2014-03-04 14:08:31 -0500] mattt: which i thought i looked up correctly for suse, but apparently not
[2014-03-04 14:08:35 -0500] mattt: which is why i figured i'd just ask :D
[2014-03-04 14:09:39 -0500] iartarisi: ah, ok
[2014-03-04 14:11:56 -0500] iartarisi: mattt: the lbaas service doesn't seem to be started explicitly in the cookbook though, is it?
[2014-03-04 14:12:05 -0500] mattt: iartarisi: that's what I'm doing now
[2014-03-04 14:12:19 -0500] mattt: the service itself isn't managed properly
[2014-03-04 14:12:22 -0500] iartarisi: oh, cool :)
[2014-03-04 14:12:27 -0500] mattt: ie. changes to the ini don't restart lbaas agent
[2014-03-04 14:12:58 -0500] mattt: iartarisi: yeah, since i'm updating the attributes file for ubuntu/rhel, figured i'd put the right stuff in for suse

[2014-03-04 14:14:49 -0500] srenatus: nacer: sorry about the ceph.conf.... my assumption was "don't suppose the user is using anything else to manage ceph"
[2014-03-04 14:15:07 -0500] mattt: iartarisi: cool!
[2014-03-04 14:15:08 -0500] nacer: srenatus: yeah we did discuss this
[2014-03-04 14:15:14 -0500] srenatus: nacer: what would you suggest?  a flag maybe?
[2014-03-04 14:15:44 -0500] nacer: srenatus: flag to disable the include yes
[2014-03-04 14:15:56 -0500] nacer: srenatus: seem the easy way

[2014-03-04 14:20:46 -0500] mattt: my bad
[2014-03-04 14:20:53 -0500] srenatus: nacer: I think it's better to make openstack-common::ceph_client not write the template of openstack[ceph][manage_conf] is false
[2014-03-04 14:21:19 -0500] nacer: the package install too
[2014-03-04 14:21:44 -0500] srenatus: hmm then the name is bad.
[2014-03-04 14:22:04 -0500] nacer: setup_client ?
[2014-03-04 14:22:32 -0500] srenatus: nacer: yes. :)

[2014-03-04 14:23:06 -0500] nacer: i'm waiting to +1 the patch
[2014-03-04 14:23:33 -0500] nacer: [erhaps we need to document at least in the attribute file why this flag exist
[2014-03-04 14:24:53 -0500] srenatus: nacer: I'm on it ;)
[2014-03-04 14:25:03 -0500] srenatus: nacer: needs specs too

[2014-03-04 14:26:59 -0500] nacer: ok now i can go back to my openstack/vswitch bug, why my node are dosing each other with GRE packet
[2014-03-04 14:34:35 -0500] DeVVaN: does not seem like there is alot of development beeing done on the object-storage cookbook. maybe we should put toghether a bp for cleaning it up a bit. It's lacking tests for templates and lwrps.
[2014-03-04 14:36:52 -0500] nacer: i feel dirty when i +1 review my own commit
[2014-03-04 14:37:33 -0500] iartarisi: nacer: well you're not supposed to do that :)

[2014-03-04 15:03:42 -0500] nacer: srenatus: i don't understand your comment
[2014-03-04 15:04:13 -0500] nacer: srenatus: your saying that : not_if "ovs-vsctl br-exists #{tun_bridge}"  is going to be executed as a shell command
[2014-03-04 15:04:23 -0500] nacer: i don't think it will
[2014-03-04 15:05:00 -0500] nacer: srenatus:  the use of mixlib is to pass foodcritic
[2014-03-04 15:05:52 -0500] srenatus: nacer: foodcritic complains about not_if shellouts?
[2014-03-04 15:06:08 -0500] srenatus: FC48?
[2014-03-04 15:06:11 -0500] nacer: complain about the use of system()
[2014-03-04 15:06:32 -0500] nacer: yup FC48
[2014-03-04 15:07:16 -0500] srenatus: nacer: second, looking at older patch sets
[2014-03-04 15:07:54 -0500] srenatus: nacer: I think it should be >>not_if "ovs-vsctl br-exists #{tun_bridge}"<<  without any { }
[2014-03-04 15:08:40 -0500] srenatus: and FC48 doesn't apply here
[2014-03-04 15:08:42 -0500] nacer: yes it seem it was like that in previous patch
[2014-03-04 15:08:53 -0500] nacer: i'm changing it nwo
[2014-03-04 15:09:22 -0500] srenatus: the complaint in set #1 was FC026: Conditional execution block attribute contains only string: ./recipes/openvswitch.rb:112
[2014-03-04 15:10:01 -0500] srenatus: and FC048 in l3_agent where system() was used
[2014-03-04 15:10:32 -0500] nacer: srenatus: i did not know that without {} it imply a shell command
[2014-03-04 15:10:44 -0500] nacer: srenatus: i did not notice the previous patch implementation
[2014-03-04 15:10:55 -0500] srenatus: nacer: the normal chef-resource not_if thing takes two possible arguments: a block ("{ return true if coin_flip() == :head }") or a string ("some_fancy_unix_command | grep i-expect-this-output")
[2014-03-04 15:11:19 -0500] srenatus: nacer: right, but the shell command without the {} is no FC violation but a feature ;)
[2014-03-04 15:11:33 -0500] nacer: srenatus: yup, updating ... :)
[2014-03-04 15:11:52 -0500] srenatus: cool and thanks.
