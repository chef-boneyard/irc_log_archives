[2014-03-27 14:46:07 -0400] galstrom: markvan: hola
[2014-03-27 14:46:17 -0400] srenatus: andymccr: thanks
[2014-03-27 14:46:52 -0400] galstrom: andymccr, srenatus: are yall working on an active review?
[2014-03-27 14:47:01 -0400] srenatus: galstrom: not yet
[2014-03-27 14:47:14 -0400] galstrom: ok..
[2014-03-27 14:47:21 -0400] galstrom: so not release blocking?
[2014-03-27 14:47:31 -0400] andymccr: galstrom: nope! its more just a if you run the base network rspec it fails :) but it could be something like berskfile etc etc
[2014-03-27 14:47:51 -0400] galstrom: ah..
[2014-03-27 14:48:13 -0400] galstrom: i have run into that a few times.. berksfile lock file old common cookbook == BOOM!
[2014-03-27 14:48:18 -0400] andymccr: srenatus: i deleted my berksfile.lock did a berks upload and all is happy again
[2014-03-27 14:48:59 -0400] srenatus: andymccr: thanks for the hint, didn't come up with that myself :}
[2014-03-27 14:48:59 -0400] andymccr: galstrom: yeh its usually that :/ i would've been surprised otherwise because a commit went into networking cookbook today and common was lasted updated quite a while ago.
[2014-03-27 14:49:14 -0400] galstrom: :)
[2014-03-27 14:49:16 -0400] andymccr: *last
[2014-03-27 14:50:00 -0400] srenatus: I have to admit that I haven't found time to follow the branching plans -- can I just submit a small bugfix to review or should I rather keep it, waiting for...something...?
[2014-03-27 14:50:03 -0400] galstrom: mattray, markvan: got 3 minutes left on a cleanup review that is gating.. after that you ready for the branching?
[2014-03-27 14:50:17 -0400] galstrom: srenatus: what is the bug fix?
[2014-03-27 14:50:23 -0400] galstrom: and which cookbook?
[2014-03-27 14:50:46 -0400] mattray: galstrom: markvan: I'm available
[2014-03-27 14:50:52 -0400] srenatus: galstrom: openstack-network, neutron-*-agent services don't subscribe to neutron.conf
[2014-03-27 14:51:35 -0400] markvan: galstrom: mattray: yup, ready to help with branching
[2014-03-27 14:52:05 -0400] galstrom: srenatus: if it is a tiny change.. you could do it post branch.. but will have to file against both branches
[2014-03-27 14:52:20 -0400] galstrom: is the bugfix change ready to propose?
[2014-03-27 14:52:43 -0400] srenatus: galstrom: still fighting berkshelf
[2014-03-27 14:52:53 -0400] srenatus: don't wait for me, I'll just do it after the branching
[2014-03-27 14:52:56 -0400] galstrom: srenatus: ok.. then we will go ahead with the branching
[2014-03-27 14:52:57 -0400] galstrom: :)
[2014-03-27 14:52:58 -0400] andymccr: srenatus: try a berks upload --force after removing the berksfile.lock
[2014-03-27 14:53:01 -0400] galstrom: we will help back port it
[2014-03-27 14:53:12 -0400] srenatus: :) thanks
[2014-03-27 14:53:25 -0400] andymccr: i almost want to alias bundle exec rspec to --> rm berksfile.lock; berks upload --force; bundle exec rspec
[2014-03-27 14:53:43 -0400] srenatus: andymccr: ... berks upload?
[2014-03-27 14:56:03 -0400] andymccr: it'll force a re-upload of the cookbooks specified in the Berksfile, but if you have the berksfile.lock it will get "clever" with how it uploads them

[2014-03-27 14:59:15 -0400] markvan: galstrom: taking a look.
[2014-03-27 15:00:04 -0400] mattray: galstrom: checking
[2014-03-27 15:03:12 -0400] galstrom: mattray: can you change https://launchpad.net/openstack-chef 'development focus' to icehouse series
[2014-03-27 15:03:23 -0400] markvan: galstrom: What's the diff between merged and unmerged branches?
[2014-03-27 15:03:34 -0400] galstrom: markvan: where?
[2014-03-27 15:04:52 -0400] markvan: telemetry, I see 3 branches, but divided between merged and unmerged (grizzly).
[2014-03-27 15:05:00 -0400] markvan: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-telemetry/branches
[2014-03-27 15:05:42 -0400] galstrom: markvan: i am not sure
[2014-03-27 15:06:03 -0400] mattray: galstrom: updated.
[2014-03-27 15:06:19 -0400] galstrom: mattray: ty
[2014-03-27 15:06:23 -0400] markvan: but on orchestration, it shows them as merged and no unmerged ones.
[2014-03-27 15:06:41 -0400] galstrom: does orchestration have a stable/grizzly?
[2014-03-27 15:06:55 -0400] markvan: yup, https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-orchestration/branches?merged=1

[2014-03-27 15:07:18 -0400] mattray: markvan: nothing there though
[2014-03-27 15:07:28 -0400] mattray: no idea either
[2014-03-27 15:07:44 -0400] markvan: k, was curious.
[2014-03-27 15:10:40 -0400] markvan: galstrom: pulled all cb's down, all seem to have valid new stable/havana branch.
[2014-03-27 15:10:49 -0400] galstrom: markvan: thanks for checking
[2014-03-27 15:11:07 -0400] galstrom: i think we can start on the berks.lockfiles for the stable branch repos
[2014-03-27 15:11:20 -0400] galstrom: and the readme updates/version bump on master
[2014-03-27 15:12:43 -0400] markvan: ok, divide and conquer?
[2014-03-27 15:13:39 -0400] markvan: I can start on the readme/version bumps on master side
[2014-03-27 15:13:42 -0400] galstrom: yeah.. i have 15 minutes of bug cleanup.. then i can help
[2014-03-27 15:14:34 -0400] mattray: galstrom: markvan: I'll update the READMEs in stable/havana

[2014-03-27 15:25:17 -0400] srenatus: btw, what is the idea guiding the -redhat_spec.rb and -suse_spec.rb checks?  Should they contain just the stuff that is different?
[2014-03-27 15:25:46 -0400] galstrom: srenatus: yeah.. that is the general deal.. you are testing things in the 'platform_family' case statements (as an example)
[2014-03-27 15:25:57 -0400] galstrom: deal = idea
[2014-03-27 15:27:29 -0400] srenatus: galstrom: thanks for clearing that up :)
[2014-03-27 15:28:14 -0400] galstrom: markvan: you are working on the berks lockfiles?

[2014-03-27 15:50:19 -0400] galstrom: after that.. i can do the rest of the cookbooks basically sequentially
[2014-03-27 15:50:33 -0400] mattray: galstrom: let me know what you need reviewed
[2014-03-27 15:50:46 -0400] markvan: yup, same on icehouse side for versions, common first, ...
[2014-03-27 15:50:55 -0400] galstrom: mattray: will do

[2014-03-27 15:53:05 -0400] mattray: galstrom: markvan: should we update the metadata.rb in Icehouse to at least have dependencies equal to the Berksfile.lock versions?
[2014-03-27 15:53:21 -0400] mattray: seems like that might protect us from potential bugs
[2014-03-27 15:53:22 -0400] galstrom: mattray: makes sense to me

[2014-03-27 15:53:48 -0400] mattray: Berksfile.lock versions in the stable/havana branch go into the Icehouse metadata.rb that is
[2014-03-27 15:55:04 -0400] mattray: markvan: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/83431/ updated with that
[2014-03-27 15:55:06 -0400] markvan: mattray: humm, I was bumping them to 9.x  , you mean go after latest 8.x.x in there?
[2014-03-27 15:55:21 -0400] mattray: markvan: no, bump to 9.0.0 but also bump the cookbook dependencies
[2014-03-27 15:55:34 -0400] mattray: so Icehouse depends on at least what goes into stable/havana
[2014-03-27 15:56:57 -0400] openstackgerrit: Mark Vanderwiel proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-dashboard: Icehouse branch version updates  https://review.openstack.org/83439
[2014-03-27 15:57:38 -0400] markvan: k, I was bumping depends to be at 9.0 also.  so that means we need to do them in order.  or did I miss something here.
[2014-03-27 15:59:02 -0400] mattray: markvan: I was actually thinking about things like mysql or rabbitmq
[2014-03-27 15:59:20 -0400] mattray: but definitely compute should depend on 9.0 of common
[2014-03-27 15:59:39 -0400] andymccr: sounds good to me
