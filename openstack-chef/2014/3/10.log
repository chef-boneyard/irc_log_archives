[2014-03-10 08:39:50 -0400] DeVVaN: iartarisi: with you cleanup, should i check if bind-ip is 0.0.0.0 or readd the entry @node.set['openstack']['object-storage']['network']['object-bind-ip'] = '10.0.0.1' ?
[2014-03-10 08:44:18 -0400] iartarisi: DeVVaN: I'd say just check the default one, but you can set a new ip and check that the changes propagated correctly for bonus points.
[2014-03-10 08:46:33 -0400] DeVVaN: iartarisi: ok, i'll do the bonus-stuff at a later date (when I'v learned to write tests better :) )

[2014-03-10 19:25:28 -0400] fraterlaetus: I have a cookbook that wants to run a script twice a day.
[2014-03-10 19:26:06 -0400] fraterlaetus: I tried adding two instances of the cron resource with different hours, but when I check the cron tab after a chef run, only the latter of the two is showing.

[2014-03-10 20:34:02 -0400] spheromak: you would need a different resource name for each
[2014-03-10 20:34:02 -0400] fraterlaetus: I am.
