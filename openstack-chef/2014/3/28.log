[2014-03-28 10:53:14 -0400] srenatus: is it ok to do stuff like updating ChefSpec "by the way" (see change above)?
[2014-03-28 10:55:46 -0400] andymccr: srenatus: the best way to do that would be to split it into 2 patches, so that you have 1 change that changes chefspec and another that then makes the change to agent services subscription.
[2014-03-28 10:56:05 -0400] andymccr: you can make the second patch dependent on the first
[2014-03-28 10:58:43 -0400] srenatus: andymccr: ok, I'll re-do that
[2014-03-28 10:58:47 -0400] andymccr: thanks!

[2014-03-28 13:53:34 -0400] kbringard:  or something like that ;-)
[2014-03-28 13:53:47 -0400] [1]Mr_D: thx much - will try it...
[2014-03-28 13:55:39 -0400] [1]Mr_D: that did the trick!

[2014-03-28 13:56:43 -0400] kbringard: I couldn't remember where the hyphen went, or if it was even necessary, so glad it worked the first try!
[2014-03-28 13:57:37 -0400] [1]Mr_D: "recheck no bug" - found a tiny reference to it here: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GerritJenkinsGit

[2014-03-28 15:46:05 -0400] srenatus: hmf. the link "change -> blueprint search" doesn't work, but the other way is fine.  I'll leave it at that..
[2014-03-28 15:46:49 -0400] galstrom: srenatus: it is the periods in the version number breaking the link
[2014-03-28 15:53:14 -0400] srenatus: galstrom: yes, sure... could make it "chefspec-3-4-0"...
[2014-03-28 15:53:33 -0400] galstrom: yeah.. looks funny.. but makes linking work
[2014-03-28 15:54:01 -0400] srenatus: or chefspec-3-4, hurts the eyes a little less
[2014-03-28 15:54:26 -0400] galstrom: :)
[2014-03-28 15:54:32 -0400] srenatus: hmm actually, the search works, ie it is found...
[2014-03-28 15:54:35 -0400] srenatus: well, anyways.

[2014-03-28 16:10:45 -0400] srenatus: galstrom: could you have a quick look at one of them?  I'd proceed with the rest in the same manner if someone nods ;)
[2014-03-28 16:10:58 -0400] galstrom: sure
[2014-03-28 16:11:00 -0400] galstrom: which one

[2014-03-28 16:14:54 -0400] galstrom: srenatus: the one question i have is around the chefspec::coverage
[2014-03-28 16:15:05 -0400] galstrom: did they change the way it works now?
[2014-03-28 16:15:23 -0400] srenatus: http://paste.openstack.org/show/74562/ here's a run
[2014-03-28 16:15:58 -0400] srenatus: galstrom: I just followed this https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec/#reporting
[2014-03-28 16:16:17 -0400] galstrom: yeah looking at that now
[2014-03-28 16:16:29 -0400] srenatus: "ChefSpec will test all cookbooks that are loaded as part of the Chef Client run."
[2014-03-28 16:16:32 -0400] srenatus: hmm
[2014-03-28 16:17:07 -0400] galstrom: srenatus: yeah.. just saw that as well
[2014-03-28 16:17:11 -0400] galstrom: so we need to add the filter bit
[2014-03-28 16:17:19 -0400] galstrom: to restrict to the specific cookbook
[2014-03-28 16:17:24 -0400] srenatus: I was just judging from the output...
[2014-03-28 16:17:26 -0400] galstrom: but other than that it looks fine to me
[2014-03-28 16:17:42 -0400] srenatus: ok.  I'll look into the filter thing
[2014-03-28 16:17:55 -0400] galstrom: that looks pretty straight forward
