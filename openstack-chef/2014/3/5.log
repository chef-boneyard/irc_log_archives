[2014-03-05 16:47:36 -0500] iartarisi: markvan: thanks
[2014-03-05 17:02:24 -0500] markvan: mancdaz: Regarding InnoDB.  Were seeing that on redhat and centos, some projects (neutron, ceilometer) are not handling setting the default properly.  I have not had a chance to dig into core yet, but it seems this has happened before. And even DevStack forces this defautl.
[2014-03-05 17:03:58 -0500] iartarisi: markvan: ah, cool, that should've been mentioned in the gerrit discussion :)
[2014-03-05 17:04:25 -0500] iartarisi: FWIW, I'm fine with the change once we document the reason for needing it a bit better.
[2014-03-05 17:05:46 -0500] markvan: iartarisi: good point.  I'll get that updated and I'm in the process of opening up some core bugs for this.  But since most core folks use ubuntu/devstack, they never will see this issue, might be hard to get fixed.
[2014-03-05 17:06:35 -0500] iartarisi: what do you mean by core?
[2014-03-05 17:07:26 -0500] iartarisi: ah, openstack itself i guess

[2014-03-05 19:21:27 -0500] markvan: nacer:   hi, not sure I understand your issue.  Are you saying this is a timing/sequence issue?
[2014-03-05 19:27:51 -0500] nacer: markvan: the way the service is setup it restart at each chef run
[2014-03-05 19:30:21 -0500] nacer: if you have a reason for restart a service you should notifies
[2014-03-05 19:30:51 -0500] markvan: nacer: ok, so this is a multi run scenario.    Yeah, I agree, notifies should be used to start as needed.
[2014-03-05 19:31:04 -0500] nacer: restart
[2014-03-05 19:31:10 -0500] nacer: starting a service is ok
[2014-03-05 19:31:22 -0500] markvan: if a restart was needed, would there still be an issue with the timing of it in this case?
[2014-03-05 19:31:39 -0500] markvan: assuming we have proper notifies in place.
[2014-03-05 19:32:23 -0500] nacer: i don't see what you mean by timing issue
[2014-03-05 19:34:44 -0500] nacer: if a other ressource need a restart immediatly on service you can notifies with immediatly param
[2014-03-05 19:37:11 -0500] markvan: right.  I was trying to understand why your scenario with restart happening is preventing the service from starting again.
[2014-03-05 20:29:47 -0500] mattt: markvan: can you explain your question in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/78263/2/recipes/cinder-common.rb a bit ore ?
[2014-03-05 20:35:28 -0500] mattt: markvan: i think i see what you're saying now
[2014-03-05 20:35:44 -0500] mattt: markvan: don't see the point tho, because realistically you'd only have one password in that data bag
[2014-03-05 20:36:15 -0500] mattt: markvan: although nothing to stop you from having a different mq user per service i guess?
[2014-03-05 20:40:43 -0500] markvan: mattt: yeah, was kinda thinking out loud. not sure if having a diff mq user would make sense at some point
[2014-03-05 20:56:48 -0500] nacer: markvan: the problem is that the service is restarting at each chef run and it should not. that's all :)
[2014-03-05 21:09:46 -0500] markvan: nacer: thx, got it.
