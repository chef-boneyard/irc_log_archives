[2014-02-24 16:16:09 -0500] galstrom: as far as outstanding issues holding up havana branching
[2014-02-24 16:16:10 -0500] galstrom: we have 5 critical bugs.. 2 High bugs that need to be resolved
[2014-02-24 16:16:10 -0500] galstrom: and we need a concerted effort by the cores to get reviews humming this week
[2014-02-24 16:17:46 -0500] galstrom: and we have 4 in progress blueprints
[2014-02-24 16:18:31 -0500] iartarisi: galstrom: which do you mean? I see 2 Essentials and 4 Highs in launchpad
[2014-02-24 16:18:46 -0500] iartarisi: ah, right, I was looking at blueprints, not bugs
[2014-02-24 16:19:06 -0500] galstrom: iartarisi: essential (cent and vagrant)
[2014-02-24 16:19:31 -0500] galstrom: high (client recipes, lint/unit)
[2014-02-24 16:20:23 -0500] galstrom: iartarisi: i think the swift rename can be pushed over to icehouse
[2014-02-24 16:21:11 -0500] iartarisi: agreed
[2014-02-24 16:21:18 -0500] iartarisi: can't we just ignore swift altogether until icehouse?
[2014-02-24 16:21:24 -0500] galstrom: iartarisi: i believe those bps are all in flight and just pending reviews
[2014-02-24 16:21:27 -0500] galstrom: iartarisi: :)
[2014-02-24 16:21:37 -0500] spheromak: theres alot pending review

[2014-02-24 16:22:08 -0500] galstrom: i think the only things that are pending work are the open bugs
[2014-02-24 16:22:27 -0500] galstrom: some of those have active reviews.. some dont
[2014-02-24 16:23:13 -0500] galstrom: make that critical: 5, high: 2, and medium: 2
[2014-02-24 16:23:52 -0500] markvan: claco: make sure you have the older version of vagrant 1.3.5 to start with, might have better luck.

[2014-02-24 16:33:58 -0500] mattray: so fixing that before branching would make the upgrade path much smoother
[2014-02-24 16:34:25 -0500] mattray: we either eat the pain in an upgrade recipe or a review

[2014-02-24 21:54:34 -0500] luisg: mattray, i think there is a problem we need to address in the mysql cookbook
[2014-02-24 21:54:53 -0500] luisg: the default db engine is not InnoDB (that is the default in mysql 5.5) but not in the mysql the cookbook installs
[2014-02-24 21:55:14 -0500] mattray: luisg: hmmm
[2014-02-24 21:55:20 -0500] luisg: but we need innodb for openstack (the ceilometer db does not install otherwise)
[2014-02-24 21:55:30 -0500] luisg: devstack sets it to innodb
[2014-02-24 21:56:01 -0500] luisg: so i asked in #chef and i was told to send the patch out to mysql, it would be reviewed in the next merge meeting
[2014-02-24 21:56:06 -0500] luisg: do u know when that might be?
[2014-02-24 21:56:08 -0500] luisg: (they didn't know)
[2014-02-24 21:56:17 -0500] spheromak: there used to be 2 a week
[2014-02-24 21:56:22 -0500] spheromak: i think its on wed or thurs
[2014-02-24 21:56:43 -0500] luisg: ahh k cool, good to know i thought it was less often than that
[2014-02-24 21:56:50 -0500] paulczar: are you suggesting that myisam isn't the best database engine ?
[2014-02-24 21:56:57 -0500] luisg: paulczar, yeah

[2014-02-24 21:58:13 -0500] paulczar: luisg: I was joking btw I know its not good ;)
[2014-02-24 21:58:16 -0500] luisg: ceilometer's dbsync won't even finish on myisam i think due to FKs that it needs
[2014-02-24 21:58:20 -0500] luisg: ah haha
[2014-02-24 21:58:48 -0500] paulczar: I thought mysql 5.5+ defaults to innodb if not specified ( except for the mysql user/perms databases )

[2014-02-24 21:59:05 -0500] luisg: :)
[2014-02-24 21:59:12 -0500] luisg: yeah 5.5 uses innodb by default
[2014-02-24 21:59:28 -0500] paulczar: oooh I see,  the mysql db doesn't do 5.5
[2014-02-24 21:59:36 -0500] paulczar: because it's using the OS packages
[2014-02-24 21:59:48 -0500] paulczar: so it'll be mysql 0.84rc2 on rhel
[2014-02-24 22:00:07 -0500] mattray: paulczar: ( )
[2014-02-24 22:00:09 -0500] paulczar: or something equally old and useless
[2014-02-24 22:00:58 -0500] luisg: yeah, so i wanted to send a patch out to explicitely set it to innodb
[2014-02-24 22:01:39 -0500] mattray: luisg: it's not something we could set by attribute?
[2014-02-24 22:02:00 -0500] luisg: no there is no attribute for it, that was the patch that i was gonig to send
[2014-02-24 22:02:11 -0500] mattray: luisg: well that sounds legit
[2014-02-24 22:02:19 -0500] mattray: someara is the one who does COOK
[2014-02-24 22:02:39 -0500] luisg: yeah k.. so good to know the merge meetings are often, i'll send the patch out
[2014-02-24 22:03:13 -0500] paulczar: so we can do it like this -
[2014-02-24 22:03:20 -0500] paulczar: set the attribute for include_dir
[2014-02-24 22:03:31 -0500] spheromak: <3 (tableflip)
[2014-02-24 22:03:44 -0500] paulczar: and then have a template with the default innodb set to build a file in that include_dir
[2014-02-24 22:03:57 -0500] paulczar: node['mysql']['server']['directories']['confd_dir']
[2014-02-24 22:04:24 -0500] paulczar: and then finish off by throwing a brick through redhat's window
[2014-02-24 22:04:33 -0500] luisg: lol
[2014-02-24 22:04:44 -0500] luisg: i was just thinking about setting the default-storage-engine though
[2014-02-24 22:05:03 -0500] luisg: if set we woudl set it, else it would use the server's default
[2014-02-24 22:05:15 -0500] luisg: then we can set the attribute to innodb in os-db
[2014-02-24 22:06:22 -0500] paulczar: yeah  echo 'default_storage_engine = innodb' > /etc/mysql/confd/innodblolwtf
[2014-02-24 22:06:38 -0500] paulczar: node['mysql']['server']['directories']['confd_dir'] = '/etc/mysql/confd'
[2014-02-24 22:07:12 -0500] paulczar: that will fix it for the current cookbook without waiting on a fix
[2014-02-24 22:07:36 -0500] luisg: hmm... i did't know that was there already
[2014-02-24 22:07:50 -0500] luisg: so should we just do that in the ops-database cb?
[2014-02-24 22:08:30 -0500] paulczar: yeah I think so     we should also push a fix to mysql cookbook to make that a settable option and then when that's in and tested we can remove the workaround in the ops-db
[2014-02-24 22:08:44 -0500] luisg: k..
[2014-02-24 22:08:50 -0500] luisg: that makes sense, alright cool, thanks
[2014-02-24 22:09:13 -0500] paulczar: should probably write a blueprint or a feature-bug on launchpad to track it
[2014-02-24 22:10:36 -0500] luisg: i had created this bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+bug/1284272
[2014-02-24 22:11:14 -0500] paulczar: yeah we can just track it there
[2014-02-24 22:13:06 -0500] luisg: k
[2014-02-24 22:13:40 -0500] paulczar: it's always an upstream system packaging problem
