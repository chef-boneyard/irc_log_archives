[2014-02-27 16:07:17 -0500] luis_: mattray, could you pls take a look at this one here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+bug/1284272
[2014-02-27 16:08:18 -0500] luis_: it's that problem where we need to change the storage engine for mysql, i tried to deliver an enhancement to the mysql cookbook but i gotta sign the CLA to do that, and it looks like the process for getting approval to do that might take a while here
[2014-02-27 16:09:05 -0500] mattray: luis_: if necessary you can point Berkshelf at your branch with that patch if it's a blocker
[2014-02-27 16:09:37 -0500] mattray: I talked with someara about the MySQL cookbook, he's moved it up in his priority queue
[2014-02-27 16:10:01 -0500] luis_: yeahI have it working locally, but i was wondering if we could get that fix merged by someone that already has the CLA
[2014-02-27 16:10:15 -0500] luis_: so it's in the next version of the cookbook
[2014-02-27 16:10:34 -0500] luis_:  b/c im not sure how long the process of getting the ibm lawyers to let me sign the cla wil tke
[2014-02-27 16:11:59 -0500] mattray: IBM's already at #223

[2014-02-27 16:13:04 -0500] luis_: oh ok, so i don't need to sign an individual CLA, i thought i needed to, i was told in #chef the reason i an't mark the ticket as "fix priovided' was b/c i needed to sign the CLA
[2014-02-27 16:13:53 -0500] mattray: I'll double-check.
[2014-02-27 16:14:05 -0500] luis_: this is the jira ticket: https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-4370
[2014-02-27 16:14:29 -0500] luis_: if it can be looked at in the merge meeting w/o me marking it as fix provided, then i guess that is fine then
[2014-02-27 16:16:46 -0500] mattray: luis_: it looks like you'll have to get IBM to add you to their CCLA, I'll track down who you need to ping

[2014-02-27 18:59:19 -0500] fraterlaetus: Hey, how can I remove all recipes in a cookbook from all roles containing it using knife?
[2014-02-27 18:59:53 -0500] fraterlaetus: for example, I have a cookbook called "deprecated" containing recipes "deprecated::1" and "deprecated::2"
[2014-02-27 18:59:59 -0500] mattray: fraterlaetus: what's your goal?
[2014-02-27 19:00:20 -0500] fraterlaetus: I want to remove deprecated::1 and deprecated::2 from all roles containing it
[2014-02-27 19:00:45 -0500] fraterlaetus: (actually it's deprecated::1 through deprecated::8)
[2014-02-27 19:01:23 -0500] mattray: I believe you could use "knife search"
[2014-02-27 19:02:47 -0500] fraterlaetus: so, I've gotten a list of nodes using knife search
[2014-02-27 19:02:56 -0500] fraterlaetus: but the recipes are attached to roles
[2014-02-27 19:04:04 -0500] fraterlaetus: and there's no knife role run_list remove
[2014-02-27 19:04:09 -0500] fraterlaetus: that I can find anyway
[2014-02-27 19:04:27 -0500] fraterlaetus: Did I just goof by assigning the recipes to roles instead of directly onto nodes?
[2014-02-27 19:04:48 -0500] mattray: fraterlaetus: no, that's the right application of recipes
[2014-02-27 19:04:53 -0500] mattray: do you really have that many roles?
[2014-02-27 19:04:58 -0500] mattray: can't you just use grep?
[2014-02-27 19:05:00 -0500] fraterlaetus: yes
[2014-02-27 19:05:11 -0500] fraterlaetus: I have like 30 roles at present
[2014-02-27 19:05:20 -0500] fraterlaetus: I guess I can just go in and vim them manually
[2014-02-27 19:05:21 -0500] mattray: but they're back by files right?
[2014-02-27 19:05:28 -0500] fraterlaetus: no
[2014-02-27 19:05:45 -0500] fraterlaetus: Is there an easy way to export them to json?
[2014-02-27 19:06:51 -0500] fraterlaetus: the problem is, when I first started chefing,
[2014-02-27 19:07:04 -0500] fraterlaetus: I created a configure_network recipe for each of the roles
[2014-02-27 19:07:14 -0500] mattray: fraterlaetus:  knife role show FOO -fj
[2014-02-27 19:07:18 -0500] mattray: that'll give you the JSON
[2014-02-27 19:07:44 -0500] fraterlaetus: can i overwrite an existing role with a from file statement?
[2014-02-27 19:07:49 -0500] mattray: yes
[2014-02-27 19:07:52 -0500] fraterlaetus: awesome!

[2014-02-27 19:24:54 -0500] mattray: ubuntu
[2014-02-27 19:25:10 -0500] mattray: I'm trying to use knife openstack against the forwarded ports
[2014-02-27 19:25:50 -0500] salmanbaset: forwarded ports?
[2014-02-27 19:26:16 -0500] salmanbaset: i thought knife openstack runs against API
[2014-02-27 19:26:23 -0500] mattray: yes
[2014-02-27 19:26:41 -0500] mattray: the Vagrant files forward the OS and EC2 API ports, so you can hit them with knife
[2014-02-27 19:26:45 -0500] mattray: or fog
[2014-02-27 19:26:54 -0500] salmanbaset: ah, i see
[2014-02-27 19:27:19 -0500] mattray: https://gist.github.com/9257291
[2014-02-27 19:27:24 -0500] salmanbaset: we don't use vagrant for real testing. just cookbooks directly.
[2014-02-27 19:27:42 -0500] mattray: yeah, I figured it would be easier this way
[2014-02-27 19:28:03 -0500] salmanbaset: can u run any other openstack cli?
[2014-02-27 19:28:04 -0500] mattray: var/log/nova/*api* logs show the hits
[2014-02-27 19:28:18 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: I'll try
[2014-02-27 19:29:14 -0500] salmanbaset: what is the IP address and port in endpoints created? the interaction can behave in weird ways with forwarding
[2014-02-27 19:29:45 -0500] mattray: I'm guessing that's it
[2014-02-27 19:29:52 -0500] mattray: local connections work
[2014-02-27 19:30:03 -0500] mattray: at least with the CLI
[2014-02-27 19:33:43 -0500] mattray: galstrom: didn't we have port forwarding working at one point with knife openstack?
[2014-02-27 19:52:31 -0500] mattray: I'm guessing it's because all the services are bound to 127.0.0.1

[2014-02-27 20:12:34 -0500] galstrom: mattray: but you will also need keystone ports as well.. i think

[2014-02-27 20:13:01 -0500] galstrom: mattray: yeah.. that sounds right
[2014-02-27 20:13:27 -0500] mattray: installing fog on the vagrant instance, see if it works local before blaming ports

[2014-02-27 20:15:47 -0500] galstrom: mattray: there might be an issue with trying to move those ports into each of the vm.define blocks

[2014-02-27 20:20:06 -0500] galstrom: mattray: may have to jack around and add in the guest_ip string for both vms above their blocks

[2014-02-27 23:25:20 -0500] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/openstack-chef-repo: Updated apt dependency to 2.3.8 to match openstack-common dependency  https://review.openstack.org/76936
[2014-02-27 23:26:51 -0500] alop: can we talk shop?
[2014-02-27 23:27:30 -0500] alop: what do you guys use for bare-metal provisioning in preparation for an openstack installation with stackforge cookbooks?
[2014-02-27 23:31:02 -0500] mattray: fraterlaetus: you may need a new ohai plugin if that data is essential
[2014-02-27 23:31:23 -0500] mattray: alop: pxe_dust, but I typically recommend razor
[2014-02-27 23:31:29 -0500] fraterlaetus: I use PXE
[2014-02-27 23:31:45 -0500] mattray: alop: someday I hope to use ironic
[2014-02-27 23:31:54 -0500] alop: Sure, pxe for building, but like, full on datacenter builds...
[2014-02-27 23:32:07 -0500] alop: I know some people use crowbar
[2014-02-27 23:32:43 -0500] mattray: alop: there are lots of tools out there to pxe boot machines, what are you missing?
[2014-02-27 23:32:58 -0500] fraterlaetus: yep. PXE for bare metal.
[2014-02-27 23:33:09 -0500] fraterlaetus: (500+ hosts)
[2014-02-27 23:33:29 -0500] alop: well, our 'legacy' data center building tools are presently unsupported, as the guys who wrote it all left for greener pastures
[2014-02-27 23:34:10 -0500] mattray: there are dozens of tools that do PXE booting. I currently recommend razor because bluebox and rackspace seem to be using it with Chef and reaching success
[2014-02-27 23:34:22 -0500] alop: cool, I'll check out razor
[2014-02-27 23:34:32 -0500] mattray: the IBM folks can probably point you to xcat resources
[2014-02-27 23:34:48 -0500] alop: OOO is the dream
[2014-02-27 23:35:23 -0500] alop: mattray: razor from puppetlabs?
[2014-02-27 23:35:36 -0500] mattray: yeah
[2014-02-27 23:35:44 -0500] mattray: originally from emc
[2014-02-27 23:35:55 -0500] alop: talk about not liking kool aid
[2014-02-27 23:36:19 -0500] alop: mattray, aka matt@chef.com, telling me to checkout razor from puppet ;)
[2014-02-27 23:36:27 -0500] alop: hey, works for me
[2014-02-27 23:36:38 -0500] mattray: meh, there's nothing interesting about pxe booting
[2014-02-27 23:36:47 -0500] alop: sure there is
[2014-02-27 23:36:49 -0500] mattray: I mean, every tool out there works
[2014-02-27 23:48:11 -0500] mattray: galstrom_zzz: localhost vagrant works: https://gist.github.com/mattray/9262177
[2014-02-27 23:48:44 -0500] mattray: and the ip address on the vagrant vm doesn't work
[2014-02-27 23:48:45 -0500] mattray: so need to update the environment to bind to eth0 I guess
