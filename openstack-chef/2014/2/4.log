[2014-02-04 17:21:55 -0500] openstackgerrit: Christopher H. Laco proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-object-storage: Update libraries to be rubocop compliant  https://review.openstack.org/71034
[2014-02-04 17:23:50 -0500] claco: galstrom: is there any direction/goals anywhere about object-storage and all of the ring stuff?
[2014-02-04 17:24:13 -0500] galstrom: claco: not that i am aware of
[2014-02-04 17:24:20 -0500] galstrom: beyond what is in the readme
[2014-02-04 17:25:08 -0500] claco: mostly, I ask because we moved away from all of the ring/drive setup stuff
[2014-02-04 17:25:33 -0500] claco: not what if we had a community direction on either not doing that travesty we gained from the fork.. or making it not insane :-)
[2014-02-04 17:27:31 -0500] galstrom: claco: i do not believe that conversation has happened yet.. you should start it up on the ML
[2014-02-04 17:28:25 -0500] claco: oh god
[2014-02-04 17:28:32 -0500] claco: this never ends well
[2014-02-04 17:28:35 -0500] claco: :-)
[2014-02-04 17:47:03 -0500] mattray: claco: you and ctracey seem to have opinions that it needs reworking, I'd hit up the ML and a blueprint
[2014-02-04 18:07:32 -0500] claco: mattray: you lost me at "you and ctracey seem to have opinions" :-P
[2014-02-04 18:19:37 -0500] invsblduck: hello, i created thorough specs for keystone.conf template (there was a bug for it)
[2014-02-04 18:19:51 -0500] invsblduck: but it's currently only tested from the ubuntu platform (./spec/server_spec.rb);
[2014-02-04 18:20:12 -0500] invsblduck: i would create generic shared examples and include them from each platform file
[2014-02-04 18:20:34 -0500] invsblduck: but there are no platform-specific tunables for that file.
[2014-02-04 18:22:02 -0500] invsblduck: Should I run the same dozens of examples for each platform, just to be complete?
[2014-02-04 18:24:12 -0500] invsblduck: IOW, I think having the tests under Ubuntu platform is fine right now since there is no OS-specific logic.
[2014-02-04 18:26:40 -0500] invsblduck: galstrom: looks like you put the pending "template contents" TODOs in spec/server-opensuse_spec.rb for identity...
[2014-02-04 18:27:44 -0500] galstrom: invsblduck: if there is not suse/rhel specific code.. then checks in the main spec are fine
[2014-02-04 18:27:47 -0500] invsblduck: galstrom: just wanted $0.02 before i git review :)
[2014-02-04 18:27:53 -0500] invsblduck: galstrom: ty sir.
[2014-02-04 18:36:08 -0500] claco: invsblduck: don't you worry. I'll find something. :-P
[2014-02-04 18:36:16 -0500] luisg: mattray, is there any work going on for enabling rhel on the ceilometer cookbook? it currently does not have anything at all for centos/rhel
[2014-02-04 18:36:45 -0500] mattray: luisg: I'm not actively tracking it, the Rackers and IBM folks are doing the most RHEL work
[2014-02-04 18:37:10 -0500] mattray: galstrom: markvan: ^^
[2014-02-04 18:37:27 -0500] luisg: im an ibm folk :) was just wondering if there was already some effort for ceilometer
[2014-02-04 18:37:30 -0500] invsblduck: claco: oh it's an ugly change.  the code is way better in terms of coverage and performance though (3x faster).
[2014-02-04 18:37:51 -0500] luisg: ceilometer's progress seems rather behind all other projects
[2014-02-04 18:38:48 -0500] galstrom: luisg: I thought there were ceilometer packages for RHEL (rdo)
[2014-02-04 18:39:34 -0500] claco: mattray: can you take a look at https://review.openstack.org/#/c/70779/ ?   If it goes, I think the rest of object-storage rubocop will go
[2014-02-04 18:39:38 -0500] luisg: yeah i think there are, but there is no pkg definition in the cookbook attributes for anything other than suse and ubuntu
[2014-02-04 18:40:45 -0500] mattray: claco: I see you went with the pessimistic greater than?
[2014-02-04 18:41:01 -0500] mattray: claco: I agree with that, but I wish Ruby were more trustworthy
[2014-02-04 18:41:07 -0500] claco: ha
[2014-02-04 18:41:33 -0500] claco: when that bp is closed, I'll roll through the other books and upgrade the rubo versions
[2014-02-04 18:41:59 -0500] claco: then I think we're done w/ rubo
[2014-02-04 18:42:10 -0500] mattray: claco: until 0.19 ;)
[2014-02-04 18:42:34 -0500] claco: shhhhhh..... only Gemfile.lock now
[2014-02-04 18:43:09 -0500] claco: at least in those cases.. it's one patchset to upgrade the entire cookbook, rather than multiple crosscuts
[2014-02-04 18:49:38 -0500] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-object-storage: Upgrade rubocop  https://review.openstack.org/70779
[2014-02-04 18:49:59 -0500] claco: woot. thanks!

[2014-02-04 18:53:23 -0500] invsblduck: ^ let me know what you hate
[2014-02-04 18:53:36 -0500] invsblduck: in general, better coverage and way better performance.  thanks

[2014-02-04 20:42:05 -0500] alop: Anyone tried an upgrade using our cookbooks yet?
[2014-02-04 20:42:18 -0500] alop: I've run into a strange oddity
[2014-02-04 20:42:52 -0500] alop: having uploaded all the 8.x.x cookbooks into chef-repo, the PPA keeps getting set to 'grizzly'
[2014-02-04 20:44:01 -0500] alop: what's really tripping me up, `knife node show [controller] -a openstack.release` shows "havana"
[2014-02-04 20:44:28 -0500] alop: yet, every time chef-client runs, it sets it to 'grizzly'
[2014-02-04 20:44:43 -0500] alop: I set it manually to 'havana' chef reverts it
[2014-02-04 20:45:23 -0500] mattray: alop: something in an Environment?
[2014-02-04 20:45:44 -0500] alop: I've checked environments and roles, well, at least the json files
[2014-02-04 20:45:55 -0500] alop: would make sense if someone 'knife edit' the role/env
[2014-02-04 20:46:04 -0500] alop: bizz-are
[2014-02-04 20:46:17 -0500] mattray: knife node show FOO -l | grep grizzly
[2014-02-04 20:46:30 -0500] alop: upgrades are hard, yo.
[2014-02-04 20:46:34 -0500] mattray: no doubt
[2014-02-04 20:46:53 -0500] alop: yeah, going to check -l
[2014-02-04 20:47:27 -0500] alop: and when I say "our cookbooks" i mean #openstack-chef ;)
[2014-02-04 20:48:33 -0500] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/openstack-chef-repo: Change the role order in os-network  https://review.openstack.org/67808

[2014-02-04 21:05:47 -0500] spheromak: alop: node.set anywhere ?
[2014-02-04 21:05:52 -0500] spheromak: check node attribs
[2014-02-04 21:06:07 -0500] alop: Yeah, I bet it's something stupid like that
