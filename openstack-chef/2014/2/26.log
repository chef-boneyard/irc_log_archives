[2014-02-26 11:43:37 -0500] c0nsaw: I folks, n00bie here, quick question please, I have deployed openstack over a few vm's using a vagrantfile and chef, it has resulted in 2 controller nodes and a compute node, I would like to know what components/services of openstack are on which node,is there a command i can run,  reason i as is so i can draw a diagram (im a student) any ideas, thanks in advance
[2014-02-26 11:46:09 -0500] mancdaz: c0nsaw: 2 controller nodes?
[2014-02-26 11:46:20 -0500] mancdaz: c0nsaw: which vagrantfile did you use?

[2014-02-26 11:48:31 -0500] mancdaz: c0nsaw: ok you're in the wrong channel. This is for discussing the openstack cookbooks in stackforge

[2014-02-26 11:49:14 -0500] c0nsaw: ok mate, sorry, just came in as I thought it was chef related, sorry
[2014-02-26 11:49:23 -0500] mancdaz: c0nsaw: if you hop over to #rackspace you should be able to get some help there
[2014-02-26 11:49:31 -0500] c0nsaw: thanks!
[2014-02-26 11:50:44 -0500] mancdaz: c0nsaw: in fact I can help you, just want to make sure the discussion is in the right place

[2014-02-26 11:51:58 -0500] c0nsaw: everything is working fine, im just wondering how i can find out, which services went to which node, if you know what i mean, im new to this
[2014-02-26 11:55:56 -0500] mancdaz: c0nsaw: sure - hop in to the #rackspace channel and we can discuss.

[2014-02-26 16:07:17 -0500] mancdaz: mattray: generally, might we not be better waiting for the final distro packages?
[2014-02-26 16:08:37 -0500] mattray: mancdaz: I'm not the one pushing it, I assume salmanbaset and markvan would show up with patches to point to the right places until then
[2014-02-26 16:09:11 -0500] mancdaz: mattray: there are already testing repos etc, it's not that there are no packages at all
[2014-02-26 16:09:51 -0500] mancdaz: but it just feels like we're diving into it for no massive benefit, and I feel like havana would start to become stale quickly as it's no longer master

[2014-02-26 16:11:16 -0500] mancdaz: feels like we'd be better continuing to strengthen the havana cookbooks given that that's what people will be deploying for some time to come
[2014-02-26 16:11:16 -0500] salmanbaset: mancdaz: sorry I do not have the whole context. can you fill me in?

[2014-02-26 16:11:53 -0500] mancdaz: salmanbaset: the general discussion around whether we should branch off havana and start working on icehouse in master

[2014-02-26 16:15:38 -0500] markvan: mancdaz: I understand your concern about a havana branch going stale, but I don't think that would happen for a while as most of the consumers would be pushing for improvements and bug fixes.
[2014-02-26 16:16:29 -0500] mancdaz: markvan: it means people doing double commits/reviews, as a lot/most of the fixes would be applicable to both branches
[2014-02-26 16:16:33 -0500] mancdaz: people won't do that
[2014-02-26 16:16:57 -0500] mancdaz: of course I understand that at some point you have to cut away cleanly, it just feels like we're trying to do this too early
[2014-02-26 16:17:11 -0500] mancdaz: and I don't see the real benefit
[2014-02-26 16:17:38 -0500] openstackgerrit: Justin Shepherd proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-metering: update gitignore  https://review.openstack.org/75376
[2014-02-26 16:17:57 -0500] mancdaz: perhaps something like an icehouse branch, into which the people wanting to get going on icehouse now could port all changes that go into havana/master
[2014-02-26 16:18:01 -0500] salmanbaset: mancdaz: there are two possible options for branching
[2014-02-26 16:18:09 -0500] mancdaz: and then we can flip when everyone is ready
[2014-02-26 16:18:14 -0500] markvan: mancdaz: yup, I have to agree with the work needed for double commits/reviews
[2014-02-26 16:18:21 -0500] salmanbaset: (1) branch after openstack ice house (or release)
[2014-02-26 16:18:54 -0500] openstackgerrit: Justin Shepherd proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-object-storage: update gitignore  https://review.openstack.org/75378
[2014-02-26 16:19:01 -0500] salmanbaset: (2) branch before the next release so that when the openstack release is out (ice house in this case), the chef deployment code is also reasonably ready
[2014-02-26 16:19:51 -0500] salmanbaset: my concern with (1) is that we will lag behind openstack release for 6 months
[2014-02-26 16:19:57 -0500] openstackgerrit: Justin Shepherd proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: update gitignore  https://review.openstack.org/75377
[2014-02-26 16:20:05 -0500] salmanbaset: but i also understand your concern around branching too early
[2014-02-26 16:20:27 -0500] salmanbaset: e.g., 1 month after an openstack release
[2014-02-26 16:20:55 -0500] openstackgerrit: Justin Shepherd proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity: update gitignore  https://review.openstack.org/75374
[2014-02-26 16:21:22 -0500] mancdaz: salmanbaset: yeah I get the desire to be ready, it just feels like right now is too early, and I feel like there is plenty that can happen to make the havana stuff more stable
[2014-02-26 16:21:36 -0500] salmanbaset: for future, my suggestion will be to branch 2-3 months before the openstack release
[2014-02-26 16:21:53 -0500] openstackgerrit: Justin Shepherd proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-ops-messaging: update gitignore  https://review.openstack.org/75380
[2014-02-26 16:21:57 -0500] salmanbaset: we can treat this ice house as a special case, and agree on future branching policy
[2014-02-26 16:22:01 -0500] mancdaz: I know we asked for outlines of what we wanted completed, and most of those are done, but new bugs are flooding in daily as more people use this
[2014-02-26 16:22:34 -0500] salmanbaset: so in your opnion, how much time we need before we branch?
[2014-02-26 16:22:38 -0500] mancdaz: salmanbaset: I think in future we will be in a better place that far out, as more people are using/hacking on the cookbooks now
[2014-02-26 16:23:05 -0500] salmanbaset: for ice house?
[2014-02-26 16:23:44 -0500] mancdaz: not for icehouse, I mean for next release we will expect that by 2 months out, our icehouse cookbooks are more stable than our havana ones are now
[2014-02-26 16:23:57 -0500] salmanbaset: right
[2014-02-26 16:24:11 -0500] salmanbaset: so we can have a general cut off date for j-release onwards
[2014-02-26 16:24:37 -0500] salmanbaset: but what will be a good cut off date for ice house branching in your opinion?
[2014-02-26 16:25:46 -0500] markvan: Should we focus on stablazation for a while to get the bugs list down and push a few bug jam days?
[2014-02-26 16:26:41 -0500] mattray: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Icehouse_Release_Schedule
[2014-02-26 16:27:09 -0500] mattray: maybe we branch for the release candidates?
[2014-02-26 16:27:21 -0500] markvan: What I don't want to see is an open ended list of blueprints coming in for new features in havana.  Our meta-blueprint was a good idea to help scope our current feature work.
[2014-02-26 16:27:26 -0500] galstrom: mattray: that is what i have been targeting
[2014-02-26 16:27:33 -0500] galstrom: i was looking at feature freeze
[2014-02-26 16:27:45 -0500] galstrom: but i think that week of 3/27 might be more reasonable
[2014-02-26 16:28:05 -0500] mancdaz: i'm good with that
[2014-02-26 16:28:34 -0500] mancdaz: I'm also fine with feture freeze - it's the unknown bugs that we're continuing to find
[2014-02-26 16:28:35 -0500] galstrom: so i actually think we have done very well with getting the bps done to hit the feature freeze
[2014-02-26 16:28:42 -0500] mattray: ok, Rackers vote for 3/27, but what about IBM, Dell & SUSE?
[2014-02-26 16:28:46 -0500] galstrom: but stability does not seem to be there just yet
[2014-02-26 16:29:01 -0500] salmanbaset: we may have to make an exception for ice house
[2014-02-26 16:29:09 -0500] salmanbaset: but agree on a general timeline for future releases
[2014-02-26 16:29:33 -0500] galstrom: salmanbaset: what are you thinking of whey you say execption for icehouse?
[2014-02-26 16:29:40 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: I agree we should have a policy going forward
[2014-02-26 16:30:31 -0500] mancdaz: apologies I have to run.  Please could someone document final agreement on email
[2014-02-26 16:30:36 -0500] markvan: I agree with the basic logic of getting a branch done close to feature freeze, as a general policy.
[2014-02-26 16:31:00 -0500] salmanbaset: for future, i will prefer branching around milestone-3
[2014-02-26 16:31:07 -0500] galstrom: markvan: yeah.. i think it is some where between feature freeze and release candidate
[2014-02-26 16:31:22 -0500] mattray: 3/27 (RC) for Icehouse, final Milestone for Juno/future?
[2014-02-26 16:31:56 -0500] DeVVaN:  //quit Going home.
[2014-02-26 16:31:58 -0500] DeVVaN: hah
[2014-02-26 16:32:04 -0500] DeVVaN: bye
[2014-02-26 16:32:05 -0500] salmanbaset: mattray: that works
[2014-02-26 16:32:07 -0500] galstrom: i think there will still be some churn on final milestone.. but i have absolutely no issue branching at that point for future releases
[2014-02-26 16:33:04 -0500] galstrom: mattray: so using the published icehouse dates as an example for juno..
[2014-02-26 16:33:13 -0500] salmanbaset: branching at ML3 will hopefully give one month for development, so that chef deployment code can potentially be ready with the openstack release
[2014-02-26 16:33:19 -0500] markvan: mattray: could be maybe take a closer look at 3/20 and if we agree on stable, do it a week eariler?
[2014-02-26 16:33:33 -0500] galstrom: mattray: we would move active branch on release of 3rd milestone
[2014-02-26 16:33:47 -0500] mattray: galstrom: correct
[2014-02-26 16:34:02 -0500] galstrom: mattray: I approve of this plan
[2014-02-26 16:34:18 -0500] mattray: markvan: I'm fine with moving it up a week if there's consensus, but I'll be out the week before that on vacation :)
[2014-02-26 16:34:32 -0500] mattray: I'll send an email
[2014-02-26 16:34:42 -0500] galstrom: ok.. so anyone have an issue for future state.. cuting active dev at feature freeze milestone?
[2014-02-26 16:35:40 -0500] salmanbaset: so the general concern is that it will be ideal if chef deployment code for an openstack release comes at the same time as the release
[2014-02-26 16:35:40 -0500] galstrom: markvan: i think we have to play this one a bit by ear.. so a checkup on 3/20 seems to be in order
[2014-02-26 16:36:01 -0500] salmanbaset: but for now, the dates by mattray seem reasonable
[2014-02-26 16:36:26 -0500] galstrom: markvan: some where in that 2 week period week of 3/20 - week of 3/27 looks like the most realistic target
[2014-02-26 16:36:27 -0500] salmanbaset: I think we may be done with havana earlier than 3/27, but lets see
[2014-02-26 16:36:40 -0500] mattray: sounds good
[2014-02-26 16:36:48 -0500] markvan: galstrom: yes, as we get closer, a checkup on 3/20 would be good.
[2014-02-26 16:36:56 -0500] galstrom: salmanbaset: i agree it could go that way.. so a checkup the week before?
[2014-02-26 16:37:15 -0500] galstrom: plus we have the weekly meetings.. we can use part of that time as a checkup
[2014-02-26 16:37:41 -0500] markvan: I would think that the 3/20 date would be a good time to review outstanding bugs and blueprints, to see what needs to get closed/focused on.
[2014-02-26 16:38:33 -0500] galstrom: yeah.. i would like to have a serious discussion around outstanding bug squashing on the 2 weeks prior to 3/27
[2014-02-26 16:38:49 -0500] galstrom: so we can be in a good place no later than the Release Canidate schedule
[2014-02-26 16:38:57 -0500] markvan: galstrom: ++
[2014-02-26 16:39:08 -0500] salmanbaset: galstrom: sure
[2014-02-26 16:39:44 -0500] galstrom: salmanbaset: you good with the proposal?
[2014-02-26 16:48:46 -0500] mattt: can we still add features to havana?
[2014-02-26 16:48:50 -0500] mattt: or is it bug fixing only at this point ?
[2014-02-26 16:50:35 -0500] mattray: mattt: features are fine
[2014-02-26 16:50:37 -0500] galstrom: mattt: my opinion is that we can still add features
[2014-02-26 16:50:45 -0500] mattray: schedule email sent
[2014-02-26 16:50:58 -0500] galstrom: mattray: thanks for sending that
[2014-02-26 16:51:08 -0500] salmanbaset: galstrom: yes
[2014-02-26 16:51:50 -0500] mattt: alright cool i have a blueprint i'd like to knock out before we carry this code over to icehouse
[2014-02-26 16:51:53 -0500] mattt: so i'll proceed then
[2014-02-26 16:53:28 -0500] markvan: mattray: shouldn't we always be looking for new features, but some might be decided upon to wait for next release to get in?
[2014-02-26 16:54:06 -0500] mattray: markvan: we really need to establish blueprint review
[2014-02-26 16:54:32 -0500] mattray: we're not doing much in the way of reviewing them
[2014-02-26 16:54:39 -0500] mattray: (I'm not at least)
[2014-02-26 16:54:41 -0500] markvan: mattray: yup, that was my follow question. how to get a better flow for blueprints  (doc, updates, reviews, discussion, ...)
[2014-02-26 16:54:50 -0500] mattray: make that part of the status meeting?
[2014-02-26 16:55:25 -0500] markvan: yeah, we can try taking a few (5 or less) at each meeting and flush them out a bit
[2014-02-26 16:55:25 -0500] mattray: that seems to be the 1 time we're mostly focused
[2014-02-26 16:55:57 -0500] mattray: ok, adding to the backlog for Monday
[2014-02-26 16:57:02 -0500] markvan: k, is there a simple way to "tag" the blueprints so owners know they should try to make the next meeting?   Then we could tag some each week and get a cycle going.
[2014-02-26 16:58:17 -0500] mattray: markvan: galstrom put a bunch in 'havana'
[2014-02-26 16:58:53 -0500] mattray: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/havana
[2014-02-26 16:59:44 -0500] mattray: we take https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-chef and triage them
[2014-02-26 17:00:30 -0500] markvan: k, then need to get word out for bp owners to make meetings
[2014-02-26 17:01:04 -0500] mattray: do we need an alternate meeting time?
[2014-02-26 17:01:39 -0500] mattray: I'd prefer not to since it's hard enough getting people to 1 time
[2014-02-26 17:01:53 -0500] mattray: but I understand timezones :)
[2014-02-26 17:09:05 -0500] markvan: yeah, maybe another topic to bring up, but hard to make happen.   That's why I would like to see a better way to easily make comments/revisions on blueprints, some are pretty thin.
[2014-02-26 17:11:05 -0500] mattray: yeah, we have an openstack etherpad for that, we just need to get more organized on how we do blueprints
[2014-02-26 17:50:41 -0500] galstrom: mattray: if we need to start doing sperate metings for bp reviews.. i would suggest irc meetings
