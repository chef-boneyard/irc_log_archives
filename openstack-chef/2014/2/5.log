[2014-02-05 17:01:46 -0500] nacer: mattray: hi
[2014-02-05 17:02:25 -0500] nacer: i don't understand your position on change Ide506511 dashboard cookbook
[2014-02-05 17:02:44 -0500] mattray: nacer: link?
[2014-02-05 17:02:57 -0500] nacer: mattray: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/68446/
[2014-02-05 17:03:43 -0500] mattray: nacer: you've updated it to use node['openstack']['dashboard']['horizon_user']
[2014-02-05 17:03:57 -0500] mattray: nacer: but not node['openstack']['dashboard']['horizon_group']
[2014-02-05 17:04:11 -0500] nacer: mattray: it's not my commit
[2014-02-05 17:04:14 -0500] mattray: oh
[2014-02-05 17:04:25 -0500] nacer: mattray: i just try to deploy dashbaord in a test env :)
[2014-02-05 17:04:55 -0500] nacer: mattray: ohh yeah , i see it now
[2014-02-05 17:05:04 -0500] nacer: mattray: sorry to have bother you
[2014-02-05 17:05:17 -0500] mattray: no worries, reviews are supposed to be picky :)
[2014-02-05 17:06:20 -0500] nacer: to bad git-harry is not on irc, this patch is needed to have dashboard running
[2014-02-05 17:08:07 -0500] mattray: nacer: you can update other peoples' patches
[2014-02-05 17:08:42 -0500] nacer: mattray: okay i need to check that
[2014-02-05 17:48:36 -0500] ericReeves: Greetings  I think I'm running in to a dependency problem w/ the yum cookbook version when trying to deploy Havana on CentOS 6.5.
[2014-02-05 17:49:52 -0500] ericReeves: yum::epel was moved out to a separate cookbook in yum 3.x, but is referenced as such in many cookbooks.  The Berksfile for openstack-chef-repo specifies Python 1.4.4 and Yum 2.3.4, but openstack-common depends explicitly on yum 3.x.
[2014-02-05 17:50:16 -0500] ericReeves: Related to this.  https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+bug/1273714
[2014-02-05 18:00:26 -0500] mattray: ericReeves: is it possible all the yum upgrade patches haven't made it through yet?
[2014-02-05 18:01:49 -0500] ericReeves: Are there additional patches not referenced in that bug?
[2014-02-05 18:02:01 -0500] ericReeves: I'll test!  :)
[2014-02-05 18:05:09 -0500] ericReeves: That fix doesn't seem to address the openstack-common dependency on 3.x.  So there's still a conflict.

[2014-02-05 18:06:02 -0500] ericReeves: https://github.com/hughsaunders a day ago https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/commit/bbce1ec65eead2b04cabe80eeead58f26f09f177
[2014-02-05 18:06:03 -0500] ericReeves: Neat.
[2014-02-05 18:06:25 -0500] ericReeves: The commit that pins yum to 3.x on openstack-common came in 1 day ago.
[2014-02-05 18:19:54 -0500] ericReeves: Rolled back to openstack-common 8.0.1 and it seems happier.
[2014-02-05 18:23:01 -0500] mattray: ericReeves: that's the problem with the sharp end of development
[2014-02-05 18:23:39 -0500] ericReeves: hehe.
