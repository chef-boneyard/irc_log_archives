[2014-02-20 10:02:18 -0500] galstrom: yeah.. going to see what is up with that one..
[2014-02-20 10:02:28 -0500] galstrom: i am pretty sure i ran chefspec locally on it
[2014-02-20 10:02:51 -0500] spheromak: was playing / wrestling with the chefspec chef-zero support today
[2014-02-20 10:02:59 -0500] galstrom: nice
[2014-02-20 10:03:17 -0500] spheromak: not quite to where I would want it but potential there to model a cluster of things
[2014-02-20 10:03:30 -0500] spheromak: which could be pretty nice
[2014-02-20 10:03:34 -0500] spheromak: for this project
[2014-02-20 10:03:58 -0500] galstrom: did you see https://review.openstack.org/#/c/70261/ .. look at the 7th comment from the bottom..

[2014-02-20 10:04:55 -0500] spheromak: had to run compute with the nulldriver tho
[2014-02-20 10:05:02 -0500] galstrom: i remember.. we had talked about it.. but apparently nova no worky with lxc
[2014-02-20 10:05:03 -0500] galstrom: right?

[2014-02-20 10:06:34 -0500] galstrom: yes
[2014-02-20 10:06:39 -0500] spheromak: vagrant/vmware just goto shit
[2014-02-20 10:06:45 -0500] spheromak: lxc also handles it well

[2014-02-20 10:07:24 -0500] spheromak: from a vagrant-vmware perspective
[2014-02-20 10:07:42 -0500] galstrom: oh yeah.. isn't that the pay for vagrant plugin
[2014-02-20 10:07:47 -0500] spheromak: right now our jenk runs vmware-workstation for most kitchen work, but I have some pure vagrant complex net builds
[2014-02-20 10:07:54 -0500] spheromak: that just tear things up
[2014-02-20 10:07:59 -0500] spheromak: yep

[2014-02-20 10:08:45 -0500] galstrom: i looked at it a while ago.. and it was not near usable for me..
[2014-02-20 10:09:02 -0500] spheromak: so the jobs I was trying to do multi-vm just aren't as big a deal anymore.
[2014-02-20 10:09:17 -0500] galstrom: nice

[2014-02-20 14:07:14 -0500] iartarisi: shouldn't all this be in your wrapper cookbook?
[2014-02-20 14:13:50 -0500] mancdaz: iartarisi: this is tecnically in the messaging wrapper cookbook
[2014-02-20 14:14:05 -0500] mancdaz: that particular cookbook/recipe wants to install rabbitmq-server
[2014-02-20 14:14:17 -0500] mancdaz: without epel, it can't

[2014-02-20 16:30:47 -0500] mrodden: mancdaz: hi
[2014-02-20 16:30:57 -0500] mrodden: rabbitmq thing?
[2014-02-20 16:31:05 -0500] mancdaz: mrodden: yeah
[2014-02-20 16:31:13 -0500] mancdaz: I just worked out what the issue is
[2014-02-20 16:31:24 -0500] mancdaz: in our wrapper we set use_distro_version to true
[2014-02-20 16:31:27 -0500] mrodden: shouldn't the rabbit cookbook pull in the EPEL repo if it needs a package from it?
[2014-02-20 16:31:33 -0500] mancdaz: which overrides the default in the rabbitmq cookbook
[2014-02-20 16:31:40 -0500] mrodden: oh...
[2014-02-20 16:31:46 -0500] mancdaz: the default is to pull the latest rabbit version from the rabbit site itself
[2014-02-20 16:32:05 -0500] mancdaz: since we say use_distro_version, well, rhel doesn't have one
[2014-02-20 16:32:09 -0500] mrodden: was not aware of that
[2014-02-20 16:32:12 -0500] mrodden: right
[2014-02-20 16:32:17 -0500] mancdaz: hence I was adding epel to give it a 'distro' version
[2014-02-20 16:32:39 -0500] mancdaz: but I think the righter thing is to not use distro version, at least not for rhel.
[2014-02-20 16:32:51 -0500] mrodden: yeah
[2014-02-20 16:32:53 -0500] mancdaz: then we get the proper latest version from rabbit

[2014-02-20 16:33:38 -0500] mancdaz: not sure why we would not also want that for debian, but I vaguely remember in the mists of time long ago, we pinned rabbitmq version to an older one in debian due to some issue with the latest
[2014-02-20 16:34:17 -0500] mancdaz: mrodden: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-ops-messaging/blob/master/recipes/rabbitmq-server.rb#L39

[2014-02-20 16:35:21 -0500] mrodden: yeah was just looking at that
[2014-02-20 16:35:32 -0500] mancdaz: so I guess I'll just make the change to leave use_distro_version to false if rhel?
[2014-02-20 16:35:37 -0500] mrodden: should we override use_distro_version if RHEL?
[2014-02-20 16:35:39 -0500] mrodden: yeah
[2014-02-20 16:35:44 -0500] mrodden: i would rather use that
[2014-02-20 16:35:44 -0500] mancdaz: as I don't want to tinker with ubuntu when it's clearly working with the distro vesion
[2014-02-20 16:35:55 -0500] mancdaz: kk
[2014-02-20 16:36:39 -0500] mrodden: wondering if there is any licensing implications
[2014-02-20 16:36:41 -0500] mancdaz: mrodden: thanks for hearing my out-loud-thinking :-)
[2014-02-20 16:36:53 -0500] mancdaz: not that I'm aware of
[2014-02-20 16:37:08 -0500] mancdaz: I think it's just a case of do you want/not want the 'bleeding edge' version
[2014-02-20 16:37:15 -0500] mrodden: ah

[2014-02-20 20:50:25 -0500] rajini_dell: Is the role openstack-db supposed to create the keystone database?
[2014-02-20 20:51:13 -0500] rajini_dell: I see that the openstack-indentity::db recipe was removed from the run list https://github.com/mattray/openstack-chef-repo/commit/4d69ad0c733204f0100f1ab49bc96fbc0a7489f6

[2014-02-20 21:37:24 -0500] rajini_dell: I have some basic questions of how to connect database role with keystone role.
[2014-02-20 21:37:24 -0500] rajini_dell: Is the recipe openstack-db in the database role supposed to create the keystone database and the user?

[2014-02-20 21:41:49 -0500] mattray: rajini_dell: it got moved to this recipe: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-ops-database/blob/master/recipes/openstack-db.rb
[2014-02-20 21:42:18 -0500] mattray: which gets called here: https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo/blob/master/roles/os-compute-single-controller.rb#L6
[2014-02-20 21:42:34 -0500] rajini_dell: I'm looking for a correct place to call the os-ops-database::openstack-db.rb
[2014-02-20 21:43:31 -0500] rajini_dell: would it make more sense to call that from the database role or inside the service recipe ?
[2014-02-20 21:45:04 -0500] DeVVaN_: mattray: i found a "bug" in the openstack-chef-repo in the object-storage roles regarding proxy, seems like the recipie proxy was renamed to proxy-server at some point
[2014-02-20 21:46:12 -0500] DeVVaN_: i'm not familliar with git (patches, pullrequest and such) is there a guide on submitting patches that i can read?
[2014-02-20 21:46:50 -0500] mattray: DeVVaN: you can open a bug here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-chef
[2014-02-20 21:47:07 -0500] mattray: or if you want to try to fix it...

[2014-02-20 22:19:20 -0500] mattray: to propose it
[2014-02-20 22:19:28 -0500] DeVVaN_: fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
[2014-02-20 22:19:50 -0500] DeVVaN_: ahh... have to sign an agreement :)
[2014-02-20 22:20:39 -0500] mattray: you did the "git review -s" from the blog?
[2014-02-20 22:20:57 -0500] DeVVaN_: yeah
[2014-02-20 22:24:31 -0500] DeVVaN_: there we go
[2014-02-20 22:28:37 -0500] DeVVaN_: mattray: so now i wait for jenkins, code review and approval ?
[2014-02-20 22:50:33 -0500] alop: are we bumping version on havana yet?

[2014-02-20 23:02:41 -0500] mattray: DeVVaN_: this you? https://review.openstack.org/#/c/75208/

[2014-02-20 23:03:08 -0500] DeVVaN_: mattray: yeah
[2014-02-20 23:03:21 -0500] mattray: so yeah, wait on jenkins to pass the tests, then the reviews start
[2014-02-20 23:04:23 -0500] DeVVaN_: how long does that generally take? i can se there is bunch of stuff in the list
[2014-02-20 23:07:28 -0500] mattray: DeVVaN_: http://status.openstack.org/zuul/
[2014-02-20 23:07:36 -0500] mattray: looks like they're backing up again
[2014-02-20 23:11:41 -0500] mattray: DeVVaN_: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/75208/ I reviewed it and found an issue
[2014-02-20 23:15:03 -0500] DeVVaN_: mattray: yeah, so how do i add a new patch to it, reverting the wrong issue?
[2014-02-20 23:15:21 -0500] mattray: I've got a gist of that, 1 sec

[2014-02-20 23:16:47 -0500] mattray: DeVVaN_: so "git review -d 75208"
[2014-02-20 23:17:00 -0500] mattray: you can rebase, but probably no need
[2014-02-20 23:17:28 -0500] mattray: make the changes

[2014-02-20 23:39:16 -0500] alop: this is strange, never seen my change fail jenkins with a status of "LOST"
[2014-02-20 23:41:52 -0500] mattray: alop: that's what happens when zuul gets crazy overloaded
[2014-02-20 23:42:00 -0500] mattray: it starts dropping stuff
