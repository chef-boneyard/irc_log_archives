[2014-02-07 16:54:00 -0500] rajini_ram: Have a question on gem installation using chef_gem using local distribution
[2014-02-07 16:55:39 -0500] rajini_ram: We have our own distribution of gems and want to use the option "source" , but don't want to hack the cookbooks. Has anyone experienced the same and is there another way to specify this without changing the recipe
[2014-02-07 17:00:11 -0500] claco: what about dropping a custom .gemrc ?
[2014-02-07 17:00:15 -0500] rajini_ram: does anyone have any suggestion or opinion?
[2014-02-07 17:01:57 -0500] rajini_ram: but gemrc i though works for gem-package  not chef-gem
[2014-02-07 17:03:15 -0500] rajini_ram: IIRC, chef_gem ignores custom .gemrc files.
[2014-02-07 17:03:16 -0500] rajini_ram: that is the problem
[2014-02-07 17:04:24 -0500] claco: surpsing.. since it just calls the gem binary?
[2014-02-07 17:04:34 -0500] claco: where are you putting the .gemrc?
[2014-02-07 17:05:19 -0500] claco: digging through resource source atm...
[2014-02-07 17:06:14 -0500] rajini_ram: /etc/gemrc
[2014-02-07 17:08:18 -0500] claco: wonder if the omnibus gem reads that... either way...
[2014-02-07 17:08:20 -0500] claco: http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2013-12/msg00236.html
[2014-02-07 17:08:35 -0500] claco: at least one possibility
[2014-02-07 17:10:45 -0500] claco: or maybe try .gemrc for the root user. Not sure why/when, but there are times when .gemrc works and /etc/gemrc doesn't. Never dug into it.
[2014-02-07 17:11:29 -0500] claco: well..probably depends on how the omnibus ruby is setup... and what it's --sysconfdir setting is...
[2014-02-07 17:12:43 -0500] rajini_ram: not sure if the link you posted is the same case as ours
[2014-02-07 17:13:18 -0500] rajini_ram: One chef-run setups up the gemrc for us and the subsequent chef runs should load them right and it doesn't
[2014-02-07 17:16:53 -0500] rajini_ram: related to https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-vault/pull/1
[2014-02-07 17:20:02 -0500] rajini_ram: may be it is related to the user ~/.gemrc vs /etc/gemrc https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4539
[2014-02-07 17:20:09 -0500] claco: most of those mention ~/.gemrc over /etc/gemrc
[2014-02-07 17:20:11 -0500] rajini_ram: Worth giving it a try
[2014-02-07 17:20:56 -0500] rajini_ram: Thanks for the discussion
[2014-02-07 17:20:57 -0500] claco: /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem env
[2014-02-07 17:21:13 -0500] claco: /root/.gems is the second path...
[2014-02-07 17:21:29 -0500] claco: so try adding a root .gemrc...and gem env again to see if the changes take
[2014-02-07 17:23:03 -0500] claco: yup should work. I add /root/.gemrc .. reran /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem env and my changes are applied
[2014-02-07 17:23:20 -0500] claco: so, I _think_ that might do it for chef_gem

[2014-02-07 19:38:09 -0500] Mr_D: I'm trying to get the vagrant testing environment up.  After installing the plugins (order: omnibus, chef-zero, berkshelf), "vagrant up" fails with the following:

[2014-02-07 19:39:30 -0500] claco: so, my first thought...
[2014-02-07 19:39:53 -0500] claco: try pinning what the omnibus installs to 11.8
[2014-02-07 19:40:12 -0500] claco: 11.10 is quite new, and maybe the other plugins haven't adjusted to the gem conflicts yet
[2014-02-07 19:40:56 -0500] claco: so....
[2014-02-07 19:41:00 -0500] claco: change this: https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo/blob/master/Vagrantfile-aio-nova#L25

[2014-02-07 19:41:59 -0500] Mr_D: will give it a shot - thx very much!
[2014-02-07 19:42:37 -0500] claco: but it could be earlier than that.. so?
[2014-02-07 19:44:18 -0500] Mr_D: no dice - same error
[2014-02-07 19:45:04 -0500] claco: yeah... this is earlier... the plugin deps in vagrant...

[2014-02-07 19:46:17 -0500] claco: Mr_D: so, sounds like we need to find working versions of the plugins... and do a vagrant plugin install x --plugin-version=y
[2014-02-07 19:46:34 -0500] claco: sorting through github now to see who's updated recently...
[2014-02-07 19:51:20 -0500] claco: Mr_D: What does:  vagrant plugin list   give you in terms of versions?
