[2014-05-07 01:57:17 -0400] galstrom: markvan: here is the issue (https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity/blob/master/recipes/server.rb#L197-L207)
[2014-05-07 01:57:24 -0400] galstrom: markvan: you were correct
[2014-05-07 01:58:34 -0400] galstrom: markvan: service(keystone) restarts were all getting stacked up.. and are supposed to fire on the templateing of api-paste.ini.. but we dont drop that by default now.. so registration runs before keystone has been restarted
[2014-05-07 01:59:35 -0400] galstrom: markvan: and the vagrantfile is also bypassing this restart notification: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity/blob/master/recipes/server.rb#L230

[2014-05-07 21:34:39 -0400] lrr: the data bags are there, but it seems it cannot find them?

[2014-05-07 21:36:47 -0400] lrr: oh, derp
[2014-05-07 21:42:45 -0400] lrr: ok, new problem. I have a remote mysql server that I'm trying to use. how do i go about setting up the environment so that it doesn't trying to 1) install mysql server on the controller node, and 2) doesn't try to restart mysqld on the controller node?
[2014-05-07 21:44:37 -0400] lrr: anyone?
[2014-05-07 21:59:20 -0400] mrodden: lrr: don't use the openstack-ops-database recipes to install it and you'll have to find a way to set the attributes up yourself
[2014-05-07 21:59:40 -0400] mrodden: i would let the cookbooks manage your mysql instance for the openstack cloud though
[2014-05-07 22:00:11 -0400] mrodden: i found it to be a bad idea using one central mysql server for all my services
[2014-05-07 22:00:44 -0400] mrodden: eggs in one basket and all
[2014-05-07 22:00:59 -0400] lrr: ah, ok then
[2014-05-07 22:01:48 -0400] lrr: then I have a different error in the stable/havana branch where if I set mysql to a specific ip, it can't login as root using the password to create the tables/users
[2014-05-07 22:01:53 -0400] mrodden: plus its free, so you don't have to worry about paying for more licenses and that sillyness
[2014-05-07 22:02:04 -0400] mrodden: yeah
[2014-05-07 22:02:07 -0400] mrodden: you'll hit that
[2014-05-07 22:02:27 -0400] mrodden: you'll need to give the database rsources your root password so they can build the users
[2014-05-07 22:02:31 -0400] lrr: just manually create the root identified by the ip?
[2014-05-07 22:02:34 -0400] mrodden: and grant privileges etc
[2014-05-07 22:02:59 -0400] mrodden: oh
[2014-05-07 22:02:59 -0400] lrr: mrodden: it create root@localhost just fine, but root@<ip> for mysql fails (Access denied)
[2014-05-07 22:03:07 -0400] mrodden: yeah
[2014-05-07 22:03:09 -0400] mrodden: thats mysql
[2014-05-07 22:03:11 -0400] lrr: heh
[2014-05-07 22:03:20 -0400] mrodden: each user@host is a different account
[2014-05-07 22:03:24 -0400] lrr: alright, i'll play round with it some more then
[2014-05-07 22:03:31 -0400] mrodden: you can use wildcards
[2014-05-07 22:03:34 -0400] mrodden: but yeah
[2014-05-07 22:03:37 -0400] mrodden: its MySQL permissions stuff
[2014-05-07 22:03:45 -0400] lrr: mrodden: you would think if you specify a mysql host in the attributes, it should create that "user"
[2014-05-07 22:03:46 -0400] mrodden: google and the docs are helpful there
[2014-05-07 22:03:56 -0400] lrr: and not error out
[2014-05-07 22:04:02 -0400] lrr: on initial setup
[2014-05-07 22:04:25 -0400] mrodden: i think it tries to do wildcards normally for the hosts
[2014-05-07 22:04:29 -0400] mrodden: root account is special
[2014-05-07 22:04:44 -0400] mrodden: since mysql is prepopulated to have higher security restrictions on those
[2014-05-07 22:04:51 -0400] mrodden: generally
[2014-05-07 22:05:12 -0400] lrr: yah
[2014-05-07 22:05:43 -0400] lrr: mrodden: do you know how much cpu usage mysql for only openstack services uses? like would it be ok to setup the mysql instance in a vm?
[2014-05-07 22:05:53 -0400] mrodden: sure
[2014-05-07 22:06:00 -0400] mrodden: mysql is pretty lightweight most of the time
[2014-05-07 22:06:05 -0400] lrr: ok
[2014-05-07 22:06:44 -0400] lrr: my controller node is on a vm and I didn't want it to affect other vms on that node
[2014-05-07 22:07:16 -0400] mrodden: the performance critical parts are usually the messaging service (rabbitmq or qpid)
[2014-05-07 22:07:34 -0400] mrodden: nova is great at distributing the DB access
[2014-05-07 22:07:38 -0400] lrr: nice
[2014-05-07 22:07:39 -0400] mrodden: so its generally not a problem
[2014-05-07 22:07:43 -0400] lrr: ok, thanks!
[2014-05-07 22:07:58 -0400] lrr: also i have 1 other issue: i can't get the vnc to work
[2014-05-07 22:08:09 -0400] mrodden: ah yeah thats tricky
[2014-05-07 22:08:24 -0400] mrodden: make sure you set teh compte-vnc bind_interface or address correctly
[2014-05-07 22:08:38 -0400] mrodden: i haven't tested that much with teh cookbooks
[2014-05-07 22:08:38 -0400] lrr: oh
[2014-05-07 22:09:10 -0400] mrodden: VNC sessions get proxied from the nova-novncproxy to the nova-compute nodes
[2014-05-07 22:09:25 -0400] mrodden: they can operate on the localhost interface if you do an all in one node
[2014-05-07 22:09:38 -0400] mrodden: but they will need a private network to communicate on if that isn't the case
[2014-05-07 22:10:15 -0400] mrodden: xvpvncproxy works similarly
[2014-05-07 22:11:07 -0400] lrr: mrodden: so right now, ['compute-vnc-bind']['host'] is setup to be the public ip of my controller node. would the bin_interface be the public interface? (i.e. my public interface is eth0)
[2014-05-07 22:11:54 -0400] mrodden: that would make the QEMU instance VNC consoles (from QEMU/KVM) listen on the public IP
[2014-05-07 22:11:58 -0400] mrodden: which is probably not what you want
[2014-05-07 22:12:04 -0400] lrr: nope
[2014-05-07 22:12:06 -0400] mrodden: since those dont require passwords
[2014-05-07 22:12:09 -0400] mrodden: :)
[2014-05-07 22:12:12 -0400] mrodden: yeah
[2014-05-07 22:12:27 -0400] lrr: would i set that to the private interface (eth1)?
[2014-05-07 22:12:33 -0400] mrodden: should be the private/management IP of the compute node
[2014-05-07 22:12:36 -0400] lrr: or is the ip incorrect?
[2014-05-07 22:12:43 -0400] lrr: ah, ok
[2014-05-07 22:13:02 -0400] mrodden: that stuff needs cleaning up in the cookbooks
[2014-05-07 22:13:05 -0400] lrr: heh
[2014-05-07 22:13:20 -0400] mrodden: i have a point to bring that up during the summit stuff
[2014-05-07 22:14:24 -0400] lrr: but is the ip i'm binding to correct?
[2014-05-07 22:14:44 -0400] mrodden: is your controller a compute node as well?
[2014-05-07 22:14:48 -0400] lrr: nope
[2014-05-07 22:14:51 -0400] mrodden: ok
[2014-05-07 22:15:01 -0400] mrodden: just set that to localhost (lo) on your controller then
[2014-05-07 22:15:05 -0400] mrodden: the setting will be ignored
[2014-05-07 22:15:20 -0400] mrodden: since only nova-compute cares about it
[2014-05-07 22:15:41 -0400] lrr: well, in my environment, i have node['openstack']['endpoints']['bind-host'] set to the public ip of my controller node
[2014-05-07 22:15:48 -0400] mrodden: yeah
[2014-05-07 22:15:50 -0400] mrodden: so that should be ok
[2014-05-07 22:15:59 -0400] mrodden: as long as you aren't running nova-compute on the controller
[2014-05-07 22:16:08 -0400] lrr: ah, ok
[2014-05-07 22:16:09 -0400] mrodden: it will put the public IP in the nova.conf
[2014-05-07 22:16:13 -0400] mrodden: but it won't affect anything
[2014-05-07 22:16:16 -0400] lrr: ok. :)
[2014-05-07 22:17:12 -0400] mrodden: on the compute nodes you'll need to make sure its the private IP
[2014-05-07 22:17:36 -0400] lrr: mrodden: how would i do that in the environment?
[2014-05-07 22:17:44 -0400] mrodden: ah that would be hard
[2014-05-07 22:17:51 -0400] mrodden: since environments are shared between all nodes
[2014-05-07 22:17:56 -0400] mrodden: you'll have to set it at the node level
[2014-05-07 22:17:58 -0400] mrodden: or the role level
[2014-05-07 22:18:02 -0400] lrr: hmm
[2014-05-07 22:18:08 -0400] mrodden: by hard i mean impossible...
[2014-05-07 22:18:15 -0400] lrr: that gets nasty really fast
[2014-05-07 22:18:17 -0400] mrodden: yeah
[2014-05-07 22:18:18 -0400] mrodden: it does
[2014-05-07 22:18:35 -0400] mrodden: i haven't thought of a better way of doing it
[2014-05-07 22:18:37 -0400] mrodden: yet
[2014-05-07 22:18:45 -0400] mrodden: i dont think anyone else has either
[2014-05-07 22:19:27 -0400] lrr: (not to discredit anything in here) in the rdo puppet scripts, they seem to have it working for a multi-node setup
[2014-05-07 22:19:38 -0400] lrr: might take a look there?
[2014-05-07 22:19:42 -0400] mrodden: yeah
[2014-05-07 22:19:51 -0400] mrodden: would be interesting to see what they are doing
[2014-05-07 22:20:33 -0400] mrodden: i thought about doing some auto-discovery of networks
[2014-05-07 22:20:43 -0400] mrodden: since most people have a private network they want to bind services on
[2014-05-07 22:21:13 -0400] mrodden: so all the compute nodes would share a common subnet or something usually
[2014-05-07 22:21:19 -0400] mrodden: we could detect that
[2014-05-07 22:21:25 -0400] lrr: so if i'm letting chef create/manage my mysql on the controller node, what should the db host be set to if I want to have minimal interaction with the setup? right now it is the public ip of the controller node. should i set it to 0.0.0.0?
[2014-05-07 22:21:54 -0400] mrodden: oh it should auto discover if you dont set it
[2014-05-07 22:22:11 -0400] mrodden: or are you talkign about bind IP?
[2014-05-07 22:22:14 -0400] lrr: if i don't set it, mysql starts on localhost
[2014-05-07 22:22:20 -0400] mrodden: right
[2014-05-07 22:22:28 -0400] mrodden: that should be ok...
[2014-05-07 22:22:39 -0400] mrodden: compute nodes don't need DB access
[2014-05-07 22:23:00 -0400] lrr: really?
[2014-05-07 22:23:09 -0400] mrodden: unless you are deploying nova-conductor on them
[2014-05-07 22:23:19 -0400] mrodden: but the cookbooks don't do taht without tweaking
[2014-05-07 22:23:30 -0400] mrodden: yeah its by design
[2014-05-07 22:23:37 -0400] mrodden: in case a compute host gets compromised
[2014-05-07 22:23:57 -0400] mrodden: heh
[2014-05-07 22:24:03 -0400] mrodden: yeah i work on nova a lot
[2014-05-07 22:24:05 -0400] mrodden: used to anyways
[2014-05-07 22:24:21 -0400] lrr: i'll have to try some experimenting then :)
[2014-05-07 22:24:53 -0400] mrodden: yeah you should be fine with localhost binding
[2014-05-07 22:25:04 -0400] mrodden: the only problem i could see would be ceilometer
[2014-05-07 22:25:10 -0400] mrodden: but that should be using mongo
[2014-05-07 22:25:19 -0400] lrr: ok. should i set the interface bind to the public facing interface?
[2014-05-07 22:25:27 -0400] mrodden: for?
[2014-05-07 22:25:37 -0400] mrodden: mongodb?
[2014-05-07 22:25:39 -0400] lrr: default['openstack']['endpoints']['db']['bind_interface'] = nil
[2014-05-07 22:25:41 -0400] lrr: mysql
[2014-05-07 22:25:49 -0400] mrodden: oh just leave nil
[2014-05-07 22:25:52 -0400] lrr: ok
[2014-05-07 22:25:54 -0400] mrodden: it will figure it out
[2014-05-07 22:26:14 -0400] mrodden: you could do the private IP if you have controller services running elsewhere
[2014-05-07 22:26:51 -0400] mrodden: crap i have to run
[2014-05-07 22:26:59 -0400] mrodden: hopefully that all helps

[2014-05-07 23:26:37 -0400] xmltok_: i have a fix but i cant register my contact information with gerrit, it gives me a 'cannot store contact information' errorr
