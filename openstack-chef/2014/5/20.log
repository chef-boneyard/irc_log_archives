[2014-05-20 15:00:26 -0400] lrr: I have a question about how openstack-chef sets up the metadata service when running controller + n compute using nova network.
[2014-05-20 15:00:46 -0400] lrr: after running chef, the openstack-nova-api service trie to start but dies immediately
[2014-05-20 15:00:57 -0400] lrr: on the compute node with nova-network
[2014-05-20 15:01:28 -0400] lrr: if I move it to the controller node, it will run just fine without any issues, but then none of the instances can connect to the metadata service
[2014-05-20 15:02:29 -0400] lrr: if i run openstack-nova-metadata-api on the controller node and add metadata_host=127.0.0.1 to the /etc/nova/nova.conf, then it works onthe compute node, but the compute cookbooks doesn't have any option (or even default setting) for this option
[2014-05-20 15:04:25 -0400] lrr: and the openstack docs suggest that the nova-api service should be running where the nova-network service is running, but it instantly fails there with a "dead but pid exists" status
