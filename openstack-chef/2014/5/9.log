[2014-05-09 14:30:42 -0400] lrr: I'm having an issue with nova-network when I setup a remote mysql db. Everything on the controller node works fine, but in /var/log/nova/network.log on the compute node, regardless of what's set as the db host, it still tries to log into the controller node for mysql stuff which causes networking to fail. any help?
