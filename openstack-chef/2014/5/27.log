[2014-05-27 18:42:47 -0400] jmickle: mattray: you around>?
[2014-05-27 18:43:42 -0400] mattray: jmickle: kinda
[2014-05-27 18:43:53 -0400] jmickle: hehe how are you? how was your weekend?
[2014-05-27 18:45:48 -0400] jmickle: was curious if you knew how to link bootstrapping openstack vms when users launch vms through horizon
[2014-05-27 18:49:46 -0400] mattt: jmickle: wut?
[2014-05-27 18:50:26 -0400] jmickle: i am confused how to do the orchestration between chef/openstack when users launch instances through the openstack UI
[2014-05-27 18:50:39 -0400] jmickle: so that it bootstraps with chef and registers a node etc
[2014-05-27 18:50:52 -0400] jmickle: my devs want a web ui to spin up nodes
[2014-05-27 18:50:56 -0400] mattt: jmickle: custom image i guess?
[2014-05-27 18:50:59 -0400] jmickle: and i want nodes to be spun up with chef haha
[2014-05-27 18:51:05 -0400] jmickle: yeah thats what my thoughts were a custom image
[2014-05-27 18:51:11 -0400] jmickle: was wondering if there was anything already out there
[2014-05-27 18:53:15 -0400] mattt: jmickle: there are better ways than custom image i guess
[2014-05-27 18:53:47 -0400] jmickle: hmmm
[2014-05-27 18:53:52 -0400] mattt: jmickle: cloud-init may be something worth looking at
[2014-05-27 18:54:24 -0400] mattt: jmickle: because maintaining custom images is a bit of a PITA
[2014-05-27 18:54:28 -0400] jmickle: yeah
[2014-05-27 18:54:44 -0400] jmickle: knife openstack will bootstrap i assume very much like knife-ec2
[2014-05-27 18:54:59 -0400] jmickle: but giving knife-openstack CLI to devs is going to be painful
[2014-05-27 18:55:08 -0400] jmickle: they want a web UI
[2014-05-27 18:55:08 -0400] jmickle: lol
[2014-05-27 18:55:51 -0400] jmickle: would almost be nice if horizon had hooks into chef/puppet
[2014-05-27 18:57:22 -0400] paulczar: jmickle: thats what cloud-init and heat is for ;)
[2014-05-27 18:57:42 -0400] jmickle: is it?
[2014-05-27 18:57:47 -0400] jmickle: i hadnt gotten to learning about those yet
[2014-05-27 18:58:20 -0400] mattt: paulczar: i'm wondering if horizon supports cloud-init tho ?
[2014-05-27 18:59:08 -0400] paulczar: yeah theres a text box for user-data iirc
[2014-05-27 18:59:46 -0400] mattt: ok cool ... then i'd vote cloud-init too then :)
[2014-05-27 18:59:59 -0400] jmickle: sweet
[2014-05-27 19:00:18 -0400] jmickle: so use heat to launch cloud-init scripts
[2014-05-27 19:00:25 -0400] jmickle: that would essentially bootstrap for me
[2014-05-27 19:00:33 -0400] mattt: jmickle: i don't think heat is necessary
[2014-05-27 19:00:43 -0400] mattt: you can use cloud-init directly
[2014-05-27 19:00:46 -0400] mattt: or heat alternatively
[2014-05-27 19:00:52 -0400] mattt: but i've not used either so i'll defer to paulczar
[2014-05-27 19:00:53 -0400] jmickle: well what would register the node with chef
[2014-05-27 19:00:57 -0400] jmickle: to bind the roles etc
[2014-05-27 19:01:13 -0400] jmickle: assuming knife-openstack works like knife-ec2
[2014-05-27 19:01:38 -0400] jmickle: there is a node spinup -> chef server registration -> chef-client run -> pull down of roles/environment settings
[2014-05-27 19:03:07 -0400] paulczar: jmickle: youd need to write a shell script to install chef-client, inject the validator key, run chef-client with the appropriate args to do a run
[2014-05-27 19:03:17 -0400] jmickle: ok
[2014-05-27 19:03:18 -0400] paulczar: and you include that in the user-data
[2014-05-27 19:03:42 -0400] jmickle: ok let me read up on this stuff
[2014-05-27 19:03:44 -0400] jmickle: thanks for the info
[2014-05-27 19:10:44 -0400] mattt: jmickle: cool!
