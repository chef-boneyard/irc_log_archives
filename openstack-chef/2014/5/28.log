[2014-05-28 15:06:19 -0400] markvan: usually just ping on irc,   galstrom
[2014-05-28 15:06:30 -0400] galstrom: markvan: pong
[2014-05-28 15:07:45 -0400] markvan: galstrom:    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/94830/    question on spec using nil test, maybe you can help
[2014-05-28 15:07:57 -0400] galstrom: markvan: looking
[2014-05-28 15:09:01 -0400] kieren: galstrom: if i have the defaults set to nil, i can override it
[2014-05-28 15:09:29 -0400] kieren: but can't if i set them to something else
[2014-05-28 15:10:00 -0400] galstrom: yeah.. the default attribute set to nil will work
[2014-05-28 15:10:07 -0400] galstrom: there is a issue with chefspec
[2014-05-28 15:10:14 -0400] galstrom: where you will need to test the nil case first
[2014-05-28 15:10:25 -0400] galstrom: then node.override the value and test that case second
[2014-05-28 15:10:59 -0400] galstrom: if you do two set tests on a nil value.. chefspec gets wonky.. and it can fail
[2014-05-28 15:11:00 -0400] kieren: do you know of a cookbook/spec that's implemented that already?
[2014-05-28 15:11:07 -0400] galstrom: yeah.. hold on a sec
[2014-05-28 15:12:44 -0400] galstrom: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute/blob/master/spec/nova-common_spec.rb#L154-L204
[2014-05-28 15:12:58 -0400] galstrom: i ran into that exact same issue with the single/ha rabbit tests
[2014-05-28 15:14:14 -0400] kieren: ace, thanks - i'll give it a whirl
[2014-05-28 15:23:16 -0400] kieren: galstrom: hrm, maybe i'm doing something wrong - is something like this what you meant? http://paste.openstack.org/show/81898/
[2014-05-28 15:31:03 -0400] galstrom: kieren: looking
[2014-05-28 15:33:15 -0400] galstrom: kieren: i was actually thinking of something like this: http://ix.io/cGz
[2014-05-28 15:33:42 -0400] galstrom: assuming that node.default[['openstack']['identity']['ldap']['tls_cacertdir'] = nil is in the attributes file
[2014-05-28 15:34:27 -0400] galstrom: kieren: nevermind.. i did not read your snippet close enough
[2014-05-28 15:35:11 -0400] kieren: the attributes file has both cacertdir and cacertfile set to the keystone.conf defaults (/etc/keystone/certs/xxxxx) - if i set them to 'nil', i can override them fine from a spec
[2014-05-28 15:35:47 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: Add missing AMQP options to neutron.conf  https://review.openstack.org/95967
[2014-05-28 15:36:14 -0400] kieren: i tried a few variations on node.set/node.override, juggling the order around etc
[2014-05-28 15:36:21 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Add missing AMQP options to nova.conf  https://review.openstack.org/92937
[2014-05-28 15:36:47 -0400] kieren: it seems like setting an attr to nil doesn't override a default
[2014-05-28 15:37:48 -0400] galstrom: kieren: like this: http://ix.io/cGA
[2014-05-28 15:38:25 -0400] kieren: i'm pretty sure that works
[2014-05-28 15:38:49 -0400] kieren: is it ok to have the defaults as 'nil' rather than the upstream defaults?
[2014-05-28 15:39:24 -0400] galstrom: kieren: it depends on what the default case is supposed to be
[2014-05-28 15:41:10 -0400] galstrom: the upstreams are set to None: https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/stable/icehouse/etc/keystone.conf.sample#L1070-L1076
[2014-05-28 15:41:22 -0400] kieren: i guess the cookbook isn't actually grabbing the ca certs, so there's no point defaulting to a file/directory that won't be there
[2014-05-28 15:41:44 -0400] kieren: oh..... :(
[2014-05-28 15:41:58 -0400] galstrom: but i thought the tls_cacertfile and tls_cacertdir are an either/or set of options
[2014-05-28 15:42:08 -0400] galstrom: if you set file.. you leave dir as None (nil)
[2014-05-28 15:42:09 -0400] kieren: yea, they are
[2014-05-28 15:42:11 -0400] galstrom: and vice versa
[2014-05-28 15:42:32 -0400] kieren: if file is set, it overrides dir
[2014-05-28 15:42:39 -0400] galstrom: so.. it might be more sane.. to have the code handle that case
[2014-05-28 15:42:57 -0400] galstrom: if file is not nil.. set file to attribute value.. and dir to None
[2014-05-28 15:43:01 -0400] kieren: my template change should (hopefully)
[2014-05-28 15:43:08 -0400] galstrom: if dir is set.. set dir to attribute value
[2014-05-28 15:43:40 -0400] kieren: kk
[2014-05-28 15:44:08 -0400] galstrom: kieren: yeah.. your keystone.conf logic seems to be doing just that
[2014-05-28 15:44:29 -0400] galstrom: if you set the attributes to nil in attributes.rb
[2014-05-28 15:44:34 -0400] galstrom: and make two contexts
[2014-05-28 15:44:36 -0400] kieren: i'll switch the default to nil and will re-run the tests
[2014-05-28 15:44:43 -0400] galstrom: context1 = when cacertfile is set
[2014-05-28 15:44:51 -0400] galstrom: context2 = when cacertfile is set
[2014-05-28 15:44:59 -0400] galstrom: cacertdir ^
[2014-05-28 15:45:13 -0400] galstrom: then i think the chefspec should go
[2014-05-28 15:46:42 -0400] galstrom: kieren: let me know if you get it going.. or you want me to throw a patch at it..
[2014-05-28 15:47:05 -0400] kieren: will do, i'll give it a tweak now - thanks again for your help
[2014-05-28 15:47:10 -0400] galstrom: np
[2014-05-28 15:47:17 -0400] galstrom: thanks for working on it

[2014-05-28 20:34:15 -0400] mrodden: would anyone feel strongly about me cleaning up the cinder.conf.erb
[2014-05-28 20:34:27 -0400] mrodden: since there are references to config options that are moved
[2014-05-28 20:34:50 -0400] mrodden: and it doesn't seem useful at all to have commented options in a config file that realistically won't be modified by a human
[2014-05-28 20:35:29 -0400] mrodden: i'm mostly looking at the RPC/AMPQ stuff that is now all isolated in oslo.messagin
[2014-05-28 20:35:30 -0400] mrodden: g
[2014-05-28 20:35:36 -0400] mrodden: and the same for nova/cinder
[2014-05-28 20:35:40 -0400] mrodden: and will be for other projects soon

[2014-05-28 20:38:51 -0400] galstrom: mrodden: i think that is where partial templates comes in handy
[2014-05-28 20:38:58 -0400] mrodden: right
[2014-05-28 20:39:31 -0400] galstrom: that way you can still fill out a conf file with all of the default values available.. but not have to deal with it in a template all at once
[2014-05-28 20:39:36 -0400] galstrom: :)
[2014-05-28 20:40:20 -0400] mrodden: i dont follow?
[2014-05-28 20:40:38 -0400] mrodden: actually setting them to defaults from Chef attributes?
[2014-05-28 20:40:54 -0400] mrodden: or leaving the defaults in comments
[2014-05-28 20:43:21 -0400] mrodden: oh nvm

[2014-05-28 20:46:34 -0400] mrodden: partial templates would be useful for the python config sections
[2014-05-28 20:46:48 -0400] mrodden: [DEFAULT], [rabbit], [libvirt], etc
[2014-05-28 21:00:43 -0400] galstrom: mrodden: yes.. that is what i was thinking..
[2014-05-28 21:00:50 -0400] galstrom: also useful for multi options
[2014-05-28 21:00:53 -0400] galstrom: like qpid/rabbit
[2014-05-28 21:01:01 -0400] mrodden: yeah
[2014-05-28 21:01:03 -0400] mrodden: "sections"
[2014-05-28 21:01:04 -0400] galstrom: two partials.. you just load the one you want
[2014-05-28 21:01:06 -0400] galstrom: exactly
[2014-05-28 21:01:34 -0400] mrodden: pretty sure that will be pulled into its own real python config section soon enough
[2014-05-28 21:01:40 -0400] mrodden: [messaging] or seomthing
[2014-05-28 21:01:46 -0400] galstrom: that would be nice
[2014-05-28 21:01:53 -0400] mrodden: oslo.messaging is more or less a copy paste of what was in nova
[2014-05-28 21:01:58 -0400] mrodden: just to get the projects to move to it
[2014-05-28 21:01:58 -0400] galstrom: but there are other places like ldap in keystone
[2014-05-28 21:02:11 -0400] mrodden: yeah
[2014-05-28 21:02:12 -0400] galstrom: that are very painful on the eyes..
[2014-05-28 21:02:17 -0400] mrodden: ldap would be nice that section is terribad
[2014-05-28 21:02:23 -0400] mrodden: heh
[2014-05-28 21:02:50 -0400] galstrom: no joke
[2014-05-28 21:03:09 -0400] galstrom: i pulled that into a partial in the rcbops cookbooks a year and a half ago.. cause it made me angry

[2014-05-28 21:03:35 -0400] mrodden: yeah thats knid of how i felt about the RPC stuff i just saw in cinder
