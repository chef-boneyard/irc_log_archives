[2014-05-15 19:38:46 -0400] jolyonbrown: Hi there - has anyone else had problems with a "Recipe Compile Error in /var/chef/cache/cookbooks/openstack-common/recipes/set_endpoints_by_interface.rb"?
[2014-05-15 20:29:36 -0400] jolyonbrown: looks as though my error only happens when I'm attempting to boot a node in a vagrant-multi-neutron environment - same setup but with vagrant-aio-nova seems to sail past.
