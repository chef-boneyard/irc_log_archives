[2014-05-19 15:03:55 -0400] iartarisi: Again, I don't have a mic, but I'd like to raise the issue of adding a trove cookbook.
[2014-05-19 15:04:02 -0400] mrodden: +1
[2014-05-19 15:04:14 -0400] mattray: iartarisi: yup, we discussed that in Atlanta
[2014-05-19 15:04:37 -0400] mattray: I'll go ahead and add "openstack-cookbook-database" and "openstack-cookbook-hadoop" for Trove and Sahara
[2014-05-19 15:05:00 -0400] iartarisi: ah, cool
[2014-05-19 15:06:51 -0400] mattray: galstrom: any rackers joining?
[2014-05-19 15:09:00 -0400] mattray: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/juno-summit-ops-meetup-chef is the Chef Operators notes from Friday
[2014-05-19 15:16:37 -0400] iartarisi: wait, you mean, 'openstack-database', right? because we already depend on a 'database' cookbook.
[2014-05-19 15:16:55 -0400] rsmitty: Hi all - quick question about the Swift cookbooks. I'd like to do have two swift nodes, but I'm unsure about which cookbooks to add to each runlist. Would I just have one node with the "all-in-one" role and one with the "storage" role?
[2014-05-19 15:17:16 -0400] galstrom: mattray: not sure.. i had a conflict this morning
[2014-05-19 15:21:58 -0400] mattray: iartarisi: openstack-cookbook-database
[2014-05-19 15:22:22 -0400] mrodden: could we just do client
[2014-05-19 15:22:25 -0400] mrodden: instead of common-client
[2014-05-19 15:22:40 -0400] mrodden: i mean they are trying to converge all the openstack clients into one anyways
[2014-05-19 15:30:15 -0400] mrodden: i like yaml...
[2014-05-19 15:41:30 -0400] mrodden: RHEL5 should die in a fire...
[2014-05-19 15:42:30 -0400] mattray: galstrom: we talked about moving the meeting back 30 minutes to 10:30, that work better for you guys?
[2014-05-19 15:42:59 -0400] galstrom: mattray: 10:30 would probably work better for me
[2014-05-19 15:43:05 -0400] galstrom: not sure about the UK rackers
[2014-05-19 15:44:35 -0400] mattt: mattray: i'm sure that'd be fine
