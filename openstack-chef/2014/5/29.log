[2014-05-29 15:56:25 -0400] mattray: I pushed this to openstack-infra to get the new cookbooks created: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/96332/
[2014-05-29 15:56:43 -0400] mattray: The feedback was that Sahara should be "openstack-data-processing"
[2014-05-29 15:56:52 -0400] mattray: so that's a thing
[2014-05-29 16:15:27 -0400] galstrom: mattray: good to know
[2014-05-29 16:17:33 -0400] lrr: I'm having some issues trying to setup gre tunnel neutron with the havana branch
[2014-05-29 16:18:02 -0400] lrr: first of all, the vagrant-multi-neutron environment is broken
[2014-05-29 16:18:39 -0400] lrr: i think
[2014-05-29 16:20:02 -0400] lrr: because the endpoints field contains all of this: http://pastebin.osuosl.org/7551/
[2014-05-29 16:45:23 -0400] mrodden: process all the dataz
[2014-05-29 16:46:07 -0400] lrr: which then causes the set_endpoints_by_interface recipe to fail out
[2014-05-29 18:38:01 -0400] markvan: galstrom: on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/96254/ remove policy file.  would like to do separate commit, this one closes out the remove-policy-templates blueprint.
[2014-05-29 18:38:17 -0400] galstrom: markvan: ok
[2014-05-29 18:39:29 -0400] markvan: galstrom: you mentioned partial templates above, has that been a struggle or something we should look at for these openstack cookbooks?
[2014-05-29 18:40:07 -0400] galstrom: markvan: it has not been a struggle, it fell down to personal preference.. some devs want everything in one giant config file..
[2014-05-29 18:40:15 -0400] galstrom: but.. i generally like the partials
[2014-05-29 18:40:31 -0400] galstrom: cause.. that way you have to do less if/else blocks..
[2014-05-29 18:40:37 -0400] galstrom: and the confs are a lot cleaner
[2014-05-29 18:40:54 -0400] galstrom: if you dont import the partial.. it does not get templated into the conf file
[2014-05-29 18:40:55 -0400] markvan: ok, I'll take a deeper look into them.  I've been struggle with the network cookbooks and any help would be good.
[2014-05-29 18:41:14 -0400] galstrom: yeah.. it is definitely worth a look
[2014-05-29 18:41:26 -0400] galstrom: i started with them on the keystone/ldap stuff
[2014-05-29 18:41:31 -0400] galstrom: cause that is super ugly in the conf file
[2014-05-29 18:42:48 -0400] mrodden: galstrom: wondering if you have an opinion on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/96291
[2014-05-29 18:43:14 -0400] galstrom: i was trying to not get dragged in on that one
[2014-05-29 18:43:17 -0400] galstrom: :(
[2014-05-29 18:43:19 -0400] mrodden: hah
[2014-05-29 18:43:20 -0400] mrodden: k
[2014-05-29 18:43:52 -0400] galstrom: as far as a conf file on a running system.. i generally like all of the comments
[2014-05-29 18:44:03 -0400] galstrom: makes it easier for a trouble shooting perspective
[2014-05-29 18:44:04 -0400] mrodden: we should just ship a sample ( or maybe teh packages ship sample configs ) instead of including comments for stuff we already control
[2014-05-29 18:44:11 -0400] mrodden: ok
[2014-05-29 18:44:27 -0400] galstrom: however.. working with the templates.. all of the comments annoy me.. leads to a gigantic ugly file
[2014-05-29 18:44:33 -0400] mrodden: yes
[2014-05-29 18:44:53 -0400] mrodden: hence i feel like having the sample configs woudl be nice
[2014-05-29 18:44:55 -0400] mrodden: for debugging
[2014-05-29 18:45:03 -0400] galstrom: the solution i went with a while ago.. was partial templates
[2014-05-29 18:45:04 -0400] mrodden: but we dont need to have them in the actual configs
[2014-05-29 18:45:17 -0400] galstrom: that way.. the template i am working with.. is fairly small
[2014-05-29 18:45:22 -0400] mrodden: yes
[2014-05-29 18:45:22 -0400] galstrom: and i still get to keep all the comments
[2014-05-29 18:45:35 -0400] mrodden: makes sense
[2014-05-29 18:45:44 -0400] galstrom: but without partials
[2014-05-29 18:45:46 -0400] galstrom: ...
[2014-05-29 18:46:10 -0400] galstrom: i would err to the troubleshooting usecase.. and leave the comments in
[2014-05-29 18:46:22 -0400] mrodden: yeah
[2014-05-29 18:46:33 -0400] mrodden: i think i would like partials + comments longterm
[2014-05-29 18:47:06 -0400] mrodden: especially with most of these starting to come from the common libraries
[2014-05-29 18:47:25 -0400] mrodden: all the qpid/rabbit/rpc stuff will be the same between most projects
[2014-05-29 18:48:13 -0400] galstrom: yeah
[2014-05-29 18:48:46 -0400] galstrom: the source attribute for partials gives you that
[2014-05-29 18:48:52 -0400] mrodden: yep
[2014-05-29 18:48:53 -0400] galstrom: which is nice
[2014-05-29 18:48:57 -0400] mrodden: exactly my thoughts
[2014-05-29 20:50:19 -0400] jmickle: anyone have any use with RDO
[2014-05-29 20:50:21 -0400] jmickle: for openstack>
