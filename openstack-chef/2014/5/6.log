[2014-05-06 17:31:09 -0400] lrr: can someone help me debug an error i'm having? I've created (what i think is correct) the data bags layout for service and db passwords as well as the secrets. but when i run chef-cliet, i get a 404 response
[2014-05-06 17:31:17 -0400] lrr: this is in the stable/havana branch
[2014-05-06 17:31:23 -0400] lrr: i'm not sure what I'm doing wrong

[2014-05-06 18:28:55 -0400] galstrom: anyone notice that keystone is broke in master?
[2014-05-06 18:31:09 -0400] galstrom: when using the vagrant files.. it can not create any of the tenants/users

[2014-05-06 20:49:25 -0400] markvan: galstrom_zzz: yes, I just ran into that as well, trying to figure it out.  Service is up and I can do keystone cli manually and it works with admintoken.
[2014-05-06 21:23:35 -0400] galstrom: so..
[2014-05-06 21:23:44 -0400] galstrom: i think it has to do with the prettytable parsing
[2014-05-06 21:24:07 -0400] galstrom: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/libraries/parse.rb#L31
[2014-05-06 21:24:13 -0400] galstrom: i dont think table is nil
[2014-05-06 21:24:18 -0400] galstrom: but it is empty
[2014-05-06 21:24:20 -0400] galstrom: and boom
[2014-05-06 21:24:54 -0400] galstrom: also for what ever reason.. templated catalog is not working correctly either
[2014-05-06 21:28:39 -0400] markvan: galstrom: I see that the paste.ini change move the restart server line
[2014-05-06 21:29:12 -0400] markvan: galstrom: we might have conf pieces that are not yet picked up by the server now
[2014-05-06 21:29:57 -0400] markvan: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity/commit/d20615e91be693d6898cb3c53cfd125ad4cdf9f1#diff-3e8bbb9796e1fb74295ceac72868245bL203
[2014-05-06 21:41:10 -0400] galstrom: markvan: that could make sense
[2014-05-06 21:41:44 -0400] markvan: seems like all other in there are action :delayed, so we hit the registration when not yet ready.
[2014-05-06 21:42:16 -0400] galstrom: markvan: that would do it
[2014-05-06 21:45:02 -0400] markvan: So, now that paste.ini template is gone, and either that or templated backend would do the immediate restart, where to put that now?  On keystone.conf template seems to work, but I'm not sure that is the right place.
[2014-05-06 21:45:57 -0400] markvan: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity/blob/master/recipes/server.rb#L194
[2014-05-06 21:50:05 -0400] markvan: Since both the paste.ini and templated backend are conditional, seems like the next one up the line is keystone.conf templatye.
[2014-05-06 21:51:47 -0400] markvan: galstrom: is there any finer level of control for when delayed kicks in?
[2014-05-06 21:52:28 -0400] markvan: like at end of that server recipe?
[2014-05-06 21:52:53 -0400] markvan: would not want to leave that recipe until server is up and running.
[2014-05-06 22:01:20 -0400] markvan: or switch server service to subscribe, but there are a bunch of resources involved.
[2014-05-06 22:21:08 -0400] galstrom: markvan: you can stack up a bunch of delayeds.. then fire an immediate.. and i think they all accept the immediate (if you need to do it in the middle of the recipe
