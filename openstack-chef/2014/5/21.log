[2014-05-21 17:57:49 -0400] lrr: is there a reason why in master branch there is no keystone-paste.ini template but in stable/havana there is?
[2014-05-21 17:58:27 -0400] lrr: when trying out the master branch and specifying havana, keystone errors out because it expects keystone-paste.ini, but the keystone cookbook on master doesn't setup this file
[2014-05-21 18:01:16 -0400] lrr: if we want to use havana, should we go maste and specify the release version, or use the stable/havana branch?

[2014-05-21 19:06:33 -0400] galstrom: lrr: you should be using the stable/havana branch if you want to deploy havana
[2014-05-21 19:07:36 -0400] lrr: ok

[2014-05-21 20:20:31 -0400] mattt: markvan_: you there ?
[2014-05-21 21:13:56 -0400] markvan_: mattt: pong
[2014-05-21 21:14:27 -0400] mattt:  markvan_ https://review.openstack.org/#/c/94653/2/libraries/cli.rb -- was wondering if you could clarify your second comment?
[2014-05-21 21:14:52 -0400] markvan_: mattt: the args one?
[2014-05-21 21:15:07 -0400] mattt: markvan_: yep!
[2014-05-21 21:16:30 -0400] markvan_: mattt: Seeing that glance image-show already has one arg (--human-readable) I thought there might be others that might come down the road.  So, adding the optional arg hash now would allow for that.
[2014-05-21 21:16:31 -0400] mattt: markvan_: glance's image-show requires id|name, so there are no optional arguments there
[2014-05-21 21:16:39 -0400] lrr: i have a question about how the metadata service is setup in the stable/havana branch. The docs say that nova-api should be running on the same host as nova-network, but in os-compute-single-controller, it starts nova-api on the controller while the os-compute-worker starts nova-network on the compute node
[2014-05-21 21:16:42 -0400] mattt: markvan_: OHHHH
[2014-05-21 21:16:49 -0400] mattt: markvan_: cool, that makes sense
[2014-05-21 21:16:51 -0400] lrr: this causes cloud-init to not be able to pull from the metadata
[2014-05-21 21:17:07 -0400] markvan_: mattt:  not a big deal, just a suggestion.
[2014-05-21 21:17:15 -0400] mattt: markvan_: it's a good one, thanks
[2014-05-21 21:17:35 -0400] lrr: the docs suggest if you have nova-network on a different host than nova-api, you need to specify metadata_host in /etc/nova/nova.conf, but at least in stable/havana, there is no option to specify this
[2014-05-21 21:17:47 -0400] lrr: what should be done to get this working correctly?
[2014-05-21 21:17:49 -0400] mattt: markvan_: regarding the first comment, that is already being tested via the test for image_id ... but you think i should do something more explicit?
[2014-05-21 21:18:35 -0400] markvan_: mattt: ok, I see that now, it's covered. thx.
[2014-05-21 21:18:56 -0400] mattt: markvan_: the change feels a bit dirty for some reason, but i wasn't sure how else to do it
[2014-05-21 21:20:01 -0400] markvan_: mattt: maybe just a comment as to why it's needed
[2014-05-21 21:20:21 -0400] mattt: markvan_: i like the way you think
[2014-05-21 21:23:55 -0400] markvan_: lrr: not sure on your situation, but there's the misc_nova that could be used to add key=value pairs to the nova.conf
[2014-05-21 21:24:25 -0400] lrr: markvan_: ah, thanks.
[2014-05-21 21:28:23 -0400] mattt: lrr: nova-network should run on each compute node no ?
[2014-05-21 21:30:27 -0400] lrr: mattt: not entirely sure. i've seen it setup where nova-network runs on the controller node and isn't installed on the compute node
[2014-05-21 21:31:13 -0400] mattt: lrr: in old versions of openstack you had to run it on the controller, but then you introduced a massive SPOF ... because if controller went down all instances would be inaccessible
[2014-05-21 21:31:25 -0400] mattt: lrr: i think you need to flip default['openstack']['compute']['network']['multi_host'] = true and then you can run it on each compute
[2014-05-21 21:32:02 -0400] lrr: mattt: right now it is running on each compute node
[2014-05-21 21:32:08 -0400] lrr: but the metadata service is messed up
[2014-05-21 21:32:25 -0400] lrr: nova-api on the compute node has "service dead but pid exists"
[2014-05-21 21:32:39 -0400] lrr: but nova-api on the controller is running without issue
[2014-05-21 21:32:44 -0400] mattt: lrr: you shouldn't need nova-api on the compute node
[2014-05-21 21:32:55 -0400] mattt: lrr: there is a separate metadata service that you should run
[2014-05-21 21:33:48 -0400] lrr: mattt: but the os-compute-worker doesn't start nova-metadata-api on the compute node
[2014-05-21 21:34:04 -0400] lrr: nor does it start that on the controller node
[2014-05-21 21:34:44 -0400] lrr: which afaict, nova-metadata-api needs to be running and defined if instances are goingto get metadata
[2014-05-21 21:37:06 -0400] mattt: lrr: can you start up nova-metadata-api on the controller?
[2014-05-21 21:37:14 -0400] mattt: there should be something in nova.conf pointing to that metadata service tho
[2014-05-21 21:37:21 -0400] mattt: i'm just looking at the cookbooks now
[2014-05-21 21:38:48 -0400] lrr: mattt: these are the only metadata references in /etc/nova/nova/conf on the controller node: http://pastebin.osuosl.org/7406/
[2014-05-21 21:43:56 -0400] mattt: lrr: you may want to pop a bug about this ... it's late here and it's been a while since i've looked at this stuff
[2014-05-21 21:44:07 -0400] mattt: lrr: i'd be happy to poke into it in the morning tho
[2014-05-21 21:44:30 -0400] lrr: mattt: ok
[2014-05-21 21:44:45 -0400] mattt: lrr: you should be able to start up the metadata service on the compute host, metadata_host defaults to $my_ip
[2014-05-21 21:45:40 -0400] mattt: lrr: if you create a bug PM the bug # to me and i'll look tomorrow
[2014-05-21 21:45:48 -0400] lrr: mattt: ok
[2014-05-21 21:46:56 -0400] lrr: mattt: is $my_ip a defined variable?
[2014-05-21 21:48:57 -0400] mattt: lrr: no i think it just defaults to your node's primary IP
[2014-05-21 21:50:07 -0400] lrr: ok
[2014-05-21 21:51:56 -0400] openstackgerrit: Mark Vanderwiel proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-dashboard: Fix to allow login urls to be configurable  https://review.openstack.org/94448
[2014-05-21 21:55:00 -0400] mattt: lrr: pretty sure you need to flip that multi_host attribute on tho, have a look at http://docs.openstack.org/grizzly/openstack-compute/admin/content/existing-ha-networking-options.html
[2014-05-21 21:55:51 -0400] lrr: mattt: i do have multi_host set to T
[2014-05-21 21:56:20 -0400] mattt: lrr: k ... and sorry, http://docs.openstack.org/havana/install-guide/install/apt/content/nova-network.html is probably more applicable to you
[2014-05-21 21:56:29 -0400] mattt: but it does suggest that you can run the metadata service on each compute
[2014-05-21 21:58:16 -0400] mattt: lrr: afk, ping me if you think there is a bug
[2014-05-21 21:59:20 -0400] lrr: ok
[2014-05-21 22:17:02 -0400] jmickle: mattray: you around?
[2014-05-21 22:17:27 -0400] mattray: jmickle: yup
[2014-05-21 22:17:35 -0400] jmickle: so im at a critical fork in the road
[2014-05-21 22:17:40 -0400] jmickle: neutron or nova?
[2014-05-21 22:17:49 -0400] jmickle: i cant seem to decide either way ive heard good and bad for each
[2014-05-21 22:17:50 -0400] jmickle: haha
[2014-05-21 22:18:01 -0400] mattray: Havana or Icehouse?
[2014-05-21 22:18:04 -0400] jmickle: icehouse
[2014-05-21 22:18:04 -0400] mattray: and scale?
[2014-05-21 22:18:15 -0400] jmickle: couple thousand vms
[2014-05-21 22:18:21 -0400] jmickle: maybe a couple hunded
[2014-05-21 22:18:24 -0400] jmickle: we are in POC right now
[2014-05-21 22:19:48 -0400] mattray: so my understanding is that the ovs implementation might not scale well
[2014-05-21 22:20:30 -0400] mattray: but I expect galstrom_zzz or markvan_ can comment more on ovs at ~500 nodes.
[2014-05-21 22:20:36 -0400] jmickle: ovs is neutron i take it?
[2014-05-21 22:20:41 -0400] mattray: openvswitch
[2014-05-21 22:20:46 -0400] jmickle: ah sorry
[2014-05-21 22:20:57 -0400] mattray: yeah, the open source neutron driver
[2014-05-21 22:21:15 -0400] jmickle: ahhhhh the sucky part about this is its like a make or break decision too
[2014-05-21 22:21:23 -0400] jmickle: seems like id have to rebuild entirely
[2014-05-21 22:21:35 -0400] mattray: what do you need from your network?
[2014-05-21 22:21:45 -0400] mattray: virtual private networks or no?
[2014-05-21 22:22:15 -0400] jmickle: not really i mean its all a private internal network as it is
[2014-05-21 22:22:17 -0400] mattray: because nova-network will give you a nice big single network
[2014-05-21 22:22:22 -0400] jmickle: reall we just need a nice big single network
[2014-05-21 22:22:22 -0400] jmickle: haha
[2014-05-21 22:22:35 -0400] mattray: nova-network will never die :)
[2014-05-21 22:22:47 -0400] lrr: ^^
[2014-05-21 22:23:10 -0400] jmickle: should i be concerned about the deprecation efforts of nova-network?
[2014-05-21 22:23:33 -0400] mattray: jmickle: no, they can't get rid of it until there's a migration
[2014-05-21 22:23:40 -0400] jmickle: also i installed the ubuntu 13 backports like the guide said for neutron should i be concerned about using nova network now?
[2014-05-21 22:24:31 -0400] mattray: clean, fresh installs are your best bet
[2014-05-21 22:24:45 -0400] jmickle: http://docs.openstack.org/icehouse/install-guide/install/apt/content/basics-packages.html
[2014-05-21 22:24:50 -0400] jmickle: Install the Ubuntu 13.10 backported kernel:
[2014-05-21 22:24:51 -0400] jmickle: i did that step
[2014-05-21 22:25:05 -0400] mattray: "legacy networking service" is nova-network I expect
[2014-05-21 22:25:12 -0400] jmickle: yea
[2014-05-21 22:25:28 -0400] jmickle: i was planning on using neutron but now im here at the setup for either neutron or nova and got cold feet
[2014-05-21 22:25:28 -0400] jmickle: haha
[2014-05-21 22:26:04 -0400] jmickle: i feel like those headers wont harm anything
[2014-05-21 22:26:06 -0400] jmickle: for legacy network
[2014-05-21 22:26:52 -0400] jmickle: so you reccomend nova-network?
[2014-05-21 22:27:03 -0400] mattray: yeah, it's well-supported in the cookbooks
[2014-05-21 22:27:24 -0400] mattray: at least, it always works on vagrant for me, unlike neutron
[2014-05-21 22:27:37 -0400] jmickle: ok
[2014-05-21 22:27:37 -0400] jmickle: hehe
[2014-05-21 22:27:42 -0400] jmickle: thx man
[2014-05-21 22:28:02 -0400] mattray: I suspect you and lrr are doing similar setups?
[2014-05-21 22:28:16 -0400] lrr: could be
[2014-05-21 22:28:41 -0400] jmickle: possible whats lrr doing
[2014-05-21 22:28:42 -0400] jmickle: haha
[2014-05-21 22:28:57 -0400] lrr: i'm using nova-network mainly because of the complexity factor and having to leave my cluster to other students to maintain when i leave
[2014-05-21 22:29:09 -0400] lrr: and by leave i mean graduate
[2014-05-21 22:29:15 -0400] jmickle: ha
[2014-05-21 22:29:26 -0400] jmickle: interesting
[2014-05-21 22:30:32 -0400] jmickle: how many nodes?
[2014-05-21 22:30:53 -0400] mattray: fwiw we use nova-network on our openstack cluster, ~30 nodes and ~300+ VMs
[2014-05-21 22:31:02 -0400] mattray: no problems
[2014-05-21 22:31:11 -0400] mattray: but nothing else
[2014-05-21 22:31:15 -0400] lrr: jmickle: right now it will be a controller node + a couple of compute (not sure how many)
[2014-05-21 22:31:34 -0400] jmickle: ok
[2014-05-21 22:31:38 -0400] lrr: but we will be creating a powerpc cluster with 4 beefy power7 compute nodes
[2014-05-21 22:32:37 -0400] jmickle: ok well i just took the nova-network fork
[2014-05-21 22:32:38 -0400] jmickle: haha
[2014-05-21 22:32:48 -0400] jmickle: awesome
[2014-05-21 22:32:54 -0400] jmickle: im working on a rearchitecture for eharmony
[2014-05-21 22:33:13 -0400] lrr: very cool
[2014-05-21 22:33:17 -0400] jmickle: lots and lots of nodes
[2014-05-21 22:33:17 -0400] jmickle: haha
[2014-05-21 22:33:23 -0400] lrr: i bet
[2014-05-21 22:33:24 -0400] jmickle: dont even know what it will be when all said and done
[2014-05-21 22:33:44 -0400] jmickle: we have wayyyyy too many nodes at the moment but they all run a rhel 5 release and like some dudes crazy custom virtualization stuff
[2014-05-21 22:33:46 -0400] jmickle: from 10 years ago
[2014-05-21 22:33:52 -0400] lrr: heh
[2014-05-21 22:37:55 -0400] jmickle: see heres a problem i run into
[2014-05-21 22:38:02 -0400] jmickle: i created a demo user as per the docs
[2014-05-21 22:38:11 -0400] jmickle: when i use the demo user credentials and do a nova net-list
[2014-05-21 22:38:13 -0400] jmickle: nothing comes up
[2014-05-21 22:38:21 -0400] lrr: did you create a net?
[2014-05-21 22:38:24 -0400] jmickle: yeah
[2014-05-21 22:38:27 -0400] jmickle: when i use admin i see it
[2014-05-21 22:38:32 -0400] lrr: hmm
[2014-05-21 22:38:36 -0400] jmickle: actually
[2014-05-21 22:38:42 -0400] jmickle: nvm it sounds like it might be that way
[2014-05-21 22:38:43 -0400] lrr: i'm not very much experienced in that part
[2014-05-21 22:38:43 -0400] jmickle: on purpose
[2014-05-21 22:40:29 -0400] jmickle: aww its spawning an instance
[2014-05-21 22:40:31 -0400] jmickle: praise rang
[2014-05-21 22:40:55 -0400] jmickle: the first instance is always like an omg situation
[2014-05-21 22:40:56 -0400] jmickle: haha
[2014-05-21 22:41:05 -0400] jmickle: its like the helloworld app of openstack
[2014-05-21 22:41:13 -0400] lrr: yep
[2014-05-21 22:43:16 -0400] jmickle: doh

[2014-05-21 22:50:51 -0400] jmickle: what did you do to fix?
[2014-05-21 22:53:38 -0400] lrr: jmickle: i'm redeploying the vm
[2014-05-21 22:53:48 -0400] lrr: also, my compute node is a vm right now
[2014-05-21 22:53:58 -0400] lrr: i'm figuring out my environment
