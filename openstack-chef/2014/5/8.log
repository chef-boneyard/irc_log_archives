[2014-05-08 19:51:36 -0400] markvan: xmltok_: for your #1313814 heat concern, can you either create a new bug or post your issue in that existing bug.   The change I made was just correcting  typos in the conf template.
[2014-05-08 19:59:33 -0400] xmltok_: thanks markvan, i have a fix but i cant submit it to gerrit because the system errors out when i try to add my contact information
[2014-05-08 20:01:00 -0400] markvan: xmltok_: I'm curious what your trying to actually fix.
[2014-05-08 20:02:49 -0400] xmltok_: ive got a vip in front of the services, as it is, the bind ip and endpoint ip are the same thing
[2014-05-08 20:03:24 -0400] xmltok_: check out the patch, it should clarify the problem http://pastebin.com/2BcU7ep1
[2014-05-08 20:09:39 -0400] markvan: xmltok_: thx, understand now.
[2014-05-08 20:10:12 -0400] xmltok_: feel free to take that patch too, i cant submit it
[2014-05-08 20:14:34 -0400] markvan: xmltok_: you'll probably want to create a bug for this issue, is your launch pad account working for that?
[2014-05-08 20:21:37 -0400] xmltok_: done

[2014-05-08 20:47:02 -0400] markvan: xmltok_:  ^^^
[2014-05-08 20:48:12 -0400] markvan: xmltok_:  I noticed you added the path part into the waitcondition url   (/v1/waitcondition).  Can you please test that change out.
[2014-05-08 20:52:40 -0400] xmltok_: i didnt update the spec, perhaps something else got pulled in?
[2014-05-08 20:52:50 -0400] markvan: xmltok_: I compared it to http://devstack.org/lib/heat.html and my basic tests seem to work.
[2014-05-08 20:53:19 -0400] markvan: xmltok_: it's a difference between how the bind and endpoint are defined in Common.

[2014-05-08 20:54:42 -0400] markvan: I believe your patch is correct, and I updated the spec to match.
[2014-05-08 20:55:46 -0400] xmltok_: got it
[2014-05-08 20:58:56 -0400] xmltok_: im getting the correct url in my config file, it looks right
[2014-05-08 21:10:05 -0400] markvan: xmltok_: ;)
[2014-05-08 21:12:04 -0400] xmltok_: thanks!
[2014-05-08 21:13:21 -0400] xmltok_: these cookbooks have been very useful, i was testing salt and wrote some formulas to do the openstack deployment, chef & these cookbooks have been a lot easier
[2014-05-08 21:13:26 -0400] xmltok_: maybe icehouse has some to do with it too
[2014-05-08 21:14:09 -0400] markvan: xmltok_: np, yup these cookbooks have come a long way in a short time
[2014-05-08 21:20:34 -0400] xmltok_: my main problems implementing them was clustering rabbitmq (official cookbook doesnt actually cluster) and getting mysql clustered
