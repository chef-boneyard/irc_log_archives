[2013-12-09 16:05:13 -0500] spheromak: yea  me too
[2013-12-09 16:08:04 -0500] mrodden: i think its just a direct git push

[2013-12-09 16:14:53 -0500] mrodden: thoughts on having a branch for Icehouse?
[2013-12-09 16:16:59 -0500] paulczar: would be good to see this go into grizzly - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/55733/       helps stop both nova networking and neutron getting installed in a single env
[2013-12-09 16:17:46 -0500] paulczar: mray - post url for your search to give just the openstack-chef reviews ?
[2013-12-09 16:18:19 -0500] iartarisi: paulczar: I use this: https://review.openstack.org/#/q/status:open+project:^stackforge/cookbook-.*,n,z

[2013-12-09 16:18:57 -0500] mattray: mrodden: 2 weeks?
[2013-12-09 16:19:47 -0500] mrodden: meaning 2 weeks seems a bit early for icehouse to be deployed?
[2013-12-09 16:20:09 -0500] mrodden: looking into using them to do continuous deployment of openstack during development
[2013-12-09 16:20:21 -0500] mrodden: s/them/the cookbooks/
[2013-12-09 16:20:32 -0500] paulczar: don't have to review it on the call!  just saying we should get it for grizzly branch ;)
[2013-12-09 16:21:39 -0500] mrodden: also there is a Patch Sets link at the top that lets you diff between patchsets to see what they changed
[2013-12-09 16:21:49 -0500] mrodden: in Gerrit
[2013-12-09 16:23:57 -0500] mrodden: tags aren't a big deal if we are bumping patch and minor versions in the Git development branches
[2013-12-09 16:24:47 -0500] mattt: paulczar: ping
[2013-12-09 16:25:00 -0500] mattray: mrodden: we're planning on letting trunk be Havana for a few weeks, then branching off Havana and moving trunk to Icehouse soon
[2013-12-09 16:25:00 -0500] paulczar: mattt ?
[2013-12-09 16:27:12 -0500] mattt: paulczar: was going to ask about some code you touched in openstack-compute regarding a failing all in one run
[2013-12-09 16:27:37 -0500] mattt: paulczar: but i think i may have herped the derp
[2013-12-09 16:28:01 -0500] mrodden: +2 for namespacing
[2013-12-09 16:28:09 -0500] paulczar: heh k.
[2013-12-09 16:28:42 -0500] mrodden: also, sticking with Havana for a few weeks probably works, i am willing to be the same set of cookbooks with deploy both Icehouse and Havana for the time being
[2013-12-09 16:29:08 -0500] ctracey: if we are going to do that...we should do it nowish
[2013-12-09 16:29:14 -0500] ctracey: early in the cycle
[2013-12-09 16:29:15 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-12-09 16:29:18 -0500] mrodden: agreed
[2013-12-09 16:29:23 -0500] iartarisi: yeah, let's just do it :)
[2013-12-09 16:29:27 -0500] spheromak: why i brought it up (again)
[2013-12-09 16:29:52 -0500] spheromak: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_libraries.html
[2013-12-09 16:29:54 -0500] ctracey: ++
[2013-12-09 16:30:16 -0500] mattt: paulczar: yeah, whatever i installed today isn't reflecting what's in the repo, i must have some old checkout or something
[2013-12-09 16:30:40 -0500] ctracey: opscode?!
[2013-12-09 16:30:43 -0500] ctracey: ;)
[2013-12-09 16:31:02 -0500] paulczar: craig -  yeah I think they make ansible

[2013-12-09 16:32:03 -0500] mrodden: lol
[2013-12-09 16:32:54 -0500] ctracey: paulczar, my fiance is a chef. Google optimized searches are interesting...this doesnt help the problem one bit.
[2013-12-09 16:33:02 -0500] mrodden: with the extending example... how would one use that in their recipe?
[2013-12-09 16:33:14 -0500] spheromak: Openstack.method_name
[2013-12-09 16:33:16 -0500] mrodden: require '<library cookbook>'
[2013-12-09 16:33:30 -0500] mrodden: right thats the static way though right?
[2013-12-09 16:33:43 -0500] spheromak: nope libs are parsed and included auto during cheef compuile phase
[2013-12-09 16:33:57 -0500] mrodden: ok so its just there if its in the run list
[2013-12-09 16:34:02 -0500] spheromak: yep
[2013-12-09 16:34:04 -0500] mrodden: cool
[2013-12-09 16:34:05 -0500] spheromak: if its in metadata
[2013-12-09 16:34:09 -0500] iartarisi: mattray: do you have those chefspec3 ports public somewhere yet?
[2013-12-09 16:34:15 -0500] mrodden: seems kind of magical though
[2013-12-09 16:34:22 -0500] spheromak: its chef magic
[2013-12-09 16:34:25 -0500] mrodden: :)
[2013-12-09 16:34:25 -0500] spheromak: its how libs work
[2013-12-09 16:34:33 -0500] spheromak: also
[2013-12-09 16:34:39 -0500] spheromak: why it's important to namespace
[2013-12-09 16:35:00 -0500] spheromak: It used to be worse. cause people would mix in the library
[2013-12-09 16:35:16 -0500] spheromak: which was deep magic ;)
[2013-12-09 16:36:39 -0500] mrodden: sounds like "from othermodule import *" in python
[2013-12-09 16:41:46 -0500] spheromak: I will post to the Maillist as well, but I propose going this route. Open to discussion. want to get feedback here first:
[2013-12-09 16:41:48 -0500] spheromak: https://gist.github.com/spheromak/7875456
[2013-12-09 16:42:39 -0500] spheromak: I prefere search2, but It imposes more mental load on people writing recipes who maybe are new to ruby
[2013-12-09 16:43:19 -0500] spheromak: also some caveates there re: node access  and search
[2013-12-09 16:44:12 -0500] spheromak: prob best to do Chef::Recipe::Openstack, but Accessing it from templates or other resources may be problematic. I guess can adress this on a case by case

[2013-12-09 16:46:05 -0500] mattray: iartarisi: I'll abort and try that
[2013-12-09 16:46:22 -0500] mrodden: does git review actually build the new reference?
[2013-12-09 16:46:55 -0500] mrodden: guess you'll find out anyways :)
[2013-12-09 16:46:55 -0500] spheromak: mattray: these cooks are chef11 only right ?

[2013-12-09 16:51:47 -0500] mattray: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/60871/
[2013-12-09 16:52:05 -0500] iartarisi: can someone make me a stable-maint please? :)
[2013-12-09 16:53:34 -0500] iartarisi: mattray: can you +2?
[2013-12-09 16:53:52 -0500] iartarisi: I wonder if there's a separate stable-maint group for stackforge or not
[2013-12-09 16:54:43 -0500] mattray: iartarisi: nope, no can +2
[2013-12-09 16:55:02 -0500] mattray: galstrom: looks like we'll have to get #openstack-infra involved?
[2013-12-09 16:55:30 -0500] iartarisi: or just switch the naming to grizzly instead?
[2013-12-09 17:02:52 -0500] mattray: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/60875/
[2013-12-09 17:03:17 -0500] mattray: galstrom submitted that to openstack-infra, that should match the stable/grizzly permissions to what we currently have on master
[2013-12-09 17:03:20 -0500] mattray: iartarisi: ^^
[2013-12-09 17:03:35 -0500] iartarisi: oh, that's cool
[2013-12-09 17:06:42 -0500] iartarisi: I'm wondering if it actually makes sense for us to have the stable/ prefix. We won't be as defensive about accepting patches there as the rest of openstack and we won't have a special team for it.
[2013-12-09 17:08:43 -0500] mattray: iartarisi: true
[2013-12-09 17:09:11 -0500] mattray: iartarisi: if the rest of OpenStack uses stable/grizzly, we might as well?
[2013-12-09 17:09:18 -0500] mattray: I'm ambivalent and the patches are in
[2013-12-09 17:09:27 -0500] ctracey: spheromak, FYI...my next story is "deploy openstack via packages" so this might be omnibus time
[2013-12-09 17:09:40 -0500] ctracey: sorry i didnt get that code updated...was up against a deadline
[2013-12-09 17:09:52 -0500] mattray: ctracey: it's a Xmas gift!
[2013-12-09 17:10:41 -0500] iartarisi: mattray: yeah I guess no one is going to come complaining that we're dilluting their "stable/*" brand soon, so I guess it's ok. But I like being pedantic :)
[2013-12-09 17:10:44 -0500] spheromak: ctracey: yea we are doing fpm  builds right now, I need to spend time on your omni stuff.

[2013-12-09 17:11:05 -0500] ctracey: mattray, sadly i wrote my father in law  a mysql backup/recovery procedure for xmas :)
[2013-12-09 17:11:33 -0500] mattray: iartarisi: I appreciate pedantic :) I love the Chef server pedant test motto "Accuracy over tact"
[2013-12-09 17:11:43 -0500] ctracey: haha

[2013-12-09 17:11:55 -0500] iartarisi: :)
[2013-12-09 17:11:58 -0500] galstrom: so is openstack-common going to v5.0?
[2013-12-09 17:11:59 -0500] mattray: seriously, "chef-server-ctl test"
[2013-12-09 17:12:13 -0500] mattray: galstrom: I don't think it needs to bump yet
[2013-12-09 17:12:16 -0500] galstrom: ok..

[2013-12-09 17:12:35 -0500] mattray: maybe if spheromak's proposal makes any changes?
[2013-12-09 17:12:54 -0500] galstrom: yeah..
[2013-12-09 17:13:00 -0500] spheromak: ^^ 3 example implementations. I'll whip up a forum post.
[2013-12-09 17:13:03 -0500] iartarisi: well I guess default["openstack"]["release"] will have to change in -common
[2013-12-09 17:13:07 -0500] galstrom: well we will have to update the package repos for ubuntu at least
[2013-12-09 17:13:08 -0500] ctracey: spheromak, what ends up in the FPM?
[2013-12-09 17:13:36 -0500] spheromak: ctracey: its the openstack component.
[2013-12-09 17:14:02 -0500] mattray: iartarisi: yeah, maybe we bump openstack-common to 8.0.0?
[2013-12-09 17:14:03 -0500] spheromak: not an omni
[2013-12-09 17:14:14 -0500] mattray: just to be consistent?
[2013-12-09 17:14:47 -0500] spheromak: ctracey: just doing the setup.py -q bdist_rpm, and packing it with fpm/deb
[2013-12-09 17:15:34 -0500] iartarisi: mattray: I would be ok with that
[2013-12-09 17:15:50 -0500] mattray: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/60875/ is the openstack-infra changes to give us +2 for stable/*
[2013-12-09 17:15:54 -0500] iartarisi: I actually don't know why -common had a different major version until now
[2013-12-09 17:16:02 -0500] mattray: iartarisi: legacy
[2013-12-09 17:16:11 -0500] iartarisi: ok
