[2013-12-10 15:28:36 -0500] nacer: do you include a ceph cookbook in your stack ?
[2013-12-10 15:32:57 -0500] mattt: nacer: ceph is not an openstack project :(
[2013-12-10 15:33:36 -0500] nacer: mattt: yeah i know
[2013-12-10 15:52:34 -0500] nacer: mattt: the cookbooks are ready for beta  test ?
[2013-12-10 16:31:42 -0500] mattray: nacer: I was out of the channel earlier, but there should be Ceph support, just not included in the openstack-object-storage cookbooks
[2013-12-10 16:31:46 -0500] mattray: and block-storage
[2013-12-10 16:32:10 -0500] mattray: a wrapper cookbook for a ceph cookbook would work
[2013-12-10 16:32:21 -0500] mattray: to translate attributes in
