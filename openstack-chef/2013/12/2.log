[2013-12-02 19:00:15 -0500] openstackgerrit: Alan Meadows proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: Make wsgi attributes overridable  https://review.openstack.org/59470
[2013-12-02 19:04:07 -0500] spheromak: alanmeadows: but the template config on that won't work if i am patched and on griz right ?
[2013-12-02 19:06:53 -0500] alanmeadows: spheromak: That is correct, unless you modify the patch to use "api_workers" instead.  I mean it will work, but twiddling api_workers wont help since it wants "workers"
[2013-12-02 19:07:13 -0500] alanmeadows: I wish the patch would of been forward looking and used the same configuration parameter that havana uses, but unfortunately it does not
[2013-12-02 19:07:28 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-12-02 19:07:42 -0500] alanmeadows: I could make the parameter itself changeable, but just seems a bit crufty -- are you using that patch right now?
[2013-12-02 19:08:00 -0500] spheromak: thats realy my only objection. what i meant was it won't work when patched on griz. maybe better to just punt on griz ?
[2013-12-02 19:08:01 -0500] alanmeadows: We're using our own variant of it, but we use the forward looking api_workers parameter
[2013-12-02 19:08:14 -0500] spheromak: we can mod the patch
[2013-12-02 19:08:23 -0500] alanmeadows: That would set things golden :)
[2013-12-02 19:09:38 -0500] spheromak: jsut seems like it is a bit heavy of a req for someone to have to mod thepatch vs change an attrib.
[2013-12-02 19:10:23 -0500] spheromak: really doens't matter to me either way. Just thinking what is best for the wider udience
[2013-12-02 19:10:31 -0500] spheromak: *audience
[2013-12-02 19:10:47 -0500] alanmeadows: Let me see if I can get the patch updated so it uses api_workers
[2013-12-02 19:11:14 -0500] alanmeadows: That would be the best outcome -- I'm only pushing for this because grizzly is basically unusable in a production environment without multiple workers
[2013-12-02 19:11:20 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-12-02 19:11:41 -0500] spheromak: i want the change, I just want the cases covered
[2013-12-02 19:16:10 -0500] openstackgerrit: John Dewey proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image: Relax the dependency on openstack-identity to the 7.x series  https://review.openstack.org/59429
[2013-12-02 19:17:35 -0500] openstackgerrit: John Dewey proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image: Relax the dependency on openstack-identity to the 7.x series  https://review.openstack.org/59429
[2013-12-02 20:09:35 -0500] mattray: retr0h: on the CHANGELOG.md formats I was mostly focusing on the ## VERSIONs to be consistent so the Thor::SCMVersion would find them correctly
[2013-12-02 20:09:57 -0500] mattray: I need to find a good example of the exact format we should be using
[2013-12-02 20:10:38 -0500] mattray: since I see the use of ### Bug is inconsistent
[2013-12-02 20:15:02 -0500] retr0h: right
[2013-12-02 20:15:08 -0500] retr0h: im just looking at each changelog
[2013-12-02 20:15:17 -0500] retr0h: and they were diff
[2013-12-02 20:15:20 -0500] retr0h: so didn't know what to think
[2013-12-02 20:15:36 -0500] retr0h: in reality that change should be in a diff commit
[2013-12-02 20:15:44 -0500] retr0h: per the patch message you are just relaxing the version
[2013-12-02 20:16:02 -0500] retr0h: but i didn't wanna be that nitty heh
[2013-12-02 20:16:23 -0500] retr0h: deff would like all our changelogs and readmes to all be the same format
[2013-12-02 20:25:32 -0500] mattray: retr0h: welp, the Thor::SCMVersion script I wrote is going to be the new standard, so we can adjust them now
[2013-12-02 20:25:33 -0500] mattray: https://gist.github.com/mattray/7683491
[2013-12-02 20:25:48 -0500] mattray: it's just ## VERSION followed by "* commit message"
[2013-12-02 20:26:10 -0500] mattray: so now's the time to clean up one or the other or both
[2013-12-02 20:31:13 -0500] alop: mattray: so, for the existing cookbooks, you're going to incorporate this, or is it up to all of us?
[2013-12-02 20:31:45 -0500] mattray: alop: the SCM script will just pre-pend to the top
[2013-12-02 20:32:00 -0500] mattray: it looks for the previous version and inserts
[2013-12-02 20:32:12 -0500] alop: oh, so no need to modify?
[2013-12-02 20:32:15 -0500] mattray: nope
[2013-12-02 20:32:18 -0500] alop: cool beans
[2013-12-02 20:32:23 -0500] mattray: unless we want them all to be consistent
[2013-12-02 20:32:35 -0500] mattray: the changes I made were just to get the ## Version in place
[2013-12-02 20:32:46 -0500] mattray: since the SCM script looks for that
[2013-12-02 20:32:53 -0500] mattray: as opposed to the version underlined
[2013-12-02 20:33:02 -0500] mattray: both of which are fine for markdown
[2013-12-02 20:38:01 -0500] spheromak: oh
[2013-12-02 20:38:12 -0500] spheromak: mattray: gotta tag the repos versions
[2013-12-02 20:38:20 -0500] spheromak: to start. I didn't check if they are already tagged or not
[2013-12-02 20:38:50 -0500] mattray: spheromak: oh yeah, they're not
[2013-12-02 20:38:52 -0500] mattray: they need it
[2013-12-02 20:38:56 -0500] spheromak: yea no tags, so we need to tag the repo with the first version so that thor scmver will function
[2013-12-02 20:39:01 -0500] mattray: right
[2013-12-02 21:10:03 -0500] openstackgerrit: Matt Ray proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-metering: Relax the dependency on openstack-identity to the 7.x series  https://review.openstack.org/59432
[2013-12-02 21:11:38 -0500] retr0h: i do suggest one thing
[2013-12-02 21:11:45 -0500] retr0h: if we are going to add things into the gate
[2013-12-02 21:11:54 -0500] retr0h: we put it on a test repo or something
[2013-12-02 21:12:11 -0500] retr0h: b/c if the gating fails we all must wait for the openstack-infra guys to merge fixes
[2013-12-02 21:12:27 -0500] retr0h: and last time we did this, we couldn't do work for about 2 weeks
[2013-12-02 21:12:32 -0500] retr0h: due to failed gates
[2013-12-02 21:14:26 -0500] openstackgerrit: Paul Czarkowski proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: only run recipes if quantum or neutron  https://review.openstack.org/55733
[2013-12-02 21:15:33 -0500] galstrom: mattray: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/59432.. do we need all the version entries do be consistent (so empty lines in the middle of a version block)?
[2013-12-02 21:16:14 -0500] mattray: galstrom: nope. The SCM script just looks for "## VERSION" of the previous and inserts the new one there
[2013-12-02 21:16:21 -0500] galstrom:  ok
[2013-12-02 21:16:36 -0500] mattray: so we can leave the existing changelogs alone, but we'll need tags
[2013-12-02 21:18:50 -0500] mattray: retr0h: on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/59421/4/CHANGELOG.md what changes do you want?

[2013-12-02 21:38:09 -0500] retr0h: mattray: prob doesn't matter I just noticed spacing wasn't consistent thats all
[2013-12-02 21:38:28 -0500] mattray: retr0h: the diff spacing looked weird, but the file spacing looked fine to me
[2013-12-02 21:42:03 -0500] retr0h: sure
[2013-12-02 21:42:06 -0500] retr0h: what i mean is
[2013-12-02 21:42:08 -0500] retr0h: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/59421/4/CHANGELOG.md
[2013-12-02 21:42:28 -0500] retr0h: on the left you see v7.0.6 and directly under it ### Bug
[2013-12-02 21:42:34 -0500] retr0h: on the right you added a space
[2013-12-02 21:42:41 -0500] retr0h: but u only did that for some
[2013-12-02 21:43:05 -0500] retr0h: 7.2.1 , 7.2.0, 7.1.0 dont have spaces
[2013-12-02 21:43:23 -0500] retr0h: if we are going to change the format of the file I felt we should make it the same so others can follow suit
[2013-12-02 21:44:18 -0500] retr0h: this for example you didn't add spacing (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/59429/4/CHANGELOG.md)
[2013-12-02 21:44:22 -0500] retr0h: just like things to be the same
