[2013-12-03 15:34:38 -0500] alanmeadows: I don't know if I quite accomplished what you would of liked, but it seemed like the next best thing
[2013-12-03 15:34:48 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-12-03 15:35:13 -0500] spheromak: grizzly will be out of everyones minds in a few week anyhow right!
[2013-12-03 15:35:26 -0500] spheromak: we already src deploy alot of havana
[2013-12-03 15:35:55 -0500] alanmeadows: haha, one can hope.  I opened a pull request for the original patch, but realize there are several web links pointing at the github auto generated branch url, which will break if he accepted my pull
[2013-12-03 15:36:00 -0500] alanmeadows: realized, rather
[2013-12-03 15:36:07 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-12-03 16:02:32 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: anything I can do to help with the grizzly forking?
[2013-12-03 16:05:54 -0500] salmanbaset: jaypipes: echo mattray
[2013-12-03 16:14:48 -0500] spheromak: mattray: jkeiser went over chef-metal and cheffish with me last night. That stuff is sweet!
[2013-12-03 16:15:54 -0500] mattray: spheromak: yeah, he moves fast :)
[2013-12-03 16:16:06 -0500] jaypipes: mattray, salmanbaset: sorry, $work getting in way... lemme try and throw something up for the ThorSCM and robocup thing. Gimme around 10 minutes.
[2013-12-03 16:16:20 -0500] mattray: spheromak: are you on the Trello board?
[2013-12-03 16:16:40 -0500] mattray: https://trello.com/b/GcSzW0GM/chef-metal
[2013-12-03 16:16:56 -0500] spheromak: yes
[2013-12-03 16:17:13 -0500] spheromak: gonna ping ranjib on his lxc stuff
[2013-12-03 16:17:57 -0500] spheromak: not a member, but he linked me to it
[2013-12-03 16:18:15 -0500] mattray: I need to get more time on it
[2013-12-03 16:20:38 -0500] spheromak: it is good timing for me. refactoring our dev workflow (again)
[2013-12-03 16:21:07 -0500] spheromak: been using packer to build out various baked images for people. can use this to bring that together for a nice HA setup on your workstation.
[2013-12-03 16:21:24 -0500] spheromak: without the 1h wait for converge
[2013-12-03 16:21:51 -0500] jaypipes: mattray, spheromak: has one of you added rubocop to the various cookbook's Gemfiles?
[2013-12-03 16:21:57 -0500] spheromak: need to do more with it I got the basic example up and running, and starte hacking some new stuff. very slick
[2013-12-03 16:22:12 -0500] spheromak: jaypipes: i have not
[2013-12-03 16:23:03 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: no. We can wait on that if necessary
[2013-12-03 16:23:36 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: well, we will need that in there before the jenkins job will work (since the jenkins job will call rubocop)
[2013-12-03 16:23:48 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: same thing for the ThorSCM thing...
[2013-12-03 16:24:37 -0500] mattray: ok, I was testing with the compute cookbook, I'll go look
[2013-12-03 16:35:59 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak, mattray: so the guys over on -infra are recommending we go a different route for the version increment stuff...
[2013-12-03 16:36:17 -0500] mattray: do they have a tool they recommend?
[2013-12-03 16:36:52 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak, mattray: they think it would be better to just use a job that sets git tags like most of the other projects do, and then have ruby code in metadata.rb that reads the git tag to set the version.
[2013-12-03 16:37:29 -0500] mattray: nope
[2013-12-03 16:37:35 -0500] jaypipes: crap.
[2013-12-03 16:37:43 -0500] mattray: the git tags get lost once pushed to the server
[2013-12-03 16:38:44 -0500] mattray: even though we prefer git, we don't tie any of the tooling to it
[2013-12-03 16:40:03 -0500] jaypipes: understood.
[2013-12-03 16:56:53 -0500] mattray: yikes, Rubocop: 45 files inspected, 2571 offences detected
[2013-12-03 16:57:35 -0500] mattray: really doesn't like the use of double quotes instead of single quotes
[2013-12-03 16:57:46 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-12-03 16:58:08 -0500] mattray: me neither, but that'll take some cleanup
[2013-12-03 17:23:44 -0500] paulczar: haha yeah,  I added rubocop to some of my cookbooks to get used to it   spent all day yesterday running errands for it :)
[2013-12-03 17:25:50 -0500] jaypipes: mattray, spheromak: OK, so would one of you mind linking me the ThorSCM script we are going to use along with how to execute it?
[2013-12-03 17:26:45 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: https://gist.github.com/mattray/7683491 is the script
[2013-12-03 17:26:59 -0500] mattray: put 'thor-scmversion' in the Gemfile
[2013-12-03 17:26:59 -0500] retr0h: does rubocop even meatter?
[2013-12-03 17:27:06 -0500] retr0h: like really do we care that much about it?
[2013-12-03 17:27:09 -0500] mattray: retr0h: not yet, we're not gating on it
[2013-12-03 17:27:19 -0500] mattray: retr0h: but we would like to slowly cleanup
[2013-12-03 17:27:21 -0500] retr0h: we are writing cookbooks not acual real ruby code :)
[2013-12-03 17:27:31 -0500] mattray: retr0h: sometimes
[2013-12-03 17:27:36 -0500] retr0h: i think it only makes sense in library cookbooks
[2013-12-03 17:27:43 -0500] retr0h: like openstack-common
[2013-12-03 17:28:13 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: and how do I execute the thorscm script? bundle exec something?
[2013-12-03 17:28:16 -0500] retr0h: but i mean the time we do everything for rubocop, we are going to switch it out for the next flavor of the month
[2013-12-03 17:28:21 -0500] retr0h: :)
[2013-12-03 17:28:41 -0500] retr0h: le sigh ruby lol
[2013-12-03 17:28:56 -0500] jaypipes: retr0h: agreed...
[2013-12-03 17:28:59 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: and call it with 'bundle exec ruby cook-scm-ver bump auto'
[2013-12-03 17:29:25 -0500] mattray: retr0h: a lot of the complaints are fairly standard ruby things
[2013-12-03 17:29:37 -0500] mattray: single quotes are preferred over double quotes if you're not doing string interpolation
[2013-12-03 17:29:48 -0500] mattray: we just happen to have 4000 double quotes
[2013-12-03 17:29:52 -0500] retr0h: welll sure
[2013-12-03 17:29:55 -0500] retr0h: but double quotes were prefered by chef :)
[2013-12-03 17:29:58 -0500] retr0h: well by food critic
[2013-12-03 17:30:02 -0500] retr0h: at the time the stuff was written
[2013-12-03 17:30:13 -0500] mattray: le sigh :p
[2013-12-03 17:30:39 -0500] mattray: yeah, the Chef community revolted over the double-quotes
[2013-12-03 17:30:45 -0500] retr0h: now foodcritic doesn't care
[2013-12-03 17:30:53 -0500] retr0h: right exactly
[2013-12-03 17:30:55 -0500] retr0h: :P
[2013-12-03 17:30:55 -0500] mattray: not even in favor of single quotes, they still wanted symbols too
[2013-12-03 17:31:18 -0500] retr0h: thats the problem with ruby and this stuff.. there is no pep8 :P
[2013-12-03 17:31:24 -0500] retr0h: nobody can agree to do anything the same way lol
[2013-12-03 17:31:34 -0500] mattray: yeah rubocop and tailor kinda fill that gap
[2013-12-03 17:31:39 -0500] retr0h: but regardless of that.. if ppl like rubocop
[2013-12-03 17:31:41 -0500] retr0h: thats cool
[2013-12-03 17:32:07 -0500] retr0h: i just hate us to swap it out in 3 months when the next cleverly named hawtness comes out
[2013-12-03 17:32:11 -0500] openstackgerrit: Alan Meadows proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-object-storage: Update sources for grizzly branching  https://review.openstack.org/59791
[2013-12-03 17:32:52 -0500] mattray: retr0h: agreed, but right now everything's pretty messy, so using rubocop would at least standardize
[2013-12-03 17:32:58 -0500] retr0h: yeah totes
[2013-12-03 17:33:31 -0500] retr0h: and
[2013-12-03 17:33:41 -0500] retr0h: it seems better than the other lint we were using
[2013-12-03 17:38:28 -0500] retr0h: the " vs ' imo isn't really a huge deal esp when dealing with cookbooks perf isn't going to be an issue, but I do agree to stick to a standard
[2013-12-03 17:39:00 -0500] retr0h: but thats coming from a guy that doesn't add parens to his methods :)
[2013-12-03 17:39:17 -0500] mattray: I do prefer parens
[2013-12-03 17:39:31 -0500] retr0h: i write methods like english
[2013-12-03 17:39:51 -0500] retr0h: I read a lot of seattle.rb code
[2013-12-03 17:40:06 -0500] retr0h: and followed how they did it.. but if rubocop wants it then im happy to do it that way
[2013-12-03 17:40:09 -0500] retr0h: i like the standard
[2013-12-03 17:42:45 -0500] retr0h: this looks pretty good
[2013-12-03 17:42:53 -0500] retr0h: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide/
[2013-12-03 17:45:12 -0500] mattray: yeah, I've followed that with my own code
[2013-12-03 17:48:42 -0500] markvan: ret0h: I just quickly reviewed the guide, seems like it's well though out.   +1 for going with rubocop.
[2013-12-03 17:48:51 -0500] spheromak: retr0h: mattray i go back and forth. if you don't use parens you tend to keep the args short
[2013-12-03 17:49:15 -0500] spheromak: also re: rubocop +1
[2013-12-03 17:49:37 -0500] mattray: spheromak: retr0h: I usually think about new users first interactions. My gut tells me parens are more approachable
[2013-12-03 17:49:44 -0500] mattray: but I'm fine either way
[2013-12-03 17:50:50 -0500] retr0h: the fact that we are having this discussion about parens is what annoys me about ruby :)
[2013-12-03 17:51:01 -0500] retr0h: it shouldn't even be a question lol
[2013-12-03 17:51:44 -0500] mattray: retr0h: I admire the rigidity of python :)
[2013-12-03 17:51:54 -0500] retr0h: lol
[2013-12-03 17:51:59 -0500] retr0h: it plays well with my ocd
[2013-12-03 17:52:00 -0500] retr0h: lol
[2013-12-03 17:52:37 -0500] retr0h: at least its not js
[2013-12-03 17:52:37 -0500] retr0h: lol
[2013-12-03 17:56:14 -0500] spheromak: retr0h: flexability has it's price
[2013-12-03 17:56:43 -0500] retr0h: im perfectly happy with pythons flexablility :P
[2013-12-03 17:57:06 -0500] retr0h: but i was a ruby dev for many many years.. i can do it too :)
[2013-12-03 17:59:54 -0500] spheromak: im indifferent to both of them tbh.
[2013-12-03 18:00:12 -0500] spheromak: all this oop makes my C brain ache ;)
[2013-12-03 18:07:54 -0500] mattray: so if you haven't been in #openstack-infra, there's some push back on the thor script
[2013-12-03 18:08:13 -0500] mattray: we may need to resolve the metadata.rb versioning on the workstation
[2013-12-03 18:08:39 -0500] mattray: we can get the git auto-incrementing based on commit messags
[2013-12-03 18:11:06 -0500] mattray: so if and when we start uploading to the community site, we'll need to include that step
[2013-12-03 18:14:09 -0500] spheromak: mattray: I'm not in there whats the pushback ?  that we are using ci to commit / mod sutff ?
[2013-12-03 18:14:14 -0500] mattray: yes
[2013-12-03 18:14:23 -0500] retr0h: why does it need to auto update?
[2013-12-03 18:14:36 -0500] spheromak: figured. yea its dirty, but its better than having people hand do this shit
[2013-12-03 18:14:39 -0500] retr0h: why not have a gate job that just fails if the version hasn't been updated
[2013-12-03 18:14:56 -0500] spheromak: retr0h: then people ahve to deal with it. and all pending updates have to handle versioning
[2013-12-03 18:15:00 -0500] mattray: retr0h: I thought that's what nitpicky reviewers were for :)
[2013-12-03 18:15:02 -0500] spheromak: 3 PR's in flight
[2013-12-03 18:15:10 -0500] spheromak: all of them go from 7.1.0 > 7.1.1
[2013-12-03 18:15:13 -0500] spheromak: one of them merges
[2013-12-03 18:15:15 -0500] spheromak: other 2 fails
[2013-12-03 18:15:19 -0500] spheromak: pretty dumb
[2013-12-03 18:15:29 -0500] mattray: spheromak: actually the gate would probably let all 3 in
[2013-12-03 18:15:35 -0500] mattray: and the merge would fail
[2013-12-03 18:15:45 -0500] retr0h: i dunno
[2013-12-03 18:15:48 -0500] mattray: wait, that's what you said :)
[2013-12-03 18:15:49 -0500] retr0h: isn't part of working with chef
[2013-12-03 18:15:54 -0500] retr0h: to update metadata
[2013-12-03 18:15:57 -0500] spheromak: since it should be 7.1.1 7.1.2 7.1.3
[2013-12-03 18:15:58 -0500] retr0h: isn't that like chef 101
[2013-12-03 18:16:05 -0500] spheromak: not when jenkins can do it for you
[2013-12-03 18:16:22 -0500] retr0h: but
[2013-12-03 18:16:26 -0500] retr0h: it relies on ur commit message
[2013-12-03 18:16:28 -0500] retr0h: which is manual
[2013-12-03 18:16:35 -0500] retr0h: so its basically the same thing
[2013-12-03 18:16:36 -0500] spheromak: i would just externalize that to a VERSION file. Need to circle back and see if all the tooling is pushing VERSION files around.
[2013-12-03 18:16:39 -0500] spheromak: nope
[2013-12-03 18:16:42 -0500] spheromak: it auto bumps patch
[2013-12-03 18:16:46 -0500] retr0h: sure i get that
[2013-12-03 18:16:47 -0500] spheromak: and lets you override
[2013-12-03 18:16:55 -0500] retr0h: just seems like a lot of work
[2013-12-03 18:16:57 -0500] retr0h: for something stupid
[2013-12-03 18:17:03 -0500] retr0h: but its not my call
[2013-12-03 18:17:08 -0500] retr0h: i dont join the monday conferences
[2013-12-03 18:17:10 -0500] retr0h: i dotn really care
[2013-12-03 18:17:21 -0500] spheromak: i think the inverse is true. manually managing versions in the pull requests is alot of work for something pretty dumb thats easy to automate
[2013-12-03 18:17:26 -0500] retr0h: i just dont get whats hard about metadata.rb
[2013-12-03 18:17:34 -0500] spheromak: nothing actually difficult about it
[2013-12-03 18:17:45 -0500] spheromak: whats problem is when it doesn't happen
[2013-12-03 18:17:51 -0500] spheromak: i.e. i want to trust versions
[2013-12-03 18:17:55 -0500] spheromak: not git hashes.
[2013-12-03 18:17:57 -0500] mattray: or it merges backward
[2013-12-03 18:18:14 -0500] spheromak: only way i can trust that is if its automatic. ensuring any merge is also a versioned commit.
[2013-12-03 18:18:31 -0500] retr0h: still relies on proper peer review
[2013-12-03 18:18:34 -0500] spheromak: this is mainly to support usage of these cooks as libraries that other people use in their wrappers/environments
[2013-12-03 18:18:49 -0500] spheromak: absolutely. are you saying that with peer review well never let one slip ?
[2013-12-03 18:18:54 -0500] spheromak: why even have to worry about it ?
[2013-12-03 18:18:57 -0500] retr0h: nah it deff will
[2013-12-03 18:19:01 -0500] spheromak: its quite simple to automate
[2013-12-03 18:19:55 -0500] mattray: so if we can't automate it on the CI, how can we do it on the workstation?
[2013-12-03 18:20:08 -0500] retr0h: so when it happens in ci
[2013-12-03 18:20:30 -0500] retr0h: CI is going to make sure it is a part of the commit into gerrit?
[2013-12-03 18:20:49 -0500] mattray: that's what we wanted
[2013-12-03 18:20:54 -0500] retr0h: how is that possible?
[2013-12-03 18:21:13 -0500] retr0h: gerrit pushes jenkins the change id
[2013-12-03 18:21:23 -0500] retr0h: so jenksin knows what patchset to checkout
[2013-12-03 18:21:51 -0500] spheromak: jenkins never merges, gerrit does. so this has to be on the gerrit side ?
[2013-12-03 18:21:51 -0500] retr0h: gerrit is going to be unaware of anything doen in jenkisn land
[2013-12-03 18:22:12 -0500] retr0h: gerrit is the git server
[2013-12-03 18:22:21 -0500] retr0h: it mirrors to stackroge
[2013-12-03 18:22:24 -0500] spheromak: im 100% ignorant to gerrit
[2013-12-03 18:22:30 -0500] spheromak: so bear with me
[2013-12-03 18:22:35 -0500] retr0h: sure
[2013-12-03 18:22:38 -0500] retr0h: jay and i setup gerrit at att
[2013-12-03 18:22:38 -0500] retr0h: but
[2013-12-03 18:22:48 -0500] retr0h: im still confused by all the moving pieces
[2013-12-03 18:22:59 -0500] retr0h: spheromak: I think what u said makes perfect sense
[2013-12-03 18:23:02 -0500] retr0h: and conviced me
[2013-12-03 18:23:08 -0500] retr0h: that it makese sense to automate it
[2013-12-03 18:23:14 -0500] retr0h: b/c ur right why do it if u dont have to
[2013-12-03 18:23:15 -0500] spheromak: yea its why i opted not to do it. 1) it wants to be the git repo and 2) seemed overly complex for the simple workflow i needed
[2013-12-03 18:23:40 -0500] retr0h: so way i understand the workflow
[2013-12-03 18:23:45 -0500] retr0h: and we may wanna ask the guys in #openstack-infra
[2013-12-03 18:23:46 -0500] spheromak: retr0h: yea so the place where it should happen is wherever the merge happens
[2013-12-03 18:24:02 -0500] retr0h: gerrit is running
[2013-12-03 18:24:04 -0500] retr0h: you push to gerrit
[2013-12-03 18:24:20 -0500] retr0h: a process called zuul runs on some machines in their infra.. that monitors the gerrit firehose
[2013-12-03 18:24:27 -0500] spheromak: yarp
[2013-12-03 18:25:24 -0500] retr0h: when a changeset comes in.. it fires off a jenkins job.. but passes jenkins a handfull of variables
[2013-12-03 18:25:49 -0500] retr0h: I don't recall all of them.. but I believe it is the changeset
[2013-12-03 18:26:27 -0500] retr0h: once jenkins OK's it - zuul pings gerrit to confirm the sha and then allows merging
[2013-12-03 18:26:29 -0500] jaypipes: changeset, yes.
[2013-12-03 18:26:50 -0500] retr0h: so jenkins cant really do version bumping (i don't believe)
[2013-12-03 18:26:55 -0500] spheromak: makes sense, jenknis would locally merge that and run the jobs, and just report back build status to zuul. which is the  pipeline manger, so there is a zuul job that kicks the merge and pushes to gerrit ?
[2013-12-03 18:27:08 -0500] jaypipes: but zuul also understands all the other patches that are queued on the repo, and if any of them are dependent, it will stop executing tests on dependent branches when an upstream branch has failed.
[2013-12-03 18:27:43 -0500] spheromak: what does the merge push ?
[2013-12-03 18:28:35 -0500] jaypipes: the specific changeset that was tested and passed, as long as all dependent patches have merged.
[2013-12-03 18:32:04 -0500] spheromak: jaypipes: but someting has to merge the commit and push the commit onot master right ?
[2013-12-03 18:33:14 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak: yes, Zuul does that.
[2013-12-03 18:34:00 -0500] jaypipes: technically, it's the jenkins Gerrit user that Zuul executes the git commit as...
[2013-12-03 18:38:28 -0500] retr0h: what about
[2013-12-03 18:38:49 -0500] retr0h: if we wrote a pip or gem that would drop a hook into peoples repo
[2013-12-03 18:38:52 -0500] retr0h: so on post commit
[2013-12-03 18:39:02 -0500] retr0h: so it did the bump for them
[2013-12-03 18:39:27 -0500] retr0h: prob not as ideal th
[2013-12-03 18:39:28 -0500] retr0h: tho*
[2013-12-03 18:40:15 -0500] retr0h: if you guys want to do this - the openstack-infra guys might be able to give you suggestions if it is possible they are the gerrit masters
[2013-12-03 18:40:19 -0500] retr0h: i'm simply a poser lol
[2013-12-03 18:42:07 -0500] mattray: I wonder if we can just use a shell call in the metadata.rb?
[2013-12-03 18:42:20 -0500] spheromak: yea would have to be something in zuul that did it before it pushed
[2013-12-03 18:43:29 -0500] spheromak: mattray: what i did originally was just use scm-version as-is which drops a VERSION file. and then read that in my metadata, and left the VERSION out of version controll. (since the built artifacts were being pushed to a chef-server).
[2013-12-03 18:43:44 -0500] spheromak: but kitchen/berks/chef don't all agree on what files should get uploaded to a chef-server.
[2013-12-03 18:44:17 -0500] spheromak: anyhow. a post-commit would work, but still gonna have stuff in flight that will fail a merge.
[2013-12-03 18:48:49 -0500] mattray: spheromak: how did you read the file in your metadata?
[2013-12-03 18:49:13 -0500] mattray: I'm trying to use
[2013-12-03 18:49:14 -0500] mattray: version          "#{git describe --abbrev=0 --tags}"
[2013-12-03 19:01:42 -0500] alop: anyone else using stackforge cookbooks having issues with glance-cache-management?
[2013-12-03 19:02:49 -0500] spheromak: mattray: i jsut read the VERSION file.
[2013-12-03 19:32:58 -0500] mattray: spheromak: version          Mixlib::ShellOut.new("git describe --abbrev=0 --tags", :cwd => File.dirname(__FILE__)).run_command.stdout
[2013-12-03 19:33:11 -0500] mattray: works, yuck
[2013-12-03 19:33:32 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: ^^
[2013-12-03 19:34:30 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: but as soon as it's uploaded to the chef server, what would happen? would chef server understand what version it is?
[2013-12-03 19:35:00 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: knife runs the metadata.rb and converts it to metadata.json
[2013-12-03 19:35:05 -0500] mattray: nothing happens on the server
[2013-12-03 19:35:21 -0500] mattray: but if you don't have git...
[2013-12-03 19:35:49 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: understood.
[2013-12-03 19:36:26 -0500] mattray: so it works and if Gerrit auto-tags our git commits we're good to go?
[2013-12-03 19:36:38 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: I think so.
[2013-12-03 19:38:05 -0500] mattray: retr0h, spheromak: what do you guys think about that? no version strings
[2013-12-03 19:38:24 -0500] mattray: and really, we could get rid of the CHANGELOG.md if we want, but I find it nice to have
[2013-12-03 19:40:01 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: I never really use the Changelog, to be honest... I just use git log.
[2013-12-03 19:40:12 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: agreed
[2013-12-03 19:40:26 -0500] alanmeadows: My only qualm with the changelog is any competing commits always have to do a hands-on rebase to resolve that
[2013-12-03 19:40:54 -0500] jaypipes: alanmeadows: which is why we're advocating the no changelog strategy :)
[2013-12-03 19:41:02 -0500] jaypipes: alanmeadows: and just use git log.
[2013-12-03 19:43:06 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: so if we can get the git tag auto-incrementer magic working with the openstack-infra guys, we can put these changes in after the cookbooks are tagged
[2013-12-03 19:43:11 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: so shall we split up the work of ridding of changelog and putting the above Mixlib call into the repositories? We will also need to manually git tag each repository.
[2013-12-03 19:43:20 -0500] mattray: :)
[2013-12-03 19:43:24 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: lol.
[2013-12-03 19:43:32 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: ok, what you want me to work on?
[2013-12-03 19:43:37 -0500] jaypipes: mattray:  the infra stuff?
[2013-12-03 19:43:59 -0500] mattray: yes please. Figure out if we can put #major/#minor anywhere in the commit message or if it has to be in the status.
[2013-12-03 19:44:21 -0500] mattray: I'll write up another email to the mailing list explaining how it's going to work
[2013-12-03 19:44:22 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: status?
[2013-12-03 19:44:38 -0500] mattray: git log has 2 parts, the status and the body
[2013-12-03 19:44:54 -0500] mattray: the 1 liner or the whole body
[2013-12-03 19:45:11 -0500] mattray: the thor script read the whole body
[2013-12-03 19:45:12 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: oh, it would def be the whole commit message.
[2013-12-03 19:45:32 -0500] mattray: yeah, that's what I would expect. The Thor::SCMVersion didn't default to that strangely
[2013-12-03 19:46:07 -0500] mattray: so patch version auto-increments unless they say #major or #minor in the commit message
[2013-12-03 19:46:20 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: ++
[2013-12-03 19:46:36 -0500] mattray: and can we tag in a review?
[2013-12-03 19:47:15 -0500] mattray: so if I make a commit, tag it and submit for review does it propagate through?
[2013-12-03 19:47:38 -0500] mattray: if so, we can tag everything while we update the metadata.rb and CHANGELOG
[2013-12-03 19:48:45 -0500] mattray: I'll try to submit just a tag for review
[2013-12-03 19:49:19 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: only Zuul can push tags -- and Gerrit admins.
[2013-12-03 19:49:36 -0500] mattray: oh, so we'll have to get them to do the initial tagging for us?
[2013-12-03 19:50:48 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: we don't need to go back and tag everything historically, I think just the latest should be good
[2013-12-03 19:51:00 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: agreed.
[2013-12-03 19:51:23 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: and yes, I think we'll need the initial tag done by them.
[2013-12-03 19:52:15 -0500] spheromak: sorry been on a vendor call..(whee)
[2013-12-03 19:52:26 -0500] mattray: well, if they can turn on the auto-tagger, they can tag based on the current value in metadata.rb and the next commits from us can be the metadata.rb updates
[2013-12-03 19:52:57 -0500] spheromak: mattray: prob with the cmd in metadta is how kitchen/berks handles that stuff
[2013-12-03 19:53:03 -0500] spheromak: knife parses, but not all tools will
[2013-12-03 19:53:24 -0500] mattray: spheromak: ugh, lemme go see what Berkshelf does
[2013-12-03 19:53:30 -0500] spheromak: :)
[2013-12-03 19:54:15 -0500] spheromak: https://github.com/berkshelf/berkshelf/pull/923
[2013-12-03 19:54:17 -0500] spheromak: mattray: ^^
[2013-12-03 19:55:45 -0500] spheromak: also
[2013-12-03 19:55:47 -0500] spheromak: https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/pull/212
[2013-12-03 19:55:53 -0500] mattray: spheromak: so.. Berkshelf 3?
[2013-12-03 19:55:58 -0500] spheromak: to get caught up on the story
[2013-12-03 19:56:47 -0500] spheromak: also foodcritic/librarian etc
[2013-12-03 19:57:09 -0500] spheromak: why i ended up where i did with what i did ^^ yaks!
[2013-12-03 19:58:22 -0500] spheromak: problem is getting fixed
[2013-12-03 19:58:33 -0500] spheromak: tho which is cool, but mostly in the latest of each of these tools
[2013-12-03 19:59:30 -0500] mattray: so Berkshelf looks like it merged last week
[2013-12-03 19:59:36 -0500] mattray: and TK awhile ago
[2013-12-03 20:00:02 -0500] spheromak: 7 days ago
[2013-12-03 20:00:04 -0500] spheromak: ;)
[2013-12-03 20:00:17 -0500] spheromak: for uploading custom files
[2013-12-03 20:00:19 -0500] mattray: well, included in the 1.0.0 release :)
[2013-12-03 20:00:24 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-12-03 20:00:41 -0500] spheromak: jsut saying yer gonna have to specify what versions stuff is gonna work with.
[2013-12-03 20:00:43 -0500] mattray: so the solution I proposed doesn't use a VERSION file, it calls git directly
[2013-12-03 20:00:48 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-12-03 20:00:50 -0500] spheromak: I saw
[2013-12-03 20:01:05 -0500] spheromak: wont be able to vendor a cook
[2013-12-03 20:01:08 -0500] spheromak: with librarian
[2013-12-03 20:01:16 -0500] spheromak: or berks
[2013-12-03 20:01:38 -0500] spheromak: :\
[2013-12-03 20:01:43 -0500] mattray: or if you vendor it, you vendor the metadata.rb
[2013-12-03 20:01:56 -0500] spheromak: which has the ruby int it to read the git branch
[2013-12-03 20:01:58 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: lol, this is turning into a nightmare :(
[2013-12-03 20:01:59 -0500] spheromak: tag
[2013-12-03 20:02:35 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: I know, the hoops we jump through to make things "easy"
[2013-12-03 20:04:10 -0500] spheromak: hey this stuff works for me ! :D
[2013-12-03 20:04:18 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: you following along in -infra?
[2013-12-03 20:04:35 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak: yes, but you also have 2x as many commits, half of them are version commits...
[2013-12-03 20:04:35 -0500] mattray: lemme go catch up
[2013-12-03 20:04:59 -0500] spheromak: jaypipes: thats just cause this process is heavy ;)
[2013-12-03 20:11:20 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: technically we could use straight SHAs for all versions
[2013-12-03 20:11:28 -0500] mattray: and lock everything down in the environment
[2013-12-03 20:11:37 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: berkshelf would break horribly.
[2013-12-03 20:11:57 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: as would everything that uses crap like openstack-compute >~ 7.0
[2013-12-03 20:12:33 -0500] mattray: yeah, adding a veneer of user-friendliness to this is causing more work
[2013-12-03 20:12:39 -0500] jaypipes: indeed.
[2013-12-03 20:12:49 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: sounds like we just need to do this:
[2013-12-03 20:12:55 -0500] jaypipes: 1) remove the changelogs
[2013-12-03 20:13:19 -0500] jaypipes: 2) Manually continue to handle *minor* and *major* version increments, and manually do git tagging ourselves.
[2013-12-03 20:13:52 -0500] jaypipes: 3) If people really want to increment patch number, go for it, but we shouldn't have any of our Berksfiles referring to patch numbering.
[2013-12-03 20:14:12 -0500] spheromak: :\
[2013-12-03 20:14:30 -0500] jaypipes: 4) If a changelog really is needed, for instance on upload to the community site, then generate it with a script and git log.
[2013-12-03 20:14:37 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak: what?
[2013-12-03 20:14:57 -0500] mattray: 4) changelog is completely a github-user-friendly thing. We can drop it
[2013-12-03 20:15:04 -0500] jaypipes: ok.
[2013-12-03 20:16:49 -0500] spheromak: jaypipes: personally I wnat to trust versions/tags on master to not have other commits on them.
[2013-12-03 20:17:19 -0500] mattray: So we just keep doing what we're doing is how I read this, being less worried about patch versions? Start tagging minor and majors?
[2013-12-03 20:17:55 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-12-03 20:18:39 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: yes. and remove changlog
[2013-12-03 20:19:13 -0500] mattray: or maybe keep the Changelog and do roll-ups with #major and #minor commits?
[2013-12-03 20:19:39 -0500] mattray: so you can get a human-readable update explaining differences?
[2013-12-03 20:20:08 -0500] mattray: so less hard-ass on the patches, and #minor and #major need explanations
[2013-12-03 20:20:26 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: up to you.
[2013-12-03 20:21:06 -0500] mattray: I definitely prefer a narrative form of changelogs, I can read diffs but if someone has a write-up why they updated that seems nice
[2013-12-03 20:21:18 -0500] mattray: retr0h: spheromak?
[2013-12-03 20:23:11 -0500] spheromak: i am indifferent to changelog, but i know it's one of those things that people get upset over :)
[2013-12-03 20:23:26 -0500] retr0h: mattray: I been on call, I'm behind - I personally don't really care about changelogs, however, the bsd/debian guys always release such nice changelogs, and i figure they know what they are doing
[2013-12-03 20:27:25 -0500] retr0h: very good question tho ...
[2013-12-03 20:29:43 -0500] retr0h: mattray: and spheromak you guys have far more experience with the chef tooling and how things should be.. what do you guys think?
[2013-12-03 20:41:08 -0500] mattray: I like it as a documentation artifact to just explain big changes
[2013-12-03 20:41:20 -0500] mattray: READMEs get too long
[2013-12-03 20:41:41 -0500] mattray: and git logs are non-linear
[2013-12-03 20:42:12 -0500] mattray: so now what?
[2013-12-03 20:46:30 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: how about branching for grizzly? ;)
