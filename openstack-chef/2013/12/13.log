[2013-12-13 01:48:00 -0500] galstrom: zhiwei: hi
[2013-12-13 01:48:08 -0500] zhiwei: I fount my local workstation and Jenkins have the different test result.
[2013-12-13 01:48:20 -0500] galstrom: well that is no good

[2013-12-13 01:48:54 -0500] zhiwei: can you take a look at this file, I commented it there.
[2013-12-13 01:50:38 -0500] galstrom: sure
[2013-12-13 01:51:00 -0500] zhiwei: I want to know the result on your workstation.
[2013-12-13 01:55:45 -0500] galstrom: ok.. pulling it down..
[2013-12-13 01:59:13 -0500] zhiwei: please use the latest code

[2013-12-13 02:03:17 -0500] galstrom: zhiwei: ok.. had to fix my rvm..
[2013-12-13 02:03:20 -0500] galstrom: re-pulled

[2013-12-13 02:09:28 -0500] galstrom: zhiwei: http://ix.io/9lB
[2013-12-13 02:09:31 -0500] galstrom: i get the same error
[2013-12-13 02:09:55 -0500] zhiwei: but why Jenkins did not get this error?
[2013-12-13 02:12:42 -0500] zhiwei: This will make many troubles for our work.
[2013-12-13 02:15:33 -0500] galstrom: zhiwei: i think this is the problem.. http://ix.io/9lC
[2013-12-13 02:16:36 -0500] galstrom: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/apache2/blob/master/definitions/apache_site.rb#L34-L40
[2013-12-13 02:32:50 -0500] zhiwei: galstrom: Jenkins uses Ubuntu and we use rhel, so this is the problem?
[2013-12-13 02:33:28 -0500] galstrom: zhiwei: dont think so.. i am on a mac
[2013-12-13 02:34:02 -0500] zhiwei: only ubuntu(debian) has sites-enabled dir
[2013-12-13 02:34:03 -0500] galstrom: i think it is because that file might actually exist on the jenkins server
[2013-12-13 02:34:06 -0500] galstrom: right
[2013-12-13 02:35:42 -0500] zhiwei: ok, should solve this issue, because others will encounter it later.
[2013-12-13 02:35:52 -0500] galstrom: yeah
[2013-12-13 02:35:58 -0500] galstrom: i am seeing if i can get it working
[2013-12-13 02:36:16 -0500] zhiwei: ok
[2013-12-13 02:37:02 -0500] zhiwei: and, I still have some question on openstack-block-storage cookbook
[2013-12-13 02:38:18 -0500] zhiwei: the auth_uri uses https protocol before, the rspec testing passed. But when I upgrade the gems and berks, the rspec testing failed.
[2013-12-13 02:38:42 -0500] zhiwei: so, I changed https to http, then rspec success.
[2013-12-13 02:38:50 -0500] zhiwei: can you explain this?
[2013-12-13 02:59:36 -0500] galstrom: yeah.. i am not sure on that one
[2013-12-13 02:59:45 -0500] galstrom: i dont know if that is funkiness in chefspec or not
[2013-12-13 03:03:16 -0500] zhiwei: block-storage repushed, you can review it now: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/61413/

[2013-12-13 03:43:26 -0500] galstrom: zhiwei: i think i fixed that call in openstack-dashboard
[2013-12-13 04:50:19 -0500] zhiwei: galstrom: ok. the review site is too slow, I can't see your changes.
[2013-12-13 04:50:51 -0500] galstrom: zhiwei: no worries.. i found another issue.. for apache_site "openstack-dashboard"
[2013-12-13 04:51:00 -0500] galstrom: ill get it fixed in the morning .. and submit a patch
[2013-12-13 04:51:53 -0500] zhiwei: I saw your comment
[2013-12-13 04:52:24 -0500] zhiwei: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/61622/8/spec/server_spec.rb
[2013-12-13 04:52:41 -0500] zhiwei: but, if set to to, will cause error.

[2013-12-13 13:24:32 -0500] zhiwei: iartarisi: hi, I found one weird thing, there are some differences between my workstation and Jenkins server. Do you know how to check our diff?
[2013-12-13 13:25:20 -0500] zhiwei: the test cases run success on my workstation, but failed on Jenkins server. Like this commit: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/61659/
[2013-12-13 13:29:36 -0500] iartarisi: zhiwei: well it's foodcritic it seems sso just make sure you're using the same version as jenkins?
[2013-12-13 13:30:06 -0500] zhiwei: I don't which version Jenkins used.
[2013-12-13 13:30:23 -0500] iartarisi: 3.0.3
[2013-12-13 13:30:37 -0500] iartarisi: http://logs.openstack.org/59/61659/2/check/gate-cookbook-openstack-object-storage-chef-lint/abdb43f/console.html
[2013-12-13 13:31:39 -0500] zhiwei: I think this error means the cookbook provider did not notify when updated.
[2013-12-13 13:31:51 -0500] zhiwei: maybe add a notify clause
[2013-12-13 13:35:18 -0500] zhiwei: I added this: new_resource.updated_by_last_action(update)
