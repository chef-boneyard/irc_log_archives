[2013-12-19 20:23:27 -0500] mattray: kbringard: are you guys using the build_openvswitch_source recipe?
[2013-12-19 20:23:40 -0500] kbringard: yes
[2013-12-19 20:24:58 -0500] mattray: just digging into getting a single box working with OVS, since Neutron doesn't work with Vagrant
[2013-12-19 20:25:23 -0500] mattray: I want to do it with OVS, I assume I need to use that recipe?
[2013-12-19 20:26:56 -0500] mattray: trying to sort which attributes to turn on too
[2013-12-19 20:27:41 -0500] mattray: kbringard: also, why a git SHA instead of one of the tagged releases?
[2013-12-19 20:28:46 -0500] kbringard: uhm, I'd have to go back and look, but I recall it being because the SHAs are how their gitweb thing manages tags
[2013-12-19 20:28:59 -0500] kbringard: you don't have to use it, only if you want to install a version of OVS other than what comes in your distro
[2013-12-19 20:29:23 -0500] kbringard: by default it just does apt-get (or rpn or whatever)
[2013-12-19 20:29:27 -0500] mattray: I assumed it was broken/suboptimal?
[2013-12-19 20:29:42 -0500] mattray: Ubuntu 12.04
[2013-12-19 20:29:48 -0500] kbringard: it's just an old version Ubuntu 12.04 has version 1.4.x, 2.0 is the latest released version
[2013-12-19 20:30:08 -0500] kbringard: but, if you just want to test how it works, you don't need to build from source
