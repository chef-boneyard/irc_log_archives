[2013-12-04 15:32:00 -0500] paulczar: it's caused by the order in which you installed the plugins   check the README I think it tells you the order you need
[2013-12-04 15:32:20 -0500] paulczar: you may need to completely nuke your vagrant install ( including ~/.vagrant )

[2013-12-04 16:23:57 -0500] paulczar: hooray you did a thing!

[2013-12-04 21:32:30 -0500] markvan_: Is it time to get out meeting on the openstack cal?  https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings
[2013-12-04 21:32:30 -0500] markvan_: I've alreadyd been asked a few times where to find our meeting info...
[2013-12-04 21:51:08 -0500] mattray: markvan_: I think the problem with that is we're not using #openstack-meeting
[2013-12-04 21:52:02 -0500] mattray: but we don't conflict with any of the other meeting times
[2013-12-04 21:52:15 -0500] mattray: markvan_: if you want to add it that's fine with me
[2013-12-04 21:53:19 -0500] markvan_: k, I'll take a look, maybe just a reminder that we are having meetings now.
[2013-12-04 21:54:57 -0500] luisg: hey guys a noob type of Q, i have an openstackblock-storage machine running, I only setup identity, image and storage, so the openrc file was not created, so what are the defautl credentials for the ks admin?
[2013-12-04 21:55:13 -0500] luisg: where can i get them?
[2013-12-04 22:05:31 -0500] luisg: mattray, do u know? ^
[2013-12-04 22:05:44 -0500] mattray: admin/secrete?
[2013-12-04 22:06:51 -0500] luisg: hm k thx, i'll try that, also the same run did not work for me on centos64, im getting errors creating the keystone resources..
[2013-12-04 22:07:11 -0500] luisg: "ERROR: Unable to create tenant 'admin'"
[2013-12-04 22:07:12 -0500] mattray: luisg: mileage may vary with centos
[2013-12-04 22:07:20 -0500] luisg: must be missing something obvious..ah
[2013-12-04 22:07:29 -0500] mattray: luisg: do you have developer = true in your setup?
[2013-12-04 22:07:35 -0500] luisg: yeah
[2013-12-04 22:07:38 -0500] luisg: shoud I not?
[2013-12-04 22:07:43 -0500] mattray: you should
[2013-12-04 22:07:57 -0500] luisg: db_sync, and bootstreap_keystone_admin ran just fine
[2013-12-04 22:08:03 -0500] luisg: then it went south
[2013-12-04 22:08:12 -0500] luisg: i'll keep digging.. thx!
[2013-12-04 22:08:25 -0500] mattray: weird, if one works the others should. That service could have CentOS issues, we're still progressing on them
[2013-12-04 22:08:34 -0500] mattray: ubuntu is the happy path currently
[2013-12-04 22:09:35 -0500] markvan_: FYI  Meeting page updated  https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings

[2013-12-04 22:10:32 -0500] mattray: gotta run folks, back online later
[2013-12-04 23:12:26 -0500] paulczar: yeah you should assume that centos won't work until somebody fixes it
[2013-12-04 23:12:49 -0500] paulczar: We should actually switch from centos to fedora19 or something in the vagrants
