[2013-12-12 02:38:32 -0500] zhiwei: DavidGeng: the version number is located in Berksfile.lock, should update this file.
[2013-12-12 02:39:57 -0500] zhiwei: DavidGeng: did you test the spec file on your workstation before commit?
[2013-12-12 02:41:29 -0500] DavidGeng: yes, the openstack-common is already be changed to 0.4.6
[2013-12-12 02:41:51 -0500] DavidGeng: but the metering is missing from the Berksfile.lock
[2013-12-12 02:42:42 -0500] zhiwei: I saw your errors, maybe your commit should push after the all of the havana cookbooks ready.

[2013-12-12 05:30:51 -0500] zhiwei: galstrom_zzz: hi
[2013-12-12 05:45:12 -0500] galstrom: zhiwei: hi
[2013-12-12 05:47:14 -0500] zhiwei: galstrom: want to ask a question
[2013-12-12 05:47:20 -0500] galstrom: shoot
[2013-12-12 05:49:24 -0500] zhiwei: http://logs.openstack.org/22/61622/2/check/gate-cookbook-openstack-dashboard-chef-unit/05fe2f8/console.html
[2013-12-12 05:49:35 -0500] zhiwei: I can't solve this stub_command error.
[2013-12-12 05:49:52 -0500] galstrom: hm..
[2013-12-12 05:50:27 -0500] zhiwei: could you take a look?
[2013-12-12 05:50:51 -0500] zhiwei: I added this stub_command to the it clause, but still errors.
[2013-12-12 05:51:27 -0500] galstrom: hm..
[2013-12-12 05:51:37 -0500] galstrom: and it is erroring with the same error
[2013-12-12 05:51:40 -0500] galstrom: about the stub command
[2013-12-12 05:51:48 -0500] zhiwei: yes
[2013-12-12 05:51:58 -0500] zhiwei: http://rubydoc.info/github/sethvargo/chefspec#Stubbing
[2013-12-12 05:52:08 -0500] galstrom: so you put stub_command("[ ! -e /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf ] && [ -e /etc/redhat-release ] && [ $(/sbin/sestatus | grep -c '^Current mode:.*enforcing') -eq 1 ]").and_return(true) in the block
[2013-12-12 05:52:12 -0500] galstrom: and it still fails
[2013-12-12 05:52:14 -0500] zhiwei: yes
[2013-12-12 05:52:16 -0500] galstrom: with the same error
[2013-12-12 05:52:27 -0500] galstrom: i wonder if you need to stub each command seperately
[2013-12-12 05:52:46 -0500] galstrom: stub_command("[ ! -e /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf ]").and_return(true)
[2013-12-12 05:53:01 -0500] zhiwei: let me try again
[2013-12-12 05:53:02 -0500] galstrom: stub_command("[ -e /etc/redhat-release ]").and_return(true)
[2013-12-12 05:53:07 -0500] galstrom: etc
[2013-12-12 05:53:12 -0500] galstrom: if that does not work..
[2013-12-12 05:53:25 -0500] galstrom: push up a review with what you have tonight.. mark it as a Work in progress
[2013-12-12 05:53:37 -0500] galstrom: and ill pull it and see if i can get it working in the morning
[2013-12-12 05:54:40 -0500] zhiwei: ok, thanks.
[2013-12-12 05:54:48 -0500] galstrom: zhiwei: np..
[2013-12-12 05:54:56 -0500] galstrom: zhiwei: have a good night.. hope you get it working
[2013-12-12 05:55:23 -0500] zhiwei: I am in China, it's afternoon in my time. :)

[2013-12-12 11:19:24 -0500] zhiwei: iartarisi: hi, are you here?
[2013-12-12 11:20:44 -0500] iartarisi: zhiwei: hey, yes
[2013-12-12 11:21:20 -0500] zhiwei: when I upgrade gems, I encountered a weird error. And can't find a solution: http://logs.openstack.org/22/61622/3/check/gate-cookbook-openstack-dashboard-chef-unit/02b0466/console.html
[2013-12-12 11:21:31 -0500] zhiwei: can you help me fix this errer?
[2013-12-12 11:23:55 -0500] iartarisi: zhiwei: I think you need to move the contents of the "stubs all commands" block into dashboard_stubs
[2013-12-12 11:24:23 -0500] iartarisi: it should get executed for all tests, the way it is now it gets executed independent of the tests
[2013-12-12 11:24:47 -0500] zhiwei: I tested, but still can't work. let me do that again.
[2013-12-12 11:25:18 -0500] iartarisi: but -e /etc/redhat-release should return true only on redhat, so it should be in the before block of server-redhat_spec
[2013-12-12 11:25:43 -0500] iartarisi: it's a bit complicated I guess :)
[2013-12-12 11:26:46 -0500] zhiwei: I follow the document instruction to update bothe server-fedora_spec.rb and server-redhat_spec.rb, but still can't solve the errors.
[2013-12-12 11:30:02 -0500] iartarisi: give me a moment, I'll try it here
[2013-12-12 11:30:12 -0500] zhiwei: ok
[2013-12-12 11:41:19 -0500] iartarisi: zhiwei: seems fine here, put these in spec_helper, and then use either one or the other in the before block of the other spec files: http://paste.openstack.org/show/54880/
