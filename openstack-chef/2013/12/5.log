[2013-12-05 21:43:18 -0500] paulczar: anyone know how to tell rubocop to skip a check ?
[2013-12-05 21:46:45 -0500] mattray: paulczar: all I see is -l and -R
[2013-12-05 21:47:47 -0500] mattray: paulczar: https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop#disabling-cops-within-source-code there's that
[2013-12-05 21:48:29 -0500] mattray: it would be nice if it listed the rules like foodcritic
[2013-12-05 21:49:04 -0500] paulczar: yeah, I was hoping to not have to annotate my source just to make rubocop shut up about stuff like 'line is too long'
[2013-12-05 21:49:11 -0500] mattray: and you could go look them up, like FC003
[2013-12-05 21:49:54 -0500] mattray: paulczar: well, we could stick with just the lint checks
[2013-12-05 21:50:47 -0500] paulczar: yeah, except I like a lot of the checks it does  such as newlines,   ' vs " etc
[2013-12-05 21:54:10 -0500] mattray: yeah, I think we clean up as much as we can, but maybe only gate on "-l"?
[2013-12-05 21:54:14 -0500] mattray: (eventually)
[2013-12-05 21:55:00 -0500] paulczar: ahhh found it
