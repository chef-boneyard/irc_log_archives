[2013-12-18 21:11:34 -0500] mattray: It's kinda sad the Havana install guide still sends you to nova-networking
[2013-12-18 21:12:18 -0500] mattray: I'm trying to get OVS support working and documented before publicizing the Havana work
[2013-12-18 21:12:41 -0500] mattray: not that you guys don't already know about it, but the profile on this is still not high

[2013-12-18 23:27:41 -0500] alop: hey, we're not version bumping master right now, right?
[2013-12-18 23:28:03 -0500] alop: mattray: ^
[2013-12-18 23:28:21 -0500] mattray: alop: not yet
[2013-12-18 23:28:36 -0500] mattray: I'm fighting with OVS, maybe once that works?
[2013-12-18 23:29:03 -0500] mattray: Once the Vagrant build works is what I'm thinking
[2013-12-18 23:38:20 -0500] alanmeadows: mattray: to be sure, we are bumping it in grizzly/stable?
[2013-12-18 23:38:41 -0500] alanmeadows: stable/grizzly, if my fingers worked
[2013-12-18 23:39:04 -0500] mattray: alanmeadows: yeah, that seems reasonable
[2013-12-18 23:39:20 -0500] mattray: fewer changes probably going in there, bumping is more reasonable
[2013-12-18 23:39:46 -0500] alanmeadows: yeah I think that makes sense

[2013-12-18 23:41:29 -0500] alop: ok, I guess I don't know how to cherry pick this to stable/grizzly :)

[2013-12-18 23:43:09 -0500] alop: that's the Bowie movie?
[2013-12-18 23:43:38 -0500] alanmeadows: You can tell from the hair.
[2013-12-18 23:43:48 -0500] alop: and the sphere
