[2013-12-23 16:01:42 -0500] carlp: I'm on a conference call with a customer, but I'll monitor chat
[2013-12-23 16:04:20 -0500] mattray: nobody's on, which makes me assume either I screwed it up again or everyone is on vacation
[2013-12-23 16:05:25 -0500] mattray: not a whole lot to talk about, the version patches are all in, lots of stuff is going onto master
[2013-12-23 16:05:31 -0500] mattray: I'm pushing in the rubocop stuff slowly
[2013-12-23 16:05:54 -0500] mattray: vagrant is still broken for OVS, I'm going to push that to a WIP review branch if anyone wants to take a crack at it
[2013-12-23 16:06:21 -0500] carlp: I've been fighting with OVS for the past week, I may be able to put some love into that
[2013-12-23 16:07:44 -0500] salmanbaset: is the hangout working (or is it already full?)
[2013-12-23 16:07:56 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: that link not work?
[2013-12-23 16:08:22 -0500] mattray: carlp: I've been trying to find the right mix of attributes in an environment to make it work
[2013-12-23 16:08:38 -0500] carlp: Yeah, OVS is annoying. I may be able to crack it
[2013-12-23 16:08:46 -0500] carlp: Using Havana correct?
[2013-12-23 16:08:49 -0500] mattray: yes
[2013-12-23 16:09:02 -0500] mattray: it finally started up all the neutron services, then the networks weren't there
[2013-12-23 16:09:08 -0500] mattray: but that feels close
[2013-12-23 16:09:20 -0500] carlp: very close!
[2013-12-23 16:09:26 -0500] salmanbaset: mattray: does not seem to start.
[2013-12-23 16:09:35 -0500] carlp: are you using the OVS plugin or the ML2 driver with the OVS provider?
[2013-12-23 16:10:08 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/hoaevent/AP36tYdXuzIKH8GrBkey0t4cGhit2NCuniMkX_WaqszC_xLg5-JqrQ

[2013-12-23 16:10:22 -0500] mattray: posted the youtube link, supposed to be the hangout link
[2013-12-23 16:12:57 -0500] mattray: carlp: default["openstack"]["network"]["core_plugin"] = "neutron.plugins.openvswitch.ovs_neutron_plugin.OVSNeutronPluginV2"
[2013-12-23 16:13:01 -0500] mattray: that one
[2013-12-23 16:13:56 -0500] carlp: OK, it may be easier to get the ML2 driver working but I'll try the OVS driver first
