[2013-11-13 16:32:48 -0500] galstrom: retr0h: ping
[2013-11-13 18:27:37 -0500] wabat: good morning ctracy
[2013-11-13 18:57:27 -0500] retr0h: galstrom: yo
[2013-11-13 19:02:08 -0500] ctracey: what about retr0h?
[2013-11-13 19:02:32 -0500] ctracey: ;)
[2013-11-13 19:04:11 -0500] galstrom: retr0h: so are we going with bugs increment the last version number.. and features increment the middle version number>
[2013-11-13 19:04:25 -0500] galstrom: 7.0.1 -> 7.0.2 is a but
[2013-11-13 19:04:33 -0500] galstrom: 7.0.1 -> 7.1.0 is a feature
[2013-11-13 19:04:52 -0500] galstrom: just want to make sure i have it right for consistency in reviews
[2013-11-13 19:04:53 -0500] galstrom: :)
[2013-11-13 19:05:53 -0500] alanmeadows: I already baked retr0h enough cookies
[2013-11-13 19:13:38 -0500] retr0h: galstrom: it would be nice if we did that
[2013-11-13 19:14:03 -0500] retr0h: I honestly don't know how much it really matters with cookbooks
[2013-11-13 19:14:34 -0500] retr0h: but in general Major.Minor.Bug (and we concider Major, a bump from grizzly to havana)
[2013-11-13 19:15:19 -0500] retr0h: alanmeadows: yes u have :)
[2013-11-13 19:15:30 -0500] ctracey: another thread that retr0h and i were just talking about...we should get these cookbooks listed on the community site.
[2013-11-13 19:16:22 -0500] ctracey: mattray is likely busy atm, but perhaps we can replace the entries that are there now. right now swift is just a placeholder cookbook.
[2013-11-13 19:16:54 -0500] retr0h: yeah... would be good to get everyone looking here
[2013-11-13 19:18:46 -0500] ctracey: this cam about bc I was talking to someone looking to roll out swift cookbooks and they werent sure who had them
[2013-11-13 19:19:35 -0500] ctracey: naming these generically (ie. object-storage) is the right thing to do, but can confuse newcomers....i think the community site could help here.
[2013-11-13 19:23:40 -0500] alanmeadows: Swift is a tough one, newcomers coming looking for "OpenStack block storage" or "OpenStack network" cookbooks so those work out fine but even a newcomer would probably end up knowing they're looking for "swift" and be searching for that and most likely find someone elses before ours
[2013-11-13 19:24:20 -0500] alanmeadows: Also it can be deployed in isolation, so people don't end up looking for and end up finding the whole suite that stackforge has to offer
[2013-11-13 19:34:51 -0500] galstrom: alanmeadows: reviewed
[2013-11-13 19:35:15 -0500] galstrom: any chance I could get a core to review https://review.openstack.org/#/c/55354/
