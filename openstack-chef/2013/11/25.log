[2013-11-25 16:03:03 -0500] mattray: simonmcc: not that I'm aware of how to get to
[2013-11-25 16:03:22 -0500] iartarisi: it seems it's already full

[2013-11-25 16:22:17 -0500] mattray: the general consensus is to get the qpid patches in ASAP and branch Wednesday
[2013-11-25 16:22:34 -0500] mattray: and hold off for 2 weeks (or more) before branching for Icehouse too
[2013-11-25 16:23:20 -0500] iartarisi: should we talk about a backporting policy after branching? or do we just develop on two separate branches?
[2013-11-25 16:26:14 -0500] judd7: a strainer config?
[2013-11-25 16:34:55 -0500] iartarisi: sounds good to me

[2013-11-25 17:05:55 -0500] salmanbaset: so
[2013-11-25 17:06:20 -0500] salmanbaset: the testing mechanism is to try both rabbit and qpid paths, based on a flag, right?
[2013-11-25 17:07:07 -0500] iartarisi: right
[2013-11-25 17:08:26 -0500] iartarisi: salmanbaset: I think you can do something similar to: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute/blob/master/spec/nova-common_spec.rb#L124
[2013-11-25 17:09:10 -0500] salmanbaset: ok, adding it now
