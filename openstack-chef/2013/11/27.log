[2013-11-27 00:10:28 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: updated the metadata :)
[2013-11-27 00:27:59 -0500] salmanbaset: jaypipes: for your two comments:
[2013-11-27 00:28:46 -0500] salmanbaset: using node["openstack"]["mq"]["service_type"] is breaking the test
[2013-11-27 00:29:38 -0500] salmanbaset: default["openstack"]["compute"]["mq"]["qpid"]["hosts"]  is used similar to rabbit host and rabbit_hosts (with clustering)
[2013-11-27 00:29:48 -0500] salmanbaset: so there is no different pattern
[2013-11-27 00:53:21 -0500] openstackgerrit: Salman Baset proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Adding qpid support to nova  https://review.openstack.org/56797

[2013-11-27 02:56:41 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: sorry to ding that review again
[2013-11-27 02:56:57 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: I'll come back and +2 it again shortly
[2013-11-27 02:57:03 -0500] mattray: with that change
[2013-11-27 02:57:17 -0500] mattray: at least the tests are working again :)
[2013-11-27 03:05:49 -0500] salmanbaset: ok
[2013-11-27 03:05:50 -0500] salmanbaset: let me add
[2013-11-27 03:06:40 -0500] spheromak: ack forgot to hit review ages ago on your patch mattray
[2013-11-27 03:08:32 -0500] salmanbaset: matt, the mq attribute was discussed with Jay and Justin
[2013-11-27 03:08:48 -0500] salmanbaset: ultimately, we need to move rabbit and qpid attributes under mq
[2013-11-27 03:08:54 -0500] salmanbaset: for now, i only did mq
[2013-11-27 03:09:11 -0500] salmanbaset: moving mq under rabbit should be a separate patch
[2013-11-27 03:21:50 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: ok, we'll sort it out later
[2013-11-27 04:38:30 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: you see my comment on this? https://review.openstack.org/#/c/56509/

[2013-11-27 15:12:06 -0500] salmanbaset: hello guys, i pushed a final version of qpid patch with all the test cases, readme updates and change logs
[2013-11-27 15:12:10 -0500] salmanbaset: please take a quick look
[2013-11-27 15:12:30 -0500] salmanbaset: if looks reasonable, i will start updating othres
[2013-11-27 15:49:43 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: you think anyone on your team would be able to work on the ThorSCM thing to remove the need for Changelog and metadata.rb version changes?
[2013-11-27 15:50:02 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: also, does David Geng hang out on IRC? if so, his nickname?
[2013-11-27 15:51:52 -0500] salmanbaset: jaypipes: let me check.
[2013-11-27 15:52:20 -0500] salmanbaset: David Geng is based in China
[2013-11-27 15:52:31 -0500] salmanbaset: so he is not online now :)
[2013-11-27 15:54:11 -0500] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Adding qpid support to nova  https://review.openstack.org/56797
[2013-11-27 16:10:56 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: mornin sunshine :)
[2013-11-27 16:11:03 -0500] mattray: howdy
[2013-11-27 16:11:07 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: trying to hammer through reviews today so we can branch
[2013-11-27 16:11:13 -0500] mattray: yeah, me too
[2013-11-27 16:11:18 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: you around?
[2013-11-27 16:11:20 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: need to get the thorscm thing done, though.
[2013-11-27 16:11:21 -0500] salmanbaset: yes
[2013-11-27 16:11:31 -0500] salmanbaset: am finishing the other qpid patches
[2013-11-27 16:11:34 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: the nova qpid stuff went in, how go the other patches?
[2013-11-27 16:11:35 -0500] mattray: thanks
[2013-11-27 16:11:37 -0500] salmanbaset: hopefully done in the next 3 hours
[2013-11-27 16:11:40 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: I would love to have the thorscm thing done before branching.
[2013-11-27 16:11:55 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: I tried to get spheromak to do it, I think he ignored me :)
[2013-11-27 16:12:10 -0500] mattray: since I think KT uses it
[2013-11-27 16:12:23 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: do you know how to push a commit to someone else's branch in gerrit?
[2013-11-27 16:12:47 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: if David is out, might be useful for you to do that -- reviews like this one: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/58658/
[2013-11-27 16:12:54 -0500] salmanbaset: ok
[2013-11-27 16:12:57 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: do the following:
[2013-11-27 16:13:00 -0500] jaypipes: git review -d XXXXX
[2013-11-27 16:13:07 -0500] jaypipes: where XXXX is the Gerrit patch number.
[2013-11-27 16:13:11 -0500] salmanbaset: ok
[2013-11-27 16:13:15 -0500] jaypipes: in this case, 58658
[2013-11-27 16:13:38 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: make changes (in this case, just correct new metadata.rb version and changelog entry), then do git commit -a --amend && git review
[2013-11-27 16:13:47 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: and that will push an update to that patchsety.
[2013-11-27 16:13:54 -0500] salmanbaset: ok, doing that now
[2013-11-27 16:14:03 -0500] jaypipes: cheers.
[2013-11-27 16:14:10 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: doing reviews on the other cookbooks now...
[2013-11-27 16:14:32 -0500] salmanbaset: I have not updated them yet for qpid :)
[2013-11-27 16:16:37 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: KT's cookbooks are auto-incrementing their version https://github.com/cloudware-cookbooks/ktc-compute/commits/master/metadata.rb
[2013-11-27 16:17:16 -0500] mattray: I just don't know how you wire that up
[2013-11-27 16:18:42 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: just noticed KT's Oppan Github Style logo... LOL.
[2013-11-27 16:20:12 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: yeah, not sure how the auto_version works. it definitely isn't driven from something in the commit message... see https://github.com/cloudware-cookbooks/ktc-compute/pull/69.
[2013-11-27 16:20:24 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: the entire commit message is just "cleanup" :(
[2013-11-27 16:20:38 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: but the commit right after that is an auto_version bump.
[2013-11-27 16:20:48 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: so prolly it is a GitHub post-commit autohook.
[2013-11-27 16:21:55 -0500] mattray: hmm maybe it bumps the patch if no message is given?
[2013-11-27 16:22:15 -0500] mattray: which would be reasonable
[2013-11-27 16:22:32 -0500] mattray: ie. #major, #minor or #patch or nothing
[2013-11-27 16:36:05 -0500] alop: jaypipes: makes sense, as they're Korean
[2013-11-27 16:39:07 -0500] jaypipes: alop: yeah, I just think it's awesome :)
[2013-11-27 16:39:19 -0500] alop: Korea? Yeah
[2013-11-27 16:39:32 -0500] alop: good food
[2013-11-27 16:46:03 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: mind doing that version/changlog fix for this one too, please? https://review.openstack.org/#/c/58485/
[2013-11-27 16:46:53 -0500] salmanbaset: having some rebasing issues with https://review.openstack.org/#/c/58658/ since my patch was merged :)
[2013-11-27 16:48:51 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: reviewed https://review.openstack.org/#/c/56494/ ... couple minor fixups to make.
[2013-11-27 16:49:13 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: you want me to do the rebasing?
[2013-11-27 16:49:26 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: just let me know
[2013-11-27 16:50:29 -0500] salmanbaset: that will be helpful, since I also got other qpid patches to merge :)
[2013-11-27 16:50:39 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: no prob, i will do that now.
[2013-11-27 16:50:48 -0500] salmanbaset: if you can do that, then i can tidy all the qpid patches now.
[2013-11-27 16:50:49 -0500] salmanbaset: thanks
[2013-11-27 16:50:56 -0500] jaypipes: not a problem.
[2013-11-27 16:51:01 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: I'm messing with the thor::scm-version stuff, I assume we can put it in as a post-review step with Gerrit?
[2013-11-27 16:51:30 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: yeah, would need to go in the Zuul post-merge pipeline... one sec, grabbing link.
[2013-11-27 16:51:37 -0500] mattray: so Jenkins goes to merge, reads the commit message and appends a metadata.rb update
[2013-11-27 16:53:29 -0500] openstackgerrit: Jay Pipes proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Add new attributes for common rpc configuration  https://review.openstack.org/58658
[2013-11-27 16:54:00 -0500] jaypipes: mattray, salmanbaset: ^^ double check pls... it's just a rebase of David's rpc attrs patch with updated version and changelog.
[2013-11-27 16:54:05 -0500] mattray: hitting it
[2013-11-27 16:54:32 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: well, no, jenkins would merge the main commit and create a separate commit that simply bumped the version and changelog...
[2013-11-27 16:55:11 -0500] jaypipes: ok, rpc patch off to the gate.
[2013-11-27 16:55:18 -0500] salmanbaset: looks good
[2013-11-27 16:57:04 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: steps for your future reference: http://paste.openstack.org/show/54086/
[2013-11-27 16:57:18 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: doing the heat/cloudformation identity cookbook rebase now...
[2013-11-27 16:57:32 -0500] salmanbaset: thanks
[2013-11-27 16:59:00 -0500] openstackgerrit: Jay Pipes proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity: Add 2 service types to support heat  https://review.openstack.org/58485
[2013-11-27 16:59:41 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset, mattray: ready for your review: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/58485/
[2013-11-27 17:00:04 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: oh.. "vv" is my alias for gvim... sorry if that was confusing!
[2013-11-27 17:00:29 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: and done
[2013-11-27 17:00:33 -0500] jaypipes: sweet.
[2013-11-27 17:00:56 -0500] jaypipes: who knows we might *actually* get all these reviews done today :)
[2013-11-27 17:01:44 -0500] jaypipes: paulczar: any news on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/55733/ ?
[2013-11-27 17:01:45 -0500] salmanbaset: done
[2013-11-27 17:03:40 -0500] paulczar: yeah I just need to rebase it and then reapply my changes   I'm not sure how the tests ended up the way they are
[2013-11-27 17:04:08 -0500] paulczar: I'll do it have the holiday
[2013-11-27 17:04:11 -0500] jaypipes: cool, let us know if you have issues or questions, paulczar
[2013-11-27 17:04:15 -0500] paulczar: have=over
[2013-11-27 17:04:29 -0500] jaypipes: k
[2013-11-27 17:04:49 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: re: this file's changes: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/56795/5/attributes/default.rb
[2013-11-27 17:05:09 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: I am concerned about the changes to the XXX_packages distro-specific stuff.
[2013-11-27 17:05:44 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: the RHEL/Centos/Fedora packages had been verified for stable/grizzly by galstrom_zzz and ionut, IIRC.
[2013-11-27 17:05:56 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: are you sure those changes are for stable/grizzly packaging?
[2013-11-27 17:06:14 -0500] salmanbaset: looking
[2013-11-27 17:07:03 -0500] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Add new attributes for common rpc configuration  https://review.openstack.org/58658

[2013-11-27 17:08:20 -0500] salmanbaset: jaypipes: yes
[2013-11-27 17:08:29 -0500] salmanbaset: these are grizzly stable
[2013-11-27 17:09:13 -0500] salmanbaset: one second
[2013-11-27 17:09:29 -0500] salmanbaset: there may be one issue
[2013-11-27 17:10:40 -0500] salmanbaset: checking at RDO: http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/openstack/openstack-grizzly/fedora-18/
[2013-11-27 17:11:18 -0500] salmanbaset: the package names are correct
[2013-11-27 17:11:45 -0500] salmanbaset: I proposed ""openstack-quantum-openvswitch", existing is ""openstack-quantum-openvswitch-agent"
[2013-11-27 17:12:03 -0500] salmanbaset: RDO repo does not have a ""openstack-quantum-openvswitch-agent" package
[2013-11-27 17:13:06 -0500] alop: qpid... 2nd coolest name for a message queue...
[2013-11-27 17:13:19 -0500] salmanbaset: hehe
[2013-11-27 17:13:38 -0500] alop: Just based on names, I like ZeroMQ the best... having never used either :)
[2013-11-27 17:13:50 -0500] mattray: I'm gonna make a new one called queueRZ
[2013-11-27 17:14:29 -0500] alop: is that pronounced like "quires"?
[2013-11-27 17:14:38 -0500] mattray: queue-ray-zee
[2013-11-27 17:15:02 -0500] mattray: meh, I tried to hard :)
[2013-11-27 17:15:23 -0500] alop: "mattray" sounds like the name of some weapon a comic villain would use
[2013-11-27 17:16:12 -0500] alop: he's going through his armaments, Death Ray? Nah, Shrink Ray? Nah, Heat Ray, nope... Matt Ray
[2013-11-27 17:16:32 -0500] mattray: least effective weapon
[2013-11-27 17:17:05 -0500] alop: "jaypipes" sounds like the handle of some Super Mario Bros enthusiast, like those guys who can beat the game is 58sec or something
[2013-11-27 17:17:09 -0500] paulczar: weapon of mass automation
[2013-11-27 17:17:25 -0500] jaypipes: lol
[2013-11-27 17:18:31 -0500] alop: paulczar... Tzar of?
[2013-11-27 17:19:05 -0500] paulczar: King of the Pauls
[2013-11-27 17:19:15 -0500] paulczar: worse kingdom ever :(
[2013-11-27 17:28:45 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: so thor::scmversion works off of tags
[2013-11-27 17:28:51 -0500] mattray: which we haven't used, but could
[2013-11-27 17:29:01 -0500] mattray: heck, probably should
[2013-11-27 17:30:51 -0500] alop: mattray: would help keep development and released versions apart
[2013-11-27 17:31:04 -0500] mattray: alop: not a real distinction
[2013-11-27 17:31:14 -0500] mattray: alop: what you put in your Berksfile controls that
[2013-11-27 17:31:28 -0500] alop: yeah, you're right, I'm thinking of a world without that
[2013-11-27 17:31:35 -0500] mattray: everything on StackForge is considered "released"
[2013-11-27 17:31:38 -0500] alop: yeah, you're just accidentally using whatever is ther
[2013-11-27 17:31:47 -0500] mattray: just pick and choose by tagged versions
[2013-11-27 17:32:51 -0500] mattray: so in the post-review hook, we look at the commit message for proper version bump, pipe that to thor::scm-version and then paste the new version into the metadata.rb. We could grab the first line of the commit for the CHANGELOG.md too
[2013-11-27 17:33:09 -0500] mattray: I thought this was automated, but I don't see it
[2013-11-27 17:33:56 -0500] salmanbaset: mattray: I think the tests for other cookbooks are also broken
[2013-11-27 17:34:06 -0500] salmanbaset: am testing qpid for network now
[2013-11-27 17:34:17 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: seems likely, include that same fix
[2013-11-27 17:35:05 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: so it does write out a VERSION file, we can include that in the metadata.rb
[2013-11-27 17:35:17 -0500] salmanbaset: yup, doing that
[2013-11-27 17:42:05 -0500] jaypipes: mattray: cool...
[2013-11-27 17:42:42 -0500] mattray: or just sed it in
[2013-11-27 17:43:46 -0500] alop: %VERSION%
[2013-11-27 17:44:05 -0500] mattray: sed "s/^version.*/version '`bundle exec thor version:current`'/" metadata.rb
[2013-11-27 17:44:15 -0500] alop: man, I remember this just being simple when I worked in a SVN shop
[2013-11-27 17:44:22 -0500] mattray: yeah
[2013-11-27 17:44:45 -0500] alop: "Oh, you want the last commit message automatically added to changelog?? Done!"
[2013-11-27 17:45:26 -0500] alop: it even made a little "I Dream of jeannie" sound when you asked it
[2013-11-27 17:45:27 -0500] mattray: I know others have already done this, I just don't know how
[2013-11-27 17:45:33 -0500] spheromak: mattray: i got some codes for that
[2013-11-27 17:45:43 -0500] mattray: spheromak: good morning :)
[2013-11-27 17:45:49 -0500] spheromak: https://gist.github.com/spheromak/7236020
[2013-11-27 17:46:17 -0500] spheromak: prob want to nuke line 43
[2013-11-27 17:46:18 -0500] mattray: fancy
[2013-11-27 17:46:53 -0500] mattray: spheromak: we want to add a post-merge hook to jenkins to bump the metadata.rb on cookbooks automatically
[2013-11-27 17:47:01 -0500] spheromak: yes
[2013-11-27 17:47:04 -0500] spheromak: thats what i do
[2013-11-27 17:47:16 -0500] spheromak: well this is actually changing and pushing
[2013-11-27 17:47:19 -0500] spheromak: post-build
[2013-11-27 17:47:24 -0500] spheromak: on master branch
[2013-11-27 17:47:48 -0500] spheromak: I don't use the VERSION file cause of incompatabilities
[2013-11-27 17:47:59 -0500] spheromak: between berks chef and kitchen ;)
[2013-11-27 17:48:15 -0500] spheromak: i.e. they don't all process metadata.rb and slrup in the VERSIONFILE
[2013-11-27 17:48:18 -0500] mattray: yeah, I didn't want to use the file either
[2013-11-27 17:48:19 -0500] spheromak: so had to do it like this.
[2013-11-27 17:48:22 -0500] alop: spheromak: your avatar, is that a picture of a cold fusion reactor? play on tokamak?
[2013-11-27 17:49:05 -0500] spheromak: alop: it's a plasma sphere
[2013-11-27 17:49:32 -0500] spheromak: well torus
[2013-11-27 17:49:47 -0500] spheromak: plasma doughnut would be the better way to say it i guess :)
[2013-11-27 17:49:48 -0500] alop: I assumed the -mak suffix
[2013-11-27 17:49:52 -0500] alop: torus is right :)
[2013-11-27 17:49:52 -0500] mattray: spheromak: that looks pretty good. Don't think Jenkins should need to git stash
[2013-11-27 17:50:08 -0500] mattray: spheromak: does something else parse the git commit message?
[2013-11-27 17:50:19 -0500] spheromak: mattray: it shouldn't but i think cause our build stuff had some artifacts
[2013-11-27 17:50:23 -0500] spheromak: I didn't want them around
[2013-11-27 17:50:34 -0500] mattray: spheromak: probably safe
[2013-11-27 17:50:51 -0500] spheromak: mattray: I don't aggregate commits into Changelog ... yet
[2013-11-27 17:51:01 -0500] mattray: spheromak: we can add that later
[2013-11-27 17:51:59 -0500] openstackgerrit: Salman Baset proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: Adding qpid support to quantum  https://review.openstack.org/56795
[2013-11-27 17:52:35 -0500] salmanbaset: here comes the qpid changes for openstack-network :)
[2013-11-27 17:52:42 -0500] spheromak: alop: spheromaks are used to start larger fusion reactions .. or they were when I was interested in that stuff :)
[2013-11-27 17:52:51 -0500] spheromak: salmanbaset: sweet
[2013-11-27 17:53:11 -0500] salmanbaset: mattray, jaypipes,spheromak: please take a look
[2013-11-27 17:54:12 -0500] alop: Not to be confused with the spherical tokamak, another topic in fusion research.
[2013-11-27 17:54:26 -0500] spheromak: :)
[2013-11-27 17:54:53 -0500] alop: spheromak: which leads me to your picture again
[2013-11-27 17:54:57 -0500] alop: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_tokamak
[2013-11-27 17:55:00 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-11-27 17:55:14 -0500] spheromak: i know im being in conflict
[2013-11-27 17:55:39 -0500] alop: I used to read on this stuff a few years ago too
[2013-11-27 17:56:03 -0500] spheromak: https://nimrodteam.org/graphics/r002sj12641.jpg
[2013-11-27 17:56:10 -0500] spheromak: would that be better ?
[2013-11-27 17:56:12 -0500] spheromak: :D
[2013-11-27 17:59:22 -0500] spheromak: alop: its still a toroidial plasma ball. So i wans't that stressed :)
[2013-11-27 18:01:58 -0500] jaypipes: so very iron man.
[2013-11-27 18:02:10 -0500] spheromak: hah now i feel like a 12yrold
[2013-11-27 18:02:18 -0500] spheromak: need that big helmet
[2013-11-27 18:02:20 -0500] jaypipes: LOL!
[2013-11-27 18:02:27 -0500] alop: a big Dark Helmet?
[2013-11-27 18:02:47 -0500] spheromak: jaypipes: mattray @all you guys got any issues with breaking attribute files up per-implementation.
[2013-11-27 18:02:59 -0500] spheromak: stuff like the qpid attributes could go into qpid.rb
[2013-11-27 18:03:19 -0500] alop: I've been thinking we'd eventually start going that way
[2013-11-27 18:03:26 -0500] alop: not everything needs to be in default.rb
[2013-11-27 18:03:30 -0500] spheromak: yes
[2013-11-27 18:03:32 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak: no objections from me...
[2013-11-27 18:03:39 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak: something for the icehouse timeframe.
[2013-11-27 18:03:48 -0500] spheromak: also makes it a bit more work when wrapping possibly, but also you can be more precise
[2013-11-27 18:04:07 -0500] alop: shit that goes to default should be like, 'developer mode', maybe log-config
[2013-11-27 18:04:29 -0500] spheromak: yea how i feel about it as well. I do think you can overdo it (i know i have).
[2013-11-27 18:05:27 -0500] spheromak: jaypipes: you know if we are going to be able to get kitchen runs in on these things ?
[2013-11-27 18:05:41 -0500] spheromak: whole nother world of hurt when converging compute
[2013-11-27 18:06:07 -0500] spheromak: https://github.com/cloudware-cookbooks/ktc-compute/blob/master/.kitchen.yml :(
[2013-11-27 18:06:12 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak: we really need *something*. chef-workflow doesn't work with our berkshelf/Chef11 tooling.
[2013-11-27 18:06:16 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-11-27 18:06:21 -0500] spheromak: i used to use chef-workflow
[2013-11-27 18:06:31 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak: I tried using vagabond with serverspec. total fail.
[2013-11-27 18:06:34 -0500] spheromak: im just doing tk right now, and ubilding up my own sauce for doing multi-node
[2013-11-27 18:06:42 -0500] spheromak: really ?
[2013-11-27 18:06:51 -0500] spheromak: my issues are lxc related
[2013-11-27 18:07:10 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak: I could totally go for kitchen if we could get some good examples that ran in a decent amount of time -- which Vagrant sucks ass for.
[2013-11-27 18:07:14 -0500] spheromak: I need vm nesting and i can't get cgroups setup to allow libvirt to spin inside a contianer
[2013-11-27 18:07:36 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak: I have no lxc issues. the issues I had were not understanding how to write serverspec tests! :)
[2013-11-27 18:07:38 -0500] spheromak: jaypipes: we are doing lxc backed kitchen converges on our cooks
[2013-11-27 18:07:45 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak: ++!
[2013-11-27 18:07:50 -0500] spheromak: jaypipes: bats
[2013-11-27 18:07:55 -0500] spheromak: ;|
[2013-11-27 18:08:21 -0500] spheromak: moved to bats from serverspec for most of our integrations cause it was easier for our non-ruby folks to grok
[2013-11-27 18:08:30 -0500] spheromak: I rather have shitty bats tests than no tests
[2013-11-27 18:11:01 -0500] spheromak: jaypipes: those converges are pretty long tho compute ~30min
[2013-11-27 18:11:14 -0500] jaypipes: geez....
[2013-11-27 18:11:18 -0500] spheromak: cause it has to have identity/db/messaging
[2013-11-27 18:11:31 -0500] jaypipes: right...
[2013-11-27 18:11:34 -0500] spheromak: also makes it so our shit has to all work together on the same node. causes some dephell things
[2013-11-27 18:11:44 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak: never heard of bats until just now :(
[2013-11-27 18:11:46 -0500] spheromak: need a way to moc identity
[2013-11-27 18:11:52 -0500] spheromak: jaypipes: :(
[2013-11-27 18:11:56 -0500] jaypipes: sorry :(
[2013-11-27 18:12:48 -0500] spheromak: my fav integration test

[2013-11-27 18:12:52 -0500] spheromak: with bats
[2013-11-27 18:14:19 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak: do you have a link to where I can read about Bats? I can't seem to find a direct link in Google :(
[2013-11-27 18:14:44 -0500] spheromak: yea one sec

[2013-11-27 18:15:43 -0500] spheromak: only real snafu is doing multip-platform switches
[2013-11-27 18:16:19 -0500] spheromak: having to  stat /etc/redhat-release to do os-detect, but someone has added some libs to handle that
[2013-11-27 18:17:48 -0500] jaypipes: spheromak: danke!
[2013-11-27 18:19:51 -0500] spheromak: https://github.com/lzap/foreman-bats/blob/master/os_helper.bash
[2013-11-27 18:20:00 -0500] spheromak: jaypipes: ^^ some libs for os_detection
[2013-11-27 18:20:14 -0500] jaypipes: nice.
[2013-11-27 18:33:03 -0500] salmanbaset: jaypipes: i do not see your comments inline
[2013-11-27 18:33:09 -0500] salmanbaset: did you publish?
[2013-11-27 18:33:24 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: which patch?
[2013-11-27 18:33:41 -0500] salmanbaset: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/56795/
[2013-11-27 18:34:22 -0500] salmanbaset: I also removed quantum openvswitch package info in this patch. will add it later
[2013-11-27 18:34:52 -0500] salmanbaset: oops. your comments were for previous patch. all those issues fixed.
[2013-11-27 18:37:16 -0500] jaypipes: salmanbaset: click Patch Set 5 :)
[2013-11-27 18:37:19 -0500] jaypipes: ya...
[2013-11-27 18:41:30 -0500] openstackgerrit: Salman Baset proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-block-storage: Adding qpid support to cinder  https://review.openstack.org/56801
[2013-11-27 18:42:17 -0500] salmanbaset: qpid changes coming in for cinder :)
[2013-11-27 18:44:01 -0500] salmanbaset: is justin sphepherd online?
[2013-11-27 18:44:32 -0500] salmanbaset: he had a -2 on quantum patch pending resolution of issues in nova. those issues have been resolved
[2013-11-27 18:48:03 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: that's galstrom_zzz
[2013-11-27 18:48:19 -0500] salmanbaset: ok
[2013-11-27 19:02:22 -0500] openstackgerrit: Salman Baset proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-block-storage: Adding qpid support to cinder  https://review.openstack.org/56801
[2013-11-27 19:02:48 -0500] spheromak: also as per attributes
[2013-11-27 19:03:06 -0500] spheromak: it might be nice to use template partials for rendering these conditional components
[2013-11-27 19:11:11 -0500] salmanbaset: spheromak: +1 for template partials
[2013-11-27 19:11:14 -0500] salmanbaset: after this merge is complete
[2013-11-27 19:43:55 -0500] mattray: and back.
[2013-11-27 19:52:22 -0500] mattray: spheromak: adding a CHANGELOG insertion to that script, but it's pretty good
[2013-11-27 19:59:08 -0500] spheromak: mattray: share it back :)
[2013-11-27 19:59:23 -0500] spheromak: i could use the changelog stuff as well
[2013-11-27 19:59:27 -0500] mattray: will do
[2013-11-27 20:02:21 -0500] openstackgerrit: Salman Baset proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: Adding qpid support to quantum  https://review.openstack.org/56795

[2013-11-27 20:15:22 -0500] mattray: that does the changelog
[2013-11-27 20:15:40 -0500] spheromak: mattray: sweet
[2013-11-27 20:16:01 -0500] mattray: the issue I see us having is how do you tag the versions that are there now?
[2013-11-27 20:16:10 -0500] mattray: can you push a tag in a review?
[2013-11-27 20:16:24 -0500] spheromak: so what gets commited
[2013-11-27 20:16:38 -0500] spheromak: should pars with any  comment that has #major #minor #patch
[2013-11-27 20:16:44 -0500] spheromak: *parse
[2013-11-27 20:16:50 -0500] mattray: well, haven't put in the parse filter yet
[2013-11-27 20:17:04 -0500] spheromak: scm-ver uses those in the commit log
[2013-11-27 20:17:10 -0500] spheromak: to push back
[2013-11-27 20:17:33 -0500] spheromak: so up to the commiter to mention the patch level in the commit
[2013-11-27 20:17:35 -0500] mattray: it reads the git commit log?
[2013-11-27 20:17:38 -0500] spheromak: yarp
[2013-11-27 20:17:47 -0500] mattray: lemme try that locally
[2013-11-27 20:17:58 -0500] spheromak: this is a #major chang
[2013-11-27 20:18:00 -0500] spheromak: *e
[2013-11-27 20:18:26 -0500] spheromak: im not familliar enough with gerrit to know how it will jib
[2013-11-27 20:19:11 -0500] mattray: hmm you can't start the line with #major :)
[2013-11-27 20:23:01 -0500] mattray: spheromak: how do you get it to parse the git commit message?
[2013-11-27 20:23:08 -0500] mattray:   cook-scm-ver bump TYPE [PRERELEASE_TYPE]  # Bump version number (type is major, minor, patch, prerelease or auto)
[2013-11-27 20:23:08 -0500] mattray:   cook-scm-ver current                      # Show current SCM tagged version
[2013-11-27 20:23:14 -0500] mattray: auto?
[2013-11-27 20:24:19 -0500] mattray: ugh, 7.2.0+build.2
[2013-11-27 20:33:42 -0500] mattray: spheromak: it reads out the tag of the previous, but it doesn't seem to read the commit message
[2013-11-27 20:37:08 -0500] mattray: ahhh, it has to be in the subject
[2013-11-27 20:37:20 -0500] mattray: that kinda stinks
[2013-11-27 20:37:33 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: ^^
[2013-11-27 20:37:59 -0500] mattray: it works and I have the workflow down
[2013-11-27 20:38:51 -0500] mattray: I think I want to read the entire commit message so we don't have to use the subject for #major, #minor, #patch
[2013-11-27 20:47:25 -0500] spheromak: its prob using shortlog or something yea
[2013-11-27 20:51:39 -0500] mattray: almost done
[2013-11-27 21:00:13 -0500] mattray: https://gist.github.com/7683120
[2013-11-27 21:00:37 -0500] mattray: spheromak: that tags the existing tag and increments it based on the commit message, or bumps patch if nothing mentioned
[2013-11-27 21:00:48 -0500] mattray: jaypipes: done ^^
[2013-11-27 21:25:03 -0500] mattray: https://gist.github.com/7683491 now ignores messages with #noversion in them
[2013-11-27 21:29:55 -0500] mattray: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/56402/ looks like we need to rename cookbook-openstack-metering to cookbook-openstack-telemetry
[2013-11-27 21:30:12 -0500] spheromak: :/
[2013-11-27 21:40:24 -0500] spheromak: mattray: re: noversion. I just have it auto increment patch for commits.
[2013-11-27 21:40:44 -0500] mattray: spheromak: I added that for random cleanups
[2013-11-27 21:40:47 -0500] mattray: like commit messages
[2013-11-27 21:40:56 -0500] mattray: or .gitignore
[2013-11-27 21:40:59 -0500] spheromak: well auto
[2013-11-27 21:41:04 -0500] spheromak: will do a build versions
[2013-11-27 21:41:14 -0500] mattray: yeah, not crazy about that :)
[2013-11-27 21:41:14 -0500] spheromak: *version.. which chef's gonna puke on
[2013-11-27 21:41:24 -0500] spheromak: so yea i invoke with --default patch
[2013-11-27 21:41:36 -0500] spheromak: or w/e
[2013-11-27 21:41:40 -0500] spheromak: yea default
[2013-11-27 21:41:54 -0500] mattray: #major, #minor, #noversion and #patch. Nothing in the commit message will get you #patch
[2013-11-27 21:42:08 -0500] spheromak: i must have read that wrong
[2013-11-27 21:42:12 -0500] spheromak:         return 'patch'
[2013-11-27 21:42:16 -0500] spheromak: hurp a durp
[2013-11-27 21:42:29 -0500] spheromak: ;)
[2013-11-27 21:42:40 -0500] mattray: I specifically don't want "build" or "prerelease"
[2013-11-27 21:42:49 -0500] spheromak: yea no cook should have that
[2013-11-27 21:42:54 -0500] spheromak: chef will puke
[2013-11-27 21:43:03 -0500] spheromak: just good to increment every merge so we can trust versions
[2013-11-27 21:43:06 -0500] mattray: so if that looks good how do we get it into the build?
[2013-11-27 21:43:19 -0500] mattray: and how do we fix up the tags before we turn it on?
[2013-11-27 21:43:28 -0500] spheromak: I have this as a post build shel executor
[2013-11-27 21:43:46 -0500] spheromak: gotta manually tag the current version before you turn it on
[2013-11-27 21:44:31 -0500] spheromak: again not familliar enough with how gerrit works to know how to get it implemented
