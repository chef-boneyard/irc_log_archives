[2013-11-09 21:38:36 -0500] openstackgerrit: Paul Czarkowski proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: only run recipes if quantum or neutron  https://review.openstack.org/55733
[2013-11-09 21:47:14 -0500] paulczar: when somebody has a few minutes can they point me to why my tests are failing in https://review.openstack.org/55733.   It's definately PEBCAK, but the changes I made to spec files look to match the changes I made to the cookbooks
[2013-11-09 21:47:37 -0500] paulczar: the cookbook actually works as expected,  so no doubt I just fail at chefspec
