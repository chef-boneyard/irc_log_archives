[2013-11-01 19:54:25 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: I've got quite a few in need of review too
[2013-11-01 19:54:38 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: yup, going for those now ;)
[2013-11-01 19:55:43 -0400] mattray: I think I'm onto something with the broken vagrant installs, the rabbit stuff isn't wired up at all and nova-network is on the box with quantum
[2013-11-01 19:56:01 -0400] mattray: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/54614/ and https://review.openstack.org/#/c/53234/ respectively
[2013-11-01 19:56:19 -0400] mattray: trying to sort Vagrant for the preso in HK
[2013-11-01 19:56:49 -0400] spheromak: will have time this eve to go over the list again
[2013-11-01 19:59:03 -0400] spheromak: mattray, jaypipes et-al  node.run_list.expand(node.chef_environment).roles.include
[2013-11-01 19:59:08 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: k, a number of them are approved and going through gates...
[2013-11-01 19:59:13 -0400] spheromak: would be good to get this wrapped eh ?
[2013-11-01 19:59:19 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: ++
[2013-11-01 19:59:20 -0400] spheromak: and to be supporting of a role or  recipe
[2013-11-01 19:59:31 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: but I think mattray wanted to use the run_context?
[2013-11-01 19:59:35 -0400] spheromak: yea
[2013-11-01 19:59:40 -0400] spheromak: its better with context
[2013-11-01 19:59:45 -0400] spheromak: we can introspect for a recipe
[2013-11-01 19:59:48 -0400] spheromak: which is better imo
[2013-11-01 19:59:54 -0400] spheromak: cause it doesn't assume role structure
[2013-11-01 20:00:25 -0400] spheromak: be good to have a helper for that.
[2013-11-01 20:00:48 -0400] spheromak: be better if chef-proper handled node.recipes.include? in a comprehensive way.
[2013-11-01 20:01:38 -0400] mattray: spheromak: yes and yes
[2013-11-01 20:01:48 -0400] mattray: a helper in common
[2013-11-01 20:02:00 -0400] mattray: and I was going to bitch about it in Seattle
[2013-11-01 20:02:04 -0400] spheromak: yea
[2013-11-01 20:02:10 -0400] spheromak: i want to bitch about namespaces :D
[2013-11-01 20:02:16 -0400] spheromak: and common
[2013-11-01 20:02:24 -0400] spheromak: but yea
[2013-11-01 20:02:32 -0400] mattray: I'm hesitant to mess with common right now
[2013-11-01 20:02:39 -0400] spheromak: yea we talked about it
[2013-11-01 20:02:40 -0400] mattray: I want to save that for havana
[2013-11-01 20:02:49 -0400] spheromak: well maybe move it to  Chef::Recipe::Openstack on havana
[2013-11-01 20:02:58 -0400] spheromak: so recipes can call Openstack.foo
[2013-11-01 20:03:06 -0400] mattray: yup yup
[2013-11-01 20:03:56 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Check the run_context.loaded_recipes rather than the run_list, removed sysctl  https://review.openstack.org/53234

[2013-11-01 20:18:27 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: quick recheck on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/54609/...
[2013-11-01 20:27:54 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: I +2'd it, what's your recommendation for when to +1A it?
[2013-11-01 20:28:24 -0400] mattray: if another Core review has already +2'd it?
[2013-11-01 20:29:01 -0400] mattray: I've been inconsistent and want to do it right
[2013-11-01 20:29:40 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: right.
[2013-11-01 20:29:50 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: so i think it's good to go.
[2013-11-01 20:29:58 -0400] mattray: aight, I'll go +1A it
[2013-11-01 20:30:13 -0400] mattray: what about other reviews? Like if there are 2 or more +1s from non-Core?
[2013-11-01 20:32:09 -0400] mattray: we're a little short on Core reviewers right now
