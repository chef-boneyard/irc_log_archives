[2013-11-18 18:40:39 -0500] mattray: Time to catch up with 2 weeks of reviews
[2013-11-18 19:34:26 -0500] paulczar: sweet!  review my changes mattray :)
[2013-11-18 19:34:53 -0500] mattray: I'm slowly going through them. Checking my reviews first, resyncing my merges and working oldest first
[2013-11-18 19:35:31 -0500] mattray: we really need to make the Grizzly branch but there are so many outstanding PRs
[2013-11-18 19:35:53 -0500] mattray: I guess it's like ripping off a band-aid, just get it over with
[2013-11-18 19:42:51 -0500] paulczar: yeah I really want to get into Havana stuff
[2013-11-18 19:43:10 -0500] paulczar: want to get the docker driver implemented :D
[2013-11-18 22:31:54 -0500] galstrom: mattray: ping
[2013-11-18 23:15:30 -0500] mattray: galstrom_zzz: pong
[2013-11-18 23:33:46 -0500] mrodden: so there isn't any integration testing done on the stackforge cookbooks at all today right?
[2013-11-18 23:34:01 -0500] mattray: mrodden: not yet
[2013-11-18 23:34:08 -0500] mrodden: yet?
[2013-11-18 23:34:23 -0500] mrodden: got a BP or is someone working on that
[2013-11-18 23:34:24 -0500] mrodden: ?
[2013-11-18 23:34:28 -0500] mattray: supposedly lxc-based stuff should work, vagabond is being investigated
[2013-11-18 23:34:36 -0500] mrodden: hah yeah
[2013-11-18 23:34:41 -0500] mrodden: looking into it myself
[2013-11-18 23:35:21 -0500] mattray: yeah, need to start using blueprints
[2013-11-18 23:35:49 -0500] mrodden: i'm new to testing cookbooks
[2013-11-18 23:36:10 -0500] mrodden: but i am not new to CI with Jenkins
[2013-11-18 23:36:28 -0500] mrodden: i'm thinking of trying out test kitchen with vagrant all-in-one for the moment
[2013-11-18 23:38:17 -0500] mattray: mrodden: yeah, I'd be interested if the kitchen-lxc driver works on stackforge
[2013-11-18 23:39:23 -0500] mrodden: lxc through vagabond?
[2013-11-18 23:41:06 -0500] mattray: yeah, that should work too
[2013-11-18 23:41:16 -0500] mattray: afaik vagabond is only lxc?
[2013-11-18 23:41:21 -0500] mrodden: yeah i think so
[2013-11-18 23:41:26 -0500] mrodden: there are two drivers ?
[2013-11-18 23:41:27 -0500] mattray: vagrant-lxc, kitchen-lxc and vagabond
[2013-11-18 23:41:31 -0500] mrodden: ok
[2013-11-18 23:41:40 -0500] mrodden: wasn't aware of kitchen-lxc
[2013-11-18 23:41:47 -0500] mattray: still single-node
[2013-11-18 23:42:22 -0500] mrodden: why LXC vs virtbox or libvirt
[2013-11-18 23:42:23 -0500] mrodden: ?
[2013-11-18 23:42:44 -0500] mattray: not sure
[2013-11-18 23:43:09 -0500] mrodden: i haven't had much luck with vagrant with anything other than virtualbox
[2013-11-18 23:43:19 -0500] mattray: I've been lead to believe we can use lxc with review.openstack.org
[2013-11-18 23:43:29 -0500] mattray: but cycles are spare
[2013-11-18 23:43:41 -0500] mrodden: i think they run QEMU in openstack gate
[2013-11-18 23:43:45 -0500] mrodden: nested VMs
[2013-11-18 23:43:56 -0500] mrodden: its slow but it works
[2013-11-18 23:45:00 -0500] mrodden: regardless, its probably better to see if either works first before worrying about speed
