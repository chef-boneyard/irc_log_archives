[2013-11-14 08:54:35 -0500] openstackgerrit: jiehuajin proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: use new package name to replace python-pyparsing  https://review.openstack.org/53796
[2013-11-14 10:23:14 -0500] s2r2: good morning.  I wonder more and more about the stackforge cookbooks' dependency on the packages that are used as much stuff is expected to be done by the package's postinst like user creation, sudoers, 
[2013-11-14 10:23:32 -0500] s2r2: is there some rule of thumb to follow?
[2013-11-14 10:24:05 -0500] iartarisi: s2r2: what
[2013-11-14 10:24:10 -0500] iartarisi: 's your problem exactly? :)
[2013-11-14 10:25:33 -0500] s2r2: my colleague's trying to get the cookbooks to work with our packages and keeps complaining about stuff ;)
[2013-11-14 10:25:49 -0500] iartarisi: you're not using distro packages?
[2013-11-14 10:25:58 -0500] s2r2: no :)
[2013-11-14 10:26:05 -0500] iartarisi: ah :)
[2013-11-14 10:26:11 -0500] s2r2: is it the advised way?  I.e. "stackforge is for distro packages"
[2013-11-14 10:26:32 -0500] iartarisi: well right now that's how most people are using and developing them
[2013-11-14 10:27:17 -0500] s2r2: yes...
[2013-11-14 10:28:13 -0500] iartarisi: I guess you could say that there's an assumption that you would use distro packages on one of the supported platforms.
[2013-11-14 10:28:25 -0500] s2r2: ok
