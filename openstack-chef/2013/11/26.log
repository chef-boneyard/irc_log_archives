[2013-11-26 12:14:48 -0500] salmanbaset: any idea how to fix the issue at the gate? http://logs.openstack.org/97/56797/20/check/gate-cookbook-openstack-compute-chef-unit/604ce6d/console.html

[2013-11-26 15:03:55 -0500] alanmeadows: For the life of me I can't get the LP bug reference to stick, did the syntax change or did I just not have enough coffee this morning?
[2013-11-26 15:04:48 -0500] iartarisi: alanmeadows: see my comment

[2013-11-26 15:18:21 -0500] alanmeadows: iartarisi: there we go, thanks.
[2013-11-26 15:19:38 -0500] alanmeadows: That is indeed not the same syntax as I previously was using (which in the past also managed to successfully tie it to LP)
[2013-11-26 15:22:39 -0500] iartarisi: yeah, I don't know why LP didn't pick it up. It worked here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+bug/1207504/comments/10
[2013-11-26 15:23:24 -0500] alanmeadows: iartarisi: shouldn't that be partial-fix vs addresses?
[2013-11-26 15:23:44 -0500] alanmeadows: I'm not sure if it matters
[2013-11-26 15:25:07 -0500] iartarisi: I don't know, I've never seen partial-fix
[2013-11-26 15:26:09 -0500] iartarisi: alanmeadows: hm.. maybe try Partial-Bug? https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Gerrit_Workflow#Committing_Changes
[2013-11-26 15:26:28 -0500] alanmeadows: indeed, reading the same page
[2013-11-26 15:26:31 -0500] alanmeadows: partial-bug
[2013-11-26 15:26:34 -0500] iartarisi: :)
[2013-11-26 15:28:14 -0500] alanmeadows: I'm going to follow the guide and do partial-bug.

[2013-11-26 16:22:50 -0500] DeVVaN: is there any work beeing done on swift in openstack-chef-repo atm?
[2013-11-26 16:24:01 -0500] DeVVaN: openstack-object-storage is locked on 1.1.0 in Berksfile.lock while the repo is @ 7.0.11
[2013-11-26 16:38:58 -0500] mattray: hmmm I was hoping to get salmanbasset's patches through review
[2013-11-26 16:40:14 -0500] mattray: spheromak: you guys use Thor::SCMVersion?
[2013-11-26 16:42:30 -0500] alanmeadows: DeVVaN: There was a jump to 7.x on object-storage--some confusion with mistaking it for block-storage, but it shouldn't be locked at 1.1.0 anywhere.
[2013-11-26 16:50:49 -0500] DeVVaN: alanmeadows: ah, i see... the "locking" i was referring to was https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo/blob/master/Berksfile.lock
[2013-11-26 16:52:11 -0500] alop: DeVVaN: yeah, the stackforge chef-repo is merely for example...
[2013-11-26 16:52:25 -0500] alop: we *should* keep that up to date as a reference, but it's not
[2013-11-26 16:53:25 -0500] DeVVaN: alop: yeah, i'm using it just to test the swift implementation.
[2013-11-26 16:53:52 -0500] DeVVaN: or is there better cookbooks that i should be looking at?
[2013-11-26 16:55:06 -0500] alop: No, these are them, just the chef-repo is out of date
[2013-11-26 16:55:27 -0500] alop: if you change berksfile.lock in your own, you'll be better along
[2013-11-26 16:56:16 -0500] DeVVaN: as i expected then
[2013-11-26 16:56:24 -0500] mattray: the Berksfile.lock is pretty out of date
[2013-11-26 16:56:50 -0500] alop: mattray: I'll do some fixing right now
[2013-11-26 16:57:01 -0500] mattray: if you update to the latest versions, the Vagrant build doesn't work for networking
[2013-11-26 16:57:04 -0500] alop: I just happen to have a working one in another repo
[2013-11-26 16:57:23 -0500] DeVVaN: mattray: i heard you mention that during the meeting yesterday
[2013-11-26 16:57:36 -0500] DeVVaN: damn my spelling is foobaar
[2013-11-26 16:57:52 -0500] mattray: alop: the allinone-compute role is supposed to be using the OVS plugin, instead it's using an old version of the network cookbook that had a bug where OVS and nova-network were both installed
[2013-11-26 16:58:03 -0500] mattray: so nova-network works :)
[2013-11-26 16:58:11 -0500] alop: yeah, I remember that mentioned
[2013-11-26 16:58:12 -0500] mattray: but really we want to cut over to OVS
[2013-11-26 16:58:47 -0500] alop: we've done a poor job of versioning
[2013-11-26 16:58:49 -0500] alop: too
[2013-11-26 16:58:57 -0500] alop: like "Everything is 7.0.0!!!"
[2013-11-26 16:59:02 -0500] alop: regardless of SHA
[2013-11-26 16:59:13 -0500] mattray: alop: we can get more aggressive once the Thor::SCMVersion stuff is working
[2013-11-26 16:59:21 -0500] alop: yup
[2013-11-26 16:59:26 -0500] mattray: or.. if someone gets it working now
[2013-11-26 16:59:35 -0500] mattray: I'm trying a single-box and a vagrant install now
[2013-11-26 16:59:39 -0500] alop: I always get a jaypipes -1 because of versions
[2013-11-26 17:05:16 -0500] alop: mattray: https://review.openstack.org/58583
[2013-11-26 17:08:29 -0500] mattray: alop: does that work with the Vagrant run?
[2013-11-26 17:08:57 -0500] paulczar: mattray:  networking doesn't work in vagrant?  I thought I fixed it :/
[2013-11-26 17:09:20 -0500] mattray: paulczar: the Berksfile.lock brings in old versions of the cookbooks which still use nova-network
[2013-11-26 17:09:34 -0500] paulczar: ahhh right
[2013-11-26 17:09:37 -0500] alop: mattray: I just updated the swift/glance books, I didn't check vagrant
[2013-11-26 17:09:45 -0500] paulczar: nova networking is considered broken? :P
[2013-11-26 17:09:54 -0500] mattray: paulczar: it's considered sub-optimal
[2013-11-26 17:10:10 -0500] mattray: especially since it installs both OVS and nova-network
[2013-11-26 17:10:14 -0500] paulczar: you know devstack still uses nova-networking for default :P
[2013-11-26 17:10:37 -0500] mattray: troll hard
[2013-11-26 17:11:12 -0500] mattray: there were so many sessions in HK where people bitched about Neutron being unusable as open source software
[2013-11-26 17:11:45 -0500] mattray: I want to lean into OVS until it works
[2013-11-26 17:12:14 -0500] mattray: sadly the removal of nova-network got yet another reprieve
[2013-11-26 17:12:44 -0500] alop: added chef-repo to the gerritbot watchlist https://review.openstack.org/58585
[2013-11-26 17:14:06 -0500] mattray: alop: we'll need to go back and add orchestration once the Havana work starts
[2013-11-26 17:15:51 -0500] alop: I see it has 'master' and 'stable/grizzly', I assume that was pipes
[2013-11-26 17:17:16 -0500] mattray: paulczar: does the centos64 work with Vagrant?
[2013-11-26 17:18:06 -0500] paulczar: I think it fails during provisioning   I just added it in case someone wanted to take up the rains for championing making the cookbooks run on centos
[2013-11-26 17:18:37 -0500] paulczar: and/or RHEL
[2013-11-26 17:19:16 -0500] mattray: paulczar: thanks. I'll probably jump on that eventually
[2013-11-26 17:19:28 -0500] mattray: I kinda want to drop the Ubuntu 13.04
[2013-11-26 17:19:55 -0500] paulczar: I would be okay with that 
[2013-11-26 17:19:58 -0500] mattray: alop: testing your Berksfile.lock change now
[2013-11-26 17:20:33 -0500] paulczar: annoys the shit out of me that RHEL isn't doing something for vagrant support
[2013-11-26 17:21:41 -0500] mattray: we should have an Austin Chef Hack Day
[2013-11-26 17:21:50 -0500] mattray: or Chef + OpenStack Hack Day
[2013-11-26 17:22:09 -0500] paulczar: yeah I agree!
[2013-11-26 17:22:17 -0500] paulczar: maybe a little mini chef conf ?
[2013-11-26 17:22:39 -0500] paulczar: with a few hours for talks/presentations then hacking at cookbooks etc the rest of the day
[2013-11-26 17:22:43 -0500] mattray: yup
[2013-11-26 17:23:02 -0500] mattray: I've done them in LA, Boston and NYC
[2013-11-26 17:23:18 -0500] paulczar: I'm actually writing up a deck on TDD with chefspec+strainer from what I've learned working on the openstack cookbooks
[2013-11-26 17:23:21 -0500] mattray: Austin next month? I bet I can get some pizza money from Opscode
[2013-11-26 17:23:37 -0500] mattray: maybe Dell or RS can provide a venue
[2013-11-26 17:24:18 -0500] paulczar: maybe see if Boyd wants to do it in place of the the regular meet up .. which I don't think anything is scheduled for yet
[2013-11-26 17:25:03 -0500] paulczar: 12 - 6 : hackday,   6 -> *  devops austin - chef focussed presentations
[2013-11-26 17:25:14 -0500] paulczar: two birds
[2013-11-26 17:27:24 -0500] alop: maybe I can crash at my bosses place ;)
[2013-11-26 17:34:04 -0500] mattray: paulczar: I'm checking with Boyd, I'll get something going for December
[2013-11-26 17:34:15 -0500] mattray: a Havana dev spike or something
[2013-11-26 17:34:24 -0500] mattray: and RHEL support :)
[2013-11-26 17:35:06 -0500] paulczar: I would just make it chef in general,  we can get a subgroup to focus on openstack   that way we're not excluding people who don't care about openstack
[2013-11-26 17:36:35 -0500] paulczar: also at last OSATX meet up we were talking about doing an install day based around the stack forge cookbooks  so good reason to get them working :P
[2013-11-26 17:52:01 -0500] mattray: paulczar: we could go either way, or both
[2013-11-26 18:53:26 -0500] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: Parameterize the quota default values  https://review.openstack.org/56953

[2013-11-26 20:50:46 -0500] salmanbaset: added patch without qpid test in rspec. for some reason, it keeps failing at the gate
[2013-11-26 20:58:25 -0500] mattray: salmanbaset: I'll take a look
[2013-11-26 21:07:49 -0500] salmanbaset: so this patch succeeded because I did not add any testing code in nova-common_spec.rb
[2013-11-26 21:08:19 -0500] salmanbaset: you can take a look at patch 20 for the additions in this file
[2013-11-26 21:38:56 -0500] mattray: Tests in openstack-compute are failing for me the same way Jenkins is failing
[2013-11-26 21:45:06 -0500] spheromak: mattray: thanks for the notes from the meeting.  Hopefully I can make it to next weeks meeting
[2013-11-26 21:45:29 -0500] mattray: spheromak: glad to be of service
[2013-11-26 21:45:46 -0500] mattray: right now I'm trying to sort broken testing for salmanbaset
[2013-11-26 21:46:01 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-11-26 21:46:09 -0500] spheromak: this is the qpid stuff
[2013-11-26 21:46:18 -0500] spheromak: ?
[2013-11-26 21:47:06 -0500] mattray: yes
[2013-11-26 21:47:24 -0500] mattray: what's weird is that what's currently in trunk of os-compute fails for me
[2013-11-26 21:47:33 -0500] mattray: the same way Gerrit is rejecting his qpid patches
[2013-11-26 21:47:47 -0500] spheromak: no bueno
[2013-11-26 21:48:56 -0500] mattray: previous experience makes me suspect Ruby breaking things
[2013-11-26 21:49:04 -0500] mattray: the Gemfile is pretty loose
[2013-11-26 23:53:53 -0500] openstackgerrit: Matt Ray proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Fix for tests failing on ::Chef::Application.fatal!  https://review.openstack.org/58649
[2013-11-26 23:56:59 -0500] mattray: spheromak: jaypipes: ctracey: ^^ fixes gating tests failing on ::Chef::Application.fatal! (like salmanbaset's qpid nova tests)
