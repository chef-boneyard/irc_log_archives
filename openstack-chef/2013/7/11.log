[2013-07-11 03:00:31 -0400] spheromak: in the various roles in the openstack-chef-repo it refrences recipe[openstack-compute::worker] which doesn't exist
[2013-07-11 03:00:44 -0400] spheromak: is that supposed to exist, or is it simply something else ?

[2013-07-11 15:34:29 -0400] irossi: mattray, I need some help with knife-openstack
[2013-07-11 15:34:41 -0400] mattray: irossi: what can I do for you?
[2013-07-11 15:36:10 -0400] irossi: mattray, Hey thanks. I'v tried to setup knife-openstack on two systems and I'm getting errors. I currently have a clean VM running RVM with Ruby 1.9.3. I have my OpenRC script from the Openstack dash in my bash_profile and the error I'm getting is bad URI, not a URI?

[2013-07-11 15:52:27 -0400] mattray: turns out the openstack_auth_url was missing "/tokens" at the end, like http://10.0.0.6:5000/v2.0/tokens
[2013-07-11 16:01:09 -0400] rackerjoe: mattray: ping
[2013-07-11 16:01:20 -0400] mattray: rackerjoe: pong
[2013-07-11 16:01:43 -0400] rackerjoe: mattray: I am looking at search_for in openstack-common - specifically memcached_servers.
[2013-07-11 16:02:21 -0400] rackerjoe: search_for(role).map seems to be returning a json blob as part of the search that is getting stuffed into the keystone conf file.
[2013-07-11 16:03:41 -0400] rackerjoe: if I change the search for memcached servers to not use .map I can get it to work correctly, but it seems that .map is misbehaving
[2013-07-11 16:06:35 -0400] mattray: rackerjoe: hmmm I've been away from the code for a bit, perhaps jaypipes or retr0h could chime in
[2013-07-11 16:21:48 -0400] jaypipes: rackerjoe: heyo... yeah, we noticed a change in behaviour regarding that from Chef 10 to Chef 11...
[2013-07-11 16:22:42 -0400] jaypipes: rackerjoe: retr0h should be able to comment more knowledgeably than I can, but basically, before we were returning result[0][section] and now we return result[section]
[2013-07-11 16:23:03 -0400] jaypipes: rackerjoe: I'm not entirely sure what changed, but we definitely noticed something is different
[2013-07-11 16:23:38 -0400] jaypipes: rackerjoe: I *thought* that we'd fixed all the places in the code that did this, though... what version of the openstack-common lib are you using?
[2013-07-11 16:54:24 -0400] openstackgerrit: Abel Lopez proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Added nfs client packages  https://review.openstack.org/36694
[2013-07-11 17:08:22 -0400] rackerjoe: jaypipes: I'm using trunk right now.  I think there is another problem here.  with memcached_servers, we expect to return an array of the memcached servers and identity joins with , the list into a string of candidate memcached servers.  however, search_for returns the first result only, so at most you only ever get one memcached server in your list from search
[2013-07-11 17:08:54 -0400] rackerjoe: I am going to add a search_for_many function to common that returns all nodes from the search so that we can correctly build up a list of candidates
[2013-07-11 17:09:35 -0400] rackerjoe: this change won't require any changes to other cookbooks for it to be consumed
[2013-07-11 17:10:42 -0400] retr0h: iono
[2013-07-11 17:10:48 -0400] retr0h: search returns
[2013-07-11 17:11:00 -0400] retr0h: [[], x, x]
[2013-07-11 17:11:22 -0400] retr0h: where the last two are a count and rows
[2013-07-11 17:11:24 -0400] retr0h: or something like that
[2013-07-11 17:11:33 -0400] retr0h: so search.first returns the array of all found servers
[2013-07-11 17:11:49 -0400] retr0h: unless
[2013-07-11 17:12:39 -0400] retr0h: search acts differently than  ::Chef::Search::Query
[2013-07-11 17:13:06 -0400] retr0h: previously the code called ::Chef::Search::Query, which returns the structure I stated above
[2013-07-11 17:13:27 -0400] retr0h: if it doesn't.. i can fix this pretty easially, I just need to verify
[2013-07-11 17:14:54 -0400] retr0h: rackerjoe: and you are likely right, b/c that would explain the json
[2013-07-11 17:15:34 -0400] rackerjoe: retr0h: it looks like search() returns a list of the nodes only
[2013-07-11 17:16:07 -0400] retr0h: ok cool... can I supply a patch, since I broke it then?
[2013-07-11 17:16:10 -0400] retr0h: andu can test it?
[2013-07-11 17:16:15 -0400] retr0h: should take me 5 min or so
[2013-07-11 17:16:18 -0400] retr0h: to fix all the tetss
[2013-07-11 17:16:21 -0400] retr0h: or u wanna fix it up?
[2013-07-11 17:16:40 -0400] rackerjoe: retr0h: go ahead :)
[2013-07-11 17:29:02 -0400] spheromak: funny i ran into this last night as well
[2013-07-11 17:30:22 -0400] retr0h: ya, unittests are good, but we till need integration tests
[2013-07-11 17:30:30 -0400] retr0h: i mocked out the wrong resonse
[2013-07-11 17:31:06 -0400] spheromak: yeap  bats + kitchen 4tw, but we need multi-node kitchen. Vagabond!
[2013-07-11 17:31:19 -0400] spheromak: im sensing tho that we will see a chef-zero kitchen thing soon

[2013-07-11 17:33:08 -0400] retr0h: spheromak: ya, most likely

[2013-07-11 17:37:28 -0400] retr0h: ^^let me know what u think of that guys
[2013-07-11 17:40:09 -0400] spheromak: retr0h, also for workstuff I have vagrant + vagrant-berskhelf + vagrant-chef-zero building multiple nodes to regress and develop this stuff
[2013-07-11 17:40:36 -0400] spheromak: I use Vagabond but there are lots of folks on mac and some on windows. So vagrant made more sense there
[2013-07-11 17:44:41 -0400] retr0h: spheromak: cool.. yah .. jay has vagabond
[2013-07-11 17:44:51 -0400] retr0h: i think he now has it all working
[2013-07-11 17:45:03 -0400] spheromak: yea im doign vagabond on the jenkins server right now
[2013-07-11 17:45:20 -0400] spheromak: vagrant/vbox will just fall over when 2 builds errun at the same time :D
[2013-07-11 17:45:35 -0400] retr0h: hahaha
[2013-07-11 17:45:40 -0400] retr0h: ya thats why we have a metal cluster for thta
[2013-07-11 17:45:53 -0400] retr0h: we have a 12 node production grade environment in plano
[2013-07-11 17:46:01 -0400] retr0h: that jenkins fronts
[2013-07-11 17:46:29 -0400] retr0h: we are in the middle of getting jenkins to IMPI netboot everything from the ground up
[2013-07-11 17:46:35 -0400] retr0h: so we test our cloud provisinong
[2013-07-11 17:46:36 -0400] retr0h: PXE
[2013-07-11 17:46:37 -0400] retr0h: cobbler
[2013-07-11 17:46:39 -0400] retr0h: chef
[2013-07-11 17:46:42 -0400] spheromak: ya @ KT we got 2 racks of shit for doing build out and testing, but its not auto-provisioned on the jenkins side.
[2013-07-11 17:46:43 -0400] retr0h: and then run horizon
[2013-07-11 17:46:48 -0400] retr0h: ya
[2013-07-11 17:46:52 -0400] retr0h: thats what we trying to do
[2013-07-11 17:46:58 -0400] retr0h: hopefully get that done soon
[2013-07-11 17:47:01 -0400] spheromak: were using razor and that stuff is almost there for us
[2013-07-11 17:47:10 -0400] retr0h: spheromak: ya.. i remember you telling me about thta
[2013-07-11 17:47:13 -0400] spheromak: razor is pretty sweet
[2013-07-11 17:47:18 -0400] retr0h: spheromak: but on the bright side we are using berkshelf now ;)
[2013-07-11 17:47:29 -0400] spheromak: I just haven't had time to get back to the bare metal deploy
[2013-07-11 17:47:42 -0400] retr0h: so what we need
[2013-07-11 17:47:52 -0400] retr0h: is the stackforge/openstack-chef-repo
[2013-07-11 17:48:02 -0400] retr0h: to get everyone to update with their stuff so it works ;)
[2013-07-11 17:48:53 -0400] spheromak: yea im working on that :D
[2013-07-11 17:48:55 -0400] spheromak: finally
[2013-07-11 17:56:24 -0400] retr0h: spheromak: sweet
[2013-07-11 18:05:32 -0400] spheromak: retr0h I want to seriously reduce the role footprint in this refrence tho.
[2013-07-11 18:06:16 -0400] spheromak: or would be nice if openstack-common wasn't so role-dependent.
[2013-07-11 18:06:38 -0400] spheromak: I was looking at some of the searches, and could be made to look for recipe as a fall-through.
[2013-07-11 18:06:45 -0400] spheromak: role>recipe>attribute
[2013-07-11 18:07:31 -0400] spheromak: or put the attribute at the top of that list which IIRC is what that memcached method is doing
[2013-07-11 18:08:12 -0400] spheromak: also noticed that even tho many of the lookups take an optional role name, many of the recipes using them don't defer to an attribute for that role name.
[2013-07-11 18:08:29 -0400] spheromak: all fixable things
[2013-07-11 18:13:16 -0400] spheromak: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/35234/ should get that pushed
[2013-07-11 18:14:43 -0400] rackerjoe: retr0h: we went a different route with our integration testing and stand up a nova cluster inside of a nova cluster.  It was quicker than bare metal for us and we could run multiple gate tests for separate commits (as long as they didn't overlap too much)
[2013-07-11 18:16:27 -0400] rackerjoe: retr0h: the memcache and rabbit searches look like they could use partial searches as well

[2013-07-11 18:51:04 -0400] retr0h: spheromak: ya... i mean all of this is a work in progress... they are slanted to the way we did it.. but can be fixed up to handle better uses
[2013-07-11 18:51:25 -0400] spheromak:  /better/more/
[2013-07-11 18:51:26 -0400] spheromak: :D
[2013-07-11 18:52:03 -0400] retr0h: hehehe
[2013-07-11 18:53:35 -0400] retr0h: rackerjoe: nice...
[2013-07-11 18:53:48 -0400] retr0h: spheromak: so you guys are using the stackforge cookbooks ?
[2013-07-11 18:53:57 -0400] retr0h: or working towards using them?
[2013-07-11 18:54:01 -0400] spheromak: retr0h, trying to
[2013-07-11 18:54:05 -0400] spheromak: ;)
[2013-07-11 18:54:08 -0400] retr0h: heh
[2013-07-11 18:54:33 -0400] retr0h: hopefully we can boil them down enough to where they are easy
[2013-07-11 18:54:34 -0400] spheromak: rcbops is what we are running right now, but were gonna do ostack beta service in september, and I really want us to pivot over to stackforge stuff before then.
[2013-07-11 18:54:54 -0400] retr0h: ya
[2013-07-11 18:55:00 -0400] retr0h: that be nice..
[2013-07-11 18:55:07 -0400] retr0h: hopefully they are not soo painful
[2013-07-11 18:55:14 -0400] retr0h: you will curse me the next time u see m e;P
[2013-07-11 18:55:19 -0400] spheromak: :)
[2013-07-11 18:55:39 -0400] spheromak: I wanted to start this work 2 months ago, but we just had other things that had to get done.
[2013-07-11 18:56:00 -0400] spheromak: right now i have develop branch looking @ stackforge, but its not building
[2013-07-11 18:56:05 -0400] spheromak: :D
[2013-07-11 18:56:40 -0400] spheromak: need to get the refrence working then well start porting our wrapers for each service over
[2013-07-11 18:57:15 -0400] retr0h: ya
[2013-07-11 18:57:18 -0400] retr0h: we want to move off our roles
[2013-07-11 18:57:19 -0400] retr0h: to wrappres
[2013-07-11 18:57:23 -0400] retr0h: wrappers*
[2013-07-11 18:57:30 -0400] spheromak: yea I want to move things to app cooks
[2013-07-11 18:57:38 -0400] spheromak: and away from role-spaghetti
[2013-07-11 18:58:07 -0400] spheromak: least on stackforge the searches are easy to fixup to handle this
[2013-07-11 18:58:12 -0400] retr0h: ya
[2013-07-11 18:58:16 -0400] retr0h: they should be
[2013-07-11 18:58:20 -0400] retr0h: we did roles at first
[2013-07-11 18:58:44 -0400] spheromak: everyone did :D
[2013-07-11 18:58:48 -0400] retr0h: hah
[2013-07-11 18:58:58 -0400] retr0h: if it were up to me
[2013-07-11 18:59:02 -0400] retr0h: id salt it all
[2013-07-11 18:59:03 -0400] spheromak: so i was playing with that graphviz stuff from the chef-ml
[2013-07-11 18:59:06 -0400] retr0h: but i cant change that now
[2013-07-11 18:59:12 -0400] spheromak: you're salt fan eh
[2013-07-11 18:59:21 -0400] retr0h: im a python fan ;)
[2013-07-11 18:59:27 -0400] spheromak: putting rabbit everywhere isn't my idea of a good time
[2013-07-11 18:59:31 -0400] spheromak: im a golang fan!
[2013-07-11 18:59:34 -0400] spheromak: :\
[2013-07-11 18:59:57 -0400] retr0h: we need
[2013-07-11 19:00:00 -0400] retr0h: a go deployer next lol
[2013-07-11 19:00:01 -0400] spheromak: If i wrote config management in Go it would end up with LUA as a DSL.. I don't think that would happen
[2013-07-11 19:00:17 -0400] retr0h: i'm not a dsl fan
[2013-07-11 19:00:19 -0400] spheromak: Would like to see many of the Ostack components redone
[2013-07-11 19:00:38 -0400] spheromak: ;)
[2013-07-11 19:01:06 -0400] spheromak: that wont happen, as the project is pretty bias to python. unfortunate cause at scale many of these components are faling over :D
[2013-07-11 19:01:21 -0400] retr0h: go might get some traction
[2013-07-11 19:01:24 -0400] spheromak: Eventlet blocking is the funniest one I've seen so far.
[2013-07-11 19:01:49 -0400] retr0h: i still want to add healthcheck urls inot the API services
[2013-07-11 19:02:15 -0400] retr0h: let my load balancer query a route, that performs some sanity and returns 200 OK or not
[2013-07-11 19:02:25 -0400] retr0h: vs a dumb port / check
[2013-07-11 19:02:36 -0400] spheromak: I would love to see a metadata standard on API's. Shit even just a supports & version calls
[2013-07-11 19:02:59 -0400] retr0h: well as soon as i can get out of chef deployment hell i can get bcak to coding nova
[2013-07-11 19:03:01 -0400] spheromak: yea were doing some stuff in haproxy with a patch to some of the api's so that we can do requests throught the stack
[2013-07-11 19:03:09 -0400] retr0h: which is what i been wnaging to do all along :)
[2013-07-11 19:03:14 -0400] spheromak: ah lol
[2013-07-11 19:04:02 -0400] retr0h: i can code ruby... i used to have a full time ruby job for many many years.. but i rather not if i dont have to :P
[2013-07-11 19:04:53 -0400] spheromak: so why python, I don't have a pref for either really

[2013-07-11 19:08:38 -0400] spheromak: swiftproxy ;P *but thats swift*

[2013-07-11 19:09:48 -0400] retr0h: or hopefully they already have more elsewhere
[2013-07-11 19:09:48 -0400] retr0h: :)
[2013-07-11 19:09:53 -0400] spheromak: :)
[2013-07-11 19:10:16 -0400] retr0h: spheromak: u in the US or do u actually work out of K?
[2013-07-11 19:10:29 -0400] spheromak: Im in the US, but i spend a decent amount of time in Seoul
[2013-07-11 19:10:49 -0400] retr0h: very cool
[2013-07-11 19:11:06 -0400] spheromak: cool for a while ;P  sorta rather either be there or be here.
[2013-07-11 19:11:25 -0400] spheromak: last year i was 1/2 time over there and that was really difficult
[2013-07-11 19:11:26 -0400] retr0h: ya going to hk?
[2013-07-11 19:11:31 -0400] retr0h: i bet
[2013-07-11 19:11:57 -0400] spheromak: I am sure KT will send people there I dunno If I will be. Would prob have to piggy-back a trip to Seoul, and then to HK
[2013-07-11 19:12:08 -0400] retr0h: ahhhh
[2013-07-11 19:12:14 -0400] retr0h: yah not sure if we going.. :/
[2013-07-11 19:12:53 -0400] spheromak: Just hired another Xpat, hes in seoul now full time I am sure he will want to go  :)
[2013-07-11 19:15:14 -0400] retr0h: hehehe
[2013-07-11 19:36:59 -0400] spheromak: jaypipes, retr0h is there an easy way for me to get at these patches from gerrit ?
[2013-07-11 19:37:38 -0400] spheromak: i need to play with gerrit more.  It's its own repo right, I should be able to see the commits there and fetch the refs and merge to local
[2013-07-11 19:37:40 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: git review -d <PATCH_NUM>
[2013-07-11 19:37:48 -0400] spheromak: I need to setup the remotes
[2013-07-11 19:37:55 -0400] spheromak: and RTFM
[2013-07-11 19:38:01 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: git review -s will set you up
[2013-07-11 19:38:08 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: then git review -d <PATCHNUM>
[2013-07-11 19:38:20 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: will bring the patch branch down to your local workstation
[2013-07-11 19:38:26 -0400] spheromak: nice cool thanks
[2013-07-11 19:38:41 -0400] spheromak: doing a review day, if you haven't noticed

[2013-07-11 21:17:22 -0400] alop: wtf

[2013-07-11 21:20:47 -0400] alop: sorry for the noise
[2013-07-11 21:42:50 -0400] spheromak: I question the default policy to set packages to upgrade.
[2013-07-11 21:43:16 -0400] alop: yeah, there's like, two schools of thought on that
[2013-07-11 21:43:29 -0400] alop: and both have valid points and concerns
[2013-07-11 21:43:33 -0400] spheromak: agreed
[2013-07-11 21:44:05 -0400] spheromak: If you run your own repos and amange version sthere then its a fine policy ;)
[2013-07-11 21:45:01 -0400] spheromak:  Just looking at that nfs patch, and I know that on some distros and at certain nfs updates. upgrading nfs packages without a kernel upgrade caused funky behavior on hosts
[2013-07-11 21:45:32 -0400] spheromak: Wondering what we could do to make this a selector
[2013-07-11 21:46:04 -0400] spheromak: other than a big  hash of package versions and an attrib to set the action
[2013-07-11 21:46:43 -0400] spheromak: you could argue that a wrapper for the service could manage the  upgrade, and that we should be concerned with only getting the thing setup and running.
[2013-07-11 21:47:15 -0400] spheromak: I could also say that if you were that concenred about it you could use rewind to make sure the package resources never upgrade ;)
[2013-07-11 21:48:15 -0400] mattray: I had a patch for managing all the openstack packages and one of the attributes was whether or not to use :install or :upgrade
[2013-07-11 21:48:24 -0400] mattray: probably worthwhile making that an attribute?
[2013-07-11 21:48:33 -0400] spheromak: yea I think thats a minimal impact change
[2013-07-11 21:48:42 -0400] spheromak: that makes it easy for local opinions
[2013-07-11 21:48:53 -0400] alop: daring vs caution
[2013-07-11 21:49:05 -0400] mattray: ie. node['openstack']['packages']['install'] = :install
[2013-07-11 21:49:16 -0400] mattray: node['openstack']['packages']['install'] = :upgrade
[2013-07-11 21:49:18 -0400] spheromak: action
[2013-07-11 21:49:22 -0400] spheromak: yea
[2013-07-11 21:49:24 -0400] mattray: yeah
[2013-07-11 21:49:29 -0400] mattray: just typing as I think :)
[2013-07-11 21:49:34 -0400] spheromak: yup yup
[2013-07-11 21:49:36 -0400] mattray: node['openstack']['packages']['action'] = :install

[2013-07-11 21:51:37 -0400] spheromak: or have someone take a shot at it
