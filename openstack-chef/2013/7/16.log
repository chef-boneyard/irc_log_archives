[2013-07-16 21:11:46 -0400] ctracey: does anyone else feel like standing these environments up is an exercise in extreme patience? :)
[2013-07-16 21:13:29 -0400] ctracey: i cannot imagine doing this without CM

[2013-07-16 21:50:08 -0400] ctracey: does anyone have thoughts about adding a generic mechanism for "unsupported" config options?
[2013-07-16 21:51:20 -0400] ctracey: a pattern i have used elsewhere is to accept a hash of key => value and expand that in said template
[2013-07-16 21:52:03 -0400] ctracey: im thinking of options that I want, which are probably pretty non-standard, and/or situations where we havent implemented them yet.
[2013-07-16 21:52:20 -0400] ctracey: this might be good for unblocking users...thoughts?
