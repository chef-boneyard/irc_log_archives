[2013-07-01 03:08:53 -0400] spheromak: jaypipes, HAving fun with vagabond ? :D
[2013-07-01 03:09:09 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: I am... slowly getting through it...
[2013-07-01 03:09:18 -0400] spheromak: yea lots of rough edges
[2013-07-01 03:09:58 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: better than vagrant at least.
[2013-07-01 03:10:38 -0400] spheromak: yea well i've been using vagrant-chef-zero
[2013-07-01 03:11:01 -0400] spheromak: mostly cause ties easier for our devs, but the jenkins instances I'm using vagabond
[2013-07-01 03:11:08 -0400] spheromak: *cause
[2013-07-01 03:11:29 -0400] spheromak: curious about vagrant-lxc
[2013-07-01 03:11:45 -0400] spheromak: but yea I think vagabond has the best potential for infra testing
[2013-07-01 03:19:16 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: agreed.
[2013-07-01 12:11:53 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity: Removed the use of non-standard ohai plugin  https://review.openstack.org/34943
[2013-07-01 13:13:58 -0400] spheromak: you guys think its reasonable to lock version reps on the metadata to a ~>  loose enough to dev against, but will prevent things from going awry if something is changed upstream (apt etc etc) ?
[2013-07-01 13:14:38 -0400] spheromak: I see locks in berks files, but I rather see that @ the cookbook level as then we can have multiple versions, on a server and ensure various cooks will get the versions of whatever they need
