[2013-07-03 08:04:55 -0400] spheromak: actually just staring all the stackfoge up in local dev right now.

[2013-07-03 14:06:30 -0400] mattt: any reason why not all roles get uploaded to chef server via spiceweasel?
[2013-07-03 14:06:59 -0400] mattt: (allinone-compute as an example)
[2013-07-03 15:15:45 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: still here?
[2013-07-03 15:15:56 -0400] mattt: jaypipes: yep, still here!
[2013-07-03 15:16:11 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: if you are referring to the openstack-chef-repo reference repo on stackforge, I think it's just an oversight...
[2013-07-03 15:16:25 -0400] mattt: jaypipes: that's the repo i'm referring to
[2013-07-03 15:16:48 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: we've been looking at using vagabond instead of vagrant recently, which would completely remove the need for spiceweasel or any infrastructure.yml file, for that matter
[2013-07-03 15:16:58 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: so, likely just an oversighty...
[2013-07-03 15:17:26 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: if you wouldn't mind taking a gander at https://review.openstack.org/#/c/35234/, I'd really appreciate some feedback
[2013-07-03 15:19:46 -0400] mattt: jaypipes: happy to have a look, may take me a while to get through it tho :P
[2013-07-03 15:20:15 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: no worries at all.
[2013-07-03 15:20:39 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: we're in the early stages of integration testing all the cookbooks and recipes and just want some eyes on the approach
[2013-07-03 15:22:37 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: ping!
[2013-07-03 15:22:57 -0400] iartarisi: jaypipes: I was just answering your comment now :)
[2013-07-03 15:23:04 -0400] jaypipes: hehe, ok :)
[2013-07-03 15:23:16 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: lemme get alex in this channel.. one sec
[2013-07-03 15:23:30 -0400] jaypipes: ah, he's not up yet...
[2013-07-03 15:26:50 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: also, see my latest comment on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/34931/... I disagree with you (respectfully of course!)
[2013-07-03 15:27:46 -0400] iartarisi: :)
[2013-07-03 15:29:34 -0400] iartarisi: answered both now
[2013-07-03 15:29:52 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: cool, thx :)
[2013-07-03 15:30:21 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: so were you on holiday recently? we've been missing our buddy Yaw-newtz :)
[2013-07-03 15:30:35 -0400] iartarisi: haha, no, I was trying to work on some other bugs
[2013-07-03 15:30:56 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: what?! there's something more important than OpenStack and Chef?!
[2013-07-03 15:30:58 -0400] jaypipes: :P
[2013-07-03 15:31:16 -0400] iartarisi: actually I'm working on other bugs right now, too, but I keep running into issues with the cookbooks :P
[2013-07-03 15:32:04 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: yes, indeed, me too...
[2013-07-03 15:32:39 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: which is why retr0h and I have been pushing so many fixes recently... we've run into one thing after another trying to get Vagabond to spin up a simple cluster using the openstack-chef-repo
[2013-07-03 15:32:49 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: as we find bugs, we push fixes... but it's slow going
[2013-07-03 15:35:51 -0400] mattt: jaypipes: hey there, any reason some of these cookbooks are commented out?  https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo/blob/master/Berksfile
[2013-07-03 15:37:08 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/35234/2/Berksfile uncomments all but the metering one, which isn't ready.
[2013-07-03 15:37:40 -0400] iartarisi: jaypipes: ah, cool, I didn't know about Vagabond
[2013-07-03 15:39:25 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: Vagrant was just too painful to work with...
[2013-07-03 15:39:29 -0400] jaypipes: WAY too slow.
[2013-07-03 15:43:11 -0400] iartarisi: but Vagabond sure looks intriguing
[2013-07-03 15:44:27 -0400] mattt: jaypipes: thanks!  think you answered my next question  was getting constraint errors but updated versions as per that diff and seem to be moving along now
[2013-07-03 15:45:39 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: indeed. make sure you are using Berkshelf 2.0.3 or above. Before that version git or github-referenced cookbook sources don't get git pull'd when you do a berks update or berks install...
[2013-07-03 15:46:13 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: something that took me hours to figure out ;) figured i'd save you the trouble.
[2013-07-03 15:47:07 -0400] mattt: jaypipes: ah, i'm using 1.4.6, which i think just got pulled in by spiceweasel
[2013-07-03 15:47:44 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: ya, you'll note the Gemfile in that patchset above ups it to 2.0.3
[2013-07-03 15:48:10 -0400] jaypipes: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/35234/2/Gemfile
[2013-07-03 16:25:16 -0400] mattt: jaypipes: do you have a sample environment file i can reference?
[2013-07-03 16:25:25 -0400] mattt: (one more extensive than what's included in that repo)
[2013-07-03 16:26:06 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/35234/2/environments/testing.rb is all I've got so far...
[2013-07-03 16:26:42 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: slowly working through shit to get that environment file into a working condition...
[2013-07-03 16:37:39 -0400] mattt: jaypipes: k, hitting some other unrelated issues then, working through it now
[2013-07-03 16:37:49 -0400] mattt: (probably user error btw)
[2013-07-03 16:38:14 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: well, lemme know what the issues are... I've likely already run into em ;)
[2013-07-03 16:39:25 -0400] mattt: jaypipes: things like openstack-image/recipes/api.rb:143, is host supposed to be in attributes?
[2013-07-03 16:39:35 -0400] mattt: :rabbit_ipaddress => rabbit_info["host"],    #FIXME!
[2013-07-03 16:40:39 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: one sec, checking
[2013-07-03 16:41:04 -0400] mattt: thanks jaypipes
[2013-07-03 16:44:06 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: interesting... it looks from https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-ops-messaging/blob/master/recipes/rabbitmq-server.rb#L37 that rabbit_info is looking for an attribute node["openstack"]["queue"]["host"]
[2013-07-03 16:44:26 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: add that attribute value as 10.0.3.10 in that environments/testing.rb file
[2013-07-03 16:44:44 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: and then bundle exec vagabond server upload_environments && bundle exec vagabond up ops
[2013-07-03 16:45:04 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: I will push a fix to that proposed changeset. nice catch.
[2013-07-03 16:45:33 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: unfrtounately, I've been testing both on the openstack-chef-repo as well as AT&T's production chef-repo... slightly different environment files in each. sorry about this.
[2013-07-03 16:47:54 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: k, pushed a new testing.rb environment definition: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/35234/3/environments/testing.rb
[2013-07-03 16:48:04 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: line 43 - 45 is what I added
[2013-07-03 16:50:39 -0400] mattt: jaypipes: no worries, and trying that now
[2013-07-03 16:52:11 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: just checked on my localhost, and success:
[2013-07-03 16:52:12 -0400] jaypipes: 10.0.3.10 Chef Client failed. 7 resources updated
[2013-07-03 16:52:12 -0400] jaypipes:   -> PROVISIONED
[2013-07-03 16:52:27 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: when I do vagabond up ops
[2013-07-03 16:53:01 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: lol, not success I guess :(
[2013-07-03 16:53:12 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: I get this: [2013-07-03T16:51:46+00:00] FATAL: rabbitmq_user with action :add requires a non-nil/empty password.
[2013-07-03 16:53:50 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: lemme see what needs to be added to the environment file for that.... I think it's node["rabbitmq"]["password"], but double-checking
[2013-07-03 16:54:07 -0400] mattt: jaypipes: i'm not sure that queue definition is correct
[2013-07-03 16:54:21 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: which one?
[2013-07-03 16:54:30 -0400] mattt: jaypipes: in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/35234/3/environments/testing.rb
[2013-07-03 16:54:46 -0400] mattt: jaypipes: i think it looks for [queue][host], not [openstack][queue][host]
[2013-07-03 16:54:59 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: ah... yes. you are correct. my bad :(
[2013-07-03 16:55:40 -0400] mattt: heading out for the evening (UK here), will have another bash at this tomorrow
[2013-07-03 16:55:48 -0400] mattt: thanks for your help thus far jaypipes
[2013-07-03 16:56:34 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: no worries, have a great night!
[2013-07-03 16:56:40 -0400] mattt: later!
[2013-07-03 16:56:44 -0400] jaypipes: mattt: check for updates on that patch tomorrow
