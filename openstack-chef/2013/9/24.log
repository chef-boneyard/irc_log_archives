[2013-09-24 14:15:03 -0400] kbringard: mattray: ping
[2013-09-24 14:15:10 -0400] mattray: morning
[2013-09-24 14:15:17 -0400] kbringard: howdy
[2013-09-24 14:15:19 -0400] kbringard: how are you my man?
[2013-09-24 14:15:45 -0400] kbringard: I have a very silly question, but I googled for a bit and I guess I've just not had enough coffee yet
[2013-09-24 14:16:05 -0400] kbringard: can you use both a not_if and an only_if in the same block?
[2013-09-24 14:16:43 -0400] kbringard: so like execute "blah" do \n command "blah blah" \n action :run \n not_if "some condition" \n only_if some other condition \n end
[2013-09-24 14:16:47 -0400] mattray: my initial reaction is yes
[2013-09-24 14:17:09 -0400] kbringard: sorry, I didn't mean to make you do the work for me, heh
[2013-09-24 14:18:09 -0400] mattray: I don't see any examples with that, but it seems like it should
[2013-09-24 14:18:24 -0400] mattray: because really it's just saying CONDITION AND CONDITION
[2013-09-24 14:18:24 -0400] kbringard: okie, I'll see if I can find somewhere to test it before I push up a review
[2013-09-24 14:18:32 -0400] kbringard: right, that's what I thought
[2013-09-24 14:18:40 -0400] mattray: and if either is false, it doesn't happen
[2013-09-24 14:18:53 -0400] kbringard: would you imagine the syntax would be to just put them as autonomous checks on separate lines, or should I and them together?
[2013-09-24 14:19:36 -0400] kbringard: I'm asking because, I'm looking at the ovs stuff in the l3_agent.rb
[2013-09-24 14:19:51 -0400] kbringard: https://gist.github.com/kevinbringard/6685486
[2013-09-24 14:20:15 -0400] kbringard: the issue is, the ovs-vsctl add-port command just modifies the OVS DB directly
[2013-09-24 14:20:28 -0400] kbringard: so even if the interface doesn't exist, it'll dutifully add it and move on
[2013-09-24 14:21:04 -0400] kbringard: everything *looks* right, but traffic won't hit the wire and it's a beach to troubleshoot unless you've seen it before
[2013-09-24 14:21:26 -0400] kbringard: so anyway, neither here nor there, easy to validate, but just wanted to make sure the way I'm validating would work
[2013-09-24 14:51:08 -0400] mattray: kbringard: putting them together in a single conditional with multiple components seems to make more sense, but either way should be fine
[2013-09-24 14:52:15 -0400] kbringard: cool, I'll do that, thanks for the tip
[2013-09-24 15:00:32 -0400] retr0h: kbringard: you can use only_if and not_if
[2013-09-24 15:02:55 -0400] retr0h: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute/blob/master/recipes/nova-setup.rb#L126
[2013-09-24 15:09:47 -0400] kbringard: retr0h: rad, thanks :-)

[2013-09-24 19:07:53 -0400] lbragstad: hey all, quick question. When using the allinone.rb role from openstack-chef-repo, openstack-networking didn't seem to install properly. So I went to the read me and one of the requirements was to have openstack-common 2.0.0 but https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/metadata.rb#L7 says it is at 0.4.3 after a clean pull?
[2013-09-24 19:25:13 -0400] mattray: not sure where the 2.0.0 comes from, pretty sure 0.4.3 is the latest
[2013-09-24 19:50:12 -0400] lbragstad: mattray: ok, good to know
