[2013-10-21 09:14:27 -0400] bluenemo: hi guys. i work for a german ISP and we want to experiment with openstack. i setup the ubuntu cloud live stick and the devstack installer (both of them work more or less). i used a single node for both. Now i want to get into some real stuff and deploy openstack with chef to 4 rack server machines. I noticed there are multiple recepies to choose from: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Get_OpenStack I was going for ubuntu 12.04 if possible
[2013-10-21 09:14:27 -0400] bluenemo: with grizzly, what recepie collection would you advise? i have some idea about chef, some idea about openstack, but just starting.
[2013-10-21 09:18:11 -0400] bluenemo: I think i'll start with this one as its commits are most recent: https://github.com/rcbops/chef-cookbooks
[2013-10-21 09:29:33 -0400] s2r2: bluenemo: check out stackforge's cookbooks
[2013-10-21 09:29:53 -0400] s2r2: (url in topic)
[2013-10-21 09:30:33 -0400] s2r2: stackforge => using the openstack infrastructure for code review (and yay! there is code review)
[2013-10-21 09:34:37 -0400] s2r2: talking about cookbook quality, I recently tried a multi-node setup using vagrant with the stackforge cookbooks and, well, it works fine ;)
[2013-10-21 09:56:50 -0400] bluenemo: s2r2, thank you, i'll get into that. i'll be hanging out here from now on for that :) nice to meet you guys :)
[2013-10-21 09:57:23 -0400] s2r2: :)  the more the merrier
[2013-10-21 09:57:29 -0400] bluenemo: ;)
[2013-10-21 14:19:06 -0400] bluenemo: i'm running into an issue thats related to my very basic chef knowledge, but i cant seem to find the fix :( hope you can help: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/b8a90850/
[2013-10-21 14:20:41 -0400] mattray: bluenemo: you need to upload the openstack-object-storage cookbook
[2013-10-21 14:22:16 -0400] bluenemo: ah ;) thank you mattray ;) i'm making progress :)
[2013-10-21 14:26:47 -0400] bluenemo: mattray, stupid question, I understood https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo that spiceweasel would do that?
[2013-10-21 14:27:17 -0400] bluenemo: or do i need to upload it to the client first?
[2013-10-21 14:40:44 -0400] mattray: bluenemo: the spiceweasel call should call berkshelf which will upload all the dependencies
[2013-10-21 14:41:08 -0400] mattray: spiceweasel -e infrastructure.yml
[2013-10-21 14:43:19 -0400] bluenemo: mattray, i did that, it worked. i'm sure the error is sth stupid that i dont see... another paste: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/bf80fe82/
[2013-10-21 14:43:50 -0400] bluenemo: showing how i added the role and uploaded the cookbook (again, spiceweasel did that correctly before, just to show that the management workstation did a chef cookbook upload -a)
[2013-10-21 14:44:04 -0400] mattray: bluenemo: knife cookbook upload -a doesn't do anything when you're using berkshelf
[2013-10-21 14:44:33 -0400] mattray: berks upload
[2013-10-21 14:44:56 -0400] mattray: berks upload openstack-object-storage
[2013-10-21 14:44:57 -0400] bluenemo: mattray, aaaah i c ;) last time i've used chef is about 3 years ago or so ;) didnt every deploy openstack that way either. thanks, i'll try that :)
[2013-10-21 14:45:07 -0400] mattray: yeah, berkshelf changes things up a bit
[2013-10-21 14:45:24 -0400] bluenemo: upload just means upload the files, dont apply anything right?
[2013-10-21 14:45:30 -0400] bluenemo: this is still the role thing right :D ?
[2013-10-21 14:46:41 -0400] mattray: upload puts them on the chef-server
[2013-10-21 14:47:01 -0400] mattray: when the chef-client runs on a node that has that in their run list, the node downloads it
[2013-10-21 14:51:51 -0400] bluenemo: ah ok i still know that correctly. thank you :)
[2013-10-21 14:52:47 -0400] bluenemo: hmpf. still doesnt like me :( same error.. strange
[2013-10-21 14:52:56 -0400] bluenemo: berks completed happily
[2013-10-21 14:53:18 -0400] bluenemo: should this: Run List:    role[os-object-storage] be openstack-object-store..?
[2013-10-21 14:59:27 -0400] bluenemo: hm no that triggers this error (using openstack-object-storage as role name with knife node role_add blunix role[openstack-object-storage]: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/5ca6fad1/ @ mattray (if you still have time)
[2013-10-21 15:03:02 -0400] bluenemo: hm. i'll have to google that up deeper I guess. i'll go home now :) cu tomorrow guys :) looking forward to hanging with you the next few days / weeks :)
[2013-10-21 15:10:29 -0400] mattray: the object storage stuff isn't covered by the allinone, so it's possible the roles haven't been vetted thoroughly
[2013-10-21 16:46:39 -0400] mattray: anyone know the default user/pass combination for the dashboard it's a developer build?
[2013-10-21 16:46:48 -0400] mattray: ie. for the vagrant build?
[2013-10-21 18:35:24 -0400] paulczar: mattray:  admin / secrete
[2013-10-21 18:42:15 -0400] mattray: meh, not working but this build had other issues
[2013-10-21 18:51:21 -0400] galstrom: mattray: admin/admin
[2013-10-21 18:52:21 -0400] mattray: galstrom: winner!
[2013-10-21 18:52:47 -0400] galstrom: :)
[2013-10-21 18:53:08 -0400] mattray: confirmed that my network isn't working :)
[2013-10-21 18:53:14 -0400] mattray: for vms
