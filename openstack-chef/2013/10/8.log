[2013-10-08 17:39:27 -0400] ctracey: yo
[2013-10-08 17:47:28 -0400] kbringard: hello
[2013-10-08 19:34:08 -0400] ctracey: so do we have a plan for havana support?
[2013-10-08 21:22:36 -0400] mattray: ctracey: regarding Havana support, I think we start an email thread
[2013-10-08 21:22:52 -0400] ctracey: yeah...sounds good
[2013-10-08 21:22:54 -0400] mattray: but essentially I proposed we move master -> "grizzly"
[2013-10-08 21:23:00 -0400] mattray: and master becomes Havana
[2013-10-08 21:23:03 -0400] kbringard: ^^
[2013-10-08 21:23:09 -0400] kbringard: was just typing almost that exact thing :-0
[2013-10-08 21:23:13 -0400] ctracey: i just tried converging some stuff and it fails
[2013-10-08 21:23:49 -0400] ctracey: might be a bit late but it would be nice to have it for HK
[2013-10-08 21:23:59 -0400] mattray: as things get a little more stable and we get more developers on the project, I expect to get an Icehouse branch going sooner in the release cycle
[2013-10-08 21:24:16 -0400] ctracey: yeah
[2013-10-08 21:24:26 -0400] mattray: not myself, but a large company who is commiting lots of resources to Icehouse
[2013-10-08 21:24:55 -0400] ctracey: maybe we should track close to some of the RC candidates/milestones
[2013-10-08 21:25:08 -0400] mattray: most of us are deployers as opposed to active developers, so we haven't been as caught up on the milestones
[2013-10-08 21:25:13 -0400] mattray: but that's changing most likely
[2013-10-08 21:25:34 -0400] mattray: I know Rackspace and Dell have followed trunk more closely
[2013-10-08 21:25:40 -0400] ctracey: will code for $$$ :)
[2013-10-08 21:27:09 -0400] ctracey: i could be employee 3,864,921
[2013-10-08 21:28:19 -0400] ctracey: i kid
[2013-10-08 21:30:42 -0400] ctracey: but seriously...think ill start looking at the differences
[2013-10-08 21:30:52 -0400] ctracey: would be nice to have *something* for HK
[2013-10-08 21:30:53 -0400] ctracey: and...
[2013-10-08 21:31:09 -0400] ctracey: i kinda need it for this docker experiment
[2013-10-08 21:31:57 -0400] ctracey: im kinda confused by this though...didnt realize ubuntu is shipping havana packages
[2013-10-08 21:32:03 -0400] ctracey: or maybe i am just dreaming
[2013-10-08 21:33:33 -0400] mattray: did they just drop havana packages in the same places?
[2013-10-08 21:33:46 -0400] mattray: I mean, if I apt-get upgrade a box will it go grizzly->havana?
[2013-10-08 21:33:54 -0400] mattray: because that would suck
[2013-10-08 21:34:04 -0400] ctracey: i think i am wrong
[2013-10-08 21:34:13 -0400] ctracey: not sure why i thought that
[2013-10-08 21:34:32 -0400] mattray: I'm fighting with distro mysql issues now, I'm thinking about blowing off mysql for going straight mariadb from mariadb.org
[2013-10-08 21:34:44 -0400] mattray: or postgres
[2013-10-08 21:34:52 -0400] ctracey: oh god
[2013-10-08 21:35:00 -0400] ctracey: dont get me started on mysql packages
[2013-10-08 21:35:04 -0400] ctracey: centos?
[2013-10-08 21:35:14 -0400] mattray: ubuntu
[2013-10-08 21:35:20 -0400] ctracey: heh
[2013-10-08 21:35:42 -0400] mattray: I want to get to CentOS 6.4 eventually, but have to fight through everything else first
[2013-10-08 21:35:46 -0400] ctracey: if it makes you feel any better, i think the rhel/centos story around mysql packages is pretty miserable
[2013-10-08 21:35:56 -0400] mattray: as I would expect
[2013-10-08 21:36:10 -0400] mattray: I'm thinking I should be going upstream for everything
[2013-10-08 21:36:10 -0400] ctracey: have you considered the percona packages?
[2013-10-08 21:36:20 -0400] mattray: I think mari
[2013-10-08 21:36:31 -0400] mattray: mariadb is what the distros are moving too
[2013-10-08 21:36:47 -0400] ctracey: from recollection they tend to be better if you require mysql
[2013-10-08 21:37:15 -0400] ctracey: *cough* omnibus *cough*
[2013-10-08 21:37:19 -0400] mattray: well I know we want to go to postgresql eventually
[2013-10-08 21:37:26 -0400] mattray: right
