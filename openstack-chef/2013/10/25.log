[2013-10-25 15:09:45 -0400] mattray: anyone around familiar with the endpoint setups?
[2013-10-25 15:09:53 -0400] mattray: retr0h: ?
[2013-10-25 15:10:05 -0400] mattray: at&t folks?
[2013-10-25 15:10:25 -0400] mattray: I want to use the bind_interface but it seems to expect it to be set externally
[2013-10-25 15:56:07 -0400] x86brandon: are there any example databags for the DB credentials? seems to be missing and the recipes for DB set up call for it
[2013-10-25 16:01:12 -0400] x86brandon: throwing the error:  http://paste.openstack.org/show/49723/
[2013-10-25 16:08:05 -0400] mattray: x86brandon: that's on my todo list for documentation, I'm currently just setting up as developer = true
[2013-10-25 16:08:28 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo/blob/master/environments/vagrant.json#L21
[2013-10-25 16:08:32 -0400] mattray: developer_mode
[2013-10-25 16:29:39 -0400] x86brandon: ahh
[2013-10-25 16:29:40 -0400] x86brandon: thanks
[2013-10-25 16:30:08 -0400] x86brandon: dumb question, but chef client caches the environment file right?
[2013-10-25 16:30:49 -0400] mattray: probably somewhere
[2013-10-25 16:31:06 -0400] mattray: nope
[2013-10-25 16:31:30 -0400] mattray: environment is a json hash passed down the wire when the chef-client runs
[2013-10-25 16:34:03 -0400] x86brandon: agh, then it's still thrown that error even after changing to developer=true
[2013-10-25 16:35:05 -0400] mattray: yay, stickers on the way for the Hong Kong summit
[2013-10-25 16:35:19 -0400] mattray: x86brandon: what error?
[2013-10-25 16:38:33 -0400] x86brandon: same as above
[2013-10-25 16:41:22 -0400] mattray: node["openstack"]["developer_mode"] is set?
[2013-10-25 16:41:30 -0400] x86brandon: yes
[2013-10-25 16:41:33 -0400] mattray: true, not 'true'?
[2013-10-25 16:41:45 -0400] x86brandon: true
[2013-10-25 16:42:00 -0400] x86brandon: exactly like in the vagrant.json
[2013-10-25 16:42:11 -0400] x86brandon: that's why i asked about the caching, almost like my changes did nothing :)
[2013-10-25 16:42:13 -0400] mattray: here's my current environment
[2013-10-25 16:42:14 -0400] mattray: https://gist.github.com/7157741
[2013-10-25 16:42:17 -0400] x86brandon: and yes, i re-uploaded the json
[2013-10-25 16:42:53 -0400] mattray: knife environment show foo
[2013-10-25 16:43:03 -0400] mattray: and you should see the setting
[2013-10-25 16:43:21 -0400] x86brandon: override_attributes:
[2013-10-25 16:43:21 -0400] x86brandon:   developer_mode:    true
[2013-10-25 16:43:27 -0400] mattray: also be warned, the database gets wedged real easy
[2013-10-25 16:43:37 -0400] mattray: if the install fails the first time
[2013-10-25 16:43:58 -0400] mattray: I tend to recycle machines frequently rather than try to unstick them
[2013-10-25 16:44:00 -0400] x86brandon: looks like that still has my old json file
[2013-10-25 16:44:04 -0400] alop: x86brandon: long time!
[2013-10-25 16:44:13 -0400] x86brandon: hey abel :)
[2013-10-25 16:54:03 -0400] x86brandon: now getting an undefined method for nil class error
[2013-10-25 16:54:04 -0400] x86brandon: http://paste.openstack.org/show/49733/
[2013-10-25 16:54:49 -0400] mattray: hmmm I know that one
[2013-10-25 16:56:18 -0400] mattray: x86brandon: 'identity_service_chef_role' => 'allinone-compute',
[2013-10-25 16:56:30 -0400] mattray: I think I submitted a patch to make that smarter
[2013-10-25 16:56:44 -0400] mattray: to expand the run list and look for roles, I think it merged recently
[2013-10-25 16:57:18 -0400] x86brandon: that's defined
[2013-10-25 16:58:28 -0400] mattray: under compute?
[2013-10-25 16:58:36 -0400] x86brandon: yar
[2013-10-25 16:59:08 -0400] mattray: x86brandon: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/53234/
[2013-10-25 16:59:14 -0400] mattray: heh, I've got my patch
[2013-10-25 16:59:37 -0400] mattray: or +1 my patch :)
[2013-10-25 16:59:47 -0400] x86brandon: err
[2013-10-25 16:59:57 -0400] x86brandon: just chef search
[2013-10-25 17:00:03 -0400] mattray: x86brandon: sounds like you and I are on very similar paths right now
[2013-10-25 17:00:05 -0400] x86brandon: not *my* chef search
[2013-10-25 17:00:14 -0400] mattray: I'm moving the vagrant to a single box, then to multi-box
[2013-10-25 17:00:27 -0400] x86brandon: i'm just flirting with stack forge recipes right now on multi-box
[2013-10-25 17:00:28 -0400] mattray: so keep pinging me as you have issues, I bet I'm patching them as I find them
[2013-10-25 17:00:45 -0400] mattray: well, I'm a little more commited :)
[2013-10-25 17:00:47 -0400] x86brandon: have used/use RBC ones in the past
[2013-10-25 17:00:56 -0400] x86brandon: RCB even
[2013-10-25 17:01:11 -0400] mattray: hopefully the rcb ones will merge over
[2013-10-25 17:01:22 -0400] x86brandon: have also used much less chef-like ones i wrote a while ago that don't use chef search, overrides or anything fun
[2013-10-25 17:02:54 -0400] mattray: yeah, I'm trying to make these more bullet-proof and document as I go
[2013-10-25 17:03:05 -0400] x86brandon: oh, that nil value one was a newbie mistake on my part
[2013-10-25 17:03:08 -0400] mattray: http://docs.opscode.com/openstack.html
[2013-10-25 17:03:16 -0400] x86brandon: if you define a role, your controller better actually be that role
[2013-10-25 17:03:26 -0400] x86brandon: i was using single-controller, not all in one
[2013-10-25 17:03:27 -0400] x86brandon: lol
[2013-10-25 17:03:28 -0400] mattray: x86brandon: yeah, that's what the patch fixes
[2013-10-25 17:03:38 -0400] mattray: the patch searches the expanded run list
[2013-10-25 17:03:58 -0400] mattray: well that still would have failed
[2013-10-25 17:04:23 -0400] mattray: I'm using allinone and searching on single-controller I think
[2013-10-25 17:05:37 -0400] x86brandon: agh, i'm running the controller on a VM so i can reload it quicker when i eff it up :-p
[2013-10-25 17:07:44 -0400] mattray: I've got some sad hardware
[2013-10-25 17:07:54 -0400] mattray: full blown allinone on vbox is 700 seconds
[2013-10-25 17:08:09 -0400] mattray: full blown on my crappy Lenovo boxes is 800 seconds
[2013-10-25 17:08:18 -0400] mattray: my i7 is 300 seconds
[2013-10-25 17:10:34 -0400] alop: so, using the stackforge books, has anyone used glance-cache-manage ?
[2013-10-25 17:14:41 -0400] openstackgerrit: Matt Ray proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: removed duplicate 'quantum-server' services.  https://review.openstack.org/53911
[2013-10-25 17:16:26 -0400] x86brandon: the quantum stuff seems to need some work >.<
[2013-10-25 17:16:32 -0400] x86brandon: it didn't create the user accounts
[2013-10-25 17:17:51 -0400] x86brandon: seems to be trying to use quantum, despite my desire to
[2013-10-25 17:20:30 -0400] x86brandon: http://paste.openstack.org/show/49737/
[2013-10-25 17:22:35 -0400] x86brandon: oh, heh... it's all for grizzly, not havana right?
[2013-10-25 17:22:50 -0400] x86brandon: should all be neutron... not quantum?
[2013-10-25 17:22:51 -0400] mattray: yes
[2013-10-25 17:23:02 -0400] x86brandon: hrmm
[2013-10-25 17:23:11 -0400] mattray: master is still grizzly, I've got a half-written email to the ML about starting up Havana
[2013-10-25 17:23:18 -0400] x86brandon: jeez, i only pulled these down last night
[2013-10-25 17:23:24 -0400] x86brandon: ahh
[2013-10-25 17:23:32 -0400] x86brandon: derp
[2013-10-25 17:24:13 -0400] x86brandon: and default is to use neutron and not the old style nova networks, or was that deprecated totally out of havana?
[2013-10-25 17:32:45 -0400] mattray: in the StackForge cookbooks the default is openvswitch with quantum, at least as I'm pushing
[2013-10-25 18:42:30 -0400] wkelly: nova network is still in havana, out in icehouse, I think
[2013-10-25 18:42:57 -0400] wkelly: they are suggesting neutron with the linux bridge plugin as the closest replacement to straight nova network behavior
[2013-10-25 18:43:06 -0400] wkelly: also, how's it going, x86brandon? :P
[2013-10-25 18:49:59 -0400] x86brandon: hi mr kelly :)
[2013-10-25 18:50:01 -0400] x86brandon: it goes
[2013-10-25 18:50:36 -0400] x86brandon: hurry up and merge havana stack forge into master :-p
[2013-10-25 18:50:46 -0400] x86brandon: i noticed you did it with RCB stuff :)
[2013-10-25 18:53:16 -0400] x86brandon: how is life in texas?
[2013-10-25 18:53:24 -0400] x86brandon: are you going to hong kong?
[2013-10-25 19:08:11 -0400] wkelly: sorry!  We are moving desks today -- I am in and out
[2013-10-25 19:08:19 -0400] wkelly: I will not be in hong kong, and life in texas is good
[2013-10-25 19:09:25 -0400] wkelly: what about you?  Going to be in hong kong?
[2013-10-25 19:26:43 -0400] gzc: so, anyone using stackforge's repos or is there a 'preferred' chef repo for doing this? :)
[2013-10-25 19:27:20 -0400] kbringard: stackforge is what I use and contribute to
[2013-10-25 19:27:55 -0400] gzc: nice, that's where hippiehacker pointed me
[2013-10-25 19:28:12 -0400] gzc: is there a good set of docs to look at for doing a multinode deployment?
[2013-10-25 19:28:45 -0400] gzc: I'm at the stage where I'm tying Razor tags to nodes, just trying to figure out what roles to attach where and possibly how I should configure my chef environment
[2013-10-25 19:31:34 -0400] kbringard: unfortunately I'm not sure where to point you there aside from checking out the books and looking at them
[2013-10-25 19:31:52 -0400] x86brandon: gzc, at the moment there appear to be several bugs with deploying based on stack forge as i am finding out today :)
[2013-10-25 19:32:23 -0400] x86brandon: wkelly: no, no hong kong for me... i had the trip booked but my new employer will not pay for it, so i cancelled out a while ago since i'd rather not pay for a $2k plane ticket myself :)
[2013-10-25 19:33:19 -0400] wkelly: yeah, we'll have some people there
[2013-10-25 19:33:27 -0400] wkelly: but I will not be among them
[2013-10-25 19:34:26 -0400] x86brandon: do you still have your scary beard? maybe you are on the no-fly list!
[2013-10-25 19:34:26 -0400] x86brandon: :-p
[2013-10-25 19:34:36 -0400] retr0h: x86brandon: there aren't bugs
[2013-10-25 19:34:48 -0400] retr0h: :P
[2013-10-25 19:34:57 -0400] x86brandon: dewey, i beg to differ, sir :)
[2013-10-25 19:35:04 -0400] retr0h: haha
[2013-10-25 19:35:16 -0400] kbringard: retr0h would know, he's the one whose job it is to put bugs in
[2013-10-25 19:36:02 -0400] retr0h: x86brandon: yah i'm not sure.. but i can tell you the att guys and suse guys have used these cookbooks for 6+ months
[2013-10-25 19:36:07 -0400] retr0h: and everything deploys
[2013-10-25 19:36:10 -0400] retr0h: grizzly
[2013-10-25 19:36:22 -0400] x86brandon: well yeah, i want havana, dammit :)
[2013-10-25 19:36:26 -0400] retr0h: ah
[2013-10-25 19:36:31 -0400] retr0h: well these aren't havana cookbooks
[2013-10-25 19:36:46 -0400] x86brandon: see... bugs :)
[2013-10-25 19:37:23 -0400] x86brandon: trying to install havana with grizzly recipes = bug :)
[2013-10-25 19:39:16 -0400] retr0h: hehehehe
[2013-10-25 19:41:34 -0400] wkelly: x86brandon: beard is small at present!  but it will be back
[2013-10-25 19:43:08 -0400] gzc: I'm content with grizzly :)
[2013-10-25 20:02:22 -0400] mattray: fwiw I'm trying to document everything here: docs.opscode.com/openstack.html
[2013-10-25 20:02:28 -0400] mattray: but I'm behind
[2013-10-25 20:02:48 -0400] mattray: once this box starts working again, I'll go back and document Vagrant and AllinOne
[2013-10-25 20:03:01 -0400] mattray: then hopefully 1+N next week
[2013-10-25 20:07:09 -0400] x86brandon: matt, if it will help, i am willing to donate the use of a few servers :)
[2013-10-25 20:07:19 -0400] x86brandon: i have a couple extra dell servers in a rack at home
[2013-10-25 20:07:46 -0400] mattray: heh, unless you're in Austin I'll probably have to take a raincheck
[2013-10-25 20:08:13 -0400] mattray: but there are a few people who have recreated my lab setup just to follow along
[2013-10-25 20:08:38 -0400] mattray: which is why I doc it and put it all on github
[2013-10-25 20:08:57 -0400] x86brandon: not in austin, but remote access :)
[2013-10-25 20:09:29 -0400] mattray: hopefully next month I'll be running these on Opscode's colo boxes
[2013-10-25 20:09:35 -0400] mattray: and documenting that
[2013-10-25 20:09:39 -0400] mattray: for a 30 box install
[2013-10-25 20:13:41 -0400] x86brandon: nice :)
[2013-10-25 20:14:17 -0400] x86brandon: we spend a lot of money with hosted chef, wondering when we're going to do chef enterprise or something ;-p
[2013-10-25 21:52:14 -0400] openstackgerrit: Matt Ray proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: Added `endpoints` recipe and attributes to support `bind_interface`  https://review.openstack.org/53961
