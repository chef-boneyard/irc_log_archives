[2013-10-29 03:08:11 -0400] mattray: sweet, got knife working to the chef-zero running on the Vagrant openstack
[2013-10-29 03:11:02 -0400] mattray: chef-zero is some magic stuff
[2013-10-29 03:11:05 -0400] mattray: knife node show ubuntu1204 -c zero.rb -a openstack

[2013-10-29 15:40:59 -0400] s2r2: btw, does anyone use the stackforge cookbooks with the openvswitch plugin?
[2013-10-29 15:41:45 -0400] s2r2: I wonder how you solved the "move IP from interface to OVS bridge" hassle
[2013-10-29 15:46:23 -0400] mattray: s2r2: I punted on solving that problem I added another NIC
[2013-10-29 15:46:32 -0400] mattray: but I'll come back to it eventually
[2013-10-29 15:46:59 -0400] s2r2: mattray: this issue always makes me wonder wether I'm doing it wrong
[2013-10-29 15:47:17 -0400] s2r2: plus I just realised the "ovs-vsctl add-port" code is gone from openstack-network::openvswitch anyways
[2013-10-29 15:48:03 -0400] s2r2: oh sorry, confused
[2013-10-29 15:48:14 -0400] s2r2: openstack-network::l3_agent has it
[2013-10-29 15:49:10 -0400] s2r2: mattray: am I right to conclude that you do that step manually?  cause even with another NIC, once one of them is add-port'ed to the OVS bridge, the interface wont work until you move the IP, right?
[2013-10-29 15:49:51 -0400] mattray: s2r2: I configured my /etc/network/interfaces to have 2 nics on the bridged network
[2013-10-29 15:50:06 -0400] mattray: one provides connectivity, the other is for vms
[2013-10-29 15:50:19 -0400] mattray: eth1 & eth2
[2013-10-29 15:50:21 -0400] s2r2: mattray: oh...that's nice.
[2013-10-29 15:50:26 -0400] mattray: kinda crappy really
[2013-10-29 15:50:33 -0400] s2r2: but it does the trick ;)
[2013-10-29 15:50:36 -0400] mattray: had to do it because the chef server was reached via eth1
[2013-10-29 15:50:49 -0400] s2r2: and I never thought about it that way ya, mine is, too.
[2013-10-29 15:50:49 -0400] mattray: and dropping eth1 to put the bridge on disconnected from the chef server
[2013-10-29 15:51:04 -0400] mattray: so I could put the chef server on eth0
[2013-10-29 15:51:09 -0400] mattray: or come back and fix it later
[2013-10-29 15:51:14 -0400] mattray: I opted to fix it later
[2013-10-29 15:51:25 -0400] s2r2: :)
[2013-10-29 15:51:29 -0400] mattray: but I will
[2013-10-29 15:51:46 -0400] s2r2: thanks for the input, I'm more confident about this now that I know I'm not simply doing it wrong

[2013-10-29 17:38:54 -0400] mattray: anyone else having issues with the pip install of stevedore?
[2013-10-29 17:39:03 -0400] mattray: in block-storage?
[2013-10-29 17:39:35 -0400] alop: that can probably be taken out of havana
[2013-10-29 17:39:45 -0400] alop: lemme check
[2013-10-29 17:41:29 -0400] alop: mattray: I'll take that out of the 8.0.0 version
[2013-10-29 17:41:52 -0400] mattray: unfortunately I'm still on Grizzly :)
[2013-10-29 17:41:57 -0400] alop: ohhhh
[2013-10-29 17:42:12 -0400] alop: on 12.04, right?
[2013-10-29 17:43:35 -0400] alop: SO, to answer your first question, no, we haven't been having problems with that recipe
[2013-10-29 17:45:37 -0400] mattray: alop: according to your comments around stevedore, "# FIXME this can be removed if/when 1:2013.1-0ubuntu2 makes it into precise"
[2013-10-29 17:45:44 -0400] alop: right
[2013-10-29 17:45:50 -0400] mattray: that's the version of cinder-scheduler
[2013-10-29 17:46:16 -0400] alop: makes sense then
[2013-10-29 17:46:22 -0400] mattray: I'll remove it and see what happens?
[2013-10-29 17:46:22 -0400] alop: one sec, lemme pull that out then
[2013-10-29 17:46:29 -0400] alop: oh, ok
[2013-10-29 17:46:45 -0400] alop: mattray: to be sure, pip list | grep stevedore
[2013-10-29 17:46:55 -0400] alop: as long as it's > 0.8.3
[2013-10-29 17:47:13 -0400] alop: which I'm sure it's like 0.12 now

[2013-10-29 17:50:09 -0400] mattray: alop: might want to bump the version
[2013-10-29 17:50:14 -0400] alop: doh
[2013-10-29 17:50:24 -0400] mattray: I'm testing that, I'll review it up once I've confirmed

[2013-10-29 20:01:22 -0400] spheromak:  mattray  how do you feel about an abstraction on the whole endpoints in attributes  idea ?
[2013-10-29 20:02:10 -0400] mattray: that was kinda the goal of what's there
[2013-10-29 20:02:14 -0400] spheromak: I showed you the services stuff i did here, whith pluggable backend. we wrote a to_attribs thing that would puke out attribs how the openstack cooks want, but man some of these attrib structures are nuts
[2013-10-29 20:03:02 -0400] spheromak: yea we did stuff like this first
[2013-10-29 20:03:05 -0400] spheromak: set_endopint
[2013-10-29 20:03:48 -0400] spheromak: https://github.com/cloudware-cookbooks/ktc-utils/blob/master/libraries/attributes.rb

[2013-10-29 20:06:11 -0400] spheromak: haven't really had a discussion outside of our team on this stuff.
[2013-10-29 20:07:13 -0400] mattray: I'm not sure what the best solution is, I'm not sure about adding etcd into the mix
[2013-10-29 20:07:36 -0400] spheromak: doesn't have to be etcd
[2013-10-29 20:07:42 -0400] spheromak: services stuff is pluggable backend
[2013-10-29 20:07:49 -0400] spheromak: it could be services built out of attribs.
[2013-10-29 20:07:51 -0400] spheromak: or bags
[2013-10-29 20:08:00 -0400] spheromak: or redis.. or  zookeeper
[2013-10-29 20:08:02 -0400] spheromak: or...
[2013-10-29 20:08:25 -0400] spheromak:  point is that its an object abstraction on these services/endpoint/members things
[2013-10-29 20:08:32 -0400] mattray: yeah, I get that
[2013-10-29 20:36:51 -0400] ctracey: mattray: sorry :(
