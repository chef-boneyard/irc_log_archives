[2013-10-30 15:38:38 -0400] kbringard: I don't trust that alanmeadows guy :-p
[2013-10-30 15:39:55 -0400] jaypipes: kbringard: :)
[2013-10-30 15:43:30 -0400] alanmeadows: i'm slowly weaving my grand devious web using small innocuous commits
[2013-10-30 15:52:32 -0400] kbringard: I know your tricks, meadows
[2013-10-30 15:52:33 -0400] kbringard: :-p

[2013-10-30 16:20:57 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: Add support for openstack-common::sysctl  https://review.openstack.org/53201
[2013-10-30 16:24:10 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: pong
[2013-10-30 16:26:52 -0400] openstackgerrit: Matt Ray proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Check the run_context.loaded_recipes rather than the run_list, removed sysctl  https://review.openstack.org/53234
[2013-10-30 16:38:10 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: hey, what's the diff between run_context.loaded_recipes and the run_list?
[2013-10-30 16:38:40 -0400] mattray: the run_list isn't expanded
[2013-10-30 16:39:05 -0400] mattray: but I need to make the change spheromak suggested to that review
[2013-10-30 16:39:41 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: ah, I see... normally don't we expand the runlist based on the environment, though?
[2013-10-30 16:39:50 -0400] spheromak: mattray, that works for me everywhere. Am i right in my understanding of the ticket >
[2013-10-30 16:39:56 -0400] mattray: yes
[2013-10-30 16:39:59 -0400] mattray: spheromak: yes
[2013-10-30 16:40:32 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: so when I was testing that fix there are several ways to get the expanded run_list to find all the recipes
[2013-10-30 16:40:44 -0400] mattray: I'm going to bitch about it and suggest cleaning it up for Chef 12
[2013-10-30 16:40:57 -0400] spheromak: yea
[2013-10-30 16:41:05 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: ok, no worries... I'd prefer we stick to doing it just one way...
[2013-10-30 16:41:12 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: definitely agree
[2013-10-30 16:41:17 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: also, you see my comment about semver increment and a Changelog entry?
[2013-10-30 16:41:20 -0400] mattray: and I know I'm guilty of not doing it
[2013-10-30 16:41:24 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: yes, fixing that
[2013-10-30 16:41:44 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: no worries, thx man!
[2013-10-30 16:41:46 -0400] spheromak: the pattern we are using everywhere is  include_attrib, and then use default to overwrite.  explicitly controlling load order.  Seems to make things more readable, and as a benefit we have gotten rid of  override all over
[2013-10-30 16:42:10 -0400] spheromak: jaypipes, you think it's worthwhile to get some scm  versioning ?
[2013-10-30 16:43:17 -0400] spheromak: I got a script that hooks into thor-scmver and updates metadata. happy to share
[2013-10-30 16:43:17 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: ? sorry, not folloring you...
[2013-10-30 16:43:22 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: ah...
[2013-10-30 16:43:32 -0400] spheromak: when we merge it should be a patch by default unless comments specify otherwise
[2013-10-30 16:43:38 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: yeah, totally. in fact, i think you or ionut already broached the subject on the ML, no?
[2013-10-30 16:43:53 -0400] spheromak: ill give you a gist of what i use for us on jenkins
[2013-10-30 16:44:08 -0400] jaypipes: sweet, thx.
[2013-10-30 16:45:59 -0400] mattray: spheromak: could it update the CHANGELOG?
[2013-10-30 16:46:22 -0400] spheromak: you could make it so.. theres jenkins stuff for doing that
[2013-10-30 16:46:31 -0400] mattray: or is that even worthwhile?
[2013-10-30 16:46:41 -0400] spheromak: i haven't taken that step on our ci
[2013-10-30 16:46:59 -0400] spheromak: can use the summary from git commits as changelog
[2013-10-30 16:47:31 -0400] mattray: yeah, that would work. But when I write git commits I usually expect someone to be reading along with the code
[2013-10-30 16:47:46 -0400] mattray: as opposed to the changelog, which is higher-level
[2013-10-30 16:47:52 -0400] mattray: but maybe it doesn't really matter
[2013-10-30 16:50:07 -0400] spheromak: just the first line in changelog
[2013-10-30 16:50:11 -0400] spheromak: works for the kernel ;)
[2013-10-30 16:50:14 -0400] spheromak: https://gist.github.com/spheromak/7236020
[2013-10-30 16:50:19 -0400] spheromak: jaypipes, ^
[2013-10-30 16:53:25 -0400] ctracey: anyone have strong feelings about me moving this to openstack-common? https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute/blob/master/recipes/nova-common.rb#L187
[2013-10-30 16:53:47 -0400] ctracey: i ran into this last night and it was kind of a pain
[2013-10-30 16:54:20 -0400] spheromak: ctracey, ill +1 it ;)
[2013-10-30 16:54:27 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: interestign...
[2013-10-30 16:54:30 -0400] ctracey: im inclined to just move it to its own recipe so that it can be called from any role you choose
[2013-10-30 16:54:38 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: question: where it does this:
[2013-10-30 16:54:38 -0400] jaypipes:  say "Creating and pushing tags", :yellow
[2013-10-30 16:54:39 -0400] jaypipes: current_version.tag
[2013-10-30 16:54:40 -0400] galstrom: jaypipes: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/52563/
[2013-10-30 16:54:42 -0400] ctracey: seems silly to force it on folks
[2013-10-30 16:54:46 -0400] spheromak: jaypipes, its hack on thor-scm-version
[2013-10-30 16:54:49 -0400] galstrom: can you re-approve.. did a recheck no bug
[2013-10-30 16:54:57 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: is that actually creating a *git* tag, or is that referring to some other tag of some sort?
[2013-10-30 16:55:00 -0400] ctracey: though i do like it ;)
[2013-10-30 16:55:09 -0400] spheromak: jaypipes, yes whole thing is tag based
[2013-10-30 16:55:23 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: git tags, yes?
[2013-10-30 16:55:42 -0400] spheromak: so it updates metadata and updates git tags pushes tags and the commit with the bumped ver
[2013-10-30 16:56:10 -0400] spheromak: https://github.com/cloudware-cookbooks/ktc-utils/releases
[2013-10-30 16:56:16 -0400] openstackgerrit: Oisin C. Feeley proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-object-storage: Add pipeline configuration for tempurl with swauth  https://review.openstack.org/54583
[2013-10-30 16:56:25 -0400] spheromak: jaypipes, gotta disable the damn internal jenkins tags or you get that random shit
[2013-10-30 16:56:34 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: gotcha
[2013-10-30 16:56:35 -0400] spheromak: jenkins-ktc-utils-
[2013-10-30 16:56:45 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: final question...
[2013-10-30 16:56:59 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: why the git stash on line 43?
[2013-10-30 16:57:11 -0400] spheromak: hack
[2013-10-30 16:57:13 -0400] spheromak: :)
[2013-10-30 16:57:29 -0400] spheromak: it was being done instead of using a new workspace every build
[2013-10-30 16:57:40 -0400] jaypipes: spheromak: ah, I see.
[2013-10-30 16:57:42 -0400] spheromak: or cleaning up workspace
[2013-10-30 16:57:49 -0400] spheromak: should jsut have jenkins clean
[2013-10-30 16:57:53 -0400] jaypipes: kk
[2013-10-30 16:58:28 -0400] spheromak: its because right now   theres a couple of us that hop on jenkins and run kitchen in workspaces to debug (working on getting that shit archived and accecssable)
[2013-10-30 16:58:52 -0400] spheromak: and my job builder didn't have the cleanup / wipeout options.
[2013-10-30 16:59:01 -0400] spheromak: so i make sure we stash b4 we commit/push
[2013-10-30 16:59:18 -0400] spheromak: like i said ;) hack
[2013-10-30 16:59:30 -0400] spheromak: actually forgot about it.
[2013-10-30 16:59:31 -0400] jaypipes: :) no worries
