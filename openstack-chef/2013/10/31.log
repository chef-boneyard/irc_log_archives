[2013-10-31 14:46:49 -0400] paulczar: mattray:  having problems getting chef-zero provisioner to work on my new box   complains that /etc/chef/client.pem doesn't exist   have you seen this ?
[2013-10-31 14:47:13 -0400] mattray: paulczar: nope. Using the latest versions of the vagrant plugins?
[2013-10-31 15:37:48 -0400] paulczar: mattray:  yup,  using vagrant 1.3.5, and newest vbox and all the new plugins
[2013-10-31 15:38:00 -0400] paulczar: this is the second machine I've seen it on
[2013-10-31 15:38:14 -0400] mattray: I just upgraded my vagrant and plugins
[2013-10-31 15:38:19 -0400] mattray: testing now
[2013-10-31 15:38:58 -0400] paulczar: are you running on ubuntu or orc ?
[2013-10-31 15:39:01 -0400] paulczar: osx even
[2013-10-31 15:39:05 -0400] paulczar: awesome typo
[2013-10-31 15:41:00 -0400] mattray: osx
[2013-10-31 15:41:04 -0400] mattray: 10.7.5
[2013-10-31 15:41:11 -0400] mattray: vagrant 1.3.5
[2013-10-31 15:41:17 -0400] mattray: I can spin up a 12.04 box quickly
[2013-10-31 15:41:28 -0400] paulczar: nah its cool my new box is osx also
[2013-10-31 15:41:55 -0400] paulczar: osx is weird and scary i need somebody to hold me and tell me its all going to be okay
[2013-10-31 15:42:21 -0400] hugespoon: paulczar: hah i know the feeling, just got an osx box myself :-P
[2013-10-31 15:56:03 -0400] mattray: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/54764/ is kinda relevant
[2013-10-31 16:08:16 -0400] mattray: vagrant still now worky, but no issues with chef-zero
[2013-10-31 16:08:22 -0400] mattray: s/now/no/
[2013-10-31 16:14:30 -0400] paulczar: hrmmm,  I'll nuke it all and try again.
[2013-10-31 16:21:56 -0400] paulczar: mattray: can you give me a dump of ls ~/.vagrant.d/gems/gems/ ?  I think I have a wacky gem causing it
[2013-10-31 16:22:13 -0400] mattray: order of plugin installation matters
[2013-10-31 16:22:17 -0400] mattray: I've only got those 3
[2013-10-31 16:22:27 -0400] mattray: omnibus, chef-zero and berkshelf installed in that order
[2013-10-31 16:22:51 -0400] mattray: https://gist.github.com/7252588
[2013-10-31 16:22:52 -0400] paulczar: shit in my mouth  i bet thats my problem
[2013-10-31 16:30:41 -0400] jaypipes: mattray, galstrom, ctracey, spheromak: reviews on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/54169/ and https://review.openstack.org/#/c/54583/ appreciated :)
[2013-10-31 17:57:25 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h, mattray, galstrom, ctracey, spheromak: reviews on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/54169/ if you can
[2013-10-31 18:15:36 -0400] paulczar: mattray:  this is what I'm seeing - Ridley::Errors::ClientKeyFileNotFoundOrInvalid: client key is invalid or not found at: '/etc/chef/client.pem'
[2013-10-31 18:15:40 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: commented
[2013-10-31 18:16:14 -0400] paulczar: this is after reinstalling in correct order
[2013-10-31 18:16:27 -0400] mattray: paulczar: I assume your gems are the same versions as mine?
[2013-10-31 18:18:53 -0400] paulczar: yeah can't see any differences
[2013-10-31 18:20:15 -0400] paulczar: do you have a /etc/chef/client.pem on your box when its running ?  I'm assuming chef-zero plugin should be creating it
[2013-10-31 18:21:00 -0400] paulczar: or passing args to berkshelf to use something else
[2013-10-31 18:22:22 -0400] mattray: checking
[2013-10-31 18:22:45 -0400] mattray: yeah, it's there
[2013-10-31 18:27:23 -0400] mattray: fwiw, galstrom and I are looking at the vagrant stuff, it appears to be starting nova-network and quantum
[2013-10-31 18:33:10 -0400] mattray: galstrom: mine is "working" inasmuch as it has both network services running still
[2013-10-31 18:33:21 -0400] mattray: ssh'd into cirros
[2013-10-31 18:34:56 -0400] alanmeadows1: mattray: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-object-storage/blob/master/recipes/proxy-server.rb#L53
[2013-10-31 18:35:14 -0400] alanmeadows1: mattray: did you want that as a platform_option?
[2013-10-31 18:36:26 -0400] mattray: alanmeadows1: the new bits drop the python-swauth package completely, it's not in the platform_options
[2013-10-31 18:36:36 -0400] mattray: if you go back to the attribute file, the don't match
[2013-10-31 18:36:50 -0400] mattray: I don't know if they need to
[2013-10-31 18:36:53 -0400] mattray: but they don't
[2013-10-31 18:37:15 -0400] mattray: "swauth_packages" => ["swauth"]
[2013-10-31 18:40:05 -0400] alanmeadows1: mattray: got it
[2013-10-31 18:42:07 -0400] mattray: as I'm not using Swift right now, it's just me being pedantic
[2013-10-31 18:45:45 -0400] mattray: heh, this is why nova-network and quantum are both on vagrant: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/53234/
[2013-10-31 18:49:23 -0400] alanmeadows1: mattray: heresy!
[2013-10-31 18:53:47 -0400] mattray: alanmeadows1: I saw Oisin's comment, changing to +2
[2013-10-31 18:53:57 -0400] mattray: is he in here?
[2013-10-31 18:54:26 -0400] alanmeadows1: I don't think he is
[2013-10-31 18:54:35 -0400] alanmeadows1: I'm sure he will feel the love wherever he is
[2013-10-31 18:54:44 -0400] alanmeadows1: I was just checking on that myself
[2013-10-31 18:54:53 -0400] mattray: I just want to put names in reviews with people in IRC
[2013-10-31 18:55:09 -0400] mattray: I'm lazy that way, use 'mattray' everywhere
[2013-10-31 18:55:28 -0400] alanmeadows1: He would be 'ush' if he joins
[2013-10-31 18:59:21 -0400] alanmeadows1: mattray: and if you're feeling extra generous today there is https://review.openstack.org/#/c/54583/
[2013-10-31 18:59:29 -0400] alanmeadows1: ush will be positively elated :)
[2013-10-31 19:01:48 -0400] ush: :)
[2013-10-31 19:03:55 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: ctracey: core reviewers can we get another +2? https://review.openstack.org/#/c/53234/
[2013-10-31 19:08:23 -0400] mattray: fwiw, chef 11.8 just dropped
[2013-10-31 19:23:59 -0400] galstrom: mattray: we should set config.omnibus.chef_version to 11.6 then?
[2013-10-31 19:24:25 -0400] mattray: or 11.6.2 if you're nervous
[2013-10-31 19:24:30 -0400] galstrom: nvm.. looks like 11.8 seems to be working
[2013-10-31 19:24:34 -0400] mattray: I've been using nightlies
[2013-10-31 19:24:51 -0400] mattray: the test coverage is pretty good
[2013-10-31 19:50:21 -0400] paulczar: mattray:  I'm lost in ruby code that I don't understand trying to track down why I'm failing  have logged an issue on the vagrant-chef-zero plugin page so hopefully the author will respond quickly with a fix so I can get back and working with it
[2013-10-31 19:51:43 -0400] mattray: paulczar: I don't have time to test it, but I believe if you change https://github.com/andrewgross/vagrant-chef-zero/blob/master/Gemfile#L3 to gem "json", "<= 1.7.7" that fixes it
[2013-10-31 19:52:22 -0400] mattray: this is all related to ruby 1.8.7 support and the json cookbook author not respecting semver
[2013-10-31 19:52:45 -0400] mattray: if we drop Ruby 1.8.7 support the json dep goes away
[2013-10-31 19:53:37 -0400] mattray: but probably not until Chef 12, because people don't like losing stuff in stable branches
[2013-10-31 19:57:21 -0400] paulczar: yeah,  that was fixed by installing in the order you suggested,  onto a different problem now where it's not passing the client key to berkshelf so berkshelf fails after zero does its bit
[2013-10-31 19:59:05 -0400] mattray: yeah, not recreating that :(
[2013-10-31 20:01:08 -0400] paulczar: *shrug* no big deal   just gonna sit on it for now  I just wanted to get kicking on some docker nova-driver stuff using the stack forge cookbooks
