[2013-10-14 15:41:08 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: ping
[2013-10-14 15:47:03 -0400] alanmeadows1: mattray: I think jay is out until Wednesday, unless he decides to pop in earlier
[2013-10-14 15:47:37 -0400] mattray: ahh, I was hoping to talk to him about his comment on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/51301/
[2013-10-14 15:47:43 -0400] mattray: I'm posting to it
[2013-10-14 15:47:54 -0400] mattray: the short is Vagabond from source was broken and blocking all commits
[2013-10-14 15:48:12 -0400] mattray: it'll come back soon
[2013-10-14 15:48:46 -0400] mattray: and I pinged a couple of folks and this channel about reviews
[2013-10-14 15:49:15 -0400] mattray: but since it was blindly blocking anything from going in, I removed it
[2013-10-14 15:49:54 -0400] alanmeadows1: That sounds like a good change :)
[2013-10-14 16:00:52 -0400] mattray: I definitely want Vagabond back and working
[2013-10-14 16:41:40 -0400] retr0h: ya... i think jay is in FL or something
[2013-10-14 16:41:57 -0400] scottso: Ya he's soaking in the sun.
[2013-10-14 16:42:00 -0400] mattray: I added a comment: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/51301/
[2013-10-14 16:42:22 -0400] retr0h: lol.....
[2013-10-14 17:13:16 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: hey, sorry, yeah, I'm on vacay...
[2013-10-14 17:14:01 -0400] mattray: just wanted to make sure you understood my rational. I fought with Gerrit a bunch Thursday and Friday
[2013-10-14 17:14:30 -0400] mattray: I should've been more descriptive
[2013-10-14 17:15:15 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: assuming Vagabond get fixed will Gerrit run it? Will it actually spin up LXC instances?
[2013-10-14 17:15:53 -0400] mattray: curious what level of resources we have available for testing
[2013-10-14 17:17:30 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: so... two things we could have done instead of removing (just thoughts, not slamming you :): a) could have gone with a non-source Gem for vagabond, b) could have commented out the vagabond gem and/or used a different sha1
[2013-10-14 17:17:47 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: Gerrit does not currently run any vagabond testing, no.
[2013-10-14 17:18:06 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: it could, yes, but we haven't gotten to that yet (nobody has been testing vagabond stuff so far)
[2013-10-14 17:20:03 -0400] mattray: yeah, the first abandoned attempt to fix Vagabond just commented it out, should have kept that
[2013-10-14 17:20:39 -0400] mattray: but that review depended on ones that were failing.. because of Vagabond
[2013-10-14 17:20:58 -0400] mattray: I should have just resubmitted that one, but I resubmitted with it removed
[2013-10-14 17:21:12 -0400] mattray: and updated spiceweasel because it had a bug in 2.0.1
[2013-10-14 17:21:41 -0400] mattray: that's good to know that we can use LXC though
[2013-10-14 17:23:15 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: can you get me a link to one of the reviews that was failing because of vagabond please?
[2013-10-14 17:30:12 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: http://logs.openstack.org/93/51093/1/gate/gate-openstack-chef-repo/ef2cc26/console.html.gz
[2013-10-14 17:38:16 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: just needed to change "github:" to "git" :)
[2013-10-14 17:38:40 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: gotta love the differences between Gemfile and Berksfile.
[2013-10-14 17:40:56 -0400] mattray: yeah, I had an email asking if Berkshelf and Spiceweasel are required to use the repos so I'm documenting how to use the repos without using those as well
[2013-10-14 19:17:46 -0400] mattray: I thought stackforge repos automatically closed pull requests?
[2013-10-14 19:17:48 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute/pull/1
[2013-10-14 19:18:52 -0400] mattray: hmm like this one
[2013-10-14 19:18:53 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/pull/1
[2013-10-14 19:21:49 -0400] alop: mattray: that *is* closed
[2013-10-14 19:22:13 -0400] mattray: alop: the first link
[2013-10-14 19:22:14 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute/pull/1
[2013-10-14 19:22:26 -0400] alop: oh...
[2013-10-14 19:22:42 -0400] alop: maybe gerrit is slow
