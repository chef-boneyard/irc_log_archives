[2013-10-28 10:01:13 -0400] s2r2: hey *.  Since the havana topic came up, are there any plans for supporting havana right now?
[2013-10-28 10:09:05 -0400] s2r2: (where "plans" could mean "roadmap blueprint" or "let's create a branch stable/grizzly" or anything like that)
[2013-10-28 13:42:38 -0400] mattray: s2r2: saw your post from earlier. Yes, we need to start a thread on branching for the Havana release
[2013-10-28 13:42:49 -0400] mattray: I'll try to get an email out today unless someone beats me to it

[2013-10-28 16:42:11 -0400] Liquid--: I'm having a little bit of trouble understanding how the openstack-chef cookbooks work together in a multi-node environment. Can anyone point me in the right direction to start understanding that dynamic?
[2013-10-28 16:44:22 -0400] Liquid--: I started up the vagrant box that has the all-in-one role applied to it, I'm just not sure what my run_list needs to look like in order to setup an OpenStack cluster with one controller and 3 or 4 compute nodes. Any help would be Uber appreciated! :)
[2013-10-28 16:48:44 -0400] galstrom: on the chefspec stuff.. where is the identity_registration option checking happening?
[2013-10-28 16:49:07 -0400] galstrom: i am seeing the tenant_enabled must be a kind of string.. error

[2013-10-28 17:03:19 -0400] Liquid--: @mattray: Oh awesome! You guys rock by the way! This project is very cool!
[2013-10-28 17:03:33 -0400] mattray: thanks, trying to make it more accessible
[2013-10-28 17:03:46 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: pong
[2013-10-28 17:04:01 -0400] mattray: I responded to your comments on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/54143/
[2013-10-28 17:04:25 -0400] mattray: there's a mess of code around bind_interfaces sprinkled through the cookbooks
[2013-10-28 17:04:48 -0400] mattray: I'd be happy to clean it up if it doesn't mean hard-coding all the endpoitns
[2013-10-28 17:05:03 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: hardcoding all the endpoints?
[2013-10-28 17:05:18 -0400] mattray:  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/53961/ is to let you specify the interface and have them set
[2013-10-28 17:05:34 -0400] mattray: I assume you guys are specifying your endpoints in your environment?
[2013-10-28 17:06:49 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: we use a single "uri" attribute for our endpoints.
[2013-10-28 17:07:01 -0400] mattray: with the IP address already set?
[2013-10-28 17:07:09 -0400] jaypipes: no. we use DNS.
[2013-10-28 17:07:19 -0400] jaypipes: which already solves this problem quite well. :)
[2013-10-28 17:07:23 -0400] mattray: I bet
[2013-10-28 17:07:36 -0400] mattray: so in my lab, I'm trying to do services by interface
[2013-10-28 17:07:43 -0400] jaypipes: k
[2013-10-28 17:08:01 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: does each service go on a separate interface or something?
[2013-10-28 17:08:02 -0400] mattray: so I don't set the endpoint URIs or hosts, I just set the interface
[2013-10-28 17:08:05 -0400] mattray: yes
[2013-10-28 17:08:13 -0400] jaypipes: oh
[2013-10-28 17:08:52 -0400] mattray: and as I walk down that path I find other oddities around assumptions of localhost (like in that image patch)
[2013-10-28 17:09:01 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: so I think there's actually two separate issues...
[2013-10-28 17:09:15 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: first issue is the above patch which adds per-endpoint bind_interface support.
[2013-10-28 17:09:30 -0400] mattray: yes, and doesn't do anything if you don't use bind_interface
[2013-10-28 17:09:50 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I don't have a huge problem with the concept, but I do have issues with creating a wholly separate recipe called endpoints when there is already a library called endpoints that has a bunch of functionality in it.
[2013-10-28 17:10:14 -0400] mattray: yeah, I didn't see a way to push bind_interfaces into it
[2013-10-28 17:11:43 -0400] mattray: I'd love to get rid of code like this: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image/blob/master/recipes/api.rb#L137
[2013-10-28 17:12:35 -0400] mattray: so you'd like for https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/libraries/endpoints.rb to check the bind_interface?
[2013-10-28 17:12:39 -0400] mattray: and drop the recipe?
[2013-10-28 17:16:55 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I understand your point. I just see this kind of thing as something that could be handled outside of the openstack cookbooks... I mean you could use DNS, yes?
[2013-10-28 17:17:34 -0400] mattray: I'm not currently using DNS
[2013-10-28 17:17:54 -0400] mattray: and I'm trying to make it as simple as possible for new users
[2013-10-28 17:18:36 -0400] mattray: I'd definitely like to remove any recipe usage of bind_interface
[2013-10-28 17:18:44 -0400] mattray: especially outside of openstack-common
[2013-10-28 17:21:45 -0400] mattray: would logic in https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/libraries/endpoints.rb#L29 to change the host based on the bind_interface be too unexpected?
[2013-10-28 17:22:30 -0400] mattray: not changing anything if bind_interface is left empty
[2013-10-28 17:22:42 -0400] mattray: and then other recipes could get cleaned up
[2013-10-28 17:23:00 -0400] mattray: and drop the os-common::endpoints
[2013-10-28 17:25:28 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: sorry, reading back.. .ten convos going simulcast..
[2013-10-28 17:25:52 -0400] mattray: no worries, just trying to get a bind_interface fix that doesn't step on toes
[2013-10-28 17:26:40 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: have you set node[openstack][image][api][bind_interface]?
[2013-10-28 17:27:02 -0400] mattray: yeah, not picked up by node[openstack][endpoints][host]
[2013-10-28 17:27:25 -0400] mattray: my first pass through was to set the bind_interfaces via the attributes
[2013-10-28 17:27:29 -0400] mattray: they don't seem to all work
[2013-10-28 17:27:35 -0400] mattray: and coverage is incomplete
[2013-10-28 17:28:01 -0400] mattray: so I realized what I really wanted at the end of it was to have endpoints know about bind_interfaces
[2013-10-28 17:28:33 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: they are really separate things, though...
[2013-10-28 17:28:47 -0400] mattray: yeah
[2013-10-28 17:29:08 -0400] mattray: but setting node[openstack][image][api][bind_interface] wasn't showing up in the endpoint
[2013-10-28 17:29:39 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: endpoint attributes are intended to be set by the deployer, not calculated somehow using the bind_interface thing. Meanwhile, bind_address values are intended to be calculated based on bind_interface, which is why the block of code you referenced above is in all the recipes...
[2013-10-28 17:29:51 -0400] mattray: right
[2013-10-28 17:30:03 -0400] mattray: so there's no dynamic way to set endpoints?
[2013-10-28 17:30:57 -0400] mattray: at least not internal to the stackforge cookbooks
[2013-10-28 17:31:17 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: no, and it's intended to be that way... it's intended to be a set of node attributes that a role definition or wrapper cookbook sets.
[2013-10-28 17:31:26 -0400] jaypipes: or environment definition file i suppose.
[2013-10-28 17:32:40 -0400] mattray: right, and I'd like to make it more dynamic. I'm open to suggestions, but I want it to be something I don't have to leave the cookbooks for
[2013-10-28 17:32:48 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I think I could go along with your patch if you renamed the recipe from endpoints to something like "set_endpoints_from_interface"
[2013-10-28 17:33:07 -0400] mattray: I'm happy to drop the recipe completely
[2013-10-28 17:33:26 -0400] mattray: if it seems OK to set the host based on the bind_interface in the endpoints method
[2013-10-28 17:33:42 -0400] mattray: which will only happen if bind_interface is non-nil
[2013-10-28 17:33:54 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: to make it more obvious that it's not necessary unless you are dynamically trying to set all your endpoint values by searching for all nodes that have OpenStack endpoints and getting the IP address of that node's specific bind_interface for that endpoint.
[2013-10-28 17:34:25 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: but at that point, why not just have a wrapper cookbook/recipe that does that for your lab?
[2013-10-28 17:34:35 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: seems that would be the easiest way of doing this.
[2013-10-28 17:34:54 -0400] mattray: I'm trying to make a "friendlier" approach for external consumers
[2013-10-28 17:35:20 -0400] mattray: so they just label the nics they want to use
[2013-10-28 17:35:29 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I think a ten line commented recipe that can be used to do this would be fine...
[2013-10-28 17:36:15 -0400] mattray: so rename openstack-common::endpoints to "set_endpoints_by_interface"?
[2013-10-28 17:36:26 -0400] mattray: and the patch is good?
[2013-10-28 17:36:28 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: again, our approach has always been that one of the assumptions that is made by the OpenStack cookboooks is that node networking has already been configured and that endpoint hosts/URIs should be pre-determined.
[2013-10-28 17:36:42 -0400] jaypipes: lemme look one more time...
[2013-10-28 17:36:44 -0400] mattray: sure, I don't want to break that
[2013-10-28 17:36:52 -0400] mattray: I want to make both use cases viable
[2013-10-28 17:38:01 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: yup, just change the name fo the recipe and I'm good with it.
[2013-10-28 17:38:06 -0400] mattray: thanks!
[2013-10-28 17:38:09 -0400] mattray: sorry for the confusion
[2013-10-28 17:38:36 -0400] mattray: you're not goind to be in Hong Kong right?
[2013-10-28 17:38:50 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: keep in mind you mention the recipe name "endpoint" in the README.md and the attributes.rb comments...
[2013-10-28 17:38:59 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: no probs. and no, not gonna be in HK
[2013-10-28 17:39:05 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: josh will be though!
[2013-10-28 17:39:24 -0400] mattray: ok, I'll make sure I rope him into discussions
[2013-10-28 17:39:36 -0400] mattray: there is about to be an influx of new developers
[2013-10-28 17:40:04 -0400] mattray: and we'll need to probably become a little more organized in our development
[2013-10-28 17:52:21 -0400] openstackgerrit: Matt Ray proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: Added set_endpoints_by_interface recipe & attributes to support 'bind_interface'  https://review.openstack.org/53961

[2013-10-28 17:52:55 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: new patch there: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/53961/
[2013-10-28 17:53:16 -0400] mattray: I'll go back and fix the changes to image_image to call endpoints inside the LWRP
[2013-10-28 18:02:50 -0400] Liquid--: #mattray: I would love to become a contributor to this project. I checked out the getting started wiki, but I'm not sure if there is a specific area to that needs attention. I'm not sure if I'll have time right away, but would eventually like to work with you guys on this if there is a need!
[2013-10-28 18:03:06 -0400] mattray: docs are always helpful
[2013-10-28 18:03:13 -0400] Liquid--: @mattray: Whoops ^
[2013-10-28 18:03:18 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/opscode/chef-docs
[2013-10-28 18:04:22 -0400] mattray: the turn-around on docs is usually <24 hours, so if you find something you don't like or that needs clarification on http://docs.opscode.com/openstack.html you can report it or fix it quickly
[2013-10-28 18:07:47 -0400] Liquid--: Right on, once the multi-node environment is ready, I believe our company will want to deploy to production. Maybe a blog-post would be helpful on how we implement that. Right now my biggest confusion seems to be with how the role/run_lists work together, but I'm also very new to the code base for this.
[2013-10-28 18:09:36 -0400] mattray: so the roles are essentially run_list wrappers
[2013-10-28 18:09:46 -0400] mattray: they don't have any attributes, those are set in the environment
[2013-10-28 18:10:06 -0400] mattray: you assign the roles to the machines to build the deployment you want
[2013-10-28 18:10:26 -0400] mattray: ie. 'os-single-controller' and 'os-compute' for a controller + compute nodes
[2013-10-28 18:10:44 -0400] mattray: I just need to get examples of those out there
[2013-10-28 18:11:21 -0400] mattray: I'm working on an allinone environment that will be an example, then another single-controller environment that will look very similar
[2013-10-28 18:11:37 -0400] mattray: and I'll back them in the chef-docs
[2013-10-28 18:13:02 -0400] Liquid--: ah gangnam style. Oh so it works, just not documented yet? That's really cool. Then you assign attributes in the environment to configure the nodes in your cluster?
[2013-10-28 18:13:04 -0400] mattray: my lab is 5 machines, but once I have the "1+N" example working, I'll be moving it to 30 machines
[2013-10-28 18:13:14 -0400] mattray: Liquid--: yes
[2013-10-28 18:13:24 -0400] mattray: "works" is relative
[2013-10-28 18:13:33 -0400] mattray: I've got a lot of patches up for review :)
[2013-10-28 18:14:48 -0400] Liquid--: Very exciting! It seems that we are on the bleeding edge!
[2013-10-28 18:15:03 -0400] mattray: yes
[2013-10-28 18:15:22 -0400] mattray: but I'm at least trying to document the operation
[2013-10-28 18:19:00 -0400] Liquid--: Very cool, opscode has been really good about documentation especially considering how new the technology is. I got excited when I heard about the openstack stuff on the food-fight show, but it's nice to see where things are at!

[2013-10-28 21:36:59 -0400] mattray: galstrom: I lean in favor of more frequent
[2013-10-28 21:37:08 -0400] mattray: nearly everytime?
[2013-10-28 21:37:33 -0400] galstrom: yeah.. i took the silence meant acceptance approach on that one.. :)
[2013-10-28 21:37:40 -0400] galstrom: version bump.. changelog update
[2013-10-28 21:38:01 -0400] galstrom: i think ideally it should be every time..
[2013-10-28 21:38:06 -0400] galstrom: but i am sure that makes berksfile sad
[2013-10-28 21:38:09 -0400] galstrom: somehow
[2013-10-28 21:57:37 -0400] gzc: does the pipeline auto-increment versions for you?
[2013-10-28 21:57:59 -0400] gzc: we're using gerrit, too, with some hooks to do that magic for us
[2013-10-28 22:19:17 -0400] mattray: gzc: nope, but maybe it should
[2013-10-28 22:19:32 -0400] mattray: how would you flag a minor version bump?
[2013-10-28 22:19:38 -0400] mattray: as in 7.0 to 7.1
[2013-10-28 22:20:08 -0400] mattray: at&t folks.. question about rabbitmq usage
[2013-10-28 22:20:11 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: ^^
[2013-10-28 22:20:19 -0400] gzc: ours just increments patch levels, so you'd manually do that- or use one of the knife plugins that help with that workflow
[2013-10-28 22:20:47 -0400] mattray: curious about node["openstack"]["network"]["rabbit"]["host"]
[2013-10-28 22:21:01 -0400] gzc: soon i think hippiehacker'll join me in here for some of this fun, we're just about to deploy openstack and I'm ambling through it as we speak
[2013-10-28 22:21:17 -0400] mattray: gzc: I should be helping hh get going
[2013-10-28 22:21:29 -0400] gzc: nice :)
[2013-10-28 22:21:47 -0400] gzc: just got razor automated enough and am hitting issues with missing some encrypted data bags right now
[2013-10-28 22:21:57 -0400] gzc: actually i should ping him, we're supposed to get up this week
[2013-10-28 22:26:03 -0400] mattray: so the rabbitmq stuff is not propagating into the various cookbooks because each has their own attribute namespaces
[2013-10-28 22:26:23 -0400] mattray: ie. node["openstack"]["image"]["rabbit"]["host"]
[2013-10-28 22:26:36 -0400] mattray: for image, network, compute, block-storage
