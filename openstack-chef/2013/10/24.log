[2013-10-24 02:28:24 -0400] openstackgerrit: Matt Ray proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Check the run_context.loaded_recipes rather than the run_list, removed sysctl  https://review.openstack.org/53234
[2013-10-24 02:51:25 -0400] openstackgerrit: Matt Ray proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: Add support for openstack-common::sysctl  https://review.openstack.org/53201
[2013-10-24 10:31:07 -0400] openstackgerrit: andrew yongjoon kong proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: if vnc_server_listen is bound to specific IP instead of 0.0.0.0, libvirt cannot start the migrated VM from destination server. It's because when libvirt migrate vm to other node it doesn't change the vnc_server_listen port.  https://review.openstack.org/52263
[2013-10-24 10:42:46 -0400] openstackgerrit: andrew yongjoon kong proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: migration is not working  https://review.openstack.org/52263
[2013-10-24 14:32:01 -0400] x86brandon: is there a preference to using the stack forge chef recipes vs the rcbops ones? looks like same folks working on both projects to some degree
[2013-10-24 14:41:22 -0400] mattray: x86brandon: StackForge is probably where you want to focus
[2013-10-24 14:41:52 -0400] mattray: since it's a community project with lots of contributors from different companies, rcbops is mostly Rackspace
[2013-10-24 14:42:18 -0400] mattray: there is some overlap
[2013-10-24 14:42:23 -0400] mattray: and lots of shared history
[2013-10-24 18:36:55 -0400] jaypipes: x86brandon: also, much if not all of the rcbops work has been incorporated in the stackforge cookbooks by now I think... we made an effort to bring in as much as we could.
[2013-10-24 19:17:18 -0400] x86brandon: jaypipes!
[2013-10-24 19:17:20 -0400] x86brandon: hi :)
[2013-10-24 19:18:59 -0400] jaypipes: hello :)
[2013-10-24 19:21:38 -0400] x86brandon: long time no see
[2013-10-24 20:33:46 -0400] openstackgerrit: Matt Ray proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity: hide .cookbooks directory  https://review.openstack.org/53731
[2013-10-24 22:36:39 -0400] mattray: so now I've got node['openstack']['endpoints']['bind_interface'] working
[2013-10-24 22:37:07 -0400] mattray: need to clean that up so different components can listen on different interfaces if desired
