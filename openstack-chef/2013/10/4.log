[2013-10-04 10:33:30 -0400] openstackgerrit: Ionut Artarisi proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image: make cache management more configurable  https://review.openstack.org/49517
[2013-10-04 12:59:54 -0400] odyssey4me: I need to roll a small patch ( https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1235220 ) into nova via a cookbook. Ideally I don't want to use a cookbook_file as that'll require keeping the whole file up to date with subsequent package updates. Any thoughts on how best to do this?
[2013-10-04 13:03:14 -0400] odyssey4me: I could do a search & replace, but that seems like a bit of a hack?
[2013-10-04 13:03:48 -0400] iartarisi: odyssey4me: why not just patch the package?
[2013-10-04 13:05:26 -0400] odyssey4me: iartarisi - is there a localised method of doing that without all the upstream involvement?
[2013-10-04 13:06:33 -0400] iartarisi: well it depends where you install your packages from, but if you had your custom repositories, you could just rebuild the package with your patch
[2013-10-04 13:11:22 -0400] odyssey4me: iartarisi - that sounds like a lot more complexity and effort (also a lot more risk) for a simple patch. We try to use stock packages as far as possible, but sometimes we need to put a patch or two in temporarily until they make it upstream.
[2013-10-04 13:13:15 -0400] iartarisi: odyssey4me: then I guess you could just use diff&patch in the cookbook after you install the package if it's temporary.
[2013-10-04 13:18:40 -0400] odyssey4me: iartarisi - yeah, thought of that as an option... it's certainly better than search & replace.
[2013-10-04 13:19:07 -0400] odyssey4me: How does diff/patch get affected if the file itself is changed, for instance in a package update where the line number changes?
[2013-10-04 13:19:52 -0400] iartarisi: unpredictably? :)
[2013-10-04 13:22:20 -0400] odyssey4me: :) fair enough

[2013-10-04 21:55:21 -0400] mattray: virtualbox is so flakey
[2013-10-04 21:55:36 -0400] alop: compared to?
[2013-10-04 21:55:50 -0400] alop: Well, I can see, everytime I start it, I have available updates
[2013-10-04 21:58:45 -0400] mattray: my VMs are spinning up too fast?
[2013-10-04 21:59:14 -0400] mattray: every third time it fails to spin up
[2013-10-04 21:59:20 -0400] mattray: re-run and it comes up again
[2013-10-04 21:59:25 -0400] alop: that's strange
