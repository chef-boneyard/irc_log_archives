[2013-10-23 05:08:41 -0400] openstackgerrit: Matt Ray proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Check the recipes rather than the run_list, removed sysctl  https://review.openstack.org/53234
[2013-10-23 08:07:00 -0400] s2r2: good morning.  could anyone point me to where devstack.org/stack.sh.html is created?
[2013-10-23 09:10:03 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: hide .cookbooks testing artifact  https://review.openstack.org/53203
[2013-10-23 12:42:03 -0400] bluenemo: hi guys. i've uploaded the cookbooks with berks successfully, sadly chef client complains that it "could not find recipe account for cookbook openstack-object-storage" berks: http://paste.debian.net/60815/ chef-client: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/5a0fac45/
[2013-10-23 12:43:46 -0400] ultimex: bluenemo, berks install is only for your local station
[2013-10-23 12:44:06 -0400] ultimex: if you are using a chef-server, you must use berks upload
[2013-10-23 12:44:40 -0400] iartarisi: bluenemo: there is no block-storage 'account' recipe, maybe you meant account-server?
[2013-10-23 12:45:01 -0400] iartarisi: erm object-storage
[2013-10-23 12:48:22 -0400] ultimex: bluenemo, forget what i'm saying, I don't see last part of your paste with "uploading"...
[2013-10-23 12:58:06 -0400] bluenemo: iartarisi, i dont get what you tried to explain completely. when I say: knife node run_list add blunix "role[os-object-storage]", shouldnt that be enough?
[2013-10-23 12:58:23 -0400] bluenemo: as in berks upload should upload that, and chef-client should then download and use that?
[2013-10-23 12:58:39 -0400] bluenemo: sorry for all those noob questions :/ i've tried to google but the error is not very well documented.
[2013-10-23 13:02:35 -0400] iartarisi: I think the os-object-storage-account role might be wrong, since there is no account recipe: https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo/blob/master/roles/os-object-storage-account.rb
[2013-10-23 13:03:19 -0400] iartarisi: bluenemo: are you using openstack-chef-repo, btw?
[2013-10-23 13:03:40 -0400] iartarisi: oh, yeah, I saw it now in your paste
[2013-10-23 13:04:34 -0400] bluenemo: iartarisi, but i thought the new role of this node would be "os-object-storage", as specified via role[os-object-storage]
[2013-10-23 13:05:42 -0400] iartarisi: the os-object-storage role includes the os-object-storage-account role
[2013-10-23 13:05:43 -0400] bluenemo: ok this is very nooby but i'm totally puzzled right now; the output of what should i use to specify the anem of the role? knife role list or berks list?
[2013-10-23 13:05:51 -0400] bluenemo: aah ok i c
[2013-10-23 13:05:57 -0400] bluenemo: and that doesnt exist..?
[2013-10-23 13:06:32 -0400] iartarisi: it does, just try changing this line: https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo/blob/master/roles/os-object-storage-account.rb#L5 to say "recipe[openstack-block-storage::acount-server]"
[2013-10-23 13:07:29 -0400] iartarisi: s/block/object/
[2013-10-23 13:07:34 -0400] iartarisi: sorry, I keep saying 'block'
[2013-10-23 13:08:00 -0400] bluenemo: and then berks upload again right?
[2013-10-23 13:09:41 -0400] iartarisi: I don't know, whichever uploads the roles
[2013-10-23 13:16:14 -0400] bluenemo: i'm sure i'm just stupid, still cant get it working :( http://paste.debian.net/hidden/48e48076/
[2013-10-23 13:20:07 -0400] bluenemo: ah i guess i failed uploading (as its still saying account not account-server)
[2013-10-23 15:13:42 -0400] galstrom: so is gating broken at the moment (suse/erlang)?
[2013-10-23 15:13:53 -0400] galstrom: or is that just me
[2013-10-23 15:15:15 -0400] iartarisi: it's using a newer erlang version than the one in the berkshelf.lock file. I have no idea why.
[2013-10-23 15:34:42 -0400] openstackgerrit: Alan Meadows proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-object-storage: Add stats publishing support  https://review.openstack.org/51246
[2013-10-23 15:37:24 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: fixed the error when restarting quantum-server  https://review.openstack.org/51768
[2013-10-23 15:40:30 -0400] galstrom: iartarisi: i blame matt ray
[2013-10-23 15:40:32 -0400] galstrom: :)
[2013-10-23 18:36:16 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: search expanded role list, not just explicit roles  https://review.openstack.org/53152
[2013-10-23 20:13:26 -0400] bluenemo: hi guys. i'm trying out os chef. when i'm trying to install role[os-dashboard] i'm running into an error when compiling the cookbook: No such file or directory - file not found '/etc/chef/openstack_data_bag_secret'   full paste: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/bae5cba2/
[2013-10-23 20:15:04 -0400] alop: bluenemo: can you get the version of the openstack-dashboard cookbook?
[2013-10-23 20:16:44 -0400] bluenemo: ah damn i totally forgot the time.. have to go, be back in 30 minutes. damn it i've got so far now :D
[2013-10-23 20:16:57 -0400] alop: we'll be around
[2013-10-23 20:17:12 -0400] bluenemo: 7.0.0 ;) brb..
[2013-10-23 20:19:47 -0400] alop: bluenemo: when you get back, try setting "developer_mode" = true for now
[2013-10-23 20:24:32 -0400] alop: bluenemo: or just override ["openstack"]["secret"]["key_path"] with something like "/etc/chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret"
[2013-10-23 20:42:36 -0400] bluenemo: alop, back
[2013-10-23 20:43:35 -0400] bluenemo: i think there are no data bags. i'm kind of new (again, few years ago some basic stuff) to chef, i'm using the web interface for the server, which shows no data bags present.
[2013-10-23 20:50:42 -0400] alop: bluenemo: right, so if you have no data bags, I think 'developer mode' (at least for checking it out) would be your best bet
[2013-10-23 20:58:14 -0400] bluenemo: alop, just to be sure you mean    developer_mode   true     in /etc/chef/client.rb on the client machine?
[2013-10-23 20:58:25 -0400] alop: no
[2013-10-23 20:58:28 -0400] alop: uhm
[2013-10-23 20:58:43 -0400] alop: either are a role, or in the environment your machine is in
[2013-10-23 20:59:27 -0400] alop: set ['openstack']['developer_mode'] = true
[2013-10-23 21:00:02 -0400] alop: once you do that, it doesn't require data bags, and uses default passwords for all the accounts
[2013-10-23 21:00:45 -0400] alop: so, either by doing "knife node edit [your machine]"
[2013-10-23 21:09:17 -0400] bluenemo: alop, its opening a json file, in which i put: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/f98003c7/ When i save and exit the editor it tells me: Node not updated, skipping node save. The line is not saved then.
[2013-10-23 21:09:20 -0400] bluenemo: 2
[2013-10-23 21:10:04 -0400] alop: ok
[2013-10-23 21:10:18 -0400] alop: inside the "normal" bracket
[2013-10-23 21:10:25 -0400] alop: you'll need to add
[2013-10-23 21:10:35 -0400] alop: "openstack": {
[2013-10-23 21:10:51 -0400] alop: "developer_mode": "true"
[2013-10-23 21:10:53 -0400] alop: },
[2013-10-23 21:12:26 -0400] alop: not inside 'tags', but above it
[2013-10-23 21:12:32 -0400] bluenemo: hey it worked :) thank you for answering all those nooby questions..
[2013-10-23 21:12:38 -0400] alop: hey, no problem
[2013-10-23 21:12:43 -0400] alop: that's why we're here
[2013-10-23 21:12:59 -0400] bluenemo: my task is to setup openstack.. but i figured i HAVE to use something like chef to set it up (we want to use it in production some time, isp from germany)
[2013-10-23 21:13:38 -0400] alop: lots of nice big companies use these chef cookbooks
[2013-10-23 21:13:42 -0400] bluenemo: i did use chef but its quite some time ago and we rolled out files with it ;) nothing to fancy. but i'm very eager to get into openstack, and very much as well into openstack-chef. so thanks a lot for answering so i can get a setup to learn from :)
[2013-10-23 21:14:00 -0400] bluenemo: jup i saw that :)
[2013-10-23 21:16:10 -0400] bluenemo: hm its complaining about not being able to connect to mysql. http://paste.debian.net/hidden/6e6fd76d/
[2013-10-23 21:17:17 -0400] alop: hrm, most of the services default to sqlite
[2013-10-23 21:17:34 -0400] alop: in production, we use mysql
[2013-10-23 21:17:49 -0400] alop: using the opscode-database and mysql cookbooks
[2013-10-23 21:17:57 -0400] bluenemo: currently i've got Run List:    role[os-base], role[os-dashboard]
[2013-10-23 21:18:13 -0400] bluenemo: role add database?
[2013-10-23 21:22:14 -0400] alop: If you've just started, you'll likely need to install the database and mysql cookbooks from opscode, and then yes, you'd add that to you run_list
[2013-10-23 21:23:11 -0400] alop: make sure you're checking out the readme in https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo
[2013-10-23 21:25:22 -0400] bluenemo: i've just took a look into the berksfile, where under :site opscode   cookbook 'database', '1.5.2' and cookbook 'mysql', '3.0.12' is already included
[2013-10-23 22:01:07 -0400] bluenemo: ok midnight hour around here :) have a good day / night guys ;) cu tomorrow
