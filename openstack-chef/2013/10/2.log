[2013-10-02 19:55:47 -0400] ctracey: jaypipes: are those versions in the CHANGELOG right?
[2013-10-02 19:56:27 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: yes, AFAIK.
[2013-10-02 19:56:55 -0400] ctracey: shouldnt it be 7.0.[01]?
[2013-10-02 19:56:59 -0400] ctracey: or am i missing something?
[2013-10-02 19:57:14 -0400] ctracey: (it coudl def be me) :)
[2013-10-02 19:57:47 -0400] ctracey: 0.7.0 vs 7.0.0
[2013-10-02 19:57:51 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: I believe the last number in semver is a monotonically increasing number indicating minor or bug fixes

[2013-10-02 19:59:53 -0400] ctracey: what im saying is that the versions in CHANGELOG and metadata.rb dont match

[2013-10-02 20:24:59 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: sorry, will fix in a sec.
