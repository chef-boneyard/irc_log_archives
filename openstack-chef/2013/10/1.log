[2013-10-01 18:42:05 -0400] ctracey: is it me or could floating-ip creation be easier? :)
[2013-10-01 18:42:15 -0400] ctracey: seems kinda convoluted
[2013-10-01 18:47:50 -0400] retr0h: lol
[2013-10-01 18:47:51 -0400] retr0h: ya

[2013-10-01 19:26:10 -0400] ctracey: nova-manage works, but nova itself doesnt seem to

[2013-10-01 20:32:03 -0400] ctracey: retr0h: i mean in general...some of the operations stuff is less than intuitive. But, it is much much much better than it had been, so that is a good step in right direction.
