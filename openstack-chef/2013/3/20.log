[2013-03-20 00:08:49 -0400] retr0h: alop: cool story bro lol
[2013-03-20 00:09:08 -0400] alop: colloquy, FTW!
[2013-03-20 14:14:10 -0400] jkordish: so whats the process of changing the provider to quantum in nova-network? can I just do it or are there additional steps? don't want to blow things up but really want to try quantum (looking at sflow capabilities)
[2013-03-20 15:03:40 -0400] rackerjoe: jkordish: there is quite a lot of work involved in switching from nova-network to quantum on the openstack side.  On the cookbook side you will need to set the environment variable nova:network:provider to quantum
[2013-03-20 15:04:24 -0400] rackerjoe: on the openstack side you will need to remove all instances, remove the networks from the database, clean up the interfaces on your compute nodes, and flush iptables (maybe)
[2013-03-20 15:04:38 -0400] rackerjoe: there may be something else that i missed but suffice it to say it is quite a lot of work
[2013-03-20 15:26:24 -0400] jkordish: rackerjoe: oh man. remove all instances :/
[2013-03-20 15:35:53 -0400] jkordish: looking at it. I think I can redo all my instances just fine. what exactly needs to be accomplished on the nodes regarding their interfaces?
[2013-03-20 15:51:04 -0400] Apsu`: You could... probably just hax the database appropriately. But that's likely to be more painful than removing the instances :P
