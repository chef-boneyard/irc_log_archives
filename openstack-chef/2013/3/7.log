[2013-03-07 20:11:42 -0500] mattray: hey rackers, is demo.rcb.me not up?
[2013-03-07 20:23:08 -0500] rackerjoe: mattray: it does not appear to be up
[2013-03-07 20:23:46 -0500] mattray: just trying a little final testing before pushing out knife-openstack 0.7.0
[2013-03-07 20:26:40 -0500] rackerjoe: trying to find out from our support folks to see if they were doing anything to it
[2013-03-07 20:30:19 -0500] mattray: I haven't changed anything since my last batch of testing, Fog's finally got a new release out so I can push out knife-openstack
[2013-03-07 20:30:28 -0500] mattray: sanity checking
