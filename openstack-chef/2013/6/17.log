[2013-06-17 14:33:23 -0400] ritesh: Hello is there any way to disable pki in openstack-identity cookbooks.
[2013-06-17 14:33:33 -0400] ritesh: so that it works on http only.
[2013-06-17 14:36:26 -0400] ritesh: insecure = node["openstack"]["auth"]["validate_certs"] ? "" : " --insecure"
[2013-06-17 14:36:43 -0400] ritesh: what this insecure variable does?
[2013-06-17 14:36:55 -0400] iartarisi: ritesh: you might try: node["openstack"]["endpoints"]["identity-api"]["scheme"] = "http" (if I understand you correctly)
[2013-06-17 14:37:48 -0400] ritesh: ok iartarisi i will just give a try.
[2013-06-17 14:38:30 -0400] ritesh: So this is needed to be mentioned in which file.
[2013-06-17 14:38:37 -0400] ritesh: under attributes?
