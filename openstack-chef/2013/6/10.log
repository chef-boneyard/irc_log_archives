[2013-06-10 16:08:48 -0400] alop: sure
[2013-06-10 16:08:48 -0400] torandu: i have other changes that depend on this going through
[2013-06-10 16:08:51 -0400] torandu: thx!
[2013-06-10 16:15:07 -0400] alop: torandu: I only have +1, so...
[2013-06-10 16:27:03 -0400] ctracey: is it me or is LP really slow?
[2013-06-10 16:28:16 -0400] ctracey: and/or review.openstack.org
[2013-06-10 16:28:53 -0400] torandu: ctracey: yes, seems slow
[2013-06-10 16:30:00 -0400] ctracey: ill actually probably have a messaging CB to submit today
[2013-06-10 16:30:06 -0400] ctracey: trimming it up
[2013-06-10 16:30:10 -0400] ctracey: no tests yest
[2013-06-10 16:30:13 -0400] ctracey: yet*

[2013-06-10 20:45:53 -0400] torandu: whew! i think that's the last one. :)
[2013-06-10 20:50:12 -0400] torandu: quick review, if anyone has time: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/32419/
[2013-06-10 20:51:19 -0400] torandu: i'm going to move forward w/ adding tailor to the other cookbooks, then will update gate jobs to run the style check
[2013-06-10 20:52:26 -0400] torandu: i'm also going to update gate jobs to run strainer test tasks. will replace the old way
[2013-06-10 20:53:14 -0400] torandu: in case anyone is new to strainer, you can run a single test task like so, e.g: bundle exec strainer test -o chefspec
[2013-06-10 20:54:20 -0400] torandu: much faster than running the whole thing during dev when you might only need/ want to run chefspec tests
[2013-06-10 20:58:54 -0400] torandu: ctracey: oh, i see that you already opened a ticket to add tailor
[2013-06-10 20:59:11 -0400] torandu: ctracey: is that something you're actively working on?

[2013-06-10 21:38:34 -0400] torandu: whoops. didn't mean to do that one...
[2013-06-10 21:38:41 -0400] torandu: already pending
[2013-06-10 21:38:43 -0400] torandu: i'll fix it
[2013-06-10 21:50:26 -0400] openstackgerrit: Sean Gallagher proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image: Add tailor ruby style check  https://review.openstack.org/32486

[2013-06-10 22:15:47 -0400] ctracey: torandu: yes I was, although I have been working feverishly to stand up an environment
[2013-06-10 22:16:25 -0400] ctracey: I am trying to catch up again, and will likely have a little time to devote to this and other openstack cookbook tasks
[2013-06-10 22:16:38 -0400] ctracey: in fact I have a few changes almost ready to commit
[2013-06-10 22:22:04 -0400] torandu: ctracey: doh. sorry. i moved forward. :/
[2013-06-10 22:22:56 -0400] ctracey: torandu: no worries. i have been slacking in here for the last week or so.
[2013-06-10 22:23:19 -0400] ctracey: good news is that I stood up (most of) my environment from these cookbooks.
[2013-06-10 22:23:32 -0400] ctracey: and what wasnt there I will submit changes for.
[2013-06-10 22:23:37 -0400] torandu: ctracey: thx for understanding. i'm trying to get test stuff updated across all cookbooks so i can move forward w/ updates to jenkins jobs
[2013-06-10 22:23:51 -0400] torandu: ctracey: great!
[2013-06-10 22:24:01 -0400] ctracey: trust me - last thing I want to think about is tailor :)
[2013-06-10 22:24:43 -0400] torandu: heh. me too. would like to get it done (finally) and move on to more interesting things
[2013-06-10 22:32:00 -0400] torandu: ok. looks like pull requests are in to add tailor for all cookbooks
[2013-06-10 22:33:16 -0400] torandu: in case anyone has time to review...(thx)
[2013-06-10 22:50:06 -0400] torandu: interesting. i discovered that strainer will exit 0 if the label doesn't exist in Strainerfile
[2013-06-10 22:50:47 -0400] torandu: so, looks like i can move forward w/ updates to gate jobs without having to wait for all tailor changes to be accepted/ merged
