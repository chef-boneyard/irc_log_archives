[2013-06-13 16:12:35 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: you around? I really need some assistance on something...
[2013-06-13 16:13:17 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: sent a note to the ML late last night about it. Basically, I can't figure out why the mysql_database and mysql_database_user LWRPs are not firing.
[2013-06-13 16:13:38 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: and I see no output at all in chef-client when running -ldebug from the database cookbook.
[2013-06-13 16:14:37 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I've put LOG.info writeouts before and after the calls to mysql_database and mysql_database_user and I've verified that the parameters being passed to the resource providers are correct, but I see nothing in the log output from the database cookbook that it attempted to do anything at all.
[2013-06-13 16:14:56 -0400] mattray: I saw your post, seems curious but I haven't dug into it yet
[2013-06-13 16:15:25 -0400] mattray: what has changed? It was working before?
[2013-06-13 16:16:05 -0400] jaypipes: brand new env... this is trying to set up the mysql database for Gerrit.
[2013-06-13 16:16:15 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: in our CI node...
[2013-06-13 16:16:26 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I do see a lot of these messages in the log output, though:
[2013-06-13 16:16:27 -0400] jaypipes: WARN: Cloning resource attributes for chef_gem[mysql] from prior resource (CHEF-3694)
[2013-06-13 16:16:33 -0400] jaypipes: not sure if that is a concern?
[2013-06-13 16:17:41 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: I've got to go run a 30 minute errand, but I'll be back and look at mysql_database with you
[2013-06-13 16:18:02 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: thx man
[2013-06-13 19:23:04 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: you see my email?
[2013-06-13 19:35:38 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: reading it now
[2013-06-13 19:35:57 -0400] mattray: that mysql_testing recipe is pretty stripped down
[2013-06-13 19:36:57 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: should I pull that mysql_test recipe into our cookbook and see if it works?
[2013-06-13 19:37:48 -0400] mattray: sure, it should work
[2013-06-13 19:38:25 -0400] mattray: :)
[2013-06-13 19:38:28 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: are there supposed to be log debug statements from the database cookbook?
[2013-06-13 19:38:55 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: also, why should mysql::ruby and mysql::server need to be included?
[2013-06-13 19:39:17 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: we are include_recipe'ing database::mysql... that should be ennough, no?
[2013-06-13 19:39:33 -0400] mattray: lemme go check database]
[2013-06-13 19:40:11 -0400] mattray: database::mysql brings in the mysql::ruby
[2013-06-13 19:40:23 -0400] mattray: mysql::server is for giving me a server to test with
[2013-06-13 19:40:43 -0400] mattray: running with -l debug now to see if there's anything
[2013-06-13 19:43:21 -0400] mattray: https://gist.github.com/mattray/5776715
[2013-06-13 19:43:26 -0400] mattray: there is debug output
[2013-06-13 19:43:40 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: nope... for me, does not work.
[2013-06-13 19:44:05 -0400] mattray: hrmm...
[2013-06-13 19:44:06 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I get no calls in log output from database cookbook.
[2013-06-13 19:44:18 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: how do I check which version of a cookboook I have again?
[2013-06-13 19:44:25 -0400] mattray: knife cookbook show database

[2013-06-13 19:45:08 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: 1.3.4
[2013-06-13 19:45:14 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: what version are you on?
[2013-06-13 19:45:17 -0400] mattray: 1.4.0
[2013-06-13 19:45:29 -0400] jaypipes: hmm, ok... lemme update it
[2013-06-13 19:45:34 -0400] mattray: - [COOK-2561]: `mysql_database_user` can't set global grants
[2013-06-13 19:45:36 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: perhaps a chef11 thing?
[2013-06-13 19:45:40 -0400] mattray: that's fixed in 1.4.0
[2013-06-13 19:45:43 -0400] jaypipes: aha
[2013-06-13 19:45:46 -0400] jaypipes: :)
[2013-06-13 19:45:54 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: you give me hope, Obi Wan
[2013-06-13 19:46:14 -0400] mattray: there are a bunch of grant issues after 1.3.4
[2013-06-13 19:46:35 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/database/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
[2013-06-13 19:47:55 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: root@a12r1.dal2 19:47:30:~# knife cookbook show database
[2013-06-13 19:47:56 -0400] jaypipes: database   1.4.1  1.3.4
[2013-06-13 19:48:08 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: how do I ensure 1.4.1 is used?
[2013-06-13 19:48:23 -0400] jaypipes: after uploading 1.4.1, I re-run chef-client and get the same results as before...
[2013-06-13 19:48:29 -0400] mattray: knife cookbook delete database 1.3.4
[2013-06-13 19:48:38 -0400] mattray: and 1.4.1 is the development version
[2013-06-13 19:49:24 -0400] mattray: but should be safe, the version bump is the only commit post-1.4.0
[2013-06-13 19:49:27 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: fuug. same friggin results... no log output, no database created.
[2013-06-13 19:49:59 -0400] mattray: does just running mysql_test by itself work?
[2013-06-13 19:50:04 -0400] mattray: nothing else in the run list?
[2013-06-13 19:53:26 -0400] mattray: my test setup is ubuntu12.04 with latest bits, database 1.4.0 and mysql 3.0.2
[2013-06-13 19:53:35 -0400] mattray: chef 11.4.4
[2013-06-13 19:53:55 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: yes, the test recipe, alone, works...
[2013-06-13 19:54:20 -0400] mattray: ok maybe start layering on pieces and wait for breakage?
[2013-06-13 19:55:05 -0400] mattray: how about this do you have more than 1 resource with the same name?
[2013-06-13 19:55:06 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: is there something about code in a library code file that screws with resource execution?
[2013-06-13 19:55:12 -0400] mattray: mysql_database "install reviewdb"
[2013-06-13 19:55:20 -0400] mattray: maybe that gets called multiple times?
[2013-06-13 19:55:41 -0400] jaypipes: no
[2013-06-13 19:57:37 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: what I want to know is why there's not a single piece of log output from the database cookbook...
[2013-06-13 19:57:43 -0400] mattray: nothing that happens by database.. mysql::ruby makes build-essential go before everything else
[2013-06-13 19:58:06 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: it's like it literally just skips over the calls to mysql_database and mysql_database_user :(
[2013-06-13 19:58:17 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: was there logging when you ran mysql_test by itself?
[2013-06-13 19:58:21 -0400] jaypipes: yup
[2013-06-13 19:58:48 -0400] mattray: so something in the other recipes you're applying is mucking with it...
[2013-06-13 19:59:51 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: how does one diagnose or debug this stuff? :(
[2013-06-13 20:00:10 -0400] jaypipes: would a call to node.save mess with it?
[2013-06-13 20:00:28 -0400] retr0h: what if we did this
[2013-06-13 20:00:33 -0400] retr0h: commented out everything
[2013-06-13 20:00:44 -0400] retr0h: so all you have is cookbook ci
[2013-06-13 20:00:49 -0400] retr0h: making the calls
[2013-06-13 20:01:06 -0400] retr0h: or gerrit cookbook making the calls.. whichever it is
[2013-06-13 20:01:10 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h: this isn't even cookbook ci... it's just the gerrit cookboook.
[2013-06-13 20:01:26 -0400] retr0h: gerrit cookbook is called by ci cookbook
[2013-06-13 20:01:35 -0400] retr0h: what if we just add gerrit cookbook to the runlist
[2013-06-13 20:01:36 -0400] jaypipes: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[2013-06-13 20:01:39 -0400] retr0h: and remoed the other shiz
[2013-06-13 20:01:44 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h: already did that
[2013-06-13 20:01:56 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h: we did that ealier... and verified the database cookbook is working properly.
[2013-06-13 20:02:10 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h: the issue I believe is that the gerrit::server recipe defines a variable called mysql_server.
[2013-06-13 20:02:26 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h: and the database::mysql recipe probably has a similarly-named variable
[2013-06-13 20:02:32 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h: I bet that is it...
[2013-06-13 20:02:35 -0400] retr0h: oh
[2013-06-13 20:02:37 -0400] retr0h: interesting
[2013-06-13 20:05:13 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: does ruby/chef not have any concept of namespaces? will a variable in one recipe overload a variable in another recipe of the same name?
[2013-06-13 20:05:40 -0400] mattray: when you depend on the database cookbook, you're importing it
[2013-06-13 20:05:45 -0400] mattray: to get the methods
[2013-06-13 20:05:57 -0400] mattray: from the library
[2013-06-13 20:06:15 -0400] mattray: is your gerrit cookbook using it?
[2013-06-13 20:06:37 -0400] retr0h: gerrit cookbook includes mysql and database
[2013-06-13 20:06:48 -0400] retr0h: and has depends on those
[2013-06-13 20:07:31 -0400] mattray: maybe this? https://github.com/att-cloud/cookbook-gerrit/blob/master/recipes/server.rb#L56
[2013-06-13 20:08:50 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I just replaced mysql_server with "server_info"... getting same issues :(
[2013-06-13 20:09:05 -0400] mattray: and there's the straight requires on 'mysql'
[2013-06-13 20:09:09 -0400] mattray: what's that for?
[2013-06-13 20:10:04 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: there is a libraries/manage_users.rb file that makes straight calls to MySQL
[2013-06-13 20:13:27 -0400] jaypipes: I think my annoyance is mostly the lack of any debug ability or log output...
[2013-06-13 20:17:08 -0400] mattray: yeah libraries bring an extra level of ruby "magic" to things that are hard to debug. I'm not enough of a rubyist to have a good answer
[2013-06-13 20:24:03 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: SUSE specific apache2 locations  https://review.openstack.org/30684
[2013-06-13 20:24:50 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: add tests for ceilometer-api  https://review.openstack.org/31760

[2013-06-13 20:45:48 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: ok, so I moved the database creation stuff outside the gerrit::server recipe and into its own gerrit::db recipe. I add that recipe ABOVE the role[ci] (which includes recipe[gerrit::server]), run chef-client, and no calls to mysql_database happen. However, if I remove role[ci] from the run list, leaving recipe[gerrit::db], the datasbe and user get created properly.
[2013-06-13 20:46:01 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: so why on Earth isn't the run list being executed in proper order?
[2013-06-13 20:46:31 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: why would having role[ci] in the runlist (again, AFTER recipe[gerrit::db]) mean that gerrit::db doesn't get run?
[2013-06-13 20:49:58 -0400] mattray: do a knife node show NODE after each run and look at the Recipes: output, is there a spurious include_recipe somewhere that's getting overlooked and changing the application order?
[2013-06-13 20:55:54 -0400] jaypipes: man I am so friggin frustrated right now... the lack of debugging statements is killing me. it's like large swathes of the recipe are literally being ignored.
[2013-06-13 20:56:45 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: have you tried using chef-shell?
[2013-06-13 20:56:47 -0400] mattray: http://docs.opscode.com/chef_shell.html
[2013-06-13 20:58:45 -0400] jaypipes: no, and I really dion't have time to learn yet another ruby program/library
[2013-06-13 21:01:50 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: alright, I'm fed up with this... I look at the debug output and chef is literally skipping from 40 to 170 and not executing any of the directory, script, user, group or file resource blocks in the recipe... guh.
[2013-06-13 21:02:36 -0400] jaypipes: there should at the very least be debug log lines saying "create group blah, already found"... but there's nothing. it goes from a data_bag_item() call skips 130 lines of the recipe, and sets a node attribute.
[2013-06-13 21:02:49 -0400] jaypipes: wtf
[2013-06-13 21:05:15 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: could you gist the recipe?
[2013-06-13 21:05:52 -0400] jaypipes: it's the one you linked above...
[2013-06-13 21:07:43 -0400] mattray: knife node show FOO -a gerrit
[2013-06-13 21:07:53 -0400] mattray: is db.type == MYSQL?
[2013-06-13 21:10:01 -0400] jaypipes: yes
[2013-06-13 21:10:19 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: actually, if you could just give me a PM of a private gist of the debug output I'll see if I see anything
[2013-06-13 21:10:31 -0400] mattray: and a knife node show FOO -l
[2013-06-13 21:10:55 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: that;'s the point... there's no debug output. it skips from making a HTTP request for the data bag to Gerrit site initialized...
[2013-06-13 21:11:18 -0400] jaypipes: but doesn't run any of the resources from around line 40 to line 130
[2013-06-13 21:11:23 -0400] jaypipes: sorry, line 170
[2013-06-13 21:11:28 -0400] jaypipes: just skips right over em
[2013-06-13 21:14:12 -0400] mattray: throw some Chef::Log.fatal!() in there around the initstate and some of the other variables, something is probably set that is short-circuiting a bunch of these
[2013-06-13 21:14:59 -0400] mattray: it's the initstates
[2013-06-13 21:15:13 -0400] mattray: the node.save is saving them to the node, so even on failures it's already set
[2013-06-13 21:15:31 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/att-cloud/cookbook-gerrit/blob/master/recipes/server.rb#L73
[2013-06-13 21:15:35 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: ^^
[2013-06-13 21:15:36 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I am resetting that every time.
[2013-06-13 21:16:02 -0400] mattray: but they're getting set to "ok" before the DB is created
[2013-06-13 21:16:31 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: we are past the db getting created... I had to do it manually.
[2013-06-13 21:16:51 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: now none of the script/group/directory/template blocks are being run... none of ti.
[2013-06-13 21:17:12 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/att-cloud/cookbook-gerrit/blob/master/recipes/server.rb#L179
[2013-06-13 21:17:16 -0400] mattray: blocking on initstate too
[2013-06-13 21:17:35 -0400] jaypipes: I just said, that I am resetting that on every time I run chef-client
[2013-06-13 21:19:13 -0400] jaypipes: honestly, trying to fix shit in chef just makes me want to cry.
[2013-06-13 21:19:17 -0400] jaypipes: it's a giant black box.
[2013-06-13 21:19:39 -0400] Apsu`: A terrible, smelly black box, full of spikes and shame.
[2013-06-13 21:21:53 -0400] mattray: Chef 11 changed the application of attributes to nodes. Every node['foo'] = 'bar' is evaluated up front
[2013-06-13 21:22:28 -0400] mattray: this removed race conditions between cookbooks, roles and attribute files
[2013-06-13 21:22:37 -0400] mattray: applying values to attributes
[2013-06-13 21:22:48 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/att-cloud/cookbook-gerrit/blob/master/recipes/server.rb#L213
[2013-06-13 21:23:01 -0400] mattray: node.set_unless["gerrit"]["init_state"] = "ok"
[2013-06-13 21:23:05 -0400] mattray: it's always "ok"
[2013-06-13 21:23:23 -0400] jaypipes: wtf
[2013-06-13 21:23:31 -0400] mattray: this is why it's safe to do attribute operations in attribute files now
[2013-06-13 21:23:33 -0400] jaypipes: that is the most retarded thing I've ever read
[2013-06-13 21:23:56 -0400] jaypipes: honestly, this is the kind of thing that everyone hates about chef.
[2013-06-13 21:24:32 -0400] jaypipes: the whole converge/compile shit and never knowing when a node attribute is actually set or not... it drives people through the roof -- and towards salt and puppet.
[2013-06-13 21:24:32 -0400] mattray: http://docs.opscode.com/breaking_changes_chef_11.html#role-and-environment-attribute-changes
[2013-06-13 21:25:13 -0400] jaypipes: fuuuuug.
[2013-06-13 21:25:42 -0400] mattray: we got rid of the variable timing
[2013-06-13 21:25:54 -0400] jaypipes: talk about introducing a lovely way to screw up every comlpex cookbook that relies on setting node attributes at specific times in order to verify state
[2013-06-13 21:26:15 -0400] jaypipes: and even worse, introducing it and having zero debug output telling you what is going on.
[2013-06-13 21:26:20 -0400] mattray: http://community.opscode.com/chat/openstack-chef#id-376807
[2013-06-13 21:26:24 -0400] jaypipes: what a waste of my last 48 hours fucking with this shit.
[2013-06-13 21:28:57 -0400] mattray: I know I had to debug the old behavior with you guys too, so I can't win
[2013-06-13 21:29:10 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: if the link above is intended to get me to calm down, it didn't work.
[2013-06-13 21:29:37 -0400] mattray: no, someone asked me for the log to see what set you off
[2013-06-13 21:29:46 -0400] mattray: and I mis-pasted
[2013-06-13 21:30:23 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: hey, we wouldn't have even had to go this route if there was a decent community cookbook for either gerrit or jenkins... :(
[2013-06-13 21:31:44 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: and while I understand you worked with us to debug old behaviour -- and that is appreciated -- neither the old behaviour *nor* this new behaviour, is what any sane person would expect.
[2013-06-13 21:32:02 -0400] retr0h: so
[2013-06-13 21:32:06 -0400] retr0h: is init state necesary?
[2013-06-13 21:32:26 -0400] retr0h: seems each resource should know what it should do
[2013-06-13 21:32:35 -0400] retr0h: based on what it is modifying
[2013-06-13 21:32:49 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h: it IS, but because of the change of behaviour in chef11, there is no way to set an attribute at a particular point in the recipe :( !!!
[2013-06-13 21:33:04 -0400] retr0h: why do we need that attribute
[2013-06-13 21:33:08 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h: setting node attributes is now done at compile time...
[2013-06-13 21:33:21 -0400] retr0h: sure
[2013-06-13 21:33:26 -0400] retr0h: but why are we needing to care about init state
[2013-06-13 21:33:38 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h: because without it, you need to jump through hoops in order to prevent gerrit and its silly Java configuration crap from repeating itself over and over again.
[2013-06-13 21:34:00 -0400] retr0h: well for this
[2013-06-13 21:34:00 -0400] retr0h: https://github.com/att-cloud/cookbook-gerrit/blob/master/recipes/server.rb#L179
[2013-06-13 21:34:12 -0400] retr0h: the not_if should check if the file exists
[2013-06-13 21:34:16 -0400] retr0h: not for node attributes
[2013-06-13 21:34:30 -0400] retr0h: no?
[2013-06-13 21:34:45 -0400] retr0h: same for this initstate
[2013-06-13 21:34:51 -0400] retr0h: https://github.com/att-cloud/cookbook-gerrit/blob/master/recipes/server.rb#L190
[2013-06-13 21:35:10 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h: what bothers me is this crap worked in 10 and suddently stopped working in 11, and what's more, there is zero information in the log files as to what the heck is going on.
[2013-06-13 21:35:19 -0400] retr0h: jaypipes: sure
[2013-06-13 21:35:30 -0400] retr0h: im just trying to see how we can get this deployed
[2013-06-13 21:35:35 -0400] retr0h: we ant really revert to chef 10
[2013-06-13 21:35:37 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h: for example, it attempts to execute the library manage_users calls BEFORE trying to create the database.
[2013-06-13 21:35:47 -0400] jaypipes: I have no idea why, but I've proven as much in dal2.
[2013-06-13 21:38:47 -0400] hippiehacker: anyone up for chatting about multinode testing?
[2013-06-13 21:39:04 -0400] retr0h: let me see what i can do
[2013-06-13 21:39:24 -0400] jaypipes: hippiehacker: real nodes or VMs?
[2013-06-13 21:39:47 -0400] hippiehacker: I've been doing both
[2013-06-13 21:39:54 -0400] hippiehacker: and they are longstanding (not brought up on demand)
[2013-06-13 21:40:09 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: I sent hippiehacker off to work on your thread from the other day
[2013-06-13 21:40:12 -0400] jaypipes: hippiehacker: were you the one who submitted vagrant tests for openstack-chef-repo?
[2013-06-13 21:40:36 -0400] hippiehacker: not yet 8) but that sounds interesting
[2013-06-13 21:41:57 -0400] hippiehacker: I've been using a ci/cd app pipeline to test multi nodes, but it's a bit of a different design from what was on the thread... in that the artifacts are shoved into a long running chef server and the pinning happens with chef-environments not berksfiles
[2013-06-13 21:43:05 -0400] jaypipes: hippiehacker: ok, but same concept at least...
[2013-06-13 21:43:33 -0400] mattray: and the chef server will be chef-zero, so no external dependency
[2013-06-13 21:43:47 -0400] jaypipes: what is chef-zero?
[2013-06-13 21:45:00 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/jkeiser/chef-zero
[2013-06-13 21:45:22 -0400] mattray: in memory chef server, intended for testing and replacing chef-solo
[2013-06-13 21:46:19 -0400] mattray: already has vagrant and berkshelf support
[2013-06-13 21:46:40 -0400] mattray: but it'll make multi-node testing feasible without a full-blown chef server
[2013-06-13 21:50:01 -0400] jaypipes: hmm, ok. sounds cool.
[2013-06-13 21:50:38 -0400] hippiehacker: how do you currently spin up nodes... Vagrant on each ci box?
[2013-06-13 21:52:04 -0400] jaypipes: hippiehacker: we don't currently spin up nodes in ci... that's the problem. We run into one issue after another... chef-workflow not compat with ChefSpec, test-ktichen not ready for prime-time and not particularly built for multinode testing, etc etc
[2013-06-13 21:52:22 -0400] jaypipes: hippiehacker: so we end up doing a crap load of manual testing, which we absolutely hate.
[2013-06-13 21:53:02 -0400] mattray: yeah, we definitely need a viable CI story for multi-node testing
[2013-06-13 21:53:52 -0400] mattray: for plugging into CI pipelines (like StackForge)
[2013-06-13 21:54:26 -0400] jaypipes: hippiehacker: add to that and there's no good way even now to test ordered node installation properly. for example, you cannot ensure that node A converges and builds before node B... isntead you have to do silly crap like just keep reexecuting chef-client until "stuff converges"
[2013-06-13 21:57:07 -0400] jaypipes: hippiehacker: add to that there's no good way of testing complex networking setup... one of the things that I find frustrating is that we need a two-stage chef deployment -- one stage to set udev rules and network interfaces properly, and another stage that must be run after the original stage has rebooted the nodes, otherwise networking attributes and setup is borked.
[2013-06-13 21:58:28 -0400] jaypipes: hippiehacker: that's one of the reasons I prefer the "just describe what the environment should look like" approach of Salt much better than the mess of "here's some declarative stuff, here's some logical stuff, and here's some procedural code to run in random places" that Chef is composed of.
[2013-06-13 21:59:46 -0400] jaypipes: but I've probably said too much... I'm cranky and angry about losing so much time on this...
[2013-06-13 22:00:09 -0400] jaypipes: it's not that Salt is without faults... heck, it doesn't even support networking setup for non-RedHat systems!
[2013-06-13 22:00:40 -0400] jaypipes: but it's simple architecture and design is what makes it attractive vs the messy complexity (IMHO, unwarranted) of Chef's many objects
[2013-06-13 22:01:06 -0400] jaypipes: s/it's/its
[2013-06-13 23:52:23 -0400] hippiehacker: jaypipes: sorry I had to step away for lunch, catching up
