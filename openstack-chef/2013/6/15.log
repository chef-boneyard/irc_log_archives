[2013-06-15 06:08:01 -0400] spheromak: I don't like how everything is a monolithic "repo" in salt. I don't like that it wants you to describe the world.  not to be a full fanboi I agree with you on much of the chef woes.
[2013-06-15 06:08:31 -0400] spheromak: I've been able to do multi-machine builds with chef (with openstack) with the  stuff I laid out in my email.  Its all a bit rough still.
[2013-06-15 06:08:52 -0400] spheromak: basically what I heard there was you want orchistration, and theres no defacto/baked in orch in chef.
[2013-06-15 06:09:07 -0400] spheromak: fidn an executor an use it then
[2013-06-15 06:09:11 -0400] spheromak: or build something for chef. :)
