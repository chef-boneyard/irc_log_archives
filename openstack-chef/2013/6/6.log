[2013-06-06 22:28:54 -0400] carlp: mattray: Any thoughts on my either-or question about quantum and nova integration a few weeks back?
[2013-06-06 22:29:23 -0400] mattray: carlp: refresh my memory?
[2013-06-06 22:30:25 -0400] carlp: Do we want to wrap nova-compute like we do with quantum, or have a recipe in the quantum driver cookbook which writes the correct /etc/nova.conf.d file for networking?
[2013-06-06 22:32:11 -0400] mattray: wrap nova-compute? you mean openstack-networking depends on openstack-compute?
[2013-06-06 22:32:28 -0400] mattray: and the nova-network recipe is inside of openstack-networking?
[2013-06-06 22:32:51 -0400] carlp: no - I mean nova-compute is generic, then nova-compute-ovs, nova-compute-midonet, nova-compute-linuxbridge....
[2013-06-06 22:33:56 -0400] mattray: hmmm...
[2013-06-06 22:34:28 -0400] mattray: or an openstack-midonet that provides compute-midonet and networking-midonet?
[2013-06-06 22:34:58 -0400] mattray: wrapping openstack-compute and openstack-networking

[2013-06-06 22:48:42 -0400] carlp: I just wasn't sure since you need to make nova changes depending on quantum driver

[2013-06-06 22:50:07 -0400] spheromak: mattray, we just wrapped up our internal alpha deploy on old work. so hopefully this month we'll be getting more eyballs involved here.
[2013-06-06 22:50:46 -0400] mattray: spheromak: awesome
[2013-06-06 22:51:06 -0400] mattray: carlp: I think that openstack-midonet approach makes sense the more I think about it
[2013-06-06 22:51:13 -0400] mattray: carlp: how about you?
[2013-06-06 22:51:21 -0400] spheromak: its more of a Top level cook right.
[2013-06-06 22:51:26 -0400] spheromak: so ok to wrap both ?
[2013-06-06 22:51:28 -0400] mattray: also http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KNIFE-296 :(
[2013-06-06 22:51:40 -0400] mattray: spheromak: yeah, I think so
[2013-06-06 22:52:23 -0400] spheromak: mattray, heh @ that ticket. . gonna need namespaces for knife plugins
[2013-06-06 22:52:39 -0400] mattray: spheromak: they're coming.
[2013-06-06 22:52:49 -0400] spheromak: yea
[2013-06-06 22:53:05 -0400] mattray: spheromak: https://github.com/opscode/knife-cloud
[2013-06-06 22:53:12 -0400] mattray: refactor is coming
[2013-06-06 22:53:30 -0400] spheromak: nice nice
[2013-06-06 22:53:35 -0400] spheromak: looking now :D
[2013-06-06 22:53:53 -0400] spheromak: boo no code on feature branches
[2013-06-06 22:54:32 -0400] mattray: spheromak: identifying core refactoring components right now
[2013-06-06 22:54:40 -0400] spheromak: yea
[2013-06-06 22:54:45 -0400] mattray: today's my first day on the job :)
[2013-06-06 22:54:58 -0400] spheromak: this is hjsut around th3ese plugins. not the knife plugin system in general ? or is it a side-effect ?
[2013-06-06 22:55:06 -0400] spheromak: ack sorry
[2013-06-06 22:55:18 -0400] spheromak: so excited I can't type aparently (not that i was ever good at it anyhow)
[2013-06-06 22:55:44 -0400] mattray: knife-cloud will be the base class
[2013-06-06 22:55:55 -0400] spheromak: yea for all cloud plugins
[2013-06-06 22:55:56 -0400] spheromak: nice
[2013-06-06 22:55:58 -0400] mattray: common between knife-ec2/openstack/etc.
[2013-06-06 22:56:14 -0400] spheromak: was saying  in a broader sense the knife-plugin system could use love
[2013-06-06 22:56:21 -0400] spheromak: but this is great
[2013-06-06 22:56:38 -0400] mattray: spheromak: more coming on that, we should be adding yet another ticket review, just for knife and ohai
[2013-06-06 22:56:54 -0400] mattray: gotta run, dinner time
[2013-06-06 22:56:58 -0400] spheromak: whee
[2013-06-06 22:57:21 -0400] mattray: but today's my first day in Engineering and this is the stuff I'll be working on
[2013-06-06 22:57:28 -0400] mattray: OpenStack and knife plugins
