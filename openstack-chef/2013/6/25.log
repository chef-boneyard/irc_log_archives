[2013-06-25 18:13:35 -0400] retr0h: mattray: am i crazy did network attributes change slightly in chef 11?
[2013-06-25 18:13:59 -0400] mattray: Not that I'm aware of like what?
[2013-06-25 18:15:01 -0400] retr0h: mattray: http://paste.openstack.org/show/39217/
[2013-06-25 18:15:14 -0400] retr0h: I used to have to [0][0] at the end of the select
[2013-06-25 18:15:46 -0400] retr0h: i am sure I am doing something wrong
[2013-06-25 18:15:54 -0400] retr0h: just not sure what
[2013-06-25 18:17:20 -0400] mattray: retr0h: that would be from ohai hasn't been a release of that since January
[2013-06-25 18:17:58 -0400] retr0h: mattray: right right.. just wondering can you point me to the proper syntax..
[2013-06-25 18:18:08 -0400] retr0h: what am i doing wrong or should be doing?
[2013-06-25 18:20:00 -0400] mattray: looking

[2013-06-25 18:29:57 -0400] mattray: retr0h: what are you trying to do?
[2013-06-25 18:30:10 -0400] retr0h: obtain IP address for the given interface
[2013-06-25 18:30:34 -0400] retr0h: just doing what i done before, just done'st seme tow ork
[2013-06-25 18:30:36 -0400] retr0h: http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2011-08/msg00091.html
[2013-06-25 18:30:40 -0400] retr0h: references this as well
[2013-06-25 18:38:16 -0400] mattray: retr0h: f.keys[0] works
[2013-06-25 18:41:47 -0400] mattray: not sure what changed, asking around
[2013-06-25 18:44:04 -0400] retr0h: yah... something seems diff... so was just wondering what I was doing wrong
[2013-06-25 19:20:56 -0400] ctracey`: retr0h: i have noticed that too
[2013-06-25 19:21:05 -0400] ctracey`: i have a change coming for that
[2013-06-25 19:21:24 -0400] ctracey`: you looking to get the ip of an interface?
[2013-06-25 19:21:54 -0400] retr0h: oh hey ctracey`
[2013-06-25 19:22:13 -0400] retr0h: I remember you were working on a patch to opentack-common to obtain IP of interface
[2013-06-25 19:22:14 -0400] ctracey`: hola
[2013-06-25 19:22:32 -0400] ctracey`: i believe i have it ready to go
[2013-06-25 19:22:34 -0400] retr0h: I had gotten feedback for a couple cookbooks to not use the ohai plugin and rather add this to common
[2013-06-25 19:22:50 -0400] retr0h: mind submitting that under 1.3.0 version of common?
[2013-06-25 19:23:14 -0400] ctracey`: https://github.com/craigtracey/cookbook-openstack-common/commit/fd76ceed0a5211f1a2ec040e2154130de6f2e9bf
[2013-06-25 19:23:23 -0400] ctracey`: i am a little jammed up at the moment
[2013-06-25 19:23:26 -0400] retr0h: ok
[2013-06-25 19:23:30 -0400] retr0h: i'll send in the review
[2013-06-25 19:23:35 -0400] retr0h: and u guys can comment on it
[2013-06-25 19:23:40 -0400] retr0h: that way we can get ball rolling
[2013-06-25 19:23:42 -0400] ctracey`: does that look legit to you?
[2013-06-25 19:24:09 -0400] retr0h: yah.. let me take a look a bit, i have tests written so i'll plug it into the tests
[2013-06-25 19:24:17 -0400] ctracey`: up to my eyeballs in nova baremetal
[2013-06-25 19:24:18 -0400] retr0h: gimme a bout 30 min if that cool?
[2013-06-25 19:24:23 -0400] retr0h: ctracey`: lol
[2013-06-25 19:24:26 -0400] ctracey`: this needs some SERIOUS documentation
[2013-06-25 19:24:39 -0400] retr0h: ctracey`: u using nova-conductor ?
[2013-06-25 19:24:46 -0400] retr0h: i worry about relying even more on rabbit lol
[2013-06-25 19:25:03 -0400] ctracey`: yes
[2013-06-25 19:25:16 -0400] ctracey`: problem is in the driver itself
[2013-06-25 19:25:22 -0400] ctracey`: poorly documented
[2013-06-25 19:25:29 -0400] ctracey`: and a heavy ubuntu slant
[2013-06-25 19:25:43 -0400] retr0h: ya... :(
[2013-06-25 19:37:16 -0400] retr0h: ctracey`: any iea what changed tho?
[2013-06-25 19:37:27 -0400] retr0h: i swear we used to [0][0] the results
[2013-06-25 19:37:44 -0400] retr0h: i'm not sure if its ohai or if it's chef11
[2013-06-25 19:45:34 -0400] openstackgerrit: John Dewey proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: Added helper to return IP address of given interface  https://review.openstack.org/34451
[2013-06-25 19:45:44 -0400] retr0h: ctracey`: jaypipes: https://review.openstack.org/34451
[2013-06-25 19:51:59 -0400] ctracey`: retr0h: the way the interface addresses are laid out seems different
[2013-06-25 19:52:07 -0400] ctracey`: in fact I think fauxhai is wrong
[2013-06-25 19:53:06 -0400] openstackgerrit: John Dewey proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: Added helper to return IP address of given interface  https://review.openstack.org/34451
[2013-06-25 19:54:09 -0400] retr0h: ctracey`: probably.. must have been a recent ohai change
[2013-06-25 19:54:30 -0400] retr0h: ctracey`: mind +2 or -1 that change? if ok..?
[2013-06-25 19:54:50 -0400] ctracey`: yeah - 1 sec
[2013-06-25 19:55:00 -0400] ctracey`: sorry ...ive been juggling about 10K things :)
[2013-06-25 19:55:05 -0400] retr0h: no worries
[2013-06-25 19:55:06 -0400] retr0h: take ur time
[2013-06-25 19:55:08 -0400] retr0h: no rush
[2013-06-25 19:56:24 -0400] ctracey`: looks good...
[2013-06-25 19:56:36 -0400] ctracey`: other than the fact that I now have to change my calls ;)
[2013-06-25 19:56:49 -0400] ctracey`: i am locked down for a while though while i get stable
[2013-06-25 19:56:50 -0400] retr0h: bah.. yah sorry... I had used the code i was already working on..
[2013-06-25 19:57:49 -0400] retr0h: ctracey`: are you guys using the rabbit HA stuff in nova?
[2013-06-25 19:57:55 -0400] retr0h: providing a list of rabbit servers?
[2013-06-25 19:58:05 -0400] ctracey`: no
[2013-06-25 19:58:16 -0400] retr0h: goes thru a LB?
[2013-06-25 19:58:29 -0400] ctracey`: just a single rabbit node atm
[2013-06-25 19:58:35 -0400] retr0h: ahhh ok...
[2013-06-25 19:58:42 -0400] retr0h: we run our rabbit thru a bigip
[2013-06-25 19:58:50 -0400] retr0h: but will likely move to the HA rabbit
[2013-06-25 19:58:57 -0400] ctracey`: not sure we have the scale (yet) for rabbit HA
[2013-06-25 19:59:20 -0400] ctracey`: in fact, i didnt even know grizzly supported multiple hosts.
[2013-06-25 19:59:23 -0400] retr0h: we werne't doing it for scaling but rather didn't want rabbit to fail and break us
[2013-06-25 19:59:35 -0400] retr0h: ya, but only for nova
[2013-06-25 20:00:01 -0400] ctracey`: oh - that is what i meant...
[2013-06-25 20:00:06 -0400] ctracey`: scale was the wrong word
[2013-06-25 20:00:18 -0400] ctracey`: we can live with services being MIA for a bit
[2013-06-25 20:01:51 -0400] retr0h: ok.. was juts kinda curious
[2013-06-25 20:02:09 -0400] ctracey`: def not ideal, but we could handle that with monitoring...im sure your use case is much different

[2013-06-25 21:10:09 -0400] mattray: green-lit for Hong Kong, making reservations
[2013-06-25 21:39:13 -0400] mattray: FYI, the ohai RC gem that went up today has a lot of OpenStack stuff in it, please kick those tires
