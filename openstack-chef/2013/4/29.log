[2013-04-29 17:03:05 -0400] mattray: IRC peoples, whats up?
[2013-04-29 18:13:50 -0400] kisoku: hi matt
[2013-04-29 18:16:20 -0400] mattray: prepping spiceweasel 2.2, then sputnik cloud launcher 0.3
[2013-04-29 18:16:39 -0400] spheromak: sputnic ?
[2013-04-29 18:16:43 -0400] spheromak: *sputnik
[2013-04-29 18:17:15 -0400] mattray: some tools tied to Dell's XPS 13 Sputnik laptops
[2013-04-29 18:17:23 -0400] spheromak: ah
[2013-04-29 18:17:34 -0400] mattray: should be releasing the first incarnations tomorrow at Devops Days Austin
[2013-04-29 18:17:42 -0400] mattray: profile tool and cloud launcher
[2013-04-29 18:17:53 -0400] mattray: both using Chef
[2013-04-29 18:18:02 -0400] mattray: cloud launcher is a wrapper for spiceweasel
[2013-04-29 18:18:06 -0400] spheromak: i put up my multi-node glue we use for building out dev envs during the hack day.
[2013-04-29 18:18:12 -0400] spheromak: which wraps spiceweasel
[2013-04-29 18:18:31 -0400] mattray: spheromak: any thoughts on the new cluster stuff?
[2013-04-29 18:18:47 -0400] mattray: for now, clusters -> nodes in an environment
[2013-04-29 18:19:01 -0400] spheromak: yea
[2013-04-29 18:19:28 -0400] spheromak: you want to expand that ?
[2013-04-29 18:19:56 -0400] spheromak: I want to take what i did @ github.com/spheromak/chef-infra  and make it into a kitchen plugin..
[2013-04-29 18:20:08 -0400] spheromak: what is the new cluster stuff ?
[2013-04-29 18:20:41 -0400] mattray: https://github.com/mattray/spiceweasel#clusters
[2013-04-29 18:21:06 -0400] spheromak: man matt how do you do  these confrences back to back and not just turn your brain to much. I am absolutely wasted after doing ostack and chef conf.
[2013-04-29 18:21:08 -0400] mattray: slowly adding refresh and delete to the cluster stuff
[2013-04-29 18:21:17 -0400] spheromak: ah
[2013-04-29 18:21:20 -0400] spheromak: yea teardown
[2013-04-29 18:21:23 -0400] spheromak: and provision
[2013-04-29 18:21:38 -0400] spheromak: I deal with that through vagrant in my aproach there
[2013-04-29 18:22:05 -0400] spheromak: but I was looking at chrisroberts vagabond too.. which hes got some multi-node concepts baked in.
[2013-04-29 18:22:26 -0400] mattray: so the sputnik launcher is a dumbed-down version of spiceweasel, but driving the cluster stuff
[2013-04-29 18:22:29 -0400] spheromak: but its  lxc only. so no good for all our ostack devs
[2013-04-29 18:22:40 -0400] spheromak: so just  node provisioning ?
[2013-04-29 18:23:02 -0400] mattray: currently, but refresh and delete are the immediate roadmap
[2013-04-29 18:23:29 -0400] spheromak: yea i use clusters. exclusively in my usage of spice
[2013-04-29 18:23:48 -0400] mattray: because sputnik launch is supposed to be "launch on lxc and test, then launch on openstack, test on lxc, push to openstack when done"
[2013-04-29 18:23:59 -0400] spheromak: yea thats great
[2013-04-29 18:24:10 -0400] spheromak: have you looked at vagabond ?
[2013-04-29 18:24:24 -0400] ctracey: spheromak: i would like to work on it...have been thinkin about it for some time
[2013-04-29 18:24:25 -0400] mattray: a little
[2013-04-29 18:24:27 -0400] spheromak: I think we got some overlapping projects again trying to get to the same ends :D
[2013-04-29 18:24:49 -0400] mattray: spheromak: yeah, "exploration of the problem space" is what I call it :)
[2013-04-29 18:25:04 -0400] spheromak: I had talks with fletcher about getting "infrastructures" into kitchen.. Not 100% thats the right way to do it tho.
[2013-04-29 18:25:20 -0400] spheromak: but kitchen has alot of momentum. so getting a kitchen-spice thing going might make sense
[2013-04-29 18:25:21 -0400] spheromak: IMO
[2013-04-29 18:25:42 -0400] spheromak: kitchen for your main repo or project-repo
[2013-04-29 18:25:54 -0400] spheromak: which is pretty much what i am  doing with the chef-infra stuff now.
[2013-04-29 18:26:46 -0400] spheromak: and why i used/chose spiceweasel over say knife-workflow was so i could provision to vagrant then provision ontop of openstack as well. i.e. dev on vagrants then push to jenkins and have it test with ostack on ostack.
[2013-04-29 18:26:47 -0400] mattray: yeah, I hope to get back on test-kitchen work eventually
[2013-04-29 18:27:12 -0400] spheromak: yea Im semi motivated to try and do a kitchen-infra.. kitchen-spice might make more sense tho :D
[2013-04-29 18:27:17 -0400] spheromak: dunno
[2013-04-29 18:27:32 -0400] spheromak: well kitchen-spice has a good ring too it
[2013-04-29 18:27:54 -0400] mattray: the roadmap for spiceweasel includes becoming a knife plugin
[2013-04-29 18:28:03 -0400] spheromak: idea being to bring the cluster idea from spice into kitchen. Add in some chef-zero provisioning task
[2013-04-29 18:28:21 -0400] spheromak: and being able to stand an infra up against a chef server and run your functional tests
[2013-04-29 18:28:55 -0400] spheromak: so this ends up looking like what i've glued together already with spice/knife-vagrant and some thor tasks.
[2013-04-29 18:29:01 -0400] spheromak: yea i think if spice was a gem
[2013-04-29 18:29:07 -0400] spheromak: er.. nevermind
[2013-04-29 18:29:24 -0400] mattray: I turned it into a library with 2.0
[2013-04-29 18:29:28 -0400] spheromak: haven't had my coffeee.
[2013-04-29 18:29:30 -0400] spheromak: yea
[2013-04-29 18:29:36 -0400] mattray: so sputnik could use it :)
[2013-04-29 18:29:39 -0400] spheromak: exactly so kitchen-spice could be possible
[2013-04-29 18:29:45 -0400] mattray: very much so
[2013-04-29 18:30:00 -0400] spheromak: I think i will start working on that in my  copious free time
[2013-04-29 18:30:01 -0400] spheromak: :D
[2013-04-29 18:30:04 -0400] mattray: hah
[2013-04-29 18:30:19 -0400] spheromak: and i will add in the ability to provision a chef-zero node
[2013-04-29 18:30:42 -0400] spheromak: @ hack day i  started working on a Golang chef-zero :D
[2013-04-29 18:30:46 -0400] mattray: spheromak: random ideas I mean to get to eventually (including knife plugin) https://github.com/mattray/spiceweasel/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#backlog
[2013-04-29 18:30:53 -0400] spheromak: I think we should have a golang pushy client :D
[2013-04-29 18:31:19 -0400] spheromak: mattray i may kick out an 0.0.1 kitchen-spice
[2013-04-29 18:31:25 -0400] mattray: badass :)
[2013-04-29 18:31:37 -0400] spheromak: sorta motivated for it now :D
[2013-04-29 18:31:46 -0400] mattray: I used "knife batch", but I like "knife spice" better
[2013-04-29 18:31:56 -0400] spheromak: i think it sounds like the right way to attack the infrastructures idea. which i've been tossing around for a while
[2013-04-29 18:32:00 -0400] mattray: there's already -x working
[2013-04-29 18:32:16 -0400] mattray: so turn that on and knife spice will just execute the commands
[2013-04-29 18:32:20 -0400] spheromak: will need api clusters
[2013-04-29 18:32:23 -0400] spheromak: if thats not already there
[2013-04-29 18:32:41 -0400] spheromak: yea i could see that
[2013-04-29 18:32:42 -0400] mattray: spheromak: not there yet. I had experimented with using tags to define clusters
[2013-04-29 18:32:54 -0400] spheromak: so you could use the same clsuter files/spice file with knife or with kitchen
[2013-04-29 18:32:55 -0400] mattray: but -j wasn't supported with every knife cloud plugin
[2013-04-29 18:33:06 -0400] spheromak: for hand rolling and for ci
[2013-04-29 18:33:11 -0400] mattray: so I reverted to using environments
[2013-04-29 18:33:47 -0400] mattray: I'm prepping 2.2.0 now, most everything is in master already
[2013-04-29 18:34:17 -0400] spheromak: Ill check it out. gonna go get some lunch and think about this
[2013-04-29 18:34:42 -0400] mattray: updating README and CHANGELOG now, waiting for retr0h to let me know if he needs nested environments or data_bags
[2013-04-29 18:34:58 -0400] mattray: since I added nested roles already
[2013-04-29 18:37:14 -0400] mattray: ahh, digging through their repos I see nested data_bags
[2013-04-29 18:37:21 -0400] mattray: last new feature to add for 2.2
[2013-04-29 18:40:06 -0400] ctracey: mattray: when do you start with hippiehacker?
[2013-04-29 18:40:18 -0400] ctracey: should we schedule an IRC meeting for this work?
[2013-04-29 18:40:27 -0400] mattray: he's coming to Devops Days Austin tomorrow
[2013-04-29 18:40:35 -0400] mattray: Thursday we're in my office hacking
[2013-04-29 18:40:39 -0400] mattray: (hippie style)
[2013-04-29 18:40:41 -0400] ctracey: ok  cool
[2013-04-29 18:41:07 -0400] mattray: updates will be on the ML and here
[2013-04-29 18:41:15 -0400] ctracey: sounds good
[2013-04-29 18:41:25 -0400] ctracey: i will try to get anything I have together by Thursday AM
[2013-04-29 18:42:31 -0400] ctracey: (helps if I unabridge the mailing list - a few hours behind)
[2013-04-29 18:42:36 -0400] ctracey: my apologies
[2013-04-29 18:43:30 -0400] mattray: I expect he'll be focusing initially on networking and razor provisioning while I merge branches and refactor
[2013-04-29 18:44:05 -0400] ctracey: networking meaning "the project formerly known as quantum"
[2013-04-29 18:45:45 -0400] mattray: well, sorting out quantum and nova-network to coincide with documentation
[2013-04-29 18:45:52 -0400] mattray: ie. "here's an example of both"
[2013-04-29 18:45:59 -0400] ctracey: sounds good
[2013-04-29 18:46:15 -0400] ctracey: suspect we will need a lot of that sort of thing
[2013-04-29 19:00:54 -0400] spheromak: mattray spice should also support .json and .rb files whne you use roles/envs  - "*":
[2013-04-29 19:00:55 -0400] spheromak: :D
[2013-04-29 19:01:09 -0400] mattray: spheromak: it does
[2013-04-29 19:01:26 -0400] spheromak: ok i may be pointing at old release
[2013-04-29 19:01:37 -0400] mattray: I cleaned up a lot of wildcard stuff yesterday
[2013-04-29 19:01:40 -0400] spheromak: i have to sort out what hacks i have in my integration
[2013-04-29 19:01:42 -0400] spheromak: ah
[2013-04-29 19:01:56 -0400] mattray: currently at PR/Issues zero
[2013-04-29 19:02:31 -0400] spheromak: nicfe
[2013-04-29 19:02:33 -0400] spheromak: *
[2013-04-29 19:02:36 -0400] spheromak: bleh
[2013-04-29 19:02:45 -0400] mattray: gotta run, back online later
