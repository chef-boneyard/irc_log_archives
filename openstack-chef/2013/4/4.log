[2013-04-04 13:16:36 -0400] jkordish: hm. is the single-controller role not ready for quantum? seems to break if i have my provider set for quantum
[2013-04-04 14:25:21 -0400] rackerjoe: jkordish: is is a fresh install or did you move from nova-network to quantum and re-run chef-client?
[2013-04-04 14:43:27 -0400] jkordish: rackerjoe: moving from nova-network
[2013-04-04 14:47:46 -0400] jkordish: i've been following the master branch - i tend not to mind some breakage (arch linux user here) - noticed there has been a lot of work on the networking roles
[2013-04-04 15:19:11 -0400] rackerjoe: jkordish: moving from nova-network to quantum for the network provider will require you to clean up the nova database as well as any bridges that may have been assigned to the compute nodes..  It is messy but can be done
[2013-04-04 15:23:32 -0400] jkordish: rackerjoe: yea i'm doing all that. just noticed you have to use nova first then change providers later
[2013-04-04 15:24:09 -0400] jkordish: i've removed my intances. (kept my lun with my cinder volumes on it with backup data to be reattached later)
[2013-04-04 15:24:19 -0400] jkordish: cleaned up my bridges - think I've figured that part out
