[2013-04-19 12:58:26 -0400] odyssey4me: Hi everyone. I've been working through the rcbops chef cookbooks and have a question specifically regarding high availability setups.
[2013-04-19 12:58:56 -0400] mattt: odyssey4me: howdy
[2013-04-19 12:59:02 -0400] mattt: odyssey4me: not sure if i can help, but just put it out there
[2013-04-19 12:59:22 -0400] odyssey4me: I see that keepalived is generally used to ensure that at least one of n nodes receives the requests. But I also see that there is the facility to use haproxy to load balance.
[2013-04-19 12:59:55 -0400] mattt: odyssey4me: yeah, keepalived for the VIP and haproxy for load balancing to backend services
[2013-04-19 13:00:04 -0400] odyssey4me: I'm just trying to understand where the haproxy load balancer would sit in the architecture.
[2013-04-19 13:00:22 -0400] odyssey4me: OK, so for the publically exposed services there would be just the VIPs.
[2013-04-19 13:00:55 -0400] odyssey4me: Then haproxy is setup internally.
[2013-04-19 13:01:24 -0400] odyssey4me: Are the recipes setup to know what's available and to configure the services appropriately?
[2013-04-19 13:01:45 -0400] mattt: odyssey4me: keepalived just floats the VIPs between nodes
[2013-04-19 13:02:13 -0400] odyssey4me: FYI - I'd like to adjust the readme to describe this a little better once I understand it and can recommend the method for implementing distributed HA setups.
[2013-04-19 13:03:02 -0400] mattt: haproxy will bind to the VIP and then send traffic to the configured services
[2013-04-19 13:03:13 -0400] odyssey4me: Thanks mattt. Perhaps let me clarify a little more.
[2013-04-19 13:04:57 -0400] odyssey4me: Let's say I have the roles setup where I have the databases on two nodes, rabbit on two seperate nodes, then all the openstack api's and services on two nodes. I have vip's in my environment file, so haproxy is automatically deployed and the vip's serve stuff from one of the two servers in each of those service areas. I then setup two haproxy nodes as well.
[2013-04-19 13:05:12 -0400] mattt: odyssey4me: i haven't worked on a lot of the HA stuff, but i think those recipes make the assumption that you have 2 controllers
[2013-04-19 13:05:42 -0400] mattt: odyssey4me: have a look at the ha-controller1 and ha-controller2 roles
[2013-04-19 13:06:45 -0400] odyssey4me: Assuming we have a client accessing through horizon, will the traffic flow be horizon -> api-vip -> service, or will it be horizon -> haproxy-vip -> service ?
[2013-04-19 13:08:39 -0400] mattt: odyssey4me: not familiar w/ horizon, but the keystone endpoints are updated w/ the haproxy VIPs
[2013-04-19 13:08:46 -0400] odyssey4me: mattt - yeah, I've been working through those but seeing as they're all lumped together it's hard to tell without deploying... so I'm pretty much getting there but was hoping to get enlightenment before diving into creating a separate haproxy node
[2013-04-19 13:10:18 -0400] odyssey4me: mattt: essentially I'm working on new roles for more distributed infrastructure which I intend to do a pull request for to add back into master (assuming it's accepted)... so once I've worked out the details I'll do my best to give back so that the next guy can do something like what we've done. ;)
[2013-04-19 13:11:04 -0400] odyssey4me: There's some really good work that's gone into these cookbooks. Fantastic stuff! :)
