[2013-04-23 17:59:16 -0400] ctracey: Hey folks - imagining many/most of you are on your way to chefconf.  Did we decide on a preferred lineage for the new cookbooks? att? rcbops? or essentially cherry-picking from various sources?
[2013-04-23 18:00:33 -0400] wilk: I think we were going to go with whatever matt came up with in a couple of weeks (cherry picked from various sources)
[2013-04-23 18:02:37 -0400] ctracey: ok, cool - i may get a jump on this
[2013-04-23 18:03:07 -0400] ctracey: have some thoughts especially regarding the pull from source models
[2013-04-23 19:37:09 -0400] spheromak: yea i think the sooner we have something we can start hacking against the better in this reguard. I want to pivot our efforts to the new hotness asap.
[2013-04-23 19:37:19 -0400] spheromak: but chef conf first :D
