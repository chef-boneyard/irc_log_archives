[2013-05-20 14:20:01 -0400] galstrom: jaypipes: np
[2013-05-20 14:20:10 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: very nice to see the coalescing of all the cookbooks :)
[2013-05-20 14:20:18 -0400] galstrom: agreed
[2013-05-20 14:20:41 -0400] galstrom: so there is the conductor addition.. and a sperate merge prop for the spec updates for conductor

[2013-05-20 17:44:46 -0400] ctracey: we totally need a recipe that drops a Dev credentials file that one can source
[2013-05-20 17:49:29 -0400] alop: IIRC there was a "developer mode" attribute
[2013-05-20 17:49:49 -0400] alop: that has all the cookbooks create stupid default passwords for all the DBs
[2013-05-20 17:50:06 -0400] alop: I'm sure that could be extended to create a stupid default openrc
[2013-05-20 18:08:41 -0400] ctracey: alop: yes - this is what I was thinking
[2013-05-20 18:09:09 -0400] ctracey: just getting tired of recreating a creds file after every kitchen run
[2013-05-20 18:09:32 -0400] ctracey: sure I can hack it, but seems like it could be useful in general

[2013-05-20 19:10:49 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: sweet work on that. just increment the version in metadata.rb and I'll be good with it.
[2013-05-20 19:12:49 -0400] ctracey: jaypipes: the identity changes are coming in just a moment
[2013-05-20 19:12:54 -0400] ctracey: they leverage this
[2013-05-20 19:12:55 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: sweet.
[2013-05-20 19:13:25 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: then make sure to adjust the depends openstack-common " >= XXX" in cookbook-openstack-identity/metadata.rb accordingly :)
[2013-05-20 19:13:34 -0400] ctracey: yep - already on that
[2013-05-20 19:13:44 -0400] ctracey: read my mind :)
[2013-05-20 19:14:07 -0400] jaypipes: hehe
[2013-05-20 19:14:23 -0400] ctracey: 0.2.1, right?
[2013-05-20 19:14:50 -0400] ctracey: 0.2.0 -> 0.2.1 is what i am saying

[2013-05-20 20:54:17 -0400] ctracey: jaypipes: totally with you on the testing. I am testing with kitchen atm.
[2013-05-20 20:55:39 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: just unit tests for right now.. you ok with me pushing a patch with unit tests before we proceed with that reworking of the provider?
[2013-05-20 20:55:48 -0400] ctracey: absolutely
[2013-05-20 20:55:59 -0400] jaypipes: coolio.
[2013-05-20 20:56:05 -0400] jaypipes: will try and push today or early tomorrow.
[2013-05-20 20:56:08 -0400] ctracey: this is difficult to *really* test without integration
[2013-05-20 20:56:13 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: you see my blog post today?
[2013-05-20 20:56:27 -0400] ctracey: I did - didnt finish reading it yet
[2013-05-20 20:57:00 -0400] ctracey: looked great from what I did see...noticed one extremely minor typo
[2013-05-20 20:57:03 -0400] jaypipes: cool, lemme know if you find errors or have feedback...
[2013-05-20 20:57:37 -0400] ctracey: "+2 KLooks good to me (core reviewer)"
[2013-05-20 20:57:54 -0400] ctracey: see how minor :)
[2013-05-20 20:58:11 -0400] jaypipes: gotcha. fixing now. :) thx!
[2013-05-20 20:59:01 -0400] jaypipes: fixed.
[2013-05-20 20:59:21 -0400] ctracey: also some other cookbooks are empty atm
[2013-05-20 20:59:29 -0400] ctracey: networking for instance
[2013-05-20 20:59:45 -0400] ctracey: might just want a note there say that these are in flux
[2013-05-20 21:00:44 -0400] jaypipes: yeah, probably...
[2013-05-20 21:02:13 -0400] ctracey: think we should eventually update the chef-repo cookbook to include a global Berksfile that support development and a run_tests.bash nested testing

[2013-05-20 21:02:56 -0400] ctracey: that might eventually deprecate the "Prepare to develop on a cookbook" section
[2013-05-20 21:03:14 -0400] ctracey: note: i intend to tweet the shit out of this...great post!
[2013-05-20 21:03:47 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: thx :)
[2013-05-20 21:04:24 -0400] ctracey: maybe I'm not there yet, but probably a few links to useful Gerrit docs
