[2013-05-21 16:10:47 -0400] ctracey: jaypipes: wrt to testing this new provider in identity, i think this might not provide as much value as we think it may.
[2013-05-21 16:11:19 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: in what way?
[2013-05-21 16:11:33 -0400] ctracey: the issues are a couple...1) I am using shell_out which as far as I can tell is not supported by chefspec
[2013-05-21 16:12:06 -0400] ctracey: 2) the commands are heavily nested/conditional on everything else we gather from keystone
[2013-05-21 16:12:49 -0400] ctracey: i can take another look at it, but thinking about it last night I kept finding myself painted into a corner.
[2013-05-21 16:13:04 -0400] ctracey: seem like much more of a candidate for integration testing
[2013-05-21 16:14:14 -0400] ctracey: (i can certainly be wrong here)
[2013-05-21 16:17:27 -0400] ctracey: could potentially move this to use execute and pickup some coverage - let me take a look at that
