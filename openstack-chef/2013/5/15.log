[2013-05-15 16:17:00 -0400] ctracey: fyi, looks like retr0h has updated identity and dashboard repo names
[2013-05-15 16:17:07 -0400] ctracey: https://review.openstack.org/#/q/status:open+stackforge/cookbook,n,z
[2013-05-15 16:17:19 -0400] ctracey: I am updating image now
[2013-05-15 16:21:37 -0400] mattray: I'm sorting through PRs, then I'll re-sync with StackForge before trying to make some pushes
[2013-05-15 16:54:01 -0400] ctracey: retr0h: fyi - i have test-kitchen working locally. just not ready for check-in.
[2013-05-15 16:54:41 -0400] ctracey: i think we will need it to really test this stuff, and that may be an argument for a "wrapper" cookbook that pulls in all the components via Berkshelf
[2013-05-15 17:00:12 -0400] galstrom: ctracey: i was just trying to find that discussion.. i dont see why we could not provide a set of roles for testing purposes (at least AIO)
[2013-05-15 17:02:51 -0400] ctracey: mattray and I have been working off his chef-openstack-repo
[2013-05-15 17:08:49 -0400] galstrom: ctracey: is that on the list to get pushed into stackforge?
[2013-05-15 17:09:44 -0400] ctracey: galstrom: not that I am aware of. I think there is a thread from yesterday on these so-called wrapper cookbooks.
[2013-05-15 17:56:33 -0400] mattray: So much merging and documentation that needs to be done
[2013-05-15 17:56:41 -0400] mattray: that's my takeaway from the mailing list
[2013-05-15 18:45:40 -0400] mattray: I want to move my openstack-common master branch to point at stackforge instead of att-cloud, does anyone know how to make GitHub understand that?
[2013-05-15 18:45:52 -0400] mattray: to show that I'm forking off of stackforge instead of att-cloud?
[2013-05-15 18:47:16 -0400] mattray: meh, maybe it doesn't matter if I only have one forker, I can delete the repo and then fork the new one ctracey you're being warned
[2013-05-15 19:04:15 -0400] ctracey: mattray: not a problem
[2013-05-15 19:05:03 -0400] mattray: ctracey: and done
[2013-05-15 19:05:03 -0400] ctracey: mattray: i just trash/rename it and then refork - i know of no other way
[2013-05-15 19:05:17 -0400] mattray: yeah, I read thru the API docs, nothing there for it
[2013-05-15 19:05:42 -0400] ctracey: GH is clearly the best out there, but leaves a bunch to be desired
[2013-05-15 19:07:13 -0400] ctracey: mattray: that was for openstack-common right? not chef-openstack-repo
[2013-05-15 19:07:28 -0400] mattray: ctracey: correct
[2013-05-15 19:07:39 -0400] ctracey: #lazyweb - thanks
[2013-05-15 19:07:42 -0400] mattray: I'm likely to re-fork all of the stuff off of stackforge though
[2013-05-15 19:07:53 -0400] mattray: just so there's no doubt where I consider "upstream"
[2013-05-15 19:08:18 -0400] ctracey: you can preserve both...they will just get renamed to <repo>-1
[2013-05-15 19:08:27 -0400] ctracey: i am doing that for the time being
[2013-05-15 19:08:59 -0400] mattray: yeah, I've still got the old stuff local. I just don't want PRs on the stuff that points to att-cloud
[2013-05-15 21:50:42 -0400] mattray: all re-forked and ready to start making PRs
[2013-05-15 22:32:54 -0400] ctracey: so in reference to this failure: http://logs.openstack.org/29292/1/check/gate-cookbook-openstack-image-chef-lint/1/console.html
[2013-05-15 22:33:23 -0400] ctracey: have we not configured the stackforge repos for Jenkins integration? or am I missing something (obvious) here?
[2013-05-15 22:37:17 -0400] alop: Hey, are we in the wrong channel?
[2013-05-15 22:37:42 -0400] alop: gerritbot is configured to write to #chef-openstack, not #openstack-chef
[2013-05-15 22:38:07 -0400] ctracey: i thought this is the right channel
[2013-05-15 22:38:12 -0400] alop: oh ctracey I had the exact same failure
[2013-05-15 22:38:25 -0400] alop: I had to use the "Git Read-only" URL from github
[2013-05-15 22:38:49 -0400] alop: change it in Berksfile to git://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity.git
[2013-05-15 22:38:56 -0400] alop: retr0h and I were just talking about this
[2013-05-15 22:38:58 -0400] ctracey: i figured i could fix it like that, but it also seems odd to have to do
[2013-05-15 22:39:01 -0400] alop: Yea
[2013-05-15 22:39:12 -0400] ctracey: and how did his pass the tests?
[2013-05-15 22:39:15 -0400] alop: I removed my keys, and sure 'nuff, I can clone the 'SSH' url
[2013-05-15 22:39:23 -0400] alop: so, I blame gerrit
[2013-05-15 22:39:30 -0400] ctracey: yeah - i had someone else try it as well
[2013-05-15 22:39:40 -0400] ctracey: well, blame jenkins, right?
[2013-05-15 22:39:56 -0400] ctracey: Jenkins is always an easy target anyhow :)
[2013-05-15 22:40:09 -0400] alop: well, I'll update the gerritbot config to post here instead
[2013-05-15 22:40:14 -0400] ctracey: cool
[2013-05-15 22:43:00 -0400] ctracey: looking at the Jenkins nodes, these precise nodes appear to be relatively new
[2013-05-15 22:43:20 -0400] retr0h: ctracey: ya they are
[2013-05-15 22:43:34 -0400] retr0h: I sent in some pull requests to deploy ruby 1.9.3 and bundler to them
[2013-05-15 22:43:42 -0400] retr0h: puppet ftw lol
[2013-05-15 22:43:56 -0400] ctracey: eventually eventually consistent
[2013-05-15 22:44:55 -0400] alop: ok, https://review.openstack.org/#/c/29315/ should get gerritbot in here
[2013-05-15 22:45:53 -0400] ctracey: ok - well im gonna head home - will make the change to the git urls a little later
