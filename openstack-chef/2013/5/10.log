[2013-05-10 03:52:54 -0400] jv___: hello?
[2013-05-10 13:34:03 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: retr0h_: good morning
[2013-05-10 13:34:29 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: mornin. :)
[2013-05-10 13:34:44 -0400] mattray: quick question about att-cloud/cookbook-ohai
[2013-05-10 13:35:24 -0400] mattray: it's a private repo, mind if I pull out the ohai plugins and make them public? They don't look like "secret sauce" to me
[2013-05-10 13:36:27 -0400] mattray: trying to wire up identity, which depends on it
[2013-05-10 13:49:41 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I don't mind, but you may want to double-check with retr0h_ when he's up.
[2013-05-10 13:50:40 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: FYI, we have the first cookbook proposed to Stackforge Gerrit: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/28752/
[2013-05-10 13:50:58 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: currently working with the #openstack-infra guys to get RVM installed on the Jenkins builders
[2013-05-10 13:51:03 -0400] mattray: yeah, saw that. I've got some packaging stuff that I'm prepping for opnenstack-common
[2013-05-10 13:51:09 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: thanks!
[2013-05-10 13:51:27 -0400] jaypipes: coolio.
[2013-05-10 14:43:20 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: retr0h_: are you guys still using Chef 10?
[2013-05-10 14:44:38 -0400] mattray: nevermind, red herring. Still trying to sort out the ohai stuff.
[2013-05-10 14:52:15 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: retr0h_: Ruby 1.8.7?
[2013-05-10 15:14:37 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: 1.9.2+
[2013-05-10 15:15:51 -0400] mattray: ok, just sorted some weird behavior, thought it might be a ordered hash-ism
[2013-05-10 15:20:34 -0400] mattray: and now it's disliking keystone-manage db_sync
[2013-05-10 15:21:17 -0400] mattray: sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (OperationalError) (1045, "Access denied for user 'keystone'@'localhost' (using password: YES)") None None
[2013-05-10 15:42:33 -0400] mattray: heh, didn't have a DB
[2013-05-10 15:42:50 -0400] mattray: openstack-identity is good
[2013-05-10 15:55:51 -0400] ctracey: some issues for identity around SSL, etcv
[2013-05-10 15:57:15 -0400] ctracey: looking at those today
[2013-05-10 15:57:55 -0400] mattray: pushed to mattray/openstack-identity grizzly branch
[2013-05-10 15:58:20 -0400] mattray: ctracey: anything different in your glance repo from AT&T's?
[2013-05-10 15:58:33 -0400] ctracey: didnt touch glance get
[2013-05-10 15:58:36 -0400] mattray: (I still need to merge back retr0h_'s ChefSpec stuff)
[2013-05-10 15:58:36 -0400] ctracey: yet*
[2013-05-10 15:58:40 -0400] mattray: ok, hitting glance now
[2013-05-10 15:58:53 -0400] mattray: . after this meeting and interview
[2013-05-10 15:59:05 -0400] ctracey: there were changes to chef-openstack-repo and cookbook-openstack-common though
[2013-05-10 15:59:20 -0400] ctracey: i can propose a PR
[2013-05-10 16:01:26 -0400] ctracey: the PR for openstack-common would go to ATT - that one we may want to cherry pick
[2013-05-10 16:02:39 -0400] ctracey: actually, I didnt think you had one.  I will rebase on top of yours.
[2013-05-10 18:18:53 -0400] mattray: turns out we didn't need that ohai plugin afterall
[2013-05-10 21:15:42 -0400] mattray: openstack-image is up and working
[2013-05-10 21:16:57 -0400] mattray: going to need to document this quite a bit better, but I think it's coming along very well
