[2013-05-28 12:15:14 -0400] odyssey4me: Hi everyone. I'm trying to make chef register the endpoints with DNS names instead of using IP's as is the current standard. Is there a simple way to do this rather than hacking the recipes?

[2013-05-28 14:57:44 -0400] ctracey: odyssey4me: does it not work to just set as a hostname?  only taking a cursory look right now, but it seems like it should already work, no?
[2013-05-28 15:00:45 -0400] Apsu`: ctracey: Should indeed. Assuming all the boxes register/use the same nameservers, or you just setup /etc/hosts throughout

[2013-05-28 17:41:11 -0400] ctracey: alop: thanks for the change. I have been wondering about policy.json for a while wrt comments in the json.
[2013-05-28 17:41:18 -0400] ctracey: is that actually supported?
[2013-05-28 17:41:36 -0400] alop: I've been shipping policy.json for cinder for months
[2013-05-28 17:41:46 -0400] ctracey: with comments?
[2013-05-28 17:41:52 -0400] alop: oh
[2013-05-28 17:41:58 -0400] alop: let me check
[2013-05-28 17:42:00 -0400] ctracey: https://review.openstack.org/gitweb?p=stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image.git;a=blob;f=templates/default/policy.json.erb;h=be3cb6638808053559606f583ad21e38b96b3c32;hb=ef050a11f7006857b90f532ae1e429d59e72d2c2
[2013-05-28 17:42:13 -0400] ctracey: this has literally nothing to do with your change
[2013-05-28 17:42:21 -0400] ctracey: but reminded me to test this out
[2013-05-28 17:42:50 -0400] alop: Yeah, the cinder cookbook ships the policy.json file with comments
[2013-05-28 17:43:00 -0400] ctracey: hah
[2013-05-28 17:43:02 -0400] alop: it works fine unless you run a json checkout
[2013-05-28 17:43:05 -0400] alop: err checker
[2013-05-28 17:43:19 -0400] ctracey: i figured it must, but that is kinda silly
[2013-05-28 17:44:02 -0400] alop: jaypipes once stomped on me for taking his comments out of a json file :)
[2013-05-28 17:44:16 -0400] ctracey: ouch
[2013-05-28 17:44:36 -0400] alop: something like "I don't care if jsontool says it's a syntax error, I still need to know what //comment was about"
[2013-05-28 17:44:45 -0400] ctracey: my commentary is more around the fact that openstack calls it json when it isnt :)
[2013-05-28 17:44:50 -0400] alop: right
[2013-05-28 17:46:02 -0400] ctracey: has anyone been converging dashboard?
[2013-05-28 17:46:29 -0400] alop: I haven't touched dashboard in a couple of weeks
[2013-05-28 17:47:08 -0400] ctracey: ok - converging it now and will have a change or two...just wondering
[2013-05-28 17:49:12 -0400] ctracey: alop: how have you been testing? just individual roles? recipes?
[2013-05-28 17:49:18 -0400] ctracey: and what is your platform?
[2013-05-28 17:50:10 -0400] alop: when I make a functional change, I test it in our Ubuntu 12.04 lab
[2013-05-28 17:50:55 -0400] ctracey: ok cool
[2013-05-28 17:51:09 -0400] ctracey: been hackin on test-kitchen pretty successfully for 12.04
