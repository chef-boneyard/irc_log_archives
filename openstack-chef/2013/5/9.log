[2013-05-09 09:52:46 -0400] odyssey4me: Good morning all. In the swift cookbooks there's an attribute ["swift"]["auto_rebuild_rings"] - it allows chef to automatically regenerate rings whenever changes happen in the environment.
[2013-05-09 09:53:12 -0400] odyssey4me: Is this meant for test/dev use, or is it safe to use in production?
[2013-05-09 13:37:09 -0400] rackerjoe: odyssey4me: I would not recommend that you use it in production.
[2013-05-09 13:37:47 -0400] rackerjoe: when it is off the ring modification suggestion script has an exit at the top of the script that prevents it from running automatically.
[2013-05-09 13:38:22 -0400] rackerjoe: We suggest that you review the changes first and you can either cut+paste or remove the exit from the script and run it and push the modified ring into the local git.
[2013-05-09 13:38:28 -0400] odyssey4me: rackerjoe: yeah, I see that - I suppose the general idea is that changes to the ring should be done intentionally, not automatically?
[2013-05-09 13:38:38 -0400] rackerjoe: It will be pulled on the other nodes as part of their normal chef run
[2013-05-09 13:38:49 -0400] rackerjoe: odyssey4me: you are correct
[2013-05-09 13:39:03 -0400] rackerjoe: We wrote it but regretted it immediately :)
[2013-05-09 13:40:38 -0400] odyssey4me: rackerjoe: thanks - it does serve as a useful reference for how to do the push, though... perhaps it should be changed to just deploy a script that can be used to push changes to the ring?
[2013-05-09 13:41:05 -0400] odyssey4me: a script that would be run manually
[2013-05-09 14:14:13 -0400] rackerjoe: that's not a bad idea and the change shouldn't be too difficult to make
[2013-05-09 14:14:44 -0400] rackerjoe: however, I think we could get in trouble with adding and removing nodes rapidly and running into the rebalance delay
[2013-05-09 14:45:05 -0400] odyssey4me: rackerjoe: is there perhaps a way to check when last a rebalance was done, or perhaps to check whether it's still within the delay period?
[2013-05-09 16:46:55 -0400] galstrom: mattray: any chance we can get some movement on these: [COOK-2830,COOK-2828]
[2013-05-09 16:52:17 -0400] mattray: yeah, I think I'll be taking a whack at Rabbit again next week if I get all this new code up
[2013-05-09 16:52:35 -0400] mattray: I'm driving it now from https://github.com/mattray/cookbook-openstack-ops-messaging
[2013-05-09 16:52:47 -0400] mattray: getting Grizzly out
[2013-05-09 18:28:37 -0400] galstrom: mattray: clustering is completely broke in opscode-cookbooks/rabbitmq
[2013-05-09 18:28:43 -0400] galstrom: those patches make it go-ish
[2013-05-09 19:09:05 -0400] mattray: galstrom: top of my growing list of technical debt for openstack work
[2013-05-09 19:09:15 -0400] mattray: luckily, I'm actually in engineering now
[2013-05-09 19:09:25 -0400] galstrom: :)
[2013-05-09 19:09:26 -0400] galstrom: ty
[2013-05-09 21:51:09 -0400] ctracey: unless anyone has objections I would like to experiment with conf.d per config section.
[2013-05-09 21:51:41 -0400] ctracey: assuming the oslo support is there for this.
