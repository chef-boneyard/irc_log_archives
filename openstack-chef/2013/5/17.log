[2013-05-17 14:48:23 -0400] iartarisi: mattray: ok, why not? because of the SUSE requirement?
[2013-05-17 14:48:40 -0400] mattray: no, my nova-compute is not functional yet :)

[2013-05-17 14:50:36 -0400] mattray: the cookbook code looked fine, but someone should probably test it

[2013-05-17 14:53:16 -0400] iartarisi: I wonder if anyone tested the current stackforge code for all the components together.
[2013-05-17 14:54:46 -0400] iartarisi: I've only tested with all patches applied :)
[2013-05-17 14:54:50 -0400] mattray: iartarisi: it was AT&T's working repo
[2013-05-17 14:55:07 -0400] mattray: and ctracey had that forked at HubSpot and it was working

[2013-05-17 17:53:15 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: FYI, not sure if you noticed, but I made lint and unit gates on those two ops-database and ops-messaging cookbooks, so if the first patch proposed doesn't add a spec/ directory and tests and doesn't pass the foodcritic tests, Jenkins will fail to verify the patch...
[2013-05-17 17:53:22 -0400] jaypipes: I know, it was sneak of me. ;P

[2013-05-17 17:55:42 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: so what will the process be to get people added as core reviewers?
[2013-05-17 17:56:45 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I think I mentioned this in one of my emails, but it's similar to the other -core teams: do a bunch of reviews, then someone should nominate you by throwing an email to the ML, and votes +1/-1 are tallied, and then you're added. or not :)
[2013-05-17 17:57:08 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I just chose 6 folks for core that I knew were active in working on the cookbooks...
[2013-05-17 17:57:27 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: totally good with me to bump the core team up as we see folks doing reviews.
[2013-05-17 17:57:37 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: it's all about the reviews, not the code submitted...
