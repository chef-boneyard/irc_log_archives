[2013-05-08 11:52:03 -0400] odyssey4me: hmm, perhaps some can help me with this?
[2013-05-08 11:52:26 -0400] odyssey4me: I'd like to persistantly set node attributes in a recipe.
[2013-05-08 11:53:07 -0400] odyssey4me: Effectively I'd like to search for all nodes that have a particular role/recipe applied, then loop through that list and set an attribute for each of them persistantly.
[2013-05-08 11:53:24 -0400] odyssey4me: So how exactly do I do that?
