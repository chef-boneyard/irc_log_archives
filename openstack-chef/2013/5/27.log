[2013-05-27 14:16:25 -0400] iartarisi: hm.. it looks like we don't have full launchpad-gerrit integration, yet? Bugs don't change status when referenced from gerrit.

[2013-05-27 15:28:28 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: bugs do indeed change status... which one are you looking at?
[2013-05-27 15:31:16 -0400] iartarisi: jaypipes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+bug/1184614
[2013-05-27 15:31:21 -0400] iartarisi: referenced from https://review.openstack.org/#/c/30621/
[2013-05-27 15:32:17 -0400] iartarisi: but I'm looking at other bugs on launchpad for openstack-chef and I can't see any jenkins comments
[2013-05-27 15:32:21 -0400] iartarisi: or gerrit
[2013-05-27 15:33:07 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+bug/1182576
[2013-05-27 15:33:29 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: so it looks to be closing them properly with Fix Released, but not marking In Progress when it sees a patch.
[2013-05-27 15:33:35 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: I will look into it.
[2013-05-27 15:33:42 -0400] iartarisi: that one I didn't see before :)
[2013-05-27 15:33:56 -0400] iartarisi: jaypipes: awesome! thanks
[2013-05-27 15:34:12 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: because the bug list does not list Fix Rerleased bugs by default... (use Advanced Search and select Fix Released)
[2013-05-27 15:34:18 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: will work on a fix...
