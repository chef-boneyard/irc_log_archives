[2013-05-30 19:33:32 -0400] retr0h: is remote_directory not idempotent?
[2013-05-30 19:33:43 -0400] retr0h: will it always copy the files over on every fun
[2013-05-30 19:33:48 -0400] retr0h: seems like that is the case..
[2013-05-30 19:39:34 -0400] spheromak: retr0h yea on remote dir you can't spec the hash
[2013-05-30 19:39:41 -0400] spheromak: generally stay away from that one :D
[2013-05-30 19:40:01 -0400] spheromak: better to write an rsync or something along those lines
[2013-05-30 19:41:03 -0400] spheromak: looks like you could write a provider to do it a different way as well
[2013-05-30 19:41:25 -0400] spheromak: now that i am thining about it remote_directory should be idempotent, but I think there were some bugs a while ago
[2013-05-30 19:47:23 -0400] retr0h: ya, i'd expect it to be idempotent
[2013-05-30 19:47:32 -0400] retr0h: but i have notifies that are getting fired on each run
