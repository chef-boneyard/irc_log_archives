[2013-05-31 14:50:00 -0400] odyssey4me: On a node (via json file) I want to force_override or simply override an attribute that was set in the environment. I can't seem to get it to stick in such a way that it's correct. Can someone help me get this right?

[2013-05-31 15:52:56 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: you're busy today :)
[2013-05-31 15:53:38 -0400] iartarisi: it just seems that way because I have to push a whole branch when I change just one commit :P

[2013-05-31 19:00:50 -0400] piavlo: are stackforge cookbooks the way to go with openstack grizzly deployment with chef?
[2013-05-31 19:04:03 -0400] ctracey: piavlo: this is currently a work in progress, but will be the way forward. Most are generally working at this point, but there will likely be a large number of changes in the short-term.
[2013-05-31 19:05:47 -0400] ctracey: been preoccupied with some prod issues, but should be back in the swing of things now
[2013-05-31 19:07:42 -0400] piavlo: ctracey: looks like this work in progress is much better than wondering on github and trying to pull misc users openstack cookbooks  together :)
[2013-05-31 19:08:56 -0400] ctracey: piavlo: that is precisely the idea
[2013-05-31 19:09:45 -0400] piavlo: btw is there way to track which stackforge cookbooks are considered stable?
[2013-05-31 19:10:19 -0400] ctracey: well i guess that depends on your definition of stable
[2013-05-31 19:10:38 -0400] piavlo: currently it's all master branch and i suppose will stay so event that all istable due to the gerrit workflow?
[2013-05-31 19:10:52 -0400] ctracey: all changes have to pass the gerrit gate, which is currently linting, style, and chefspec tests.
[2013-05-31 19:11:21 -0400] ctracey: we intend to add integration testing shortly along with a wrapper repo
[2013-05-31 19:12:06 -0400] spheromak: Yea need ot get the wraper repo up. We still have cookbook gaps.
[2013-05-31 19:12:24 -0400] spheromak: Hopefully next week my group will start working on getting things from here into our dev pipe.
[2013-05-31 19:12:25 -0400] ctracey: spheromak: i have been working towards that slowly
[2013-05-31 19:12:39 -0400] spheromak: were wrapping up an internal rollout :D
[2013-05-31 19:12:50 -0400] ctracey: i can probably push the beginnings of that soon, including some basic TK setups
[2013-05-31 19:12:57 -0400] spheromak: was my goal
[2013-05-31 19:13:11 -0400] spheromak: Also I can get the vagabond setup in there if theres interest for that
[2013-05-31 19:13:24 -0400] spheromak: for getting the infra-testing rolling (cause we will be doing that over here)
[2013-05-31 19:13:54 -0400] spheromak: I gotta work with spox on getting the vagabondfile to support more complext lxc networking
[2013-05-31 19:31:58 -0400] piavlo: btw does someone has insights on vagrant-lxc vs  vagabond
[2013-05-31 19:58:26 -0400] openstackgerrit: Abel Lopez proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-block-storage: Initial commit of cinder-common  https://review.openstack.org/31241
[2013-05-31 23:31:15 -0400] spheromak: piavlo I've been using kitchen-lxc vs vagrant-lxc  but I'm writing serverspec and chefspec tests that are all runable by kitchen
[2013-05-31 23:31:31 -0400] spheromak: Using vagabond to setup the infrastructures  and run more server spec tests for a repo  vs a cookbook
