[2013-05-23 15:51:25 -0400] ctracey: what is the current plan for the chef-repo?
[2013-05-23 15:51:43 -0400] ctracey: this is starting to become a bit more critical i think
[2013-05-23 15:52:42 -0400] ctracey: on a similar note, how will we normally handle adding in new repos.  I have a baremetal repo to contribute, but it will need a little cleanup before it goes in.

[2013-05-23 16:26:39 -0400] iartarisi: it's like we're playing trains with all this merge synchronization
[2013-05-23 16:29:05 -0400] mattray: so what do people think about approving my own change after it's been +1'd by lots of folks and re-based by someone else? https://review.openstack.org/#/c/29675/
[2013-05-23 16:29:52 -0400] mattray: jaypipes?
[2013-05-23 16:30:05 -0400] jaypipes: mattray!
[2013-05-23 16:30:20 -0400] mattray: I want to promote my own change, it's been through the ringer repeatedly
[2013-05-23 16:30:39 -0400] mattray: and ctracey was the latest to rebase it
[2013-05-23 16:30:56 -0400] mattray: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/29675/
[2013-05-23 16:31:09 -0400] iartarisi: FWIW, I'm ok with it
[2013-05-23 16:31:18 -0400] iartarisi: then I can rebase before going home
[2013-05-23 16:31:26 -0400] mattray: yeah, I just don't want to offend people's Gerrit sensibilities :)
[2013-05-23 16:32:08 -0400] ctracey: i can promote it too :)
[2013-05-23 16:32:11 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: lemme get retr0h_ to do it... one sec
[2013-05-23 16:32:38 -0400] mattray: ctracey: promoting your own patch, that's the question :)
[2013-05-23 16:32:48 -0400] ctracey: jaypipes: lets see if we can get the identity rewrite in as well
[2013-05-23 16:32:48 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: just reviewing your identity LWRP work... nice job so far
[2013-05-23 16:32:56 -0400] jaypipes: jinx :)
[2013-05-23 16:33:27 -0400] ctracey: mattray: technically you are still the author in Gerrit's mind
[2013-05-23 16:33:34 -0400] mattray: I know
[2013-05-23 16:33:35 -0400] jaypipes: correct.
[2013-05-23 16:33:40 -0400] ctracey: so I think i am fair game :)
[2013-05-23 16:34:07 -0400] mattray: so promote it and let's move on. I'm writing docs today
[2013-05-23 16:35:12 -0400] ctracey: might also be good to get some of the others in there that have been lngering
[2013-05-23 16:35:26 -0400] ctracey: like the identity Boolean change - that will force me to rebase a bit
[2013-05-23 16:36:00 -0400] ctracey: my goal for today is to have a single Grizlly controller/compute node setup via chef-repo
[2013-05-23 16:36:02 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: it's off to the test pit. approved.
[2013-05-23 16:36:18 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: huzzah
[2013-05-23 16:36:24 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: you see I got the openstack-chef-repo on stackforge, right?
[2013-05-23 16:36:28 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: ^^
[2013-05-23 16:36:39 -0400] ctracey: i did not
[2013-05-23 16:36:42 -0400] ctracey: I will get on that
[2013-05-23 16:36:45 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: was hoping you and ctracey would have some pushes for that today.
[2013-05-23 16:36:45 -0400] mattray: yeah, I'll deprecate the one in opscode and my repos
[2013-05-23 16:36:55 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: awesomesauce.
[2013-05-23 16:37:06 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: since I'd named my grizzly one "chef-openstack-repo" :)
[2013-05-23 16:37:11 -0400] jaypipes: lol :)
[2013-05-23 16:37:28 -0400] mattray: ctracey: I assume you're still working off of that repo?
[2013-05-23 16:37:40 -0400] mattray: or, moving the stuff into the new one?
[2013-05-23 16:37:55 -0400] ctracey: yes - i have a fork of it, but looks like very few forkers
[2013-05-23 16:38:07 -0400] ctracey: i am happy to move
[2013-05-23 16:38:32 -0400] mattray: lemme go look at what's in my repos first
[2013-05-23 16:38:57 -0400] ctracey: i suspect there are many extra bits in there
[2013-05-23 16:39:04 -0400] ctracey: lots and lots of roles
[2013-05-23 16:39:10 -0400] mattray: so my "openstack-chef-repo" points to github.com/opscode's, which doesn't point anywhere
[2013-05-23 16:39:19 -0400] jaypipes: mattray, ctracey: just put the best of it all into there... and we'll use the stackforge/openstack-chef-repo as a) the basis for the integration test jobs and b) for documenting best practices/recommendation regarding use of roles, wrapper cookbooks, etc
[2013-05-23 16:39:36 -0400] mattray: I'm cool with leaving that in place and just dropping the grizzly stuff on top of it
[2013-05-23 16:39:52 -0400] mattray: opscode won't point to stackforge "officially", but I'll add that to the README
[2013-05-23 16:40:08 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: Move attributes to [openstack][compute] namespace.  https://review.openstack.org/29675
[2013-05-23 16:40:09 -0400] mattray: unless GitHub adds a way to add post-creation forks
[2013-05-23 16:40:12 -0400] ctracey: ok - i will plan on hacking in stackforge/openstack-chef-repo and we can go from there
[2013-05-23 16:43:43 -0400] mattray: ctracey: I'm going to kill off  github.com/mattray/chef-openstack-repo and move those bits into a grizzly branch of mattray/chef-openstack-repo
[2013-05-23 16:43:52 -0400] mattray: grr mattray/openstack-chef-repo
[2013-05-23 16:44:10 -0400] mattray: and evacuate all the Essex stuff into branches
[2013-05-23 16:44:39 -0400] mattray: and clean up github.com/opscode/openstack-chef-repo with a README in master and move the Essex stuff out
[2013-05-23 16:45:38 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: rename of compute merged.
[2013-05-23 16:46:19 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: I should get back on this one too then: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/29714/
[2013-05-23 16:46:41 -0400] mattray: and perhaps open tickets on LP for the rest of the services
[2013-05-23 16:46:50 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: jeepyb (the automation tooling that creates and manages the interaction between Gerrit, Launchpd and Github) has the ability to mirror the Gerrit repo to any number of Github repos.
[2013-05-23 16:47:19 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: so if you wanted, Gerrit/jeepyb could keep an opscode github repo mirrored with and of the cookbooks or chef-repo on stackforge.

[2013-05-23 16:47:52 -0400] iartarisi: yeah...
[2013-05-23 16:48:08 -0400] jaypipes: :)
[2013-05-23 16:48:11 -0400] iartarisi: I got one more
[2013-05-23 16:48:18 -0400] mattray: iartarisi: long-term I really want to break out the libvirt stuff out of the nova cookbook
[2013-05-23 16:48:20 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: yes, on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/29714/ if you can make that quick change, that would be great
[2013-05-23 16:48:39 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: because I can just see openstack['image']['image'] becoming a confusing attribute :)
[2013-05-23 16:48:48 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: heh
[2013-05-23 16:49:26 -0400] mattray: iartarisi: like openstack-compute-xen, openstack-compute-kvm, openstack-compute-hyperv cookbooks
[2013-05-23 16:49:50 -0400] iartarisi: mattray: sounds good
[2013-05-23 16:50:24 -0400] mattray: iartarisi: longterm that is. I'll try to get to some ticket reviews today
[2013-05-23 16:50:53 -0400] jaypipes: yeah, I agree on above direction for splitting out stuff in that way.
[2013-05-23 16:53:21 -0400] openstackgerrit: Ionut Artarisi proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-compute: install ceilometer from SUSE packages: -common, -agent-central  https://review.openstack.org/29910
[2013-05-23 16:53:26 -0400] mattray: jaypipes: or we build up the Chef community cookbooks for xen, kvm and hyperv
[2013-05-23 16:53:50 -0400] mattray: I just want to keep the amount of hypervisor tooling inside of nova minimal
[2013-05-23 16:53:59 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: agreed.
[2013-05-23 16:54:18 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I think it is fine to put in stackforge... that way they are gated in the same way.
[2013-05-23 16:54:21 -0400] mattray: openstack-ops-hypervisor ;)
[2013-05-23 16:54:38 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: I was just remarking that we've added so many repos lately, I've been a pain in the CI team's ass ;)
[2013-05-23 16:54:47 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: openstack-ops-hypervisor ++
[2013-05-23 16:55:05 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: and have separate recipes for setting up libvirt/Xen/Hyper-V, etc?
[2013-05-23 16:55:09 -0400] mattray: yeah
[2013-05-23 16:55:15 -0400] ctracey: ahem
[2013-05-23 16:55:20 -0400] ctracey: baremetal too :)
[2013-05-23 16:55:29 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: :)
[2013-05-23 16:55:31 -0400] mattray: that'll be openstack-baremetal
[2013-05-23 16:55:39 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: lol, I'll let you much with that!
[2013-05-23 16:55:42 -0400] mattray: or more correctly, cookbook-openstack-baremetal
[2013-05-23 16:56:12 -0400] ctracey: ok - i can push that into stackforge once i figure out who to talk to
[2013-05-23 16:56:40 -0400] mattray: ctracey: technically it's still inside of Grizzly, so you'll have to wait until we start doing trunk or Havana
[2013-05-23 16:56:56 -0400] mattray: inside of Nova that is
[2013-05-23 16:57:35 -0400] ctracey: are we against a lone repo to config "hypervisors"?
[2013-05-23 16:57:48 -0400] ctracey: for instance if I can get conf.d working?
[2013-05-23 16:58:55 -0400] ctracey: so my idea would be to override the compute:driver attribute in compute cookbook and then add openstack-baremetal to my runlist which a) depends on compute and b) drops into conf.d
[2013-05-23 17:00:28 -0400] mattray: ctracey: I don't mind nova currently configuring hypervisors in separate recipes keyed off an attribute
[2013-05-23 17:00:39 -0400] mattray: I just think long-term this approach is unwieldy
[2013-05-23 17:00:48 -0400] mattray: as we have 5 recipes for 5 hypervisors
[2013-05-23 17:01:13 -0400] mattray: baremetal can stay inside of nova
[2013-05-23 17:01:23 -0400] mattray: but the others have community cookbooks, or should
[2013-05-23 17:01:31 -0400] mattray: I know there's lxc and kvm
[2013-05-23 17:01:58 -0400] mattray: the question is where do we want those 5 wrapper recipes? inside of openstack-compute or inside of openstack-ops-hypervisor?
[2013-05-23 17:02:33 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: dude, really nice work on the LWRP chefspec tests.
[2013-05-23 17:04:14 -0400] ctracey: thanks - was a PITA :)
[2013-05-23 17:04:29 -0400] ctracey: but now i know pretty much everything i need to know about ChefSpec i think :)
[2013-05-23 17:07:08 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: hehe
[2013-05-23 17:09:30 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: one request on the LWRP patch to address pls, other than that, I'm ready to approve.
[2013-05-23 17:10:18 -0400] ctracey: jaypipes: you caught me!
[2013-05-23 17:10:40 -0400] ctracey: i had it and removed it bc I thought it was of little value
[2013-05-23 17:10:43 -0400] ctracey: I will re-add it
[2013-05-23 17:22:17 -0400] openstackgerrit: craigtracey proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity: A complete rewrite of this LWRP  https://review.openstack.org/29817
[2013-05-23 17:22:51 -0400] ctracey: added one for endpoint and testes with Chef:Log.level = :info to verify the test
[2013-05-23 17:23:09 -0400] ctracey: s/endpoint/endpoint and service/
[2013-05-23 17:23:57 -0400] alop: Speaking of spec...
[2013-05-23 17:24:07 -0400] alop: there's something in the cinder cookbook that's been bugging me
[2013-05-23 17:24:42 -0400] alop: currently, we have each service.rb file defining the same stuff, I tried to put that in a common.rb, and have search service subscribe to the template
[2013-05-23 17:24:50 -0400] alop: VS having the template notify the services
[2013-05-23 17:24:54 -0400] alop: works great
[2013-05-23 17:25:07 -0400] alop: EXCEPT I couldn't figure out how to write a test for that
[2013-05-23 17:25:27 -0400] alop: like, service spec, can't seem to find a "it subscribes to a template"
[2013-05-23 17:25:36 -0400] alop: anyone have an idea?
[2013-05-23 17:25:44 -0400] alop: if not, I may just leave that out of spec
[2013-05-23 17:26:14 -0400] alop: because it's lame that we have cinder.conf.erb defined in api/volume/scheduler.rb
[2013-05-23 17:46:05 -0400] jaypipes: retr0h_, alop: reviews welcome on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/29817/ :)
[2013-05-23 17:46:53 -0400] jaypipes: alop: that may be something we ask crump to add as a matcher to chefspec.
[2013-05-23 17:47:30 -0400] alop: I asked retr0h_ about that, as he mentioned he would be asking other stuff
[2013-05-23 17:47:31 -0400] jaypipes: alop: FYI, retr0h_ and I have engaged crump to add guard support to chefspec -- so that we can test the adherence to not_if and only_if guards in blocks.
[2013-05-23 17:47:32 -0400] ctracey: you can include your own matchers locally as well
[2013-05-23 17:47:35 -0400] alop: yup

[2013-05-23 18:56:12 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity: remove fauxhai from Gemfile and update Gemfile.lock  https://review.openstack.org/30075
[2013-05-23 18:59:37 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity: SUSE platform defaults.  https://review.openstack.org/29496
[2013-05-23 18:59:50 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity: suse server tests  https://review.openstack.org/30080
[2013-05-23 19:13:06 -0400] ctracey: jaypipes: d'oh. I thought to do just that and then didnt.
[2013-05-23 19:13:11 -0400] ctracey: #fail
[2013-05-23 19:16:00 -0400] openstackgerrit: craigtracey proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: Allow for memcache_servers override attributes  https://review.openstack.org/30307
[2013-05-23 19:16:35 -0400] ctracey: in our renaming, we have also broken config_by_role library
[2013-05-23 19:17:01 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity: A complete rewrite of this LWRP  https://review.openstack.org/29817
[2013-05-23 19:17:20 -0400] ctracey: i will be adding new functionality to provide section as a dotted string notation (ie. "openstack.messaging")
[2013-05-23 19:23:55 -0400] mattray: ctracey: I'm actually in favor of ditching config_by_role completely
[2013-05-23 19:25:00 -0400] mattray: why not have the provider of a service set an attribute accordingly?
[2013-05-23 19:25:23 -0400] mattray: node[openstack][messaging][provides_service] = true
[2013-05-23 19:25:34 -0400] mattray: and search on that? Gets rid of all of this role monkeying around
[2013-05-23 19:25:46 -0400] mattray: no role names in attributes
[2013-05-23 19:26:23 -0400] ctracey: im not opposed to that...much nicer than the hardcodes i have in there now
[2013-05-23 19:26:35 -0400] mattray: maybe something to propose on the mailing list?
[2013-05-23 19:28:34 -0400] mattray: see if anyone has strong objections to moving that way?
[2013-05-23 19:31:05 -0400] ctracey: i do think the dotted string notation is nice to easily grab attributes out of node[]
[2013-05-23 19:36:06 -0400] mattray: ctracey: unless you put spaces in your attribute names
[2013-05-23 19:37:19 -0400] mattray: ctracey: let me introduce you to the bikeshed of http://acrmp.github.io/foodcritic/#FC001
[2013-05-23 19:37:25 -0400] mattray: :)
[2013-05-23 19:38:35 -0400] mattray: Ruby will let us do this node["embedding"].attributes['for'].fun.["and"][:profit]
[2013-05-23 19:50:48 -0400] ctracey: hah - true
[2013-05-23 19:52:05 -0400] ctracey: "There's no reason that Chef should support 100 different ways to write/lookup attributes. From a pedagogical standpoint, it's an absolute nightmare."
[2013-05-23 19:52:08 -0400] ctracey: love it
[2013-05-23 20:06:29 -0400] openstackgerrit: Matt Ray proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image: renamed attributes from [image][image] to [image][upload_image] and images to upload_images accordingly  https://review.openstack.org/30329
[2013-05-23 20:07:06 -0400] mattray: ctracey: I have failed in rebasing my patch :/
[2013-05-23 20:17:43 -0400] jaypipes: mattray: use git commit --amend
[2013-05-23 20:17:52 -0400] ctracey: and git add
[2013-05-23 20:17:56 -0400] ctracey: both are critical
[2013-05-23 20:18:07 -0400] ctracey: and when reviewing - use -R
[2013-05-23 20:18:32 -0400] ctracey: oh i see what you did
[2013-05-23 20:18:58 -0400] ctracey: dont use -m when --amend'ing
[2013-05-23 20:20:39 -0400] mattray: this is what I did: https://gist.github.com/mattray/5639113
[2013-05-23 20:21:24 -0400] ctracey: yeah - dont "-m"
[2013-05-23 20:21:35 -0400] ctracey: and then during review do "git review -R"
[2013-05-23 20:29:05 -0400] mattray: I assume I can't go back and update the original ticket without redoing the patch?
[2013-05-23 20:33:13 -0400] mattray: I'll go fix the first ticket
[2013-05-23 20:43:51 -0400] openstackgerrit: craigtracey proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: Allow for memcache_servers override attributes  https://review.openstack.org/30307
[2013-05-23 21:23:33 -0400] openstackgerrit: Matt Ray proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image: renamed attributes from [image][image] to [image][upload_image] and images to upload_images accordingly  https://review.openstack.org/30346
[2013-05-23 21:28:11 -0400] mattray: I have failed to update it again :(
[2013-05-23 21:57:21 -0400] openstackgerrit: Matt Ray proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image: Attributes for the Image service are in the ['openstack']['image'] namespace.  https://review.openstack.org/29714
[2013-05-23 21:57:58 -0400] mattray: thanks to ctracey for helping me see the light.
[2013-05-23 21:58:17 -0400] mattray: I didn't realize the -m was mucking with the changelog-id
[2013-05-23 21:59:03 -0400] mattray: just a habit since I use emacs for my shell
[2013-05-23 21:59:21 -0400] mattray: leaving it off was dumping emacs into emacs, which ate the changelog-id too :)
[2013-05-23 21:59:32 -0400] mattray: iterm that bit :)
[2013-05-23 22:01:30 -0400] alop: what's the draw for iterm?
[2013-05-23 22:02:03 -0400] alop: I use the standard Terminal.app, never got the point of iTerm
[2013-05-23 22:02:20 -0400] mattray: alop: custom key bindings, term tabs
[2013-05-23 22:02:42 -0400] alop: isn't that also available in term?
[2013-05-23 22:02:44 -0400] mattray: transparency, the tmux integration
[2013-05-23 22:02:45 -0400] alop: I know tabs are
[2013-05-23 22:03:01 -0400] mattray: dunno, haven't used Terminal for years :)
[2013-05-23 22:03:03 -0400] alop: haha
[2013-05-23 22:03:17 -0400] alop: Yeah, I bet Tiger was out when you last used it
[2013-05-23 22:03:22 -0400] alop: whatever works for you :)
[2013-05-23 22:03:46 -0400] mattray: "Broadcast Input" is kinda slick
[2013-05-23 22:04:07 -0400] mattray: I use that when testing across VMs on many different OS versions
[2013-05-23 22:05:00 -0400] mattray: but usually I use emacs
[2013-05-23 22:05:14 -0400] mattray: which caused the -m issue :/
[2013-05-23 22:05:27 -0400] mattray: well, obstructed the cause from me
[2013-05-23 22:08:14 -0400] alop: I always get a kick out of checking out other peoples setup
[2013-05-23 22:08:41 -0400] alop: When I started at T, it had been like 4 years since I had previously worked with retr0h_
[2013-05-23 22:08:48 -0400] alop: so, I was very impressed by his setup
[2013-05-23 22:09:14 -0400] alop: nerdtree vimrc, nice color PS1, etc
[2013-05-23 22:10:58 -0400] mattray: all my emacs stuff is in https://github.com/mattray/home-directory
[2013-05-23 22:11:04 -0400] mattray: well, all my stuff
[2013-05-23 22:18:20 -0400] ctracey: the easiest solution for using shell within emacs to commit to git is obviously: export EDITOR=vi && git commit --amend
[2013-05-23 22:19:06 -0400] alop: +1
[2013-05-23 22:20:10 -0400] ctracey: fully converged an all-in-one vagrant instance with TK just now
[2013-05-23 22:21:31 -0400] ctracey: doubt its working completely but a good step towards the goal

[2013-05-23 23:10:28 -0400] mattray: will start moving in the grizzly stuff :)
[2013-05-23 23:10:45 -0400] mattray: time to put some kids to bed, then back online later
