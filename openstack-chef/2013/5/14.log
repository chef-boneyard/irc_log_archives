[2013-05-14 14:56:35 -0400] jaypipes: carlp: yo.
[2013-05-14 14:56:46 -0400] jaypipes: carlp: you on the opscode-openstack-chef mailing list?
[2013-05-14 15:11:32 -0400] ctracey: jaypipes: thanks again for the all the work!
[2013-05-14 15:12:03 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: no probs. hopefully we'll have all this darn stuff settled out shortly!
[2013-05-14 15:12:18 -0400] ctracey: i think some of the confusion came to be because when we first decided to do all this work, we weren't in stackforge.
[2013-05-14 15:12:47 -0400] ctracey: agreed - would be great to just settle on the canonical way we want to do this
[2013-05-14 15:43:26 -0400] ctracey: should we take a poll of who cares about the git history of these repos? seems like this is the only outstanding issue at the moment.
[2013-05-14 15:44:18 -0400] ctracey: i happen to think it would be helpful when determining what should/should not be merged, but as long as we get to a converged state, I am sure this will all work itself out.
[2013-05-14 15:52:10 -0400] mattray: I try to keep it when I can, but it's all been lost several times before
[2013-05-14 15:58:12 -0400] retr0h: ctracey: yah.. will be nice to get stuff up on stackforge

[2013-05-14 21:32:22 -0400] mattray: feel free to drop in and heckle me
[2013-05-14 21:49:46 -0400] carlp: jaypipes: Nope, @mattray does
[2013-05-14 21:53:25 -0400] carlp: jaypipes: Sorry - I misread (I blame the sinus drugs), yes I am. A bit behind for today however
[2013-05-14 21:53:53 -0400] jaypipes: :) no worires
[2013-05-14 22:53:30 -0400] ctracey: looking at the stackforge repos,
