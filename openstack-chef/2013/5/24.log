[2013-05-24 12:35:55 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: what is the email address you use for Launchpad SSO?
[2013-05-24 12:37:32 -0400] iartarisi: hm... let me check
[2013-05-24 12:38:05 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: I've tried your maploin and your suse.cz emails but both come back saying "not a registered user" when trying to add you to the chef-manager-core team on Gerrit..
[2013-05-24 12:38:16 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: not getting the same error for ctracey
[2013-05-24 12:38:35 -0400] iartarisi: jaypipes: mapleoin@lavabit.com should be it
[2013-05-24 12:38:42 -0400] iartarisi: maybe you missed the 'e' ?
[2013-05-24 12:40:09 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: no, didn't work either...
[2013-05-24 12:42:35 -0400] iartarisi: jaypipes: on launchpad, can't you just put in the username?
[2013-05-24 12:43:02 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: nah, this is gerrit... it's actually managed separately from launchpad.
[2013-05-24 12:43:20 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: if you hop into #openstack-infra, I'm trying to fix....
[2013-05-24 12:51:52 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: so I had a question for you re: your comment about just making the identity_register mock simply double("somethign")
[2013-05-24 12:52:08 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: is there some general mocking library in ruby that we could use for this stuff?
[2013-05-24 12:52:27 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: doesn't really look like ChefSpec is built to test this kind of thing, but I may be wrong.
[2013-05-24 12:52:55 -0400] iartarisi: I'm no ruby expert, but I think https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks is what we want to use
[2013-05-24 12:53:10 -0400] jaypipes: .me checks it out...
[2013-05-24 12:53:53 -0400] iartarisi: we're actually using that already for the most part
[2013-05-24 12:53:53 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: doh. I thought double() created a double ... a numeric type.
[2013-05-24 12:54:00 -0400] iartarisi: oh :)
[2013-05-24 12:54:11 -0400] iartarisi: yeah, that's really unfortunate naming
[2013-05-24 12:54:17 -0400] iartarisi: it should be called mock() or something
[2013-05-24 12:54:22 -0400] jaypipes: very unfortunate naming, yes.
[2013-05-24 12:54:42 -0400] iartarisi: and there is a mock() synonym but double() is the recommended one
[2013-05-24 12:55:58 -0400] jaypipes: lol

[2013-05-24 15:45:48 -0400] jaypipes: mattray, ctracey: a +2R/+1A on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/29498/ should send the entire stack of dependent patches above through... it was the only one that had actual changes after rebasing.
[2013-05-24 15:46:06 -0400] mattray: done

[2013-05-24 15:54:12 -0400] jaypipes: w00t. that should theoretically begin the merge process for all the dependent patches since AFAICT, they all have a previous +1A on them.
[2013-05-24 15:55:41 -0400] iartarisi: AFAICS the +1A need to be re-added every time a change happens, even if it's a trivial rebase
[2013-05-24 16:00:49 -0400] jaypipes: iartarisi: k, will check on them.
