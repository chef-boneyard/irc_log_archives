[2013-05-03 00:44:50 -0400] carlp: kisoku: no, I wasn't at chefconf this year but I expect to be at the opscode dev summit
[2013-05-03 00:45:43 -0400] kisoku: i hope i get to go this year
[2013-05-03 00:45:48 -0400] kisoku: budget is a bit tight :-/
[2013-05-03 01:07:20 -0400] jasondotstar: newbie here. what's with the openstack link on opscode? doesn't' work.
[2013-05-03 01:08:11 -0400] spheromak: jasondotstar stuffs in flux
[2013-05-03 01:08:45 -0400] jasondotstar: spheromak understood. that's good I guess, b/c I'm just now learning chef.
[2013-05-03 01:09:46 -0400] jasondotstar: spheromak how is chef involved with OS? I mean, are folks using it to spin up component nodes? or is chef used in the background of the application stack itself?
[2013-05-03 01:25:13 -0400] spheromak: lots using chef to build OpenStack infra
[2013-05-03 02:17:51 -0400] jasondotstar: spheromak kk
[2013-05-03 04:40:03 -0400] kisoku: spheromak: so it turns out my minion wrote a single cookbook to deploy folsom :-P
[2013-05-03 04:40:30 -0400] kisoku: it's pretty amazing considering a year ago he had never done any automation or any ruby
[2013-05-03 06:54:31 -0400] spheromak: kisoku heh
[2013-05-03 16:46:00 -0400] wabat: mattray - Are there any current issues with knife-openstack that might cause me to get an issue like this:  /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/knife-openstack-0.7.1/lib/chef/knife/openstack_flavor_list.rb:51:in `run': undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
[2013-05-03 16:46:21 -0400] wabat: I'm running Private Chef and Grizzly for Openstack
[2013-05-03 16:47:51 -0400] wabat: I get this error when I try to run any sub-commands
[2013-05-03 17:16:57 -0400] mattray: wabat: which version of fog?
[2013-05-03 17:17:58 -0400] mattray: looks like the flavor is not populating ram or disk
[2013-05-03 17:19:30 -0400] mattray: wabat: open a KNIFE ticket and I'll roll it into the post 0.8.0 release
[2013-05-03 17:25:31 -0400] wabat: mattray - A guy I work with here found my problem...I missed the /tokens in the URL.  A boneheaded move on my part.
[2013-05-03 17:25:54 -0400] mattray: cool
[2013-05-03 17:26:11 -0400] wabat: But thank you for your response...I do appreciate it
[2013-05-03 17:27:46 -0400] mattray: 0.8.0 is probably dropping in the next day or 2, adding windows support
[2013-05-03 17:30:03 -0400] wabat: very cool...I'm looking forward to using it
[2013-05-03 17:34:37 -0400] wabat: mattray - out of curiosity, why is the /tokens needed in the URL when something like the nova client does not need it?
[2013-05-03 17:35:10 -0400] mattray: not sure off the top of my head, possibly something in fog
[2013-05-03 17:35:30 -0400] wabat: That's what we found it to be
[2013-05-03 17:36:54 -0400] wabat: He used export EXCON_DEBUG=true then ran knife openstack image list -VV
[2013-05-03 17:41:24 -0400] mattray: feel free to open a ticket and see what we'd need to do to remove the tokens bits
