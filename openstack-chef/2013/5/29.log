[2013-05-29 00:04:11 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-dashboard: move per-platform apache sites dir conf to attributes  https://review.openstack.org/30631
[2013-05-29 00:04:39 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: return empty list for no results on both memcached_servers branches  https://review.openstack.org/30681
[2013-05-29 01:42:12 -0400] ctracey: how would folks feel about incorporating tailor into our ./run_tests.bash and hence CI?
[2013-05-29 02:39:39 -0400] spheromak: ctracey im for it, but what are the rules :D could be a bikeshed
[2013-05-29 03:42:01 -0400] ctracey: spheromak: the idea is to simply have a "style guide" of sorts. i'm not one for super-strict rules, but we had a review today where we wanted a trailing space removed. my vimrc does this by default, so any file i edit would automatically get this change regardless of any substantive change I may make.
[2013-05-29 03:42:44 -0400] ctracey: i just "cleaned" the compute cookbook with a tailor config with all defaults except the 80 char limit
[2013-05-29 03:43:15 -0400] ctracey: this added ~20sec to my test time
[2013-05-29 03:45:11 -0400] ctracey: spheromak: but i hear ya on the bikeshed
[2013-05-29 04:29:27 -0400] retr0h: ctracey: I like the idea
[2013-05-29 04:29:40 -0400] retr0h: i also dislike trailing white space terds :P
[2013-05-29 04:29:48 -0400] ctracey: haha
[2013-05-29 04:30:00 -0400] retr0h: i'm also a fan of 80 char limit even in ruby, but i wouldn't enforce that
[2013-05-29 04:30:06 -0400] ctracey: that i do hate as well. perhaps we will have to tweak which rules work for us
[2013-05-29 04:30:11 -0400] retr0h: i know rubyists like their 800 char lines :P
[2013-05-29 04:30:45 -0400] ctracey: 80 chars is hard only bc attribute defaults could grow pretty big
[2013-05-29 04:31:08 -0400] retr0h: but then again i code on a thinkpad inside tmux inside very minimal wm lol
[2013-05-29 04:31:19 -0400] retr0h: yah in chef i totally agree
[2013-05-29 04:31:26 -0400] retr0h: i was more being a bit snarky :)
[2013-05-29 04:31:32 -0400] ctracey: we could turn 80 chars off but then eventually move them to warnings
[2013-05-29 04:31:54 -0400] ctracey: hah - ive been known to snark myself
[2013-05-29 04:33:26 -0400] retr0h: i haven't gotten to review much today - today was the fun move to chef 11 day lol
[2013-05-29 04:34:38 -0400] ctracey: nice - so that means we can be on 11 now right? :)
[2013-05-29 04:36:27 -0400] retr0h: hehehe :)
[2013-05-29 04:36:30 -0400] retr0h: sure :)
[2013-05-29 04:36:41 -0400] retr0h: its all done now

[2013-05-29 04:48:38 -0400] ctracey: as noted in those review comments, I am posting that only to open the dialog about style up. we can hack away at the idea.
[2013-05-29 04:49:10 -0400] retr0h: sweet sounds good

[2013-05-29 11:45:11 -0400] ctracey: iartarisi: thanks for the reviews last night.
[2013-05-29 11:49:12 -0400] iartarisi: no worries :)
[2013-05-29 11:49:45 -0400] ctracey: iartarisi: i had thought about error.log but just opted not to. i will fix that.
[2013-05-29 11:50:30 -0400] ctracey: as for that spec test that looked like it was a duplicate, the subtlty is in the "to_not"
[2013-05-29 11:51:26 -0400] ctracey: unfortunately, chef spec does not have a "creates_file_without_content" matcher. that seems like it would be useful, so ill probably get a patch over to them.
[2013-05-29 11:57:40 -0400] iartarisi: ah, no, that's not what I meant
[2013-05-29 11:57:45 -0400] iartarisi: I know it's not a duplicate
[2013-05-29 11:58:30 -0400] iartarisi: but I think one should be a negation of the other, so they should both test for the same line in the file: one tests it's there, the other that it isn't
[2013-05-29 11:59:13 -0400] ctracey: ok, sorry it is early :)
[2013-05-29 11:59:20 -0400] iartarisi: right now one of the tests looks for hostA and the other one for the django.core.cache... line
[2013-05-29 11:59:29 -0400] iartarisi: :)
[2013-05-29 11:59:37 -0400] ctracey: yes, and that is intentional
[2013-05-29 12:00:00 -0400] iartarisi: ah, how so?
[2013-05-29 12:00:03 -0400] ctracey: because if we have no servers, we actually exclude the whole setting
[2013-05-29 12:00:09 -0400] ctracey: let me pull the line
[2013-05-29 12:00:48 -0400] iartarisi: yes
[2013-05-29 12:01:07 -0400] ctracey: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/30830/1/templates/default/local_settings.py.erb
[2013-05-29 12:01:52 -0400] ctracey: line 60 checks for the existence of any memcache servers - if not configure nothing
[2013-05-29 12:02:06 -0400] iartarisi: I got that, just that it's not so clear from the tests :), maybe adding a create_file_with_content @file.name, "django.core..." line in the "has the memcached servers" test would make it more clear?
[2013-05-29 12:02:30 -0400] iartarisi: so it's clear that we're testing for "it has this section with this value"
[2013-05-29 12:02:48 -0400] iartarisi: but anyway, in the end it's just nit-picking so you can ignore it :)
[2013-05-29 12:03:00 -0400] ctracey: ok, sounds reasonable :)
[2013-05-29 12:03:10 -0400] ctracey: no - I can at least make it more clear
[2013-05-29 12:03:21 -0400] iartarisi: cool, thanks!
[2013-05-29 12:03:27 -0400] ctracey: nit-picking is totally cool with me! :)

[2013-05-29 15:54:54 -0400] ctracey: jaypipes: who is best to talk to about getting (yet another) cookbook in stackforge?
[2013-05-29 15:55:20 -0400] ctracey: i plan to rework baremetal today and will have a new and improved cut this week for it
[2013-05-29 15:55:25 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: me :)
[2013-05-29 15:55:39 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: or, I could share the knowledge and show you how to fish :)
[2013-05-29 15:57:21 -0400] ctracey: ok - well in that case lets see how far i get and then sync from there
[2013-05-29 15:57:34 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/29938/
[2013-05-29 15:57:42 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: that should get you there ;)
[2013-05-29 15:58:12 -0400] ctracey: perfect - thanks!
[2013-05-29 15:58:26 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: if you run into issues, pop over to #openstack-infra. They are all very helpful.
[2013-05-29 15:58:54 -0400] ctracey: will do - thanks for the info
[2013-05-29 16:01:26 -0400] jaypipes: any time.
[2013-05-29 16:01:41 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: actually, working on a patch to infra/config now to add a tailor jenkins job.
[2013-05-29 16:01:57 -0400] ctracey: awesome
[2013-05-29 16:02:05 -0400] ctracey: yay clean code
[2013-05-29 16:02:18 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: indeed.
[2013-05-29 16:02:23 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: question though...
[2013-05-29 16:02:27 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/30827/2/run_tests.bash
[2013-05-29 16:02:52 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: it doesn't matter that tailor is called without the .cookbooks/$COOKBOOK path?
[2013-05-29 16:03:13 -0400] ctracey: heh - great question
[2013-05-29 16:03:21 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: I presume it is fine since it's only going to look at the recipes/files/templates/attributes/ dirs?
[2013-05-29 16:03:57 -0400] ctracey: i dont think so only because of https://review.openstack.org/#/c/30827/2/.tailor line #3
[2013-05-29 16:04:29 -0400] ctracey: i dont think so = i think it will find any ruby files
[2013-05-29 16:04:40 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: hmm, that will be an issue then, yeah?
[2013-05-29 16:04:41 -0400] ctracey: presuming that is safe
[2013-05-29 16:05:00 -0400] ctracey: how so?
[2013-05-29 16:05:08 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: since it will find any .rb files in any cookbook in the berkshelf (.cookbooks/
[2013-05-29 16:05:09 -0400] ctracey: (i could very well be dense here)
[2013-05-29 16:05:20 -0400] ctracey: oh heh
[2013-05-29 16:05:27 -0400] ctracey: yes youre right
[2013-05-29 16:05:28 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: easy enough to test
[2013-05-29 16:05:52 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: did you test with the bundle/berkshelf or just manually without any bundling?
[2013-05-29 16:06:18 -0400] ctracey: no i used bundle to test - just as in the diff
[2013-05-29 16:07:24 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: me too :)
[2013-05-29 16:07:40 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: perhaps the **/*.rb doens't include .-prefixed dirs?
[2013-05-29 16:08:09 -0400] ctracey: i can try quickly
[2013-05-29 16:08:48 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: I'd be very surprised if all the berkshelf'd dependent cookbooks passed the tailor file :)
[2013-05-29 16:09:07 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: but it *would* explain the 20s runtime...
[2013-05-29 16:09:25 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: running tailor on such a small amount of files should really be pretty quick.
[2013-05-29 16:10:18 -0400] ctracey: http://paste.openstack.org/show/37869/
[2013-05-29 16:12:34 -0400] ctracey: and http://paste.openstack.org/show/37871/
[2013-05-29 16:13:39 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: that's definitive enough for me :)
[2013-05-29 16:13:43 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: cheers mate
[2013-05-29 16:13:53 -0400] ctracey: ok, so I copied the ".cookbooks" directory to "cb" and now its going ape shit :)
[2013-05-29 16:25:44 -0400] openstackgerrit: Ionut Artarisi proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-dashboard: add openSUSE server spec tests  https://review.openstack.org/30632
[2013-05-29 16:38:05 -0400] ctracey: jaypipes: for the ops-database stuff, I think we should just stick with top-level deps. anything else is bound to change under our feet.
[2013-05-29 16:38:18 -0400] ctracey: if thats cool with you I can push that change up now
[2013-05-29 16:38:22 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: totally cool with me.
[2013-05-29 16:38:30 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: I can do it, though...
[2013-05-29 16:38:32 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: one sec.
[2013-05-29 16:38:48 -0400] ctracey: oops
[2013-05-29 16:38:52 -0400] ctracey: i just did (i think)
[2013-05-29 16:39:28 -0400] jaypipes: no worries :)
[2013-05-29 16:39:41 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: you're quick :)
[2013-05-29 16:39:42 -0400] ctracey: or maybe not
[2013-05-29 16:39:47 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: yeah, you did.
[2013-05-29 16:39:57 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: when I git review'd, it said no changes to be made...
[2013-05-29 16:40:26 -0400] ctracey: weird - gerrit bot is slow

[2013-05-29 17:51:37 -0400] ctracey: jaypipes: looks good. Sucks that we will have to update this again to include in all the repos. Perhaps we should hold this until I can release all at once?
[2013-05-29 17:54:36 -0400] ctracey: have i mentioned how much i hate preseed?
[2013-05-29 17:55:16 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: nah, I'll do all the *others* at once...
[2013-05-29 17:55:22 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: it's no big deal.
[2013-05-29 17:56:06 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: this way the infra guys see what it's all about. then we (you!) add .tailor to the projects, fix style errors, merge to trunk, and I'll submit a second request adding the gate style jobs for all the other cookbooks
[2013-05-29 17:56:29 -0400] ctracey: fair nuf
[2013-05-29 17:57:15 -0400] ctracey: is that gembeing pulled in via the local Gemfile?
[2013-05-29 17:58:43 -0400] ctracey: (sorry not familiar with how jenkins is getting its environment here)
[2013-05-29 17:59:12 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: please reference this guy in future patch commit messages: https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-chef/+bug/1185536
[2013-05-29 17:59:46 -0400] ctracey: cool, will do
[2013-05-29 17:59:51 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: the environment gets set up with bundler + berkshelf in a dependent job that runs before that
