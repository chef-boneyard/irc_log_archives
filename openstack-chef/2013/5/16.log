[2013-05-16 15:42:13 -0400] mattray: ctracey: your openstack-image stuff just merged :)
[2013-05-16 15:42:31 -0400] mattray: we should get a StackForge post-commit hook to post in here
[2013-05-16 15:53:40 -0400] ctracey: mattray: we are in the process of moving openstackgerrit into this room
[2013-05-16 15:55:43 -0400] mattray: supasweet
[2013-05-16 15:57:51 -0400] mattray: my plan is to submit PRs for ['openstack-image'] to become ['openstack']['image']
[2013-05-16 15:57:57 -0400] mattray: and so on
[2013-05-16 15:58:15 -0400] mattray: followed by upgrading to Chef 11 once I fix the tests
[2013-05-16 17:39:15 -0400] ctracey: working on compute now
[2013-05-16 17:39:28 -0400] ctracey: anxious to start getting the grizzly bits working
[2013-05-16 17:39:54 -0400] ctracey: also want to see if I can get that PFS idea working sooner than later
[2013-05-16 17:40:33 -0400] ctracey: mattray: out of consistency for what is there now, I am doing openstack-compute
[2013-05-16 17:40:53 -0400] mattray: ctracey: roger
[2013-05-16 17:41:21 -0400] mattray: over in #chef I'm asking about testing role searches with ChefSpec
[2013-05-16 17:41:46 -0400] mattray: The suggestion is to stop doing that and just search on node['openstack']['identity']['provider'] set to 'true' or something similar
[2013-05-16 17:42:40 -0400] ctracey: im sitting over there -  i will read it
[2013-05-16 18:13:59 -0400] ctracey: right now ceilometer and compute are colocated - wondering if it makes sense to split those
[2013-05-16 18:14:13 -0400] ctracey: wont do it now, but may make sense down road
[2013-05-16 18:14:39 -0400] mattray: ctracey: in the same cookbook?
[2013-05-16 18:15:04 -0400] ctracey: yes - now they are
[2013-05-16 18:15:56 -0400] mattray: perhaps break out ceilometer and make it depend on compute?
[2013-05-16 18:16:10 -0400] ctracey: i think that makes sense
[2013-05-16 18:16:18 -0400] ctracey: right now i am only focusing on rename
[2013-05-16 18:16:36 -0400] mattray: makes sense
[2013-05-16 18:17:19 -0400] ctracey: will probably need to add a bunch of repos to stackforge over time - baremetal comes to mind
[2013-05-16 18:22:25 -0400] mattray: yup
[2013-05-16 18:22:41 -0400] mattray: and a wiki and docs to make sense of it all :)
[2013-05-16 18:22:50 -0400] mattray: and a chef repo to tie it all together
