[2013-01-22 18:51:35 -0500] monster__: howdy jcannava, we are just now implementing your LDAP changes to alamo. Really appreciate your work.
[2013-01-22 18:52:41 -0500] jcannava: great. let me know how it goes.
[2013-01-22 19:42:39 -0500] monster__: jcannava: attributes/default.rb is the only place we need to add LDAP info correct?
[2013-01-22 19:43:03 -0500] monster__:  /opt/rpcs/chef-cookbooks/cookbooks/keystone/attributes/default.rb to be more specific
[2013-01-22 19:43:09 -0500] jcannava: monster__: you can set it there, or just set the variables in the environment.
[2013-01-22 19:43:29 -0500] monster__: ok thanks
