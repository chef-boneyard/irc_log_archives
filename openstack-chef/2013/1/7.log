[2013-01-07 15:35:58 -0500] simonmcc: is knife-hp being actively maintained?  I'm having some trouble using it and struggling to tell if it's my config or just broken
[2013-01-07 17:11:34 -0500] mattray: simonmcc: I saw your question in the log, yes knife-hp is actively maintained and you can open tickets and get support on it
[2013-01-07 17:12:52 -0500] simonmcc: @mattray thanks - I think I've found an issue, with HPCS you don't need to explicitly request public IPs anymore, which it tripping up 'knife hp server create' for me
[2013-01-07 17:13:17 -0500] simonmcc: @mattray still poking around to see if the issue is mine or in knife-hp :-(
[2013-01-07 17:13:32 -0500] mattray: simonmcc: isn't there a flag for floating ips? -a or something?
[2013-01-07 17:15:24 -0500] simonmcc: @mattray I think that's only in knife-openstack
[2013-01-07 17:15:48 -0500] mattray: hmm I thought I brought the code to knife-openstack from knife-hp :)
[2013-01-07 17:16:31 -0500] mattray: yup, you're right
[2013-01-07 17:16:38 -0500] mattray: nothing in the README
[2013-01-07 17:17:00 -0500] mattray: if it's a bug please open a ticket
[2013-01-07 17:18:35 -0500] simonmcc: I think it is, rupakg & are are working on a patch
[2013-01-07 17:19:57 -0500] mattray: cool, did the hp stuff in fog get updated? last time I was in that code one of the AZs couldn't be reached
[2013-01-07 17:20:14 -0500] mattray: I had patches just sitting to be merged
[2013-01-07 17:21:09 -0500] simonmcc: no, I think they are still in the queue
[2013-01-07 17:21:16 -0500] mattray: this stuff: https://github.com/mattray/knife-hp#known-issues
[2013-01-07 17:22:18 -0500] mattray: the ohai fix is in the beta FYI
