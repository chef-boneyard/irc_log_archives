[2013-02-19 13:13:19 -0500] mvidner: Hi! At SUSE we have cookbooks for Essex and want to port them to Folsom (and eventually Grizzly).
[2013-02-19 13:14:32 -0500] mvidner: Which set of cookbooks should be the base for Folsom?
[2013-02-19 13:19:32 -0500] mvidner: taking keystone as an example, https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/keystone has the 2012.1.1 tag, but /https://github.com/att-cloud/cookbook-keystone has many more commits; https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/keystone has different history but similar content
[2013-02-19 14:36:24 -0500] mattray: mvidner: fwiw, my cookbooks are merging towards these: https://github.com/att-cloud/chef-repo
[2013-02-19 14:37:40 -0500] mvidner: mattray: ok, except, 404
[2013-02-19 14:37:47 -0500] mattray: hah
[2013-02-19 14:38:03 -0500] mvidner: is it a private one?
[2013-02-19 14:38:15 -0500] mattray: the repo that ties everything together is private, the cookbooks aren't https://github.com/att-cloud/
[2013-02-19 14:38:30 -0500] mattray: ie. https://github.com/att-cloud/cookbook-nova
[2013-02-19 14:38:30 -0500] mvidner: that's ok
[2013-02-19 14:39:17 -0500] mattray: the key difference from the current set is the use of openstack-common
[2013-02-19 14:39:18 -0500] mattray: https://github.com/att-cloud/cookbook-openstack-common
[2013-02-19 14:39:25 -0500] mattray: and it's Folsom/Grizzly
[2013-02-19 14:42:31 -0500] mvidner: tkanks!
