[2013-02-08 13:13:45 -0500] jkordish: So the mysql-openstack cookcook "broke" for me recently. looks like the following commit did it. https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/mysql-openstack/commit/1dd5d7b02ce8a3dde8b683bcaea87af427e154d0#recipes/server.rb - specificaly line 36 where it sets the mysql bind_ip to 0.0.0.0
[2013-02-08 13:14:34 -0500] jkordish: this is the error i'd get https://gist.github.com/joethemongoose/4706703
[2013-02-08 13:16:11 -0500] jkordish: found two simple ways to fix it. either i manually hard code my ip in that recipe or I add an additional bind-address for 0.0.0.0 in my.cnf
[2013-02-08 13:17:15 -0500] jkordish: fwiw, i'm using the rackspace private cloud openstack distro and pull from master on the rcbops
[2013-02-08 14:40:55 -0500] rackerjoe: jkordish: can you update the gist with the output from 'knife cookbook list' so I can see the version numbers for each of the cookbooks?  There may be a dependency that we missed when we updated the behavior of that cookbook.
[2013-02-08 14:44:11 -0500] jkordish: rackerjoe: it has been updated
[2013-02-08 17:04:43 -0500] rackerjoe: jkordish: at the moment you shouldn't pull from master for the ISO install but stick with the iso branch of the cookbooks.
[2013-02-08 18:13:01 -0500] jkordish: rackerjoe: :( thats no fun
[2013-02-08 20:19:42 -0500] rackerjoe: we have frozen the iso branch until the next release comes out.  The master is part of that next release however the environment from iso to master may need to be tweaked.
