[2013-02-01 14:59:47 -0500] mattray: Hey Rackers, who do I bug for an account on https://demo.rcb.me/ ?
[2013-02-01 15:00:02 -0500] mattray: nice to have more places to test knife-openstack
[2013-02-01 15:28:08 -0500] jcannava: mattray: I can get you access
[2013-02-01 15:28:35 -0500] mattray: jcannava: thanks! What are you guys running on there these days? trunk or folsom?
[2013-02-01 15:29:32 -0500] jcannava: mattray: folsom
[2013-02-01 15:29:56 -0500] mattray: cool, nice to have more testing targets
[2013-02-01 15:42:42 -0500] mattray: Now that I have demo.rcb.me access, I have a question for folks should "knife openstack image list" show snapshots?
[2013-02-01 15:42:56 -0500] mattray: I'm trying to keep the output in sync with what's on the web console
[2013-02-01 15:43:19 -0500] mattray: so I'm filtering out initrd$|kernel$|loader$|virtual$|vmlinuz$ names
[2013-02-01 15:43:31 -0500] mattray: but 'demosnap' is still there
[2013-02-01 15:59:51 -0500] galstrom: mattray: i think image list should show snapshots
[2013-02-01 16:00:04 -0500] galstrom: but would be nice if they were shown to be snapshots
[2013-02-01 16:00:24 -0500] mattray: hmm that could work
[2013-02-01 16:00:42 -0500] galstrom: however.. it is fairly common for them just to be lumped into the image list.. no special marker or anything
[2013-02-01 16:00:53 -0500] mattray: another column "Snapshot" with "yes" where applicable?
[2013-02-01 16:01:04 -0500] galstrom: that could work
[2013-02-01 16:01:08 -0500] mattray: easy enough to add
[2013-02-01 16:01:35 -0500] mattray: I'll check that next. Fixing security groups right now
[2013-02-01 16:01:37 -0500] galstrom: i can think of a handful of times where it would be useful to know.. and another handful where it does not matter
[2013-02-01 16:01:40 -0500] galstrom: so .. yeah
[2013-02-01 16:08:27 -0500] mattt: galstrom: don't think novaclient differentiates between base images and snapshots
[2013-02-01 16:08:44 -0500] galstrom: matt: you are correct.. i believe
[2013-02-01 16:08:48 -0500] mattt: actually it does now, don't think it did at some point ... and it was annoying
[2013-02-01 16:09:03 -0500] galstrom: nice
[2013-02-01 17:25:05 -0500] mattray: galstrom: https://gist.github.com/4692718
[2013-02-01 18:01:35 -0500] galstrom: mattray: very nice
[2013-02-01 19:27:50 -0500] jcannava: nova-client?
