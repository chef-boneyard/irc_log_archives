[2013-02-20 12:19:50 -0500] baumer: I've tried to install on Ubuntu LTS and then on start I'm getting a require error
[2013-02-20 13:04:08 -0500] baumer: I've just stepped down to ruby 1.8.7 and uninstalled and re-installed chef chefserver and rabbitmq as well as removed the directory, but I still get a fail on some of the set up with little info or logs to say what actually failed, can someone look at my pastie and help to what actually happened? http://pastie.org/6239612
