[2013-02-05 00:04:52 -0500] mpatel: Has anyone observed chef-solo create multiple <defunct> zombie processes after each run?
[2013-02-05 00:05:43 -0500] mpatel: I have a basic configuration and each time chef-solo runs, I get multiple zombie processes that are defunct.
[2013-02-05 22:13:54 -0500] mattray: availability_zones are for Grizzly right? Not in the API guide, but in Fog
[2013-02-05 22:14:13 -0500] mattray: I'm adding it to knife-openstack even though I can't test it myself.
[2013-02-05 22:14:38 -0500] mattray: just have to make sure it doesn't break anything else
[2013-02-05 22:14:52 -0500] rackerjoe: essex and folsom both support availability_zones
[2013-02-05 22:15:26 -0500] rackerjoe: if folsom (and on) you can even hint to the scheduler the compute node that you should run on with az:compute-node-name
[2013-02-05 22:16:51 -0500] mattray: rackerjoe: hmmm calls against the OS API don't seem to like it
[2013-02-05 22:16:56 -0500] mattray: maybe I'd doing it wrong
[2013-02-05 22:34:37 -0500] mattray: rackerjoe: know of any means to get the list of AZs?
[2013-02-05 22:34:45 -0500] mattray: openstack and hp appear to differ on this
[2013-02-05 22:35:14 -0500] mattray: and the API docs aren't very helpful
[2013-02-05 22:36:34 -0500] rackerjoe: mattray: off hand I do not know without having access to the database...
[2013-02-05 22:36:45 -0500] mattray: heh, DB != API :)
[2013-02-05 22:37:13 -0500] mattray: I'm digging through code to see what's what
[2013-02-05 22:37:47 -0500] rackerjoe: mattray: this may be of interest: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/show-availability-zone
[2013-02-05 22:39:21 -0500] mattray: "Today, these is no way to get all availibility_zones in a region." :(
[2013-02-05 22:39:48 -0500] mattray: Yeah, with HP it felt like magic
[2013-02-05 22:40:11 -0500] mattray: since I was just given a list
[2013-02-05 22:41:04 -0500] mattray: ok, I'll just make the calls smarter then
[2013-02-05 22:41:09 -0500] mattray: thanks
[2013-02-05 23:29:16 -0500] mattray: turfed on the AZ patch
[2013-02-05 23:29:28 -0500] mattray: posted to the ML asking for feedback if anyone has it
[2013-02-05 23:30:35 -0500] mattray: without access to an openstack deployment using them, I can't test the patch and make it sane for deployments with or without AZs
[2013-02-05 23:31:19 -0500] mattray: 0 for 2 on merges today
