[2013-02-12 13:13:15 -0500] newbie_chef: has anyone faced a problem with the relase of the new JSON 1.7.7 that causes the 'run_list' to error out
[2013-02-12 13:50:31 -0500] proppen: darn, performed a "gem update" on server, and now it sais no such file to load -- chef/webui_user
[2013-02-12 13:51:18 -0500] proppen: when starting chef-server
[2013-02-12 16:18:55 -0500] odyssey4me: There's a "rebuild-rings" action that happens if node["swift"]["auto_rebuild_rings"]. I guess this means that if you set that attribute to "true" on the swift management server that it'll automatically update the rings? Or is there another purpose for it?
[2013-02-12 16:19:13 -0500] odyssey4me: Oh, FYI I'm referring to https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/swift/blob/master/recipes/ring-repo.rb
