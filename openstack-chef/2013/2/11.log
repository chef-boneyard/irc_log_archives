[2013-02-11 18:24:09 -0500] ctracey: mattray: you looking over my shoulder?
[2013-02-11 18:24:26 -0500] mattray: my lunch break, on the twitters
[2013-02-11 18:24:47 -0500] ctracey: was literally just looking over partials for nova.conf
[2013-02-11 18:25:33 -0500] mattray: nova.conf was the first thing I thought of when I heard about the feature
[2013-02-11 18:25:51 -0500] mattray: I also want to start using partial search
[2013-02-11 18:26:38 -0500] ctracey: yeah - makes sense, especially at scale
[2013-02-11 18:26:56 -0500] ctracey: in particular, looking at how to stitch in baremetal
[2013-02-11 18:27:08 -0500] ctracey: and looks like partials is the best way
[2013-02-11 18:28:58 -0500] mattray: well, my baremetal flow is https://github.com/mattray/lab-repo which gives way to https://github.com/mattray/openstack-chef-repo
