[2013-02-21 19:45:12 -0500] ctracey`: do folks have thoughts on the future of various providers?  i am thinking specifically of things like keystone_register, etc where Net::HTTP calls are being cratfed in the provider.  do we see these things changing? moving to something like fog? or maybe even shell_out?
