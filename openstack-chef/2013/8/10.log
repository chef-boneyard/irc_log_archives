[2013-08-10 18:32:39 -0400] retr0h: so what is the chef way of chmoding a file chef doesn't manage
[2013-08-10 18:33:01 -0400] retr0h: for exaple I found a bug in horizon & neutronclient
[2013-08-10 18:33:52 -0400] retr0h: where neutronclient uses httplib2 and httplib2 installs a cacerts.txt file as 640 - apache cant read it causing dashboard to get an ssl verify error with certain CAs
[2013-08-10 18:34:12 -0400] retr0h: when making network calls
[2013-08-10 18:34:41 -0400] retr0h: I want to simply chmod 644 and have a httplib2 upstream ticket... but just doing an `execute chmod` okay?
[2013-08-10 18:35:23 -0400] retr0h: would be temporary in the dashboard cookbook until bug got fixed or until neutronclient is migrated to requests lib instead of httplib2
[2013-08-10 19:03:18 -0400] mattray: retr0h: you can use the file resource
[2013-08-10 19:03:43 -0400] mattray: just point it at the file in question and set the permissions. It won't overwrite it, but it'll reset the settings
[2013-08-10 19:04:31 -0400] mattray: retr0h: leave the content empty
[2013-08-10 19:07:03 -0400] mattray: retr0h: that's one of the examples: http://docs.opscode.com/chef/resources.html#id76
[2013-08-10 19:54:04 -0400] retr0h: mattray: sweet.. I was thinking bout that... awesome
[2013-08-10 19:54:11 -0400] mattray: np
[2013-08-10 19:54:23 -0400] retr0h: would the action be :create ?
[2013-08-10 19:55:28 -0400] mattray: yeah, or leave it off like the examples
[2013-08-10 23:33:59 -0400] openstackgerrit: Paul Czarkowski proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-image: support for alternative data_api  https://review.openstack.org/41277
