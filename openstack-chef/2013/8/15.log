[2013-08-15 18:20:24 -0400] ziviani: hello everyone, please is there any guide on how to install openstack using chef cookbooks? I'm facing a hard time by using opscode-cookbooks. Thanks!!!
[2013-08-15 18:27:06 -0400] mattray: ziviani: I'm working on a new version now, but start over in https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo
[2013-08-15 18:27:18 -0400] mattray: and https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Chef/GettingStarted
[2013-08-15 18:27:52 -0400] ziviani: mattray, thanks man
[2013-08-15 19:41:53 -0400] ziviani: mattray, I tried to install openstack-common but, at the end, chef-client finished with no resources updated: https://gist.github.com/jrziviani/6244070. Those synch'ed cookbooks should be installed, right?
[2013-08-15 19:43:22 -0400] mattray: no, they're just dependencies of the openstack-common cookbook
[2013-08-15 19:43:34 -0400] mattray: that run list will run https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common/blob/master/recipes/default.rb
[2013-08-15 19:44:11 -0400] mattray: so it probably added an ubuntu repo
[2013-08-15 19:44:33 -0400] mattray: unless the attributes aren't set
