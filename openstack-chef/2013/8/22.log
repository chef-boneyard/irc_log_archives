[2013-08-22 07:42:53 -0400] test_: I tried it today, but I met an error

[2013-08-22 08:18:11 -0400] s2r2: ohai.  I wonder about the following restriction in the openstack-identity cookbook's resource: https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-identity/blob/master/resources/register.rb#L35
[2013-08-22 08:19:22 -0400] s2r2: Should this really enforce just a set of allowed values?  I stumbled upon it when working on the heat cookbook, trying to register the service-types heat and cloudformation... but it makes me wonder if this should be a whitelist at all -- at least theoretically, anything could be desired to register with keystone...
