[2013-08-14 08:42:09 -0400] odyssey4me: hmm, I'm confused - I want to generate a uuid in a recipe, but doing 'uuid = SecureRandom.uuid' isn't working.
[2013-08-14 08:42:32 -0400] odyssey4me: It would seem that opscode has some sort of built-in mechanism to generate one - how do I use it?
[2013-08-14 08:58:52 -0400] odyssey4me: nevermind, figured it out - just needed to add "require 'securerandom'" ahead of the above statement
[2013-08-14 12:25:39 -0400] odyssey4me: hmmm, is there a way to force a package to install before a part of a recipe is processed? for some reason the package upgrade action is not happening in the right sequence
[2013-08-14 12:38:19 -0400] odyssey4me: never mind - got it

[2013-08-14 20:21:00 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom, ctracey: easy one: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/42004/
[2013-08-14 20:22:00 -0400] galstrom: jaypipes: done
[2013-08-14 20:22:06 -0400] ctracey: lookin
[2013-08-14 20:22:08 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: lol, thx :)
[2013-08-14 20:22:23 -0400] galstrom: np.. want to disable local.. so it actually uses conductor
[2013-08-14 20:22:24 -0400] galstrom: :)
[2013-08-14 20:28:42 -0400] retr0h: disabling conductor == use_local=True :)
[2013-08-14 20:29:57 -0400] retr0h: do does anyone run rabbit in a cluster
[2013-08-14 20:30:04 -0400] retr0h: using the new ha queues stuff?
[2013-08-14 20:31:09 -0400] retr0h: for us.. the default ubuntu rabbit package seems to crap itself constantly

[2013-08-14 23:12:38 -0400] retr0h: mattray: yo
[2013-08-14 23:13:03 -0400] mattray: retr0h: yessir?
[2013-08-14 23:13:18 -0400] retr0h: we have an exception handler which reports when n number of chef-client runs fail
[2013-08-14 23:13:37 -0400] retr0h: It looks as though exception handlers dont get executed if chef-client encounters a
[2013-08-14 23:13:40 -0400] retr0h: Errno::EHOSTUNREACH:
[2013-08-14 23:16:16 -0400] mattray: so the chef-client can't reach the chef-server at all, fails out without calling the exception handlers. Sounds like a high-priority bug to me
[2013-08-14 23:16:40 -0400] mattray: a good candidate for 11.8 IMO
[2013-08-14 23:21:15 -0400] retr0h: well our nodes have a few interfaces
[2013-08-14 23:21:39 -0400] retr0h: and the interface that chef queries over was down
[2013-08-14 23:21:52 -0400] retr0h: so we were expecting nagios alterts over chef not running
[2013-08-14 23:22:30 -0400] retr0h: yah sees like a bug
[2013-08-14 23:26:48 -0400] mattray: since in 11 we made the handlers run even on chef-client failures, this seems like it fits right in with that
[2013-08-14 23:27:41 -0400] mattray: I'd say open a new ticket, high priority. A PR with it would fast-track it
