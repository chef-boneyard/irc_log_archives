[2013-08-06 19:56:14 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: ^^ major issue.... https://review.openstack.org/#/c/40488/
[2013-08-06 19:56:21 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/40488/
[2013-08-06 19:57:28 -0400] galstrom: jaypipes: looking
[2013-08-06 19:58:04 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: thx man, much appreciated.
[2013-08-06 20:00:16 -0400] galstrom: jaypipes: np
[2013-08-06 20:00:37 -0400] galstrom: did you test the node.recipes.include?  -- locally
[2013-08-06 20:00:51 -0400] galstrom: err.. on your env?
[2013-08-06 20:01:07 -0400] galstrom: i seem to remember that being funky
[2013-08-06 20:01:12 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: gimme a few and I will.
[2013-08-06 20:01:30 -0400] galstrom: i +2'd anyway cause it is the code that one should use in that situation
[2013-08-06 20:01:55 -0400] galstrom: i just seem to remember running into something where i could not get at the expanded recipe dict correctly
[2013-08-06 20:02:06 -0400] galstrom: hopefully it was a minor revison bug on chef-client > 11
[2013-08-06 20:02:31 -0400] jaypipes: ah, iok... well lemme test in vagabond...
[2013-08-06 20:02:47 -0400] galstrom: i think you could test in chef-shell if you have a node handy
[2013-08-06 20:03:05 -0400] galstrom: nvm.. i just read your last comment
[2013-08-06 20:03:47 -0400] openstackgerrit: Jay Pipes proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common: Ensure we return [node] if search returns nothing  https://review.openstack.org/40488
[2013-08-06 20:04:05 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: ^^ updated metadata version and changelog...forgot to do that

[2013-08-06 20:11:53 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: didn't work :( ugh... FWIW, I'm trying to do a generic solution to the problem instead of using https://review.openstack.org/#/c/39411/
[2013-08-06 20:13:17 -0400] galstrom: jaypipes: is it able to access the expanded recipes? or is it looking for a recipe that is not on the run_list but is included via another recipe
[2013-08-06 20:13:58 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: I'm not sure :( I'm pulling Paul C's patch above locally and trying his fix.
[2013-08-06 20:14:07 -0400] galstrom: ok
[2013-08-06 20:15:12 -0400] galstrom: cause i had to do this last time i ran into this: node.run_list.expand(node.chef_environment).recipes.include?("some::recipe")
[2013-08-06 20:15:32 -0400] galstrom: err.. and by i had to do it.. one of the guys on my team figured it out.. mancdaz i believe
[2013-08-06 20:15:37 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: lol, so Paul's patch works... but my patch (which does exactly the same thing, but in the library routine instead) does not. :(
[2013-08-06 20:15:48 -0400] galstrom: hm..
[2013-08-06 20:16:19 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: you think it's the expand(environment) thing that is missing from my solution>?
[2013-08-06 20:16:26 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: I'll give that a shot...
[2013-08-06 20:16:48 -0400] galstrom: honestly i am not sure..
[2013-08-06 20:17:06 -0400] galstrom: it depends on where you are in the namespace in the library.. which is always crazy if your in a library
[2013-08-06 20:17:28 -0400] galstrom: and there are other weird things.. like if you are looking for a recipe that is included by another recipe it does not work right
[2013-08-06 20:17:45 -0400] galstrom: that is one of those things.. where you keep jacking with it until you get a solution that goes..
[2013-08-06 20:17:52 -0400] galstrom: that one might work for you..
[2013-08-06 20:18:12 -0400] galstrom: if not.. you are hitting some other edge case
[2013-08-06 20:18:14 -0400] galstrom: so yay?
[2013-08-06 20:23:21 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: no luck :(
[2013-08-06 20:24:41 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: screw it... let's approve Paul's patch... at least it works.
[2013-08-06 20:24:50 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: I'm going to write to the Chef mailing list about it.
[2013-08-06 20:27:01 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: if you could check https://review.openstack.org/#/c/39411/ and approve, that would be great
