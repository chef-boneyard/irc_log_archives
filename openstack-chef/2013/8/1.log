[2013-08-01 20:49:57 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom, ctracey: ^^ is an important fix, if you have a moment. thanks!
[2013-08-01 20:50:24 -0400] ctracey: lookin
[2013-08-01 20:51:24 -0400] ctracey: jaypipes: while im lookin...thoughts on a nova.conf attributes that is a generic hash for "unsupported" config items?
[2013-08-01 20:51:38 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: could you elaborate?
[2013-08-01 20:51:52 -0400] ctracey: i have a number of obscure config items
[2013-08-01 20:52:14 -0400] ctracey: so im thinking we should just have a hash of key/value pairs to support those sorts of things
[2013-08-01 20:52:26 -0400] ctracey: that hash gets expanded in nova.conf
[2013-08-01 20:53:48 -0400] ctracey: api auth versionfor keystone is v3 by default?!
[2013-08-01 20:54:18 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: I had switched it to v3 default recently, yes...
[2013-08-01 20:54:28 -0400] ctracey: oh - i missed that update
[2013-08-01 20:54:37 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: I had not fully understanded how non-backwards-compatible and broken that was.
[2013-08-01 20:55:03 -0400] ctracey: i believe it
[2013-08-01 20:55:06 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: but the big thing is that auth_uri is required and should be the service API, and the other auth_host/port/protocol values should be the admin endpoint
[2013-08-01 21:00:40 -0400] ctracey: jaypipes: im a little confused about the gsubs. can you elaborate?
[2013-08-01 21:01:35 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: lemme add a code comment for that.. basically, with conversation with dolphm, he said that the only reason someone might want to set auth_uri to a URI that does *not* include /v2.0/ is if they need non-default-domain v3 Keystone tokens...
[2013-08-01 21:02:49 -0400] ctracey: ok - i see the thread now
[2013-08-01 21:03:54 -0400] ctracey: yay keystone
[2013-08-01 21:05:32 -0400] ctracey: i think all of this needs to move into common, but as it was not already there, I am ok with it
[2013-08-01 21:06:05 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: agreed, thus the TODO(jaypipes) comment ;)
[2013-08-01 21:06:40 -0400] ctracey: yes - just agreeing with ya
[2013-08-01 21:07:11 -0400] ctracey: are you adding comments or should i just approve?

[2013-08-01 21:11:19 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey, galstrom, retr0h: ok, fixed the one error and re-pushed (along with a code comment explaining the v2.0 gsub thing)
[2013-08-01 21:13:07 -0400] ctracey: jaypipes: soon as Jenkins picks it up, I think youre gtg
[2013-08-01 21:14:14 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: cheers
[2013-08-01 21:15:22 -0400] galstrom: now your good..
[2013-08-01 21:15:28 -0400] galstrom: i think
[2013-08-01 21:15:34 -0400] galstrom: needed a +approve
[2013-08-01 21:15:42 -0400] galstrom: or does that get done automatically now?
[2013-08-01 21:16:14 -0400] ctracey: i actually had failed tests earlier in compute
[2013-08-01 21:16:24 -0400] ctracey: dont know if it was just my fork or not
[2013-08-01 21:44:58 -0400] jaypipes: ctracey: ah... so I need to update that cookbook's unit tests since that https -> http default endpoint change went through... doing so now.
