[2013-08-26 18:29:05 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom, ctracey, mattray: looks to be an easy win: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/43746/
[2013-08-26 18:29:59 -0400] galstrom: jaypipes: +2R,+1A
[2013-08-26 18:30:53 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: ty sir :)
[2013-08-26 18:31:04 -0400] galstrom: np
[2013-08-26 18:31:04 -0400] jaypipes: galstrom: https://review.openstack.org/40935 looks pretty good too :)
[2013-08-26 18:31:22 -0400] alop: Yes, it's serious like 3 new lines :)
[2013-08-26 18:31:38 -0400] alop: spent way more effort writing the tests :)
[2013-08-26 18:32:11 -0400] galstrom: jaypipes: done
[2013-08-26 18:32:23 -0400] jaypipes: :) thx
[2013-08-26 18:32:45 -0400] ctracey: ooof
[2013-08-26 18:33:14 -0400] ctracey: this is a prime example for omnibus-openstack
[2013-08-26 18:33:23 -0400] ctracey: thanks alop!
[2013-08-26 18:34:49 -0400] ctracey: alop: is there a specific version of stevedore supported?
[2013-08-26 18:35:06 -0400] alop: stevedore > 0.8.3
[2013-08-26 18:35:17 -0400] alop: ubuntu 12.04 ships with 0.8.0 default
[2013-08-26 18:35:24 -0400] alop: 0.10 availa
[2013-08-26 18:35:52 -0400] alop: unfortunately, the python_pip provider doesn't allow me to spec versions, yet.
[2013-08-26 18:36:01 -0400] ctracey: heh
[2013-08-26 18:36:04 -0400] ctracey: #fail
[2013-08-26 18:36:08 -0400] ctracey: fair enough
[2013-08-26 18:36:09 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-network: Parameterize L3 and DHCP Agent Scheduler Classes  https://review.openstack.org/43746
[2013-08-26 18:36:36 -0400] ctracey: wont it be glorious when we dont have distros?
[2013-08-26 18:37:01 -0400] alop: sounds like the VMWare model
[2013-08-26 18:37:21 -0400] alop: "Here, take this ISO, install it on bare metal, and you'll have ESX"
[2013-08-26 18:37:42 -0400] alop: which I guess isn't the worst thing in the world, as they're a huge company
[2013-08-26 18:37:51 -0400] ctracey: heh - i used to work there
[2013-08-26 18:38:02 -0400] alop: feel better now?
[2013-08-26 18:38:15 -0400] ctracey: they had a perception problem around the early days of ESX. folks thought it was RedHat based.
[2013-08-26 18:38:35 -0400] alop: well, if you saw the installer, it was anaconda, at least looked like it
[2013-08-26 18:38:44 -0400] ctracey: yes it was
[2013-08-26 18:38:52 -0400] ctracey: and the console was also RedHat
[2013-08-26 18:39:02 -0400] openstackgerrit: A change was merged to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-block-storage: Upgrading 'stevedore' module for bug 1169730  https://review.openstack.org/40935
[2013-08-26 18:39:09 -0400] ctracey: but the kernel was not a linux kernel
[2013-08-26 18:41:20 -0400] ctracey: my proposed talk at the Summit is about making the distro a non-factor
[2013-08-26 18:41:35 -0400] ctracey: highly doubt it will be selected
[2013-08-26 18:42:07 -0400] ctracey: though I will be curious to see the breakdown of which companies get the talks
[2013-08-26 18:45:03 -0400] openstackgerrit: Abel Lopez proposed a change to stackforge/cookbook-openstack-block-storage: Updated the README  https://review.openstack.org/43753

[2013-08-26 19:24:36 -0400] ccope: hey guys, what's the best place to grab roles right now? the stackforge/openstack-chef-repo roles seem to be out of date
[2013-08-26 19:25:27 -0400] ccope: i'm having a lot of issues where ::default and ::db recipes no longer exist
[2013-08-26 19:26:15 -0400] ctracey: hey ccope
[2013-08-26 19:26:44 -0400] ccope: ah, hey craig
[2013-08-26 19:27:19 -0400] ctracey: i think we are all using our own wrapper repos
[2013-08-26 19:28:03 -0400] ctracey: are there particular roles you are looking for?
[2013-08-26 19:28:21 -0400] ctracey: (we need to be better about that)
[2013-08-26 19:29:28 -0400] ctracey: right now mine is on our own GH instance.  I can try to get it out there.
[2013-08-26 19:29:38 -0400] ctracey: but it will take a while to sanitize
[2013-08-26 19:34:19 -0400] ccope: we were going to spin up an os-compute-single-controller before we moved forward with separate services on separate nodes
[2013-08-26 19:36:34 -0400] ccope: we've hit snags on os-dashboard, os-identity, and os-network so far
[2013-08-26 19:42:31 -0400] ctracey: oh yeah?
[2013-08-26 19:42:48 -0400] ctracey: anything in particular?
[2013-08-26 19:44:30 -0400] ccope: https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo/blob/master/roles/os-image-registry.rb#L5
[2013-08-26 19:44:57 -0400] ccope: https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo/blob/master/roles/os-network.rb#L5
[2013-08-26 19:46:08 -0400] ccope: https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo/blob/master/roles/os-dashboard.rb#L5
[2013-08-26 19:46:34 -0400] ctracey: ok - let me get you mine
[2013-08-26 19:47:42 -0400] ccope: this is the last missing recipe one we've hit: https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo/blob/master/roles/os-image-api.rb#L5
[2013-08-26 19:48:36 -0400] ctracey: ccope - in all of those cases, this is simply a matter of removing those db recipes
[2013-08-26 19:54:06 -0400] ccope: ctracey: k, that's what we're doing. i was just wondering if someone else had a repo that was tracking the cookbook development more closely, since we've ended up playing whack-a-mole in our vagrant testing.
[2013-08-26 19:56:08 -0400] ctracey: ccope: that repo is intended as an example, and has clearly not been updated adequately. I am pushing a change for that now.
[2013-08-26 19:57:01 -0400] ctracey: ccope: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/43770/
[2013-08-26 19:57:20 -0400] ctracey: if anyone wants to review that, it'd be much appreciated.
[2013-08-26 19:57:56 -0400] ccope: ok cool. there's no openstack-network::default anymore either, so the os-network role also needs updating
[2013-08-26 20:13:23 -0400] ccope: https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-chef-repo/blob/master/roles/os-compute-cert.rb#L5 should be openstack-compute::nova-cert
[2013-08-26 20:15:13 -0400] ccope: i guess i'll look into how to contribute directly so i don't keep spamming silly one-line changes in this chatroom :)
[2013-08-26 20:15:25 -0400] mattray: ccope: much appreciated!
[2013-08-26 20:16:18 -0400] mattray: FWIW, I've got a branch off of chef-docs for the OpenStack stuff to show up on docs.opscode.com here: https://github.com/mattray/chef-docs/tree/openstack
[2013-08-26 20:16:24 -0400] mattray: hope to merge it this week
[2013-08-26 20:16:41 -0400] mattray: so I'll have my fingers in the readmes a bit too
