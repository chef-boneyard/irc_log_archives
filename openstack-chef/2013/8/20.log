[2013-08-20 16:28:48 -0400] ishan: hi ctracey
[2013-08-20 16:29:00 -0400] ctracey: hey there
[2013-08-20 16:29:09 -0400] ishan: ok so Im really stuck
[2013-08-20 16:29:16 -0400] ishan: and would really apprecite some help
[2013-08-20 16:29:34 -0400] ishan: Can I go ahead and describe what I'm trying to do? then maybe you can help me out with that?
[2013-08-20 16:29:42 -0400] ctracey: sure
[2013-08-20 16:29:53 -0400] ctracey: i do have a hard stop soon though
[2013-08-20 16:30:27 -0400] ishan: ok ctracey do you want me to call you then? I could do that it's really quite a pickle I'm in
[2013-08-20 16:30:39 -0400] ctracey: no, here is fine
[2013-08-20 16:30:40 -0400] ishan: but let me proceed- I have used devstack to use openstack
[2013-08-20 16:30:48 -0400] ishan: but I want to use Chef now to deploy it
[2013-08-20 16:31:17 -0400] ishan: Since I just have the one node- my Chef Server and my Chef Workstation are on the same node as my Nodes (where I run the chef client)
[2013-08-20 16:31:50 -0400] ishan: I saw the community repos that there are for openstack-chef (stackforge) being one of them
[2013-08-20 16:32:04 -0400] ishan: I dont quite understand what to do after I clone that particular community repo
[2013-08-20 16:32:10 -0400] ishan: so I'm stuck there
[2013-08-20 16:32:28 -0400] ctracey: are you a chef user?
[2013-08-20 16:32:45 -0400] ishan: Im using a open source chef server if that's what you're asking?
[2013-08-20 16:33:04 -0400] ctracey: no, I'm asking about your familiarity with Chef
[2013-08-20 16:33:16 -0400] ishan: oh no, very limited
[2013-08-20 16:33:20 -0400] ishan: am still grappling with the basics
[2013-08-20 16:34:05 -0400] ctracey: OK, well the basic premise is that the cookbooks in the stackforge repositories are cookbooks for specific openstack services/components
[2013-08-20 16:34:18 -0400] ishan: right, got that
[2013-08-20 16:34:24 -0400] ctracey: it is up to the user to orchestrate how they use those cookbooks
[2013-08-20 16:34:29 -0400] ishan: how do I deploy those services on a client
[2013-08-20 16:34:34 -0400] ishan: correct- following you till here
[2013-08-20 16:34:38 -0400] ishan: lets take a scenario
[2013-08-20 16:34:41 -0400] ctracey: typically a user will make use of a tool like Berkshelf
[2013-08-20 16:34:49 -0400] ishan: I have a chef server and workstation setup
[2013-08-20 16:34:54 -0400] ctracey: in order to pull in cookbook dependencies
[2013-08-20 16:35:00 -0400] ishan: ok
[2013-08-20 16:35:57 -0400] ctracey: then once you have the chef server loaded, it would be typical for you to start outlining your environments and roles
[2013-08-20 16:36:04 -0400] ctracey: but this is nothing specific to chef for OpenStack
[2013-08-20 16:36:11 -0400] ctracey: this is just basic chef
[2013-08-20 16:36:19 -0400] ishan: I tried using berkshelf and spiceweasel but the thing is that im behind a proxy server and the command spiceweasel infrastructure.yml failed due to proxy
[2013-08-20 16:36:24 -0400] ishan: you're right- I do understand that
[2013-08-20 16:36:46 -0400] ishan: what I want to know is that if I want to use my chef server to deploy a all-in-one openstack instance on my local client- then how do i do that?
[2013-08-20 16:37:30 -0400] ctracey: the basic way to do that would be to create a role with the sub-roles/recipes you want and then apply that role to the node you are building
[2013-08-20 16:37:39 -0400] ishan: i got the chef-server setup. cloned the repository (Stackforge) one- then now what's next?
[2013-08-20 16:37:58 -0400] ishan: ok so I did create a node via the web-ui
[2013-08-20 16:38:20 -0400] ctracey: ishan: i would recommend that if you are new to Chef (or any other config management tool) to not start with openstack
[2013-08-20 16:38:39 -0400] ishan: oh....what would you recommend?
[2013-08-20 16:38:51 -0400] ctracey: openstack even in its simplest form is perhaps one of the most complicated config management setups
[2013-08-20 16:39:14 -0400] ishan: that's true
[2013-08-20 16:39:16 -0400] ctracey: Chef is perfectly fine...provided you know the basics
[2013-08-20 16:39:42 -0400] ctracey: I would read more on how Chef works and try to setup some simple nodes first...
[2013-08-20 16:39:54 -0400] ctracey: perhaps apache? or mysql?
[2013-08-20 16:40:03 -0400] ishan: I tried reading online documents- didnt find them very helpful
[2013-08-20 16:40:03 -0400] ctracey: then venture into the deep end
[2013-08-20 16:40:10 -0400] ishan: mysql via chef you mean?
[2013-08-20 16:41:30 -0400] ctracey: yes
[2013-08-20 16:41:36 -0400] ishan: right, ok
[2013-08-20 16:41:43 -0400] ctracey: and depending on where you are located, opscode does offer many opportunities to learn Chef
[2013-08-20 16:41:47 -0400] ishan: could you recommend a guide where I could learn to do that?
[2013-08-20 16:42:00 -0400] ishan: well I'm from India- dont know if you have it here?
[2013-08-20 16:42:52 -0400] ctracey: definitely opscode.com
[2013-08-20 16:43:01 -0400] ctracey: check out "the berkshelf way"
[2013-08-20 16:43:11 -0400] ishan: ok sure thanks
[2013-08-20 16:43:17 -0400] ishan: let me have a look
