[2013-08-29 11:39:42 -0400] jb__: hi all
[2013-08-29 11:43:03 -0400] jb__: I'm using the latest git master and trying to setup openstack. After assigning the role os-compute-single-controller to a node chef-client fatals with "Error message: Unable to satisfy constraints on package database due to solution constraint"
[2013-08-29 11:43:58 -0400] jb__: it was an empty chef-server and i've used berks and spiceweasel to upload all the components
[2013-08-29 11:45:10 -0400] jb__: any hints would be nice =)
[2013-08-29 11:53:18 -0400] jb__: ah.. now i see, (openstack-ops-database = 7.0.0) -> (database >= 1.4.0)
[2013-08-29 11:53:40 -0400] jb__: and the Berksfile has database pinned on 1.3.12
[2013-08-29 11:55:12 -0400] jb__: same for (openstack-ops-messaging = 7.0.0) -> (rabbitmq >= 2.1.0), Berksfile pinns rabbitmq on 2.0.0
[2013-08-29 11:55:25 -0400] jb__: should one make a pull request for berksfile changes?
[2013-08-29 12:20:09 -0400] jb__: hmm, ./roles/os-image-api.rb has "recipe[openstack-image::db]" in the run_list, which doesnt exist anymore
[2013-08-29 12:20:29 -0400] jb__: same for ./roles/os-image-registry.rb
[2013-08-29 13:29:37 -0400] jb__: hmm.. could not find recipe default for cookbook openstack-network
