[2012-06-04 00:53:50 -0400] amagee: hey can someone point me to the best instructions for registering a chef client?  i've got as far as installing the open source chef server, i have created a client on that machine (using knife client create), i have the .pem files, and i have the chef client software installed on my local machine
[2012-06-04 00:55:23 -0400] amagee: i've been trying this http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Fast+Start+Guide , but it seems to be tailored towards hosted chef; i don't know where to get the knife.rb file it refers to, and i'm not sure if ORGANIZATION-validator.pem translates to validation.pem?
[2012-06-04 00:56:43 -0400] miah: amagee: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Knife#Knife-Knifeconfiguration
[2012-06-04 00:56:54 -0400] miah: yes, validation.pem == ORGANIZATION-validator.pem
[2012-06-04 00:57:34 -0400] amagee: miah: so i construct the knife.rb file myself?
[2012-06-04 00:59:01 -0400] miah: yes, sure
[2012-06-04 00:59:07 -0400] miah: editing a file isn't too hard
[2012-06-04 00:59:31 -0400] miah: also
[2012-06-04 00:59:32 -0400] miah: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Knife+Built+In+Subcommands#KnifeBuiltInSubcommands-Configure
[2012-06-04 00:59:36 -0400] miah: rftm ftw
[2012-06-04 01:00:34 -0400] amagee: well it's not hard once you actually know you're supposed to do it..
[2012-06-04 01:02:35 -0400] miah: may i suggest: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Workstation+Setup
[2012-06-04 01:03:18 -0400] amagee: that's one of the pages i've been reading
[2012-06-04 01:04:17 -0400] amagee: aha, things are happening!
[2012-06-04 01:04:57 -0400] miah: yay
[2012-06-04 01:13:10 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: I would have been here sooner, but I had to automate the local installation of an IRC client. :)
[2012-06-04 01:15:15 -0400] miah: lol
[2012-06-04 01:18:33 -0400] jtimberman: jbarnette: no worries :D
[2012-06-04 01:18:47 -0400] jtimberman: run_list: ['recipe[irssi]']
[2012-06-04 01:19:43 -0400] jbarnette: jtimberman: I can dump a bit on what I'm trying to do in here if you're up for it, or I can take it to /msg or somewhere else if it's too chatty.
[2012-06-04 01:20:17 -0400] jtimberman: jbarnette: #chef-hacking is a fine place to chat, its the "development" focused channel, this one is more "general user" topics.
[2012-06-04 01:20:27 -0400] jbarnette: ah, perfect
[2012-06-04 01:20:33 -0400] jtimberman: both are indexed by the googles and logged on our community site.
[2012-06-04 01:26:11 -0400] cheeseplus: ohai
[2012-06-04 01:26:55 -0400] miah: hi
[2012-06-04 01:28:46 -0400] cheeseplus: so first real work related chef question, the checksum for remote_file is sha256 right\\?
[2012-06-04 01:30:44 -0400] miah: yes
[2012-06-04 01:35:20 -0400] cheeseplus: miah: that is what I thought, just the checksum I have in this existing cookbook doesn't seem to match any of the files
[2012-06-04 01:36:15 -0400] jtimberman: cheeseplus: there's two kinds of checksums used. the ones for content idempotence by the cookbook_file, remote_file, file, and template resources use SHA256. Then there are checksums of the files that the Chef Server stores when you upload/retrieve cookbooks through the API, which are MD5.
[2012-06-04 01:36:25 -0400] jtimberman: the MD5's have nothing to do with the content checking though :)
[2012-06-04 01:36:44 -0400] cheeseplus: jtimberman: that is super helpful info
[2012-06-04 01:37:03 -0400] cheeseplus: yea I am looking at something where we are running a checksum with remote_file
[2012-06-04 01:37:43 -0400] cheeseplus: and if I shasum -a 256 the tarballs it is referencing I don't get any matches
[2012-06-04 01:42:13 -0400] miah: shasum -pa 256 <file>
[2012-06-04 01:42:18 -0400] miah: =)
[2012-06-04 01:42:34 -0400] cheeseplus_: miah: oh I tried with portable too
[2012-06-04 01:42:46 -0400] miah: strange
[2012-06-04 01:43:04 -0400] cheeseplus_: but I shall investigate further once I devour this pizza
[2012-06-04 01:43:34 -0400] cheeseplus_: and hopefully helpful minds will be around
[2012-06-04 01:52:24 -0400] miah: i will
[2012-06-04 01:52:34 -0400] miah: im probably going to start my adventure back towards home soon
[2012-06-04 01:52:42 -0400] miah: looks like some guy is setting up to play guitar at this coffeeshop
[2012-06-04 01:55:44 -0400] miah: ok. bbiaf
[2012-06-04 04:39:03 -0400] BryanWB_: ohai chefs!
[2012-06-04 04:41:18 -0400] amagee: hey i'm having a problem with an encrypted data bag
[2012-06-04 04:41:44 -0400] amagee: i've created it fine - i can do knife data bag show --secret-file /etc/chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret ssl_keys keys, and this shows the data correctly
[2012-06-04 04:42:14 -0400] amagee: but then in a recipe I do this: keys = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("ssl_keys", "keys", "/etc/chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret"), and I get "OpenSSL::Cipher::CipherError: bad decrypt" when I try to access keys["certificate"]
[2012-06-04 04:48:49 -0400] miah: hi BryanWB_
[2012-06-04 04:49:24 -0400] BryanWB_: miah: moin
[2012-06-04 04:50:33 -0400] miah: hows it going BryanWB_ ?
[2012-06-04 04:55:48 -0400] BryanWB_: miah: pretty hectic, yourself? how job search?
[2012-06-04 04:58:42 -0400] miah: its going alright. still looking. gf is in south america so its mostly funemployment time.
[2012-06-04 05:00:32 -0400] flaccid_: miah: where abouts are you?

[2012-06-04 05:02:21 -0400] BryanWB_: i can vouch that miah is way smart
[2012-06-04 05:03:11 -0400] flaccid_: i don't think there is a need to vouch hehe
[2012-06-04 05:03:44 -0400] flaccid_: miah: we have lots of jobs going atm that might suit http://tbe.taleo.net/NA4/ats/careers/searchResults.jsp;jsessionid=74F68CA97F11D847BB4A84CF6595DAEC.NA4_primary_jvm?org=RIGHTSCALE&cws=1
[2012-06-04 05:04:13 -0400] miah: how big is rightscale now?
[2012-06-04 05:04:24 -0400] flaccid_: in terms of?
[2012-06-04 05:04:32 -0400] miah: company size
[2012-06-04 05:04:40 -0400] miah: # of employees?
[2012-06-04 05:05:12 -0400] miah: looks huge
[2012-06-04 05:06:50 -0400] flaccid_: couple of hundred, might be more now
[2012-06-04 05:07:06 -0400] flaccid_: in the staff photo i'm one of the dudes laying down in the front hehe
[2012-06-04 05:08:46 -0400] miah: well, all the guys lying in that photo are obviously flaccid
[2012-06-04 05:09:07 -0400] flaccid_: luckily :)
[2012-06-04 05:36:11 -0400] thedeeno: I don't really understand how keys are distributed for private git repo's with the opscode application cookbook. Anyone have any thoughts?
[2012-06-04 05:36:50 -0400] thedeeno: I see an option for adding a public key to the chef run, but how does the private key get on the node?
[2012-06-04 07:25:47 -0400] BryanWB_: miah: what do u use to monitor your jvms?
[2012-06-04 08:01:32 -0400] marbury: hi there
[2012-06-04 08:03:20 -0400] marbury: can anybody give me a hint on this? When starting chef server it generates the DB-Entries and the validator.pem but not the webui.pem. despite the log message: ERROR: Error opening validation key: No such file or directory - /etc/chef/webui.pem -- destroying and regenerating
[2012-06-04 08:04:45 -0400] marbury: there are no other error messages and even deleting the DB didn't help
[2012-06-04 08:05:12 -0400] marbury: the DB-entry for webui is created and even the (I think it's the) public key entry
[2012-06-04 08:05:37 -0400] marbury: version is 0.10.10
[2012-06-04 08:06:26 -0400] railsraider: is there a way to run chef-client with color output?
[2012-06-04 08:11:10 -0400] royh: Y U NO WANT COLORS???
[2012-06-04 08:13:26 -0400] royh: ERR.. wrong meme.
[2012-06-04 08:14:42 -0400] marbury: nobody?
[2012-06-04 08:14:43 -0400] bawt: nobody is stopping any of you from making a bzr branch with the patch instead of complaining about this :P
[2012-06-04 08:15:05 -0400] BryanWB_: railsraider: not afaik
[2012-06-04 08:15:24 -0400] railsraider: is there a way to run a single cookbook using chef-client?
[2012-06-04 08:15:28 -0400] BryanWB_: marbury: u not using the omnibus installer?
[2012-06-04 08:15:47 -0400] BryanWB_: railsraider: just have a single cookbook in your run_list?
[2012-06-04 08:16:24 -0400] marbury: BryanWB_: I installed via "gem install" and followed the documentation on manual install
[2012-06-04 08:16:41 -0400] marbury: got to install chef on some crappy customer suse boxes ^^
[2012-06-04 08:16:44 -0400] railsraider: yeah, except have  along list and i don't want to maintain it if i wanna run just one out of them
[2012-06-04 08:20:26 -0400] marbury: BryanWB_: according to many sources chef-server should regenerate the pem's when they are not available and at least it is logging that it is doing so
[2012-06-04 08:20:57 -0400] marbury: just wanted to know if this may be a bug that anybody encountered or if there is something I might have overlooked?
[2012-06-04 08:22:02 -0400] BryanWB_: marbury: argh :(, dunno haven't ls
[2012-06-04 08:27:03 -0400] haakon_: royh: http://edge.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/527873/80462491.jpg
[2012-06-04 08:27:04 -0400] haakon_: ;-)
[2012-06-04 08:27:45 -0400] royh: haakon_: haha! Fancy seeing you here! :D
[2012-06-04 08:30:36 -0400] railsraider: how can i get knife to run on the node itself using chef-client, i want to be able to use my script to generate hosts file using knife backspace server list
[2012-06-04 08:31:23 -0400] BryanWB_: knife ssh "name:some_host_name" chef-client -x root -i your_key_rsa
[2012-06-04 08:32:37 -0400] marbury: well thx anyway I think I'll write to the mailing list then, if I cannot find anything
[2012-06-04 08:32:51 -0400] BryanWB_: marbury: the ml is generally quite responsive
[2012-06-04 08:33:04 -0400] marbury: okay thx ... bye
[2012-06-04 08:33:10 -0400] railsraider: BryanWB_:  i have this script http://www.pastie.org/private/hdq9fa4hn10kkzropumeg it depends on my knife.rb on my dev machine do you think using knife ssh will work?
[2012-06-04 08:38:07 -0400] BryanWB_: hmm, actually probably just best using a regular ruby script that wraps ssh
[2012-06-04 08:40:56 -0400] BryanWB_: only benefit of knife ssh is that searches the chef repository for u and executes ssh commands on the results of that search
[2012-06-04 09:09:41 -0400] babysnakes: hi, I need help debugging why a node doesn't accept the override_attributes in the role. when I run 'knife node show NODENAME -a nagios' I get the correct attributes, but on the node itself when I run 'shef -z' I get the default values.
[2012-06-04 09:10:48 -0400] BryanWB_: babysnakes: shef doesn't load attributes from roles
[2012-06-04 09:11:29 -0400] babysnakes: it loads other attributes, just not the nagios ones :)
[2012-06-04 09:12:10 -0400] babysnakes: BryanWB_: are you sure? I use it all the time
[2012-06-04 09:12:36 -0400] BryanWB_: perhaps i am out of date then
[2012-06-04 09:14:07 -0400] babysnakes: BryanWB_: I'm afraid you are :) see this: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Roles#Roles-TheRubyDSL
[2012-06-04 09:16:34 -0400] BryanWB_: babysnakes: i can't find where it says that roles are loaded in shef,  i must look closer :\
[2012-06-04 09:17:20 -0400] BryanWB_: but i will be very excited if i can see role info in shef
[2012-06-04 09:17:30 -0400] babysnakes: oh, sorry, you meant in *shef*. I missed that...
[2012-06-04 09:18:10 -0400] babysnakes: but it seems that the node doesn't accept that attributes also
[2012-06-04 09:18:16 -0400] BryanWB_: yeah, confusing name ;)
[2012-06-04 09:18:52 -0400] babysnakes: how can I tell if the node itself accepts the attributes? (judging from the output of the configuration it doesn't)?
[2012-06-04 09:19:21 -0400] BryanWB_: put require 'pry'; binding.pry  inside a recipe
[2012-06-04 09:19:41 -0400] BryanWB_: of course   $ gem install pry pry-nav pry-doc     first
[2012-06-04 09:19:52 -0400] BryanWB_: gives u a debugging breakpoint
[2012-06-04 09:20:55 -0400] babysnakes: BryanWB_: that's a good idea, I'll try that
[2012-06-04 09:29:38 -0400] codeshepherd: i want to install rcconf command in ubuntu.. but I don't find a cookbook for it.. should I write one?
[2012-06-04 09:29:57 -0400] railsraider: what is the cookbook path on chef servers?
[2012-06-04 09:58:16 -0400] railsraider: anyone knows where the cookbooks are uploaded to on chef server its a mystery to me
[2012-06-04 09:58:26 -0400] railsraider: find locate doesn't find them
[2012-06-04 09:59:49 -0400] codeshepherd: anyone around
[2012-06-04 10:02:30 -0400] railsraider: where are my cookbooks stored on chef-server?
[2012-06-04 10:04:51 -0400] babysnakes: BryanWB_: thanks for the pry idea. It solved the problem. It seems that the problem was in the nagios cookbook and not in the attributes.
[2012-06-04 10:12:15 -0400] brugidou: does anyone know why i loose all existing attributes and all solr indexing of a node after doing a "knife node from file mynode.json" ?
[2012-06-04 10:13:28 -0400] brugidou: i just did a knife node show mynode -Fj > mynode.json
[2012-06-04 10:13:54 -0400] brugidou: (trying to manage my nodes config from json+git so i can easily track/recover)
[2012-06-04 10:26:45 -0400] codeshepherd: tazz:
[2012-06-04 10:27:47 -0400] codeshepherd: guys - i want to install rcconf command in ubuntu.. but I don't find a cookbook for it.. should I write one - or should I use something generic that will get rcconf installed?
[2012-06-04 10:40:04 -0400] luisfaceira: Hello!
[2012-06-04 10:40:31 -0400] luisfaceira: Is this an appropriate place to ask for help with my chef recipe?
[2012-06-04 10:41:35 -0400] masterkorp: yes
[2012-06-04 10:41:40 -0400] luisfaceira: I'm trying to use the application recipe and would like to set a subpath of my application path as document root
[2012-06-04 10:41:52 -0400] luisfaceira: any tip on how to do that in a simple way?
[2012-06-04 10:43:06 -0400] luisfaceira: the cookbook checks out my private repo successfully and sets up an apache virtual host, but that host has the application base path as documentroot and i need it to be a subpath "/web" inside it (I'm using symfony1.4 php framework)
[2012-06-04 10:44:25 -0400] masterkorp: the apache cookbook gives you the apache_site resource
[2012-06-04 10:45:45 -0400] luisfaceira: and should I use it as a sub-resource of application?
[2012-06-04 10:49:05 -0400] luisfaceira: masterkorp, I use "application" to handle everything, can I use apache_site inside that to personalize it? https://gist.github.com/2867719
[2012-06-04 10:49:25 -0400] masterkorp: no, apache site is a blog of its one
[2012-06-04 10:50:06 -0400] masterkorp: apache_site "001-forums.celticsblog.conf" do
[2012-06-04 10:50:09 -0400] masterkorp:  44   action :enable
[2012-06-04 10:50:10 -0400] masterkorp:  45 end
[2012-06-04 10:50:53 -0400] luisfaceira: and won't it conflict with the one that "application" will configure on its own?
[2012-06-04 10:51:02 -0400] masterkorp: luisfaceira: hey we are from the same country :p
[2012-06-04 10:51:36 -0400] masterkorp: no, you need to have the apache configartion file
[2012-06-04 10:54:08 -0400] luisfaceira: ok, so because I have a small difference in my virtualhost configuration, I can not personalize the application one, I need to set a virtualhost on my own entirely, is that it?
[2012-06-04 10:58:23 -0400] masterkorp: You can use it like a template.
[2012-06-04 11:03:31 -0400] BryanWB_: does omnibus still use clojure to some extent?
[2012-06-04 11:03:50 -0400] BryanWB_: the readme file still references clojure dependencies
[2012-06-04 11:13:28 -0400] ebaynaud: Hi all, does someone know if it is possible to change organization name on opscode?
[2012-06-04 12:05:19 -0400] railsraider: I have a host file that is generated with knife backspace on chef-server, i want to use this file  with the hosts cookbook how can i do?
[2012-06-04 12:06:55 -0400] railsraider: i'vetried remote_file with path but that did work
[2012-06-04 12:08:38 -0400] railsraider: i tired remote_file "/etc/hosts" do  path "/home/admin/hosts.erb"
[2012-06-04 12:08:46 -0400] railsraider: how can i get this to work
[2012-06-04 12:11:12 -0400] railsraider: is there a way to copy a local file from the chef server to the node?
[2012-06-04 12:13:49 -0400] asg: railsraider: try using cookbook_file (http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-CookbookFile)
[2012-06-04 12:14:51 -0400] asg: though if you want a template (.erb), you'll need the template resource instead of cookbook_file
[2012-06-04 12:18:53 -0400] railsraider: asg:  my issue is that my template needs to be generated with knife and rackspace api keys (template resource will try to run that on the node and obviously fail)
[2012-06-04 12:25:35 -0400] asg: railsraider: hmmm, okay. Not sure then. Sorry.
[2012-06-04 12:26:39 -0400] zts: railsraider: the short answer is no, there is no way to copy arbitrary files from the chef server.  You'll either need to put it in a cookbook (and use cookbook_file), or find another way
[2012-06-04 12:26:43 -0400] atomic-penguin: nathenharvey, I know you messaged me yesterday morning.  I missed it however, as my laptop was frozen up.
[2012-06-04 12:27:07 -0400] zts: railsraider: one other way is to run a webserver on your Chef server, use that to make some files available, and pull them onto the node using remote_file
[2012-06-04 12:34:53 -0400] nathenharvey: atomic-penguin: np.  just re-messaged you
[2012-06-04 12:42:33 -0400] railsraider: zts: can i use ssh in the cookbook to run the knife server list and get the results stored in a var?
[2012-06-04 12:43:41 -0400] atomic-penguin: railsraider, you could just use search
[2012-06-04 12:43:43 -0400] atomic-penguin: search?
[2012-06-04 12:43:44 -0400] bawt: search is http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Search
[2012-06-04 12:44:02 -0400] railsraider: bawt: not all of my servers are under chef yet
[2012-06-04 12:44:41 -0400] atomic-penguin: railsraider, bawt only responds to certain triggers (hes a bot after all)
[2012-06-04 12:44:54 -0400] railsraider: hahaha
[2012-06-04 12:46:19 -0400] atomic-penguin: railsraider, so you can get a list of node names from the node index of your chef server, if that is all you need, through search
[2012-06-04 12:46:57 -0400] railsraider: atomic-penguin: i need all of my severs and not all of them will be ,managed by chef
[2012-06-04 12:47:06 -0400] railsraider: i created a hosts file dynamically
[2012-06-04 12:47:20 -0400] railsraider: but it must be run using rackspace api
[2012-06-04 12:47:32 -0400] railsraider: which are on my chef server
[2012-06-04 12:48:12 -0400] atomic-penguin: railsraider, so I guess you have servers which the knife rackspace plugin knows about, but not other subcommands of knife, or your chef-server for that matter
[2012-06-04 12:48:54 -0400] railsraider: knife backspace server list will give you a list with all your servers
[2012-06-04 12:49:17 -0400] railsraider: i then simply use ruby to parse it and create a hosts file
[2012-06-04 12:49:48 -0400] railsraider: now if i only could inject that template into the hosts cookbook on the chef server that would be great!
[2012-06-04 12:50:01 -0400] railsraider: i can maintain updates using crontab or whenever
[2012-06-04 12:50:10 -0400] railsraider: to the template file
[2012-06-04 12:50:36 -0400] railsraider: or if i can use ssh to get back the list
[2012-06-04 12:50:42 -0400] railsraider: from the recipe
[2012-06-04 12:51:18 -0400] leifmadsen: morning all -- I've installed chef server from ubuntu 12.04 packages, and everything works except for anything related to nodes. On the webui, the nodes tab doesn't load (I think I get a 500 error), and same thing with trying to access via knife from a console
[2012-06-04 12:51:31 -0400] leifmadsen: trying to figure out where to track the errors down, any suggestions welcome
[2012-06-04 12:54:07 -0400] atomic-penguin: railsraider, I missed the objective here.  Are you trying to manage your DNS from the hosts file with something like dnsmasq?   Or just trying to run the hosts cb on managed nodes?
[2012-06-04 12:54:59 -0400] railsraider: atomic-penguin: i want a hosts file updated in /etc/hosts on very node i create the hosts should have all servers internal IP
[2012-06-04 12:55:16 -0400] railsraider: i can use knife rackspace to get the list
[2012-06-04 12:55:25 -0400] atomic-penguin: railsraider, so you're using hosts as an ad-hoc dns
[2012-06-04 12:55:30 -0400] railsraider: like this http://www.pastie.org/private/hdq9fa4hn10kkzropumeg
[2012-06-04 12:56:06 -0400] railsraider: its just a basic hosts file dns
[2012-06-04 12:57:25 -0400] railsraider: why chef doesn't have a way to copy files from any directory on it
[2012-06-04 12:59:17 -0400] railsraider: why this isn't working pathName attribute: Path to the directory. (for the remote_file resource)
[2012-06-04 13:01:49 -0400] yfeldblum: no more scripting `knife` ... just query the rackspace api directly with curl or with fog!
[2012-06-04 13:04:32 -0400] atomic-penguin: railsraider, because cookbook files are not flat files, they are stored as BLOB documents in couchdb on the chef-server.  There is a remote_file resource to fetch arbitrary files from a proper web server, however.
[2012-06-04 13:05:40 -0400] railsraider: i'll check yfeldblum suggestion
[2012-06-04 13:06:29 -0400] Sephi: hi everybody
[2012-06-04 13:06:32 -0400] atomic-penguin: I fetch my printer options file directly from the cups server with remote_file, which is pretty badass
[2012-06-04 13:06:48 -0400] leifmadsen: aha got my issue figured out -- for posterity sake, the issue was a "null" node which chef didn't like at all. I created an ssh tunnel to the EC2 instance, connected to http://localhost:5984/_utils/database.html?chef/_design/nodes/_view/all_id then deleted the "null" value. (Help via: http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2010-03/msg00068.html)
[2012-06-04 13:23:55 -0400] lflux: ohai chefsw
[2012-06-04 13:24:02 -0400] lflux: can I rename a node in chef later on?
[2012-06-04 13:35:46 -0400] hcastro: BryanWB_: do you have stub for the next episode here? https://github.com/foodfight/showz
[2012-06-04 13:40:29 -0400] BryanWB_: hcastro: ? like a template?
[2012-06-04 13:41:26 -0400] hcastro: BryanWB_: ya, i saw one for 16 (which i think is next) but no 15
[2012-06-04 13:42:20 -0400] BryanWB_: hcastro: 16 is chef-server, should come out today
[2012-06-04 13:42:46 -0400] BryanWB_: 'how-to-succeed-in-devops' was episode 14 but exploded into two episodes
[2012-06-04 13:43:02 -0400] hcastro: BryanWB_: so fork 16 to add news?
[2012-06-04 13:43:49 -0400] BryanWB_: hcastro: news goes here https://github.com/foodfight/showz/blob/master/whats-cookin/episode_16.md
[2012-06-04 13:44:20 -0400] BryanWB_: hcastro: so to answer your q, yes, however nathenharvey may have already recorded the news for episode 16
[2012-06-04 13:44:36 -0400] BryanWB_: but he will just move the text into the next one
[2012-06-04 13:45:06 -0400] BryanWB_: also, if u would like to add qs for ilya grigorik, in scripts/   that would be gr8
[2012-06-04 13:45:25 -0400] BryanWB_: will interview him as soon as i have intelligent questions to ask ;)
[2012-06-04 13:49:09 -0400] atomic-penguin: 'sup BryanWB_
[2012-06-04 13:49:35 -0400] atomic-penguin: Yay, another foodfight
[2012-06-04 13:49:45 -0400] BryanWB_: atomic-penguin: sup homez
[2012-06-04 13:50:24 -0400] atomic-penguin: OMG netcobol is in the news (cringes)
[2012-06-04 13:51:05 -0400] nathenharvey: hcastro:  do you have some news?  I'm about to record the news section so can include it today or on the next show
[2012-06-04 13:51:28 -0400] atomic-penguin: That was a joke when I originally wrote it.  Just now cleaned it up for public release
[2012-06-04 13:51:44 -0400] atomic-penguin: "I installed COBOL with Chef, now I feel dirty"
[2012-06-04 13:52:38 -0400] hcastro: nathenharvey: just submitted a pull request
[2012-06-04 13:52:45 -0400] BryanWB_: sounds like a disaster movie ;)
[2012-06-04 13:54:53 -0400] hcastro: nathenharvey: brand new -- trying to get it off the ground
[2012-06-04 13:55:10 -0400] atomic-penguin: A lot of the work I did last week was cleaning up cookbooks we use for our ERP system.
[2012-06-04 13:55:27 -0400] nathenharvey: hcastro: great, thanks!
[2012-06-04 13:56:23 -0400] BryanWB_: hcastro:  tks for the minitest-handler patch for ruby 1.9, saved my butt yesterday
[2012-06-04 13:57:07 -0400] hcastro: BryanWB_: np -- this is what came out of the discussion we had a few days ago
[2012-06-04 13:59:18 -0400] BryanWB_: hcastro: merged into master btw
[2012-06-04 14:05:24 -0400] nacer: ohai
[2012-06-04 14:06:36 -0400] dstanek: is it possible to override the clone method in Chef::Git so that I can use the deploy resource to use git-svn?
[2012-06-04 14:16:21 -0400] dstanek: i think i'm going to try to subclass Chef::Provider::Git
[2012-06-04 14:20:43 -0400] leifmadsen: hey all -- having some issues with bootstrapping an EC2 instance via knife. This may not be the case, but it looks like it is trying to connect as user: chef instead of user: chef-validator. Just keep getting a 403 you are not allowed to take this action
[2012-06-04 14:25:51 -0400] nacer: leifmadsen: you have a option for that
[2012-06-04 14:25:56 -0400] flashmanbahadur: Anyone had success using knife to bootstrap an instance by hopping through another host via SSH?
[2012-06-04 14:26:30 -0400] nacer: leifmadsen: oh i misunderstand your question
[2012-06-04 14:26:39 -0400] flashmanbahadur: turning on Knife debug doesnt seem to make it any more verbose
[2012-06-04 14:26:56 -0400] flashmanbahadur: I want to see where it is failing when "Waiting for sshd"
[2012-06-04 14:32:03 -0400] leifmadsen: nacer: this is basically what I'm seeing:   http://pastebin.ca/2158075
[2012-06-04 14:34:11 -0400] nacer: leifmadsen: i think the real error is here : HTTP Request Returned 409 Conflict: Client already exists
[2012-06-04 14:35:45 -0400] leifmadsen: nacer: this is a new bootstrap though, and even if I delete the client and node (which actualyl doesn't exist) it does the same thing
[2012-06-04 14:35:56 -0400] leifmadsen: I wonder if having more couchdb issues...
[2012-06-04 14:36:11 -0400] nacer: leifmadsen: oh you have your own chef server ?
[2012-06-04 14:36:24 -0400] leifmadsen: nacer: well ya
[2012-06-04 14:36:37 -0400] nacer: leifmadsen: you can register un free account on opscode and try with it
[2012-06-04 14:36:42 -0400] leifmadsen: nah
[2012-06-04 14:36:46 -0400] nacer: leifmadsen: this way you can isolate the pb
[2012-06-04 14:38:01 -0400] geekbri: flashmanbahadur: youre using -VV after the knife ssh command?
[2012-06-04 14:38:52 -0400] flashmanbahadur: its an ec2 bootstrap
[2012-06-04 14:38:58 -0400] flashmanbahadur: does the -VV get passed through?
[2012-06-04 14:39:05 -0400] flashmanbahadur: right now I have :debug in my knife.rb
[2012-06-04 14:39:32 -0400] btm: z: last I knew there were OS X build systems ready that just needed to be integrated for Omnibus builds, so soon.
[2012-06-04 14:42:18 -0400] anrope: So, I think I have some kind of circular include somewhere:
[2012-06-04 14:42:20 -0400] anrope: FATAL: ArgumentError: Unable to create Chef::RunList::RunListItem from String:"recipe[recipe[role[[[#<IO:(closed)>], [], []]]]]": must be recipe[] or role[]
[2012-06-04 14:42:38 -0400] sm0ker: hi
[2012-06-04 14:42:54 -0400] anrope: I can't seem to find it in a role or recipe though
[2012-06-04 14:44:24 -0400] geekbri: flashmanbahadur: yeah setting :debug in the log_level should provide the same level of output as using -VV with a knife command it looks like
[2012-06-04 14:45:18 -0400] sm0ker: i try to start a ec2 instance with knife, but i get a error: http://pastebin.com/GTKfmzFu
[2012-06-04 14:45:24 -0400] sm0ker: what do i wrong?
[2012-06-04 14:45:49 -0400] sm0ker: do i have to install chef on the AMI before i can use it with chef/knife?
[2012-06-04 14:48:48 -0400] flashmanbahadur: sm0ker: the error is because it cannot find validaiton.pem on your local machine
[2012-06-04 14:49:54 -0400] sm0ker: the validation.pem is in ~/.chef
[2012-06-04 14:50:06 -0400] sm0ker: on my local machine
[2012-06-04 14:53:11 -0400] sm0ker: ls -ahl .chef/validation.pem | -rw-------  1 smann  staff   1.6K Jun  4 12:15 .chef/validation.pem
[2012-06-04 14:55:02 -0400] garrensmith: anyone used chef solo with linode?
[2012-06-04 14:55:50 -0400] garrensmith: I'm actually using knife-solo and trying to deploy my recipes and getting access denied
[2012-06-04 15:00:13 -0400] leifmadsen: nacer: found the issue -- looks like the chef deb pkgs on ubuntu 12.04 don't quite setup rabbitmq, so that was failing. Once I setup permissions and and such it seems to bootstrap now
[2012-06-04 15:00:43 -0400] werdnativ: Using the application_ruby cookbook, the unicorn runit service can't find "bundle" but /etc/profile.d loads rbenv, and it's available to login shells. How is it supposed to work?
[2012-06-04 15:05:02 -0400] werdnativ: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application_ruby/blob/master/templates/default/sv-unicorn-run.erb
[2012-06-04 15:05:03 -0400] werdnativ: This doesn't have a way to specify the path for "bundle exec", so the rbenv PATH must be set in the environment I assume.
[2012-06-04 15:05:42 -0400] FreeFries: how do I force chef-server to rebuild everything? something is quite wrong with it...cached cookbooks are fine, but anything new seems to be not present
[2012-06-04 15:05:58 -0400] FreeFries: I tried deleting all the cookbooks and re-adding them, which did not seem to help
[2012-06-04 15:06:59 -0400] FreeFries: if I move the cache/cookbooks directory then chef-client won't run (connection refused when loading one of the cached files, or premature end of headers)
[2012-06-04 15:11:03 -0400] FreeFries: I'm guessing it's rabbit or expander that's not quite working properly, but I'm not sure how to check if they're doing what they should be
[2012-06-04 15:11:08 -0400] FreeFries: they're both running
[2012-06-04 15:11:41 -0400] nacer: leifmadsen: okay nice
[2012-06-04 15:12:15 -0400] FreeFries: I'm getting undefined method cookbook_versions for nil:nilclass in my server log
[2012-06-04 15:12:16 -0400] leifmadsen: nacer: ya, kind of annoying unfortunately, but it seems to be ok now. Which just means I get to tear it all down and automate the configuration via chef-solo :)
[2012-06-04 15:12:27 -0400] nacer: leifmadsen: :)
[2012-06-04 15:12:46 -0400] nacer: leifmadsen: you can post the issue on deb package too :p
[2012-06-04 15:12:55 -0400] leifmadsen: true :)
[2012-06-04 15:13:10 -0400] leifmadsen: need to reproduce again and make sure I didn't just do something stupid when I set it up the first time
[2012-06-04 15:14:37 -0400] FreeFries: what else can I try to get this chef-server working? should I just scrap it, launch a new server, and copy over all the node/cookbook/client/databag data?
[2012-06-04 15:16:44 -0400] FreeFries: I started this server from a copy of a chef.couch database...maybe if I start from scratch instead of a copy...
[2012-06-04 15:19:57 -0400] btm: leifmadsen: can you file a bug for that at http://tickets.opscode.com please?
[2012-06-04 15:20:24 -0400] leifmadsen: btm: doing so now
[2012-06-04 15:24:31 -0400] FreeFries: actually...based on where the cookbook version nil error is occurring I'm pretty sure it's a couchdb error
[2012-06-04 15:25:10 -0400] FreeFries: (since it's happening in the cdb_load line of the chef environment file)
[2012-06-04 15:25:25 -0400] FreeFries: so...I'm guessing I need to tell couch to rebuild itself or something
[2012-06-04 15:28:40 -0400] leifmadsen: btm: fyi filed as CHEF-3170
[2012-06-04 15:33:20 -0400] sm0ker: thx
[2012-06-04 15:33:48 -0400] btm: leifmadsen: You rock.
[2012-06-04 15:36:34 -0400] BryanWB_: btm: hey dude, it find it hard to find the omnibus installers. is that intentional? won't publicize it until it is out of beta?
[2012-06-04 15:37:37 -0400] paulmooring: BryanWB_:  Are you just looking for opscode.com/chef/install
[2012-06-04 15:37:48 -0400] leifmadsen: btm: heh, I've done bug triage a bunch, so hopefully that experience helped with the bug filing :)
[2012-06-04 15:38:01 -0400] BryanWB_: paulmooring: i found it, but found it via goolgle search
[2012-06-04 15:38:34 -0400] BryanWB_: paulmooring: there are no links to it on community.opscode.com
[2012-06-04 15:38:38 -0400] BryanWB_: that i can c
[2012-06-04 15:39:12 -0400] paulmooring: BryanWB_:  I think that's because, like you mentioned, it's still beta
[2012-06-04 15:39:32 -0400] BryanWB_: paulmooring: y, just wondering
[2012-06-04 15:39:42 -0400] btm: BryanWB_: there are no links to that page because it's in beta, yes.
[2012-06-04 15:40:06 -0400] fish_: knife bootstrap is basically just preparing the client system (dependencies etc) and then add a node + client, right?
[2012-06-04 15:40:23 -0400] btm: BryanWB_: once we get over on the new build system which the 10.12.0.rc.1 packages were built on, we'll be blogging / linking.
[2012-06-04 15:40:35 -0400] fish_: so I could also do this 'manually' with knife node create + knife client create, right?
[2012-06-04 15:40:49 -0400] BryanWB_: kewl
[2012-06-04 15:41:21 -0400] btm: leifmadsen: anytime you want to peruse the bug database and confirm/repro tickets or close out old tickets, you're welcome to :)
[2012-06-04 15:41:27 -0400] paulmooring: fish_: knife bootstrap runs a shell script that runs previously defined code.  Usually a Chef install and first chef-client run
[2012-06-04 15:41:50 -0400] FreeFries: hmm...when I curl couchdb with the line from the couchdb log (/chef/_design/id_map/_view/name_to_id?key=[%22node%22,%22node1%22]) it fails with illegal character in range specification
[2012-06-04 15:42:04 -0400] paulmooring: but you can define your own bootstrap scripts to do more depending on your environment
[2012-06-04 15:42:06 -0400] fish_: paulmooring: yes, but I'm wondering what it's doing with chef node + client objects
[2012-06-04 15:42:12 -0400] FreeFries: but that's probably curl
[2012-06-04 15:42:27 -0400] paulmooring: fish_: it puts the validator in place and runs chef-client
[2012-06-04 15:42:36 -0400] leifmadsen: btm: haha I did that for 4-5 years with Asterisk :)
[2012-06-04 15:42:37 -0400] FreeFries: it actually gives back
[2012-06-04 15:42:39 -0400] fish_: paulmooring: and this step registers a new client?
[2012-06-04 15:42:39 -0400] FreeFries: {"total_rows":1172,"offset":201,"rows":[]}
[2012-06-04 15:42:44 -0400] fish_: paulmooring: -> the first chef run?
[2012-06-04 15:42:54 -0400] paulmooring: if the validator user is specified and the key is found chef-client will create/register the client and node itself
[2012-06-04 15:43:05 -0400] FreeFries: so I'm guessing that means it's not finding any data for that node
[2012-06-04 15:43:06 -0400] fish_: oh ok
[2012-06-04 15:43:18 -0400] fish_: paulmooring: thanks a lot!
[2012-06-04 15:43:25 -0400] paulmooring: you are welcome
[2012-06-04 15:48:51 -0400] FreeFries: hmm...I'm getting data back for some cookbooks...maybe just one of them is the problem
[2012-06-04 15:50:08 -0400] FreeFries: the all with version and deps call is returning a result set...maybe it's a chef+couch version problem, using couchdb 1.0.1 and chef server version 0.10.10
[2012-06-04 15:54:08 -0400] FreeFries: so...cdb_load is returning nil...is there an easy way for me to insert a debugger into the chef-server / run the cdb_load stuff and figure out why?
[2012-06-04 15:54:47 -0400] FreeFries: (like require a certain set of files from irb?)
[2012-06-04 15:56:09 -0400] werdnativ: Anyone familiar with the application_ruby cookbook, how do i get the unicorn runit service to see rbenv's path? I need it to see "bundle exec".
[2012-06-04 15:56:09 -0400] geekbri: Anybody here using the 37signals monit cookbook?  Does it not suck?
[2012-06-04 15:59:51 -0400] FreeFries: hmm
[2012-06-04 16:00:26 -0400] FreeFries: load seems to raise an exception when it can't find the environment named name
[2012-06-04 16:02:31 -0400] mattray: geekbri: hah, just had a conversation about that
[2012-06-04 16:02:31 -0400] mattray: geekbri: check this one out https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/monit
[2012-06-04 16:02:31 -0400] mattray: coderanger: looking forward to community site namespacing soon ;)
[2012-06-04 16:02:34 -0400] geekbri: mattray: ill give this one a look, thanks
[2012-06-04 16:05:14 -0400] miah: hi
[2012-06-04 16:07:37 -0400] paulmooring: hi miah
[2012-06-04 16:11:14 -0400] FreeFries_: blah, can't even reinstall because gem install chef-server returns Unable to resolve dependencies: chef-expander requires yajl-ruby (~> 0.7.7) (and chef-server requires 1.1)
[2012-06-04 16:12:05 -0400] FreeFries_: just not going my way today, heh
[2012-06-04 16:12:12 -0400] miah: doh
[2012-06-04 16:20:39 -0400] FreeFries_: on a different note...does anyone know of a users cookbook that will fix uids? I have a bunch of servers and all users have the same name but different uids on each
[2012-06-04 16:20:40 -0400] FreeFries_: I want to make every user have the same uid on every server
[2012-06-04 16:29:33 -0400] miah: i stopped caring about uid's when i stopped using nfs =)
[2012-06-04 16:32:44 -0400] ulfmagnetics: does anybody know offhand whether rpm_package supports a URL source?
[2012-06-04 16:33:29 -0400] z: FreeFries: Should be an easy patch, though most larger shops move to LDAP for centralized user management, or similar
[2012-06-04 16:34:41 -0400] FreeFries: silly netsplit
[2012-06-04 16:34:53 -0400] FreeFries: z: should be an easy patch to which cookbook? the users one?
[2012-06-04 16:35:28 -0400] FreeFries: I'll take a look at it...I might have to move everyone's UID to something insane then back to what they should have
[2012-06-04 16:35:50 -0400] FreeFries: thanks
[2012-06-04 16:36:23 -0400] FreeFries: so...which service is failing me? I'm getting Connection refused connecting to <chef_server> for /cookbooks/sshd/1.0.0/files/c54b2842d874e729717e826a3a5fc89b
[2012-06-04 16:36:26 -0400] FreeFries: in my chef-client log
[2012-06-04 16:36:40 -0400] FreeFries: it can connect to the chef server to get the list of cookbooks to run
[2012-06-04 16:37:13 -0400] FreeFries: and I see the request in the server log
[2012-06-04 16:37:43 -0400] FreeFries: (authenticating client <client> started request handling, action showfile ...)
[2012-06-04 16:40:41 -0400] FreeFries: I guess the question is really "where does chef server its files from?"
[2012-06-04 16:40:46 -0400] FreeFries: serve*
[2012-06-04 16:41:11 -0400] FreeFries: unless it's failing authentication on only the cookbook file, but I don't see how that'd happen
[2012-06-04 16:47:15 -0400] btm: FreeFries: that should be from the API, port 4000 by default.
[2012-06-04 16:48:13 -0400] btm: FreeFries: which gets some data from disk (checksum_path) and the rest from couchdb (port 5984 by default)
[2012-06-04 16:49:36 -0400] excalq: I wanted to ask about best practices for having a workstation knife or ssh command which runs a deploy recipe where the local user can specify what branch will be deployed (this is for a staging setup using OpsCode/application_ruby (which extends the normal deploy resource))
[2012-06-04 16:49:42 -0400] FreeFries: I'm stepping through the show_file action from an irb console atm...should know soon if it's couchdb or the filesystem that's causing the problem
[2012-06-04 16:49:46 -0400] FreeFries: thanks
[2012-06-04 16:51:06 -0400] btm: excalq: put the branch name in a data bag. edit the data bag before the chef-client run.
[2012-06-04 16:51:44 -0400] excalq: yeah, that's what I was thinking, just wanted to see what experts had to say ;)
[2012-06-04 16:52:30 -0400] FreeFries: well I think I found my problem
[2012-06-04 16:52:55 -0400] FreeFries: Chef::Checksum.new(checksum).storage.file_location returns a path in /var/chef/checksums/...
[2012-06-04 16:52:58 -0400] FreeFries: but /var/chef doesn't exist
[2012-06-04 16:53:50 -0400] FreeFries: I don't see anything complaining that the path doesn't exist
[2012-06-04 16:55:03 -0400] FreeFries: shouldn't uploading a cookbook complain about the required paths not being there?
[2012-06-04 16:55:14 -0400] FreeFries: or did it and I'm not looking at the right logs?
[2012-06-04 16:59:22 -0400] FreeFries: well, creating the directory didn't fix it
[2012-06-04 17:00:25 -0400] FreeFries: (creating the directory and reuploading the cookbook, that is)
[2012-06-04 17:01:33 -0400] FreeFries: so I guess I need to hunt down the cookbook upload
[2012-06-04 17:09:46 -0400] btm: FreeFries: you watching the chef-server logs? if it can't save the cookbook it should throw some kind of error which would bubble up to knife
[2012-06-04 17:10:01 -0400] btm: FreeFries: you can use 'knife cookbook show' to look at different versions of a cookbook and even the 'parts'
[2012-06-04 17:10:06 -0400] btm: FreeFries: (via the api)
[2012-06-04 17:15:22 -0400] nathenharvey: Episode 16 of the Food Fight Show is now available.  Chef Server with Kevin Smith & Seth Falcon
[2012-06-04 17:18:44 -0400] shuvo: nathenharvey. the URL seems to have a trialing space that chrome 404 s on
[2012-06-04 17:19:00 -0400] shuvo: 'http://traffic.libsyn.com/foodfight/FoodFightShow-16-ChefServer.mp3%20'
[2012-06-04 17:22:35 -0400] nathenharvey: shuvo: thanks, should be fixed now
[2012-06-04 17:22:41 -0400] thedeeno: How should I deal with generating and distributing private keys on nodes? Should I generate the keys with a recipe and email the public key to myself for distribution?
[2012-06-04 17:22:49 -0400] thedeeno: Any tools/cookbooks to help with this?
[2012-06-04 17:23:22 -0400] shuvo: thanks, nathenharvey. good interviews BTW. any idea if chefconf training videos are up?
[2012-06-04 17:23:57 -0400] nathenharvey: shuvo: I haven't seen themdo you know if those sessions were recorded?  I didn't attend them
[2012-06-04 17:25:04 -0400] shuvo: nathenharvey, np. The "regular" talks were recorded but I am interested in the infochimps Ironfan presentation. I really would have enjoyed it
[2012-06-04 17:25:51 -0400] jackl0phty: nathenharvey: listening to it right now dude. awesome!
[2012-06-04 17:26:48 -0400] nathenharvey: shuvo:  https://github.com/foodfight/showz/blob/master/chefconf_slides.md
[2012-06-04 17:27:07 -0400] nathenharvey: shuvo:  Do you mean "Ironfan: Build a Hadoop Cluster in 20 minutes"?
[2012-06-04 17:27:37 -0400] nathenharvey: shuvo:  if so, slides - http://www.slideshare.net/temujin9/chefconf-2012, video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxRXqW-rc-Y
[2012-06-04 17:29:32 -0400] shuvo: nathenharvey, thanks a bunch for the links nathen! uhmm, I think they also had a "hands on" session? If I am mistaken, then these slides should be sufficient for me. thanks :-) I am also interested in hooking up Starfish with Ironfan, so if you, or anyone you know is on the same path, hook me up! subhobroto gmail
[2012-06-04 17:29:43 -0400] lflux: btw, anyone here going to Velocity?
[2012-06-04 17:30:13 -0400] lflux: I saw some cheffery among the tutorial sessions, but I won't be partaking in those
[2012-06-04 17:30:25 -0400] mattray: lflux: I'm headed there
[2012-06-04 17:30:52 -0400] lflux: mattray: cool, hope we run into each other.
[2012-06-04 18:01:45 -0400] freecandy: rndm told me you guys like cheez whiz.
[2012-06-04 18:07:34 -0400] rndm: i am assuming that's some kind of bot
[2012-06-04 18:07:56 -0400] FreeFries: I'm not getting any errors...watching the chef-server log on upload and access
[2012-06-04 18:08:05 -0400] rndm: so what's the right way to include an LWRP from another recipe?
[2012-06-04 18:08:28 -0400] FreeFries: knife cookbook show sshd isn't showing anything wrong...how do I pull out one of the template files with knife?
[2012-06-04 18:08:28 -0400] rndm: i am getting "NameError: Cannot find a resource for github_deploy on ubuntu version 10.04"
[2012-06-04 18:08:36 -0400] mattray: rndm: add the cookbook providing the LWRP as a dependency of the cookbook
[2012-06-04 18:08:44 -0400] mattray: then you can reference it
[2012-06-04 18:08:46 -0400] rndm: but i define that in a cookbook named github
[2012-06-04 18:08:55 -0400] rndm: and have both added it to the metadata
[2012-06-04 18:09:09 -0400] rndm: and included it in the recipe with include_recipe
[2012-06-04 18:09:28 -0400] mattray: rndm: you shouldn't need a recipe to include, the LWRP isn't part of a recipe
[2012-06-04 18:09:44 -0400] freecandy: Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
[2012-06-04 18:10:18 -0400] yfeldblum: rndm, you don't need `include_recipe` for LWRPs to work; you only need `depends` in the metadata
[2012-06-04 18:10:20 -0400] FreeFries: though the knife cookbook upload command is sending the request to the sandboxes controller
[2012-06-04 18:10:22 -0400] FreeFries: maybe that's the problem
[2012-06-04 18:10:47 -0400] yfeldblum: FreeFries, no, the sandboxes controller is what handles uploading cookbook files, and is perfectly expected
[2012-06-04 18:11:12 -0400] FreeFries: hmm
[2012-06-04 18:11:15 -0400] rndm: mattray, yfeldblum: thanks. i've removed the include -- but the other recipe is referenced in the metadata
[2012-06-04 18:11:30 -0400] FreeFries: maybe sandboxes isn't saving it in the same place send_file is looking
[2012-06-04 18:11:32 -0400] mattray: rndm: it shouldn't be a recipe in the metadata, it should be a cookbook
[2012-06-04 18:11:35 -0400] rndm: sorry, cookbook. cookbook is referenced int he metadata
[2012-06-04 18:12:04 -0400] yfeldblum: rndm, what's the cookbook name and what's the LW resource filename?
[2012-06-04 18:12:13 -0400] ILessThanThreeU: what's this?
[2012-06-04 18:12:41 -0400] ILessThanThreeU: to lazy to read the topic or follow any links. someone just wrote this channel in another channel. What is this ?
[2012-06-04 18:13:15 -0400] mattray: ILessThanThreeU: open source configuration management tool Chef
[2012-06-04 18:13:26 -0400] ILessThanThreeU: for linux?
[2012-06-04 18:13:27 -0400] rndm: cookbook's name is github. the resource is "github/resources/github_deploy.rb", the provider is "github/providers/github_deploy.rb"
[2012-06-04 18:13:45 -0400] mattray: ILessThanThreeU: Linux, Unixes, BSDs, Windows, etc.
[2012-06-04 18:14:08 -0400] ILessThanThreeU: don't really get it. But sure it's something good.
[2012-06-04 18:14:36 -0400] yfeldblum: rndm, rename the LW resource filename to `deploy.rb` from `github_deploy.rb`
[2012-06-04 18:14:37 -0400] ILessThanThreeU: is it as essential as version control management?
[2012-06-04 18:14:50 -0400] gabebug: I'm getting a "You must have ruby-shadow installed for password support" error on ubuntu 12.04, but i have the libshadow-ruby1.8 package installed. anyone know what's up with that?
[2012-06-04 18:14:52 -0400] rndm: yfeldblum: ah, thanks
[2012-06-04 18:15:15 -0400] mattray: ILessThanThreeU: it's essential for deploying servers and applications
[2012-06-04 18:15:39 -0400] mattray: ILessThanThreeU: version control would store your infrastructure config
[2012-06-04 18:15:52 -0400] yfeldblum: ILessThanThreeU, no, version control is absolutely essential for every and all software project; chef is simply highly useful for specific types of software projects such as infrastructure management, and is absolutely not a replacement for proper version control
[2012-06-04 18:16:23 -0400] ILessThanThreeU: :)
[2012-06-04 18:17:29 -0400] yfeldblum: ILessThanThreeU, if you are tasked with writing software to manage and automate infrastructure, you probably want to use both version control and an infrastructure automation tool or framework
[2012-06-04 18:17:44 -0400] yfeldblum: ILessThanThreeU, to be slightly clearer: git and chef
[2012-06-04 18:18:09 -0400] rndm: ILessThanThreeU: and often builds around version control. sorry for mangling my /join #chef from channel math =)
[2012-06-04 18:18:30 -0400] FreeFries: ah
[2012-06-04 18:18:47 -0400] FreeFries: this makes sense now...sandboxes doesn't create files if it thinks the checksum already exsists
[2012-06-04 18:19:06 -0400] FreeFries: but apparently deleting my cookbook with knife cookbook delete isn't removing the checksum for the cookbook's files
[2012-06-04 18:19:31 -0400] FreeFries: so chef-server thinks the files already exist, and doesn't re-upload them when I tell it to upload the cookbook
[2012-06-04 18:19:43 -0400] FreeFries: and the files don't actually exist on the filesystem
[2012-06-04 18:20:16 -0400] FreeFries: so now I just need to clear the checksums of already existing files, and re-upload the cookbooks
[2012-06-04 18:20:31 -0400] FreeFries: which I'm guessing is best done through couch
[2012-06-04 18:20:37 -0400] FreeFries: (clearing the checksums)
[2012-06-04 18:21:27 -0400] gabebug: actually, it seems chef is running from /opt/opscode/embedded - i'm doing this in a test VM supplied by vagrant - is chef's embedded ruby a standard thing in 0.10.10 ?
[2012-06-04 18:23:05 -0400] FreeFries: anyone know offhand how to delete a bunch of records from couchdb? (all records that it returns when I curl /chef/_design/checksums/_view/all)
[2012-06-04 18:25:25 -0400] yfeldblum: FreeFries, you can probably do it via the couchdb webui
[2012-06-04 18:26:02 -0400] FreeFries: I'm pretty sure that I got into this mess because I copied the couchdb file from another machine
[2012-06-04 18:26:05 -0400] FreeFries: and tried to run a chef server
[2012-06-04 18:26:15 -0400] FreeFries: but didn't copy all of the other files
[2012-06-04 18:26:16 -0400] yfeldblum: http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Getting_started_with_Futon
[2012-06-04 18:26:46 -0400] FreeFries: I'll give the webui a shot, running it from the console on one of hte ids gave me a document update conflict
[2012-06-04 18:27:33 -0400] leifmadsen: hey all, I want to perform a knife bootstrap on a server, and give it a run_list that includes chef-server. The chef-server cookbook info seems to indicate there are some values I need to set (such as chef-server url). I'm curious how best I should set the values it needs, and then bootstrap the server so that it can run the recipes in the run_list?
[2012-06-04 18:30:35 -0400] FreeFries: leifmadsen: the bootstrapping stuff is best done from a specific machine that already has that stuff setup
[2012-06-04 18:31:12 -0400] leifmadsen: FreeFries: right, so I'm on my workstation which is setup with knife, and I'm wanting to build a new chef-server (lets assume I'm doing disaster recovery or something)
[2012-06-04 18:31:18 -0400] leifmadsen: so I have my git repo with all the configurations
[2012-06-04 18:31:24 -0400] leifmadsen: now what?
[2012-06-04 18:31:32 -0400] FreeFries: bootstrapping the chef installation copies(and builds) certain files from the local machine to the remote one
[2012-06-04 18:31:44 -0400] FreeFries: ah
[2012-06-04 18:31:47 -0400] leifmadsen: so how do I specify the json values
[2012-06-04 18:31:49 -0400] FreeFries: you need a chef server
[2012-06-04 18:31:54 -0400] leifmadsen: that's what I'm building
[2012-06-04 18:32:00 -0400] leifmadsen: I'm trying to automate the chef-server install
[2012-06-04 18:32:06 -0400] yfeldblum: leifmadsen, have one set of backup configs that get set if `KNIFE_ENV=backup` is exported, and the default set of configs otherwise
[2012-06-04 18:32:53 -0400] yfeldblum: leifmadsen, `if ENV["KNIFE_ENV"] == "backup" ; server_url "abc" ; else ; server_url "xyz" ; end`
[2012-06-04 18:33:01 -0400] leifmadsen: the hostname is dynamic though (stupid EC2 stuff) so I need to specify the hostname to be used at bootstrap time, otherwise I can only do chef-solo which I'd prefer not to
[2012-06-04 18:33:14 -0400] maek: https://gist.github.com/2870073 Anyone have any ideas about this? we lost power and everything is "up" rabbit shows queues, couch is serving up the jsons, etc. just when I chef-client thats what I see on both sides.
[2012-06-04 18:33:20 -0400] yfeldblum: leifmadsen, set a DNS entry
[2012-06-04 18:33:21 -0400] FreeFries: assign an IP to it then
[2012-06-04 18:33:30 -0400] leifmadsen: how
[2012-06-04 18:33:32 -0400] FreeFries: you can assign IPs on ec2
[2012-06-04 18:33:32 -0400] yfeldblum: leifmadsen, or use the IP address
[2012-06-04 18:33:38 -0400] FreeFries: and then it won't change
[2012-06-04 18:33:51 -0400] leifmadsen: I can connect fine, I'm talking about how to pass the data to the recipe
[2012-06-04 18:33:52 -0400] FreeFries: ec2 nodes can theoretically change IPs on you, but I've never seen it happen
[2012-06-04 18:34:23 -0400] FreeFries: so amazon recommends (or used to) you use the DNS for your node, unless you assign it a specific IP
[2012-06-04 18:34:43 -0400] leifmadsen: for example, minimum data in the json file, per the recipe docs, is:    "chef-server": { "url": "http://foot.barf.com:4000" }
[2012-06-04 18:34:51 -0400] FreeFries: right
[2012-06-04 18:34:58 -0400] FreeFries: server url is the IP of your backup chef server
[2012-06-04 18:35:09 -0400] FreeFries: you can't launch a chef server with bootstrap without a backup server already running
[2012-06-04 18:35:13 -0400] leifmadsen: how do I pass that data in bootstrap time
[2012-06-04 18:35:19 -0400] leifmadsen: ok, so assume I have that
[2012-06-04 18:35:33 -0400] leifmadsen: knife node edit backup-node ?
[2012-06-04 18:36:09 -0400] FreeFries: export an environment variable and check what it is as yfeldblum said
[2012-06-04 18:36:54 -0400] FreeFries: if it's "use backup" then have it use the backup server for chef-server for that install
[2012-06-04 18:38:42 -0400] FreeFries: hmm
[2012-06-04 18:38:53 -0400] FreeFries: futon doesn't seem to be listening on the public address
[2012-06-04 18:38:55 -0400] FreeFries: only on localhost
[2012-06-04 18:38:59 -0400] yfeldblum: FreeFries, correct
[2012-06-04 18:39:05 -0400] yfeldblum: FreeFries, as intended
[2012-06-04 18:39:22 -0400] FreeFries: well that won't work, I don't have x-11 forwarding so no way to open a web browser
[2012-06-04 18:39:33 -0400] FreeFries: will have to look up couchdb config
[2012-06-04 18:39:47 -0400] yfeldblum: FreeFries, so if you're SSHing in, you can set up an SSH port-forward on your machine
[2012-06-04 18:40:39 -0400] yfeldblum: FreeFries, http://magazine.redhat.com/2007/11/06/ssh-port-forwarding/
[2012-06-04 18:40:55 -0400] other_guy: Hi, I'm trying to get my Chef Server to tell my HAProxy (boostrapped chef-client) to update it's configuration (re-run the app_lb.rb recipe) after each time I add an app server to my cluster.  I can't seem to figure out how to trigger that.
[2012-06-04 18:41:25 -0400] other_guy: So that HAProxy can balance using the newly added server
[2012-06-04 18:43:19 -0400] other_guy: I'm guessing it's something along the lines of, in my app server creation recipe, search through my chef.nodes for the load-balancer, and then tell it to re-run it's run_list ?
[2012-06-04 18:43:32 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, don't do that ...
[2012-06-04 18:43:50 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, the simple way is to re-run chef-client manually on the haproxy node
[2012-06-04 18:44:08 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, or you can keep chef-client running as a daemon, or cron it, so that it periodically picks up changes to its config
[2012-06-04 18:44:38 -0400] other_guy: Well there wouldn't be any changes to its config, so I don't know how it would know to rerun.
[2012-06-04 18:45:10 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, a change in the search results it would use to generate a new haproxy config file = a change in its config
[2012-06-04 18:45:42 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, or, if you want orchestration, use real orchestration with a central message bus; one recipe running on an app server publishes a message, and an agent on another server subscribes and, when receiving the message, reruns chef-client
[2012-06-04 18:47:48 -0400] other_guy: The client asks the server for the haproxy recipe, the server generates a new config haproxy on chef server, the chef client sees it's different because the underlying data the config was built on in the server has changed, and the client knows that even though it's already run this recipe before, the config is different so it should use it?
[2012-06-04 18:49:45 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, yes, chef will regenerate the template file (if your recipe uses a `template` resource) based on whatever the search results were from the present run of the recipe, and compare it to the file that currently exists, and if they are different, overwrite the old one with the new one, and if you've set up a notification, trigger haproxy to reload the config file
[2012-06-04 18:50:13 -0400] other_guy: ah ha.  great.
[2012-06-04 18:50:24 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, i.e., when you manually re-run chef-client or when you cron chef-client and cron kicks it off
[2012-06-04 18:50:52 -0400] other_guy: There's no way to trigger this from the web-ui I take it
[2012-06-04 18:51:39 -0400] other_guy: to do a push from chef-server rather than a pull from chef-client
[2012-06-04 18:52:49 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, no there isn't, because that's not the way chef works
[2012-06-04 18:53:46 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, think of chef more as a distributed, sometimes-disconnected, eventually-consistent system
[2012-06-04 18:53:54 -0400] other_guy: got it
[2012-06-04 18:54:48 -0400] other_guy: BTW, it's super handy that I can use ruby in my recipes
[2012-06-04 18:55:25 -0400] FreeFries: blah, setting up ssh forward is always such a pain
[2012-06-04 18:55:36 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, chef is indeed missing some things that would be very useful in running a fully-automated infrastructure, such as a message bus and triggering runs and so on, so if you want to go that route you would have to set them up yourself
[2012-06-04 18:55:42 -0400] FreeFries: I tried changing the bind address to the public one but then I couldn't access couchdb from anywhere
[2012-06-04 18:56:42 -0400] other_guy: yfeldblum, yeah but then I have to chef my message bus :-p
[2012-06-04 18:57:10 -0400] other_guy: sort of the two gods problem :-)
[2012-06-04 18:57:17 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, wrong ... then you *get* to chef your message bus
[2012-06-04 18:57:25 -0400] other_guy: lol :-)
[2012-06-04 18:57:37 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, and now you have a wonderful pantheon
[2012-06-04 18:58:13 -0400] other_guy: okay, two other quick questions  more Ruby realted
[2012-06-04 18:58:37 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, but you don't have a two-gods problem, because your application recipes are allowed to have a unidirectional knowledge of the fact that you've got a message bus
[2012-06-04 18:58:57 -0400] other_guy: I need to modify knife-rackspace to consume a databag
[2012-06-04 18:59:24 -0400] other_guy: this databag just has a list of possible server names (to maintain naming conventions during automation)
[2012-06-04 18:59:25 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, some parts of your chef-built infrastructure know about other, preceding parts of your chef-built infrastructure, and that's perfectly proper
[2012-06-04 19:00:24 -0400] FreeFries: is there a mass-delete command in futon or couch? suppose I should ask in #couchdb
[2012-06-04 19:00:47 -0400] other_guy: I'm just not clear on how I ask for the contents of that databag from inside the ruby of the knife extension
[2012-06-04 19:00:49 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, write your own knife plugin that does `item = Chef::DataBagItem.load(data_bag_name, data_bag_item_name)` and then creates a new instance of `Chef::Knife::RackspaceServerCreate` internally and delegates to it
[2012-06-04 19:01:20 -0400] other_guy: Chef::DataBagItem.load
[2012-06-04 19:01:24 -0400] other_guy: that's what I needed :-)
[2012-06-04 19:01:25 -0400] other_guy: thanks
[2012-06-04 19:02:05 -0400] other_guy: I think that answers my next question, or at least tells me where to look
[2012-06-04 19:03:03 -0400] other_guy: I want to auto configure my app nodes to only accept connections from known trusted load balancers
[2012-06-04 19:03:12 -0400] other_guy: that should be relatively simple
[2012-06-04 19:06:22 -0400] matschaffer: yfeldblum: are there good examples about message-bus orchestration out there? or blog posts or something?
[2012-06-04 19:07:19 -0400] other_guy: matshaffer, it shouldn't be that hard to build.
[2012-06-04 19:07:46 -0400] other_guy: There would just be a listener process on all your nodes that subscribed to some RabbitMQ or something
[2012-06-04 19:08:03 -0400] other_guy: and all it would do when it saw a message is fire off chef-client
[2012-06-04 19:08:28 -0400] other_guy: Then either you recipe or your knife extension would publish the notification to that same queue
[2012-06-04 19:12:03 -0400] yfeldblum: matschaffer, i haven't collected any, but other_guy's expanded description is just the kind of thing i was trying to get at
[2012-06-04 19:15:27 -0400] matschaffer: yfeldblum: other_guy: my curiosity is if someone's already written that listener process for me :)
[2012-06-04 19:15:36 -0400] other_guy: ah :-)
[2012-06-04 19:16:31 -0400] other_guy: Well you could set it up in node.js as a pretty lightweight demon, about 10MB memory footprint and basically no CPU
[2012-06-04 19:17:08 -0400] other_guy: About the only thing easier might be to do it in perl
[2012-06-04 19:17:29 -0400] other_guy: but I don't know how good the perl amqp clients are
[2012-06-04 19:18:57 -0400] yfeldblum: you could even - stretch though this may be - write a lightweight daemon in ruby ...
[2012-06-04 19:21:35 -0400] other_guy: We only use JRuby here, so lightweight isn't an option ;-)
[2012-06-04 19:22:07 -0400] FreeFries: yay, I managed to finally fix my chef server problems!
[2012-06-04 19:22:16 -0400] FreeFries: I had to drop the entire checksum view in couchdb
[2012-06-04 19:22:54 -0400] FreeFries: basically it looks like chef keeps track of which cookbook files it's already uploaded, and refuses to upload the same file twice
[2012-06-04 19:23:03 -0400] FreeFries: but it keeps track in couchdb
[2012-06-04 19:23:18 -0400] FreeFries: which means when I cloned couchdb but not the entire server
[2012-06-04 19:23:21 -0400] yfeldblum: other_guy, matschaffer, for a more complete solution, you can even use zookeeper or lusis' noah rather than just a message bus
[2012-06-04 19:23:27 -0400] FreeFries: it thought that I had uploaded all the files already
[2012-06-04 19:23:34 -0400] FreeFries: even though they didn't actually exist on the chef server
[2012-06-04 19:25:37 -0400] matschaffer: yfeldblum: interesting, I didn't realize zookeeper did that too
[2012-06-04 19:25:46 -0400] matschaffer: I had assumed it was an alternative CM
[2012-06-04 19:25:48 -0400] matschaffer: guess it's time to try i tout
[2012-06-04 19:27:03 -0400] yfeldblum: matschaffer, right, zookeeper is neither a message bus nor a CM system
[2012-06-04 19:28:04 -0400] matschaffer: haha yfeldblum. I feel like you just told me there is no spoon
[2012-06-04 19:28:31 -0400] lusis: there is no spoon
[2012-06-04 19:28:33 -0400] lusis: only zuul
[2012-06-04 19:28:33 -0400] matschaffer: guess it's time to hit the books :)
[2012-06-04 19:28:37 -0400] doki_pen: Unable to create Chef::RunList::RunListItem from String:"recipe[recipe[role[[[#<IO:(closed)>], [], []]]]]": must be recipe[] or role[]
[2012-06-04 19:28:41 -0400] doki_pen: ever seen that?
[2012-06-04 19:29:08 -0400] yfeldblum: matschaffer, heh, zookeeper is that part of a larger distributed system whose purpose is to be the distributed-coordination part, such as to aid in leader elections and so on
[2012-06-04 19:29:12 -0400] miah: doki_pen: looks like your run_list is a bit fubar
[2012-06-04 19:29:18 -0400] lusis: doki_pen: bad run list

[2012-06-04 19:29:35 -0400] yfeldblum: doki_pen, dunno if anyone else has brought this up, but your run list looks iffy
[2012-06-04 19:29:36 -0400] doki_pen: it throws the error from search()
[2012-06-04 19:29:50 -0400] doki_pen: yes, but that's not the run list
[2012-06-04 19:29:50 -0400] miah: then a nodes run_list is fubar
[2012-06-04 19:29:53 -0400] lusis: right but something in your search has a bad run list
[2012-06-04 19:29:57 -0400] doki_pen: ah, some other node, eh?
[2012-06-04 19:30:00 -0400] lusis: aye
[2012-06-04 19:30:04 -0400] doki_pen: but other nodes are running the same recipe fine
[2012-06-04 19:30:10 -0400] lusis: knife node show till you find the offender
[2012-06-04 19:30:11 -0400] doki_pen: hmm..
[2012-06-04 19:30:27 -0400] lusis: you can loop that too of course
[2012-06-04 19:30:27 -0400] miah: knife status =)
[2012-06-04 19:30:31 -0400] lusis: whatever
[2012-06-04 19:30:32 -0400] lusis: =P
[2012-06-04 19:30:34 -0400] lusis: I KID
[2012-06-04 19:30:41 -0400] miah: you'll probably find it faster as if it has a fubar runlist its not completing runs
[2012-06-04 19:30:50 -0400] lusis: you could probably have better luck running the search via shef -z
[2012-06-04 19:31:06 -0400] miah: ^- that would be good too
[2012-06-04 19:31:30 -0400] lusis: people always forget about Dr

[2012-06-04 19:36:08 -0400] mattray: afallows: and it was mentioned on the chef-dev ML
[2012-06-04 19:36:36 -0400] doki_pen: i wonder how it's run list got foobar
[2012-06-04 19:37:44 -0400] doki_pen: pibcak?
[2012-06-04 19:38:40 -0400] miah: usually the case
[2012-06-04 19:40:21 -0400] mikeg: anyone here with minitest-chef-handler experience that can tell me the difference between "test cases" and "spec cases" and why I might choose one or the other (or why I should choose both).  It looks like minitest-chef-handler incorporate both minitest and rspec.  I know about chefspec but we are looking to use that to test cookbooks as we develop them.  Seems the rspec tests with minitest-chef-handler do the same type of thing but tests again
[2012-06-04 19:40:21 -0400] mikeg: st actual results of a chef run, instead of testing cookbook code.  Am I seeing all this correctly?  I'm new to testing and need to wrap my head around the concepts before I jump into testing implementation
[2012-06-04 19:45:11 -0400] macros: hoover_damm: I'm not finding any reports of 1.8.7p249 json memory allocation bug
[2012-06-04 19:45:26 -0400] macros: hoover_damm: I'm filing a chef-client bug on it, just trying to find more info to include
[2012-06-04 19:47:50 -0400] hoover_damm: macros, do remember your json gem was outside of what chef normally allows.
[2012-06-04 19:48:11 -0400] hoover_damm: macros, this is why Chef has a pessimistic versioning on the json gem
[2012-06-04 19:48:28 -0400] hoover_damm: if you were running the json gem that is within the gemspec versioning requirements
[2012-06-04 19:48:32 -0400] hoover_damm: it's possible your issue would not have happened
[2012-06-04 19:54:32 -0400] macros: It was happening on a node running json 1.5
[2012-06-04 19:54:38 -0400] macros: As well
[2012-06-04 19:55:36 -0400] macros: Which was not upgraded when 'gem install ohai chef' was run
[2012-06-04 19:57:09 -0400] mjreed1: Blanking -  what's the name of the predefined var that is shared by recipes within a chef-client run but not persisted like node?
[2012-06-04 19:57:38 -0400] miah: attributes
[2012-06-04 19:57:41 -0400] miah: attributes?
[2012-06-04 19:57:42 -0400] bawt: attributes is http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Attributes
[2012-06-04 19:57:44 -0400] hoover_damm: macros, have any 1.8.7p249's still sploding?
[2012-06-04 19:57:51 -0400] excalq: Hmm.. It'd be nice if one could script knife commands better during "create unless exists" scenarios, like creating or uploading databags
[2012-06-04 19:58:07 -0400] mjreed1: no.  attributes are on node
[2012-06-04 19:58:11 -0400] macros: hoover_damm: Moved all staging and prod to omnibus this weekend
[2012-06-04 19:58:13 -0400] hoover_damm: macros, I'm not disagreeing with the validity of the bug.  Just pointing out that the json version you showed me originally was too new.
[2012-06-04 19:58:20 -0400] mjreed1: this is a variable, like 'node' itself, but only exists within the lifetime of the chef-client run
[2012-06-04 19:58:25 -0400] hoover_damm: and that was likely at least with that instance why that was the case
[2012-06-04 19:58:26 -0400] mjreed1: instead of persisting to the chef server
[2012-06-04 19:58:31 -0400] pwf: mjreed1: data bags?
[2012-06-04 19:58:41 -0400] mjreed1: no, data bags don't show up as a ruby variable.
[2012-06-04 19:58:43 -0400] macros: Different hosts showing the problem
[2012-06-04 19:58:51 -0400] hoover_damm: macros, basically the json gem will allocate 150 blocks for a json object
[2012-06-04 19:59:12 -0400] macros: At a default nesting depth of 1000 that is a lot of memory
[2012-06-04 19:59:18 -0400] hoover_damm: macros, and if you have a huge node...
[2012-06-04 19:59:26 -0400] hoover_damm: that's a crapton of blocks to allocate
[2012-06-04 19:59:30 -0400] macros: Yup, up to 9 search queries
[2012-06-04 19:59:39 -0400] hoover_damm: 9 ton crapton then
[2012-06-04 19:59:42 -0400] macros: 400KB chef-run-data
[2012-06-04 19:59:43 -0400] hoover_damm: there you go
[2012-06-04 19:59:54 -0400] hoover_damm: right, now try and looad that json chef-run data in irb
[2012-06-04 19:59:57 -0400] hoover_damm: with just json
[2012-06-04 20:00:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and see how big that bad boy is
[2012-06-04 20:00:06 -0400] macros: 1.9.1 cut run memory in half, stopped the exploding, and sped up runs by about 25%

[2012-06-04 20:00:45 -0400] hoover_damm: hippiehacker, yum?
[2012-06-04 20:01:04 -0400] hippiehacker: hoover_damm: thanks
[2012-06-04 20:01:13 -0400] hoover_damm: macros, yeah memory allocation is better and 1.9.1 overall but it has it's own json in stdlib
[2012-06-04 20:01:16 -0400] hoover_damm: which bothers me
[2012-06-04 20:01:48 -0400] mjreed1: run_status, maybe.
[2012-06-04 20:02:28 -0400] mjreed1: er, run_context, I mean.

[2012-06-04 20:05:06 -0400] flashmanbahadur: hmm
[2012-06-04 20:05:20 -0400] hoover_damm: afallows, clone the git repo and build it
[2012-06-04 20:05:33 -0400] hoover_damm: afallows, if your seeking the latest fog you'll find the master in knife-ec2 likely to have what you want
[2012-06-04 20:05:39 -0400] hoover_damm: afallows, just need to build the gem and then install it locally
[2012-06-04 20:05:51 -0400] flashmanbahadur: mjreed1: when I run it manually I can see my ec2 attributes that I get by adding the ohai-ec2 plugin, when chef-client runs it fails to laod the plugins it seems
[2012-06-04 20:07:00 -0400] mjreed1: @flashmanbahadur: yup, chef-client won't see the plugins by default.  see http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Loading+Custom+Ohai+Plugins
[2012-06-04 20:07:12 -0400] flashmanbahadur: thanks, ill check it out

[2012-06-04 20:14:45 -0400] thedeeno: I have a private git repo I want to use in this deployment resource - question, how do you guys deal with key-pair generation? Right now my plan is to generate a key-pair via my recipe and then email it to myself with a report handler. I can then manually add it to my git host as an athorized key.
[2012-06-04 20:15:25 -0400] bdha: Anyone know if any issues with managing resources on NFS volumes?
[2012-06-04 20:15:27 -0400] thedeeno: Anyone have a better idea?
[2012-06-04 20:19:06 -0400] pwf: thedeeno: just guessing here, but i think encrypted data bags are used for key distribution?
[2012-06-04 20:19:15 -0400] pwf: unless you want a separate key for each machine
[2012-06-04 20:20:24 -0400] thedeeno: I was actually assuming one key per machine, but now that you mention it, I guess it's not really required
[2012-06-04 20:21:20 -0400] thedeeno: hmm, so throw the key-pair in a databag and share that with all the nodes that need to pull down the private git-repo
[2012-06-04 20:21:32 -0400] thedeeno: that might work _far_ better than what I was imagining
[2012-06-04 20:27:23 -0400] pwf: that's the route i was planning on going, so let me know if you find something better thedeeno
[2012-06-04 20:27:37 -0400] pwf: i'm doing it for signed ssl keys though
[2012-06-04 20:27:55 -0400] pwf: right now i'm generating self signed keys like you were planning on doing, though i don't have them being emailed anywhere

[2012-06-04 21:36:35 -0400] oddover: Ohai, chefs
[2012-06-04 21:37:04 -0400] oddover: I have a question about the route resource. Is anyone here familiar with it?
[2012-06-04 21:41:55 -0400] oddover: I'll take that as a no
[2012-06-04 21:41:59 -0400] oddover: :P
[2012-06-04 21:42:01 -0400] yfeldblum: oddover, feel free to ask the question anyway
[2012-06-04 21:43:07 -0400] oddover: It looks like the route resource generates a line that looks like this: 10.15.3.0/27 via 172.20.62.1 I've been told that it's better syntax to do this: 10.15.3.0/27 via 172.20.62.1 dev eth0
[2012-06-04 21:43:17 -0400] oddover: Is there a flag or something to make it do that
[2012-06-04 21:43:23 -0400] oddover: ?
[2012-06-04 21:57:12 -0400] thedeeno: from the opscode wiki (in referece to private ssh keys when deploying from git) "The key needs to be a string with the newlines converted to "\n" ". What's a good way to do this?
[2012-06-04 21:57:31 -0400] thedeeno: my google fu is failing
[2012-06-04 22:00:34 -0400] oddover: In case anyone else was wondering about my question: The answer is no. I just looked through the source code
[2012-06-04 22:01:51 -0400] meineerde: thedeeno: something like this should do: perl -pe 's/[\n\r]+/\\n/' ~/.ssh/id_dsa
[2012-06-04 22:01:59 -0400] oddover: How do I contribute changes to the chef repo?
[2012-06-04 22:02:26 -0400] meineerde: oddover: sign a CLA, open an issue in jira and send a pull request
[2012-06-04 22:02:56 -0400] meineerde: oddover: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/How+to+Contribute
[2012-06-04 22:02:58 -0400] oddover: meineerde: Thanks.
[2012-06-04 22:02:59 -0400] ulfmagnetics: any chefspec users out there?
[2012-06-04 22:05:27 -0400] thedeeno: meineerde: is vim just retarded? %s/[\n\r]+/\n/ is what I tried but replaces everything with ^@
[2012-06-04 22:06:35 -0400] meineerde: thedeeno: not being a vim user, you probably need to escape the backslash in the replacement and you probably need to enable multi-line mode
[2012-06-04 22:07:29 -0400] thedeeno: meineerde: since I have no idea what multi-line mode is I suspect you're right :) Thanks
[2012-06-04 22:08:46 -0400] thedeeno: oh, they mean literal \n's huh
[2012-06-04 22:09:18 -0400] meineerde: thedeeno: yeah, might also be I'm talking bull. As I said, I only use vim on gun point
[2012-06-04 22:09:47 -0400] meineerde: thedeeno: yeah, not an ascii 13 but the backslash character followed by the character 'n'
[2012-06-04 22:09:50 -0400] timsmith: I'm having a bit of trouble with service restarts via notifies.  If I say  notifies :restart, "service[nagios-nrpe-server]" will that find a resource named nagios-nrpe-server or will it specifically restart a service named nagios-nrpe-server on the box
[2012-06-04 22:10:02 -0400] thedeeno: well, the BS sounds good anyways
[2012-06-04 22:10:17 -0400] thedeeno: :)
[2012-06-04 22:10:42 -0400] josephholsten: timsmith: it sends the notification to a chef resource of type 'service' with name 'nagios-nrpe-server'
[2012-06-04 22:10:46 -0400] meineerde: timsmith: it will notify the service resource named nagios-nrpe-server in your chef script. it will not inspect the system
[2012-06-04 22:10:58 -0400] timsmith: perfect
[2012-06-04 22:10:59 -0400] timsmith: thanks
[2012-06-04 22:11:31 -0400] timsmith: does the service def need to come before the template def?
[2012-06-04 22:12:00 -0400] pwf: [A
[2012-06-04 22:12:00 -0400] pwf: [A

[2012-06-04 22:12:21 -0400] pwf: oops
[2012-06-04 22:12:43 -0400] josephholsten: timsmith: yes
[2012-06-04 22:18:43 -0400] yfeldblum: hmmm ... seems to me that the config file resource should typically come before the service resource, for the simple reason that on the metal itself, the service depends on the config file
[2012-06-04 22:19:52 -0400] sako: is there a good article on how to automate ec2 provisioning?
[2012-06-04 22:20:06 -0400] sivy: heyo; anyone calling update-rc from a recipe? I need some code to read.
[2012-06-04 22:24:51 -0400] werdnativ: is anyone successfully using the application_ruby cookbook with rbenv? I can't figure out how to get the unicorn runit service to see rbenv's paths (for bundle exec).
[2012-06-04 22:26:03 -0400] werdnativ: if I run the command as root, the environment paths are there and everything works, but not when it tries to work via runit.
[2012-06-04 22:27:05 -0400] werdnativ: the rbenv cookbook installs setup files in /etc/profile.d/rbenv.sh, apparently these aren't loaded for runit jobs?
[2012-06-04 22:36:54 -0400] twelvetones: I'm having a hard time getting chefspec to recognize a resource that's located in another cookbook.
[2012-06-04 22:37:28 -0400] twelvetones: The converges keep failing with "Cannot find a resource for logrotate_app"
[2012-06-04 22:37:43 -0400] twelvetones: Anybody ever encounter this behavior?
[2012-06-04 22:49:49 -0400] other_guy: I'm trying to override some attributes in my role.rb file using the override_attributes method, and in it I'm trying to get some metadata from the node that's being setup with this role
[2012-06-04 22:50:09 -0400] other_guy: when I try to just do node['some_attr'] I get an error telling me that node doesn't exist
[2012-06-04 22:50:29 -0400] other_guy: is there a way to reference what node this role is being applied to?
[2012-06-04 22:51:26 -0400] twelvetones: for anyone curious / for posterity: I worked around my issue with ' Chef::Recipe.any_instance.stub(:logrotate_app)'
[2012-06-04 22:54:51 -0400] pwf: how do i reference an attribute i defined earlier in an attributes file
[2012-06-04 22:54:58 -0400] pwf: is it in node at that point?
[2012-06-04 22:55:57 -0400] pwf: as in `default[:foo] = 'foo'`, and then `default[:foobar] = '#{node[:foo]}bar'`
[2012-06-04 22:57:20 -0400] jeremyolliver: has anyone had any issues using remote_file behind an http_proxy?
[2012-06-04 22:57:48 -0400] jeremyolliver: I've got the client http_proxy and https_proxy variables set fine, and able to download the same uri via the http proxy manually
[2012-06-04 22:58:04 -0400] jeremyolliver: but I'm getting "Errno::ECONNREFUSED: Connection refused - Connection refused connecting to github.com:443"
[2012-06-04 22:59:32 -0400] jeremyolliver: anyone have any ideas on what that could be? I would assume that either the proxy settings are not being used, or an ssl cert verification, but I'm a bit stumped on why it's not working
[2012-06-04 23:00:04 -0400] jstad: jtimberman: you around?
[2012-06-04 23:06:39 -0400] other_guy: Is there any way for a Chef::Role to have knowledge of the Chef::Node it's being applied to?
[2012-06-04 23:08:59 -0400] jeremyolliver: @other_guy I don't think so, the best approach is to use attributes, setup some default ones for the role, and have your node or environment override them
[2012-06-04 23:09:50 -0400] other_guy: How would I have my node override them that's basically what I"m trying to do now.  I'm setting up new defaults on a role, and wanting them to override what gets set by the recipe
[2012-06-04 23:10:12 -0400] other_guy: the problem is I need the IP address and the hostname of the node the role is being applied to
[2012-06-04 23:11:01 -0400] jeremyolliver: @other_guy Hmm, I think the recipe gets that information, but not the role
[2012-06-04 23:11:48 -0400] jeremyolliver: @other_guy what's the use case you're going for?
[2012-06-04 23:13:10 -0400] other_guy: Every node in my riak cluster has to be named with a resolvable name and have it's default listening IP changed to the real IP of the machine rather than the default 127.0.0.1
[2012-06-04 23:13:30 -0400] other_guy: I wanted to do this as a role, because I'm going to have multiple clusters
[2012-06-04 23:14:00 -0400] nenemo: hi all
[2012-06-04 23:14:08 -0400] other_guy: and I wanted to be able to have mostly good defaults in the recipe, and then just have the role overwrite them depending on whether or not it was to be a session store, a production cluster, a dev cluster, etc.
[2012-06-04 23:14:40 -0400] jeremyolliver: Hmm, so they have to listen on a global name
[2012-06-04 23:14:54 -0400] nenemo: how to check from recipe that data bag is exists? search() and data_bag_item() return HTTPServerEsception 404.
[2012-06-04 23:15:03 -0400] other_guy: doing it via recipes would require me to have different recipes per cluster type, which sorta defeats the purpose of roles :-)
[2012-06-04 23:15:12 -0400] jeremyolliver: I haven't got to setting up my riak cluster yet, that will be in a few days
[2012-06-04 23:15:38 -0400] other_guy: jeremyolliver, essentially.  They have a unique name that's required by the Erlang VM to resolve member nodes in the cluster
[2012-06-04 23:15:40 -0400] jeremyolliver: I used the etchosts cookbook to setup the fqdn etc of each node
[2012-06-04 23:16:03 -0400] other_guy: like riak1@192.168.0.1, riak2@192.168.0.2 and so on
[2012-06-04 23:16:09 -0400] jeremyolliver: which was good for having an entry in /etc/hosts for every node (just within the given environment)
[2012-06-04 23:16:55 -0400] jeremyolliver: you'll probably want to set in your riak role a default_attribute something like default_attributes(:riak => {:listen_host => "127.0.0.1"})
[2012-06-04 23:17:02 -0400] other_guy: yeah, but the system doesn't rely on name resolution, and the hosts file just ends up being something else to keep in sync amongst the peers
[2012-06-04 23:17:29 -0400] jeremyolliver: and in each node you could set the attributes to something else {:riak => :listen_host => "riak1.example.com"}
[2012-06-04 23:18:13 -0400] jeremyolliver: it's not the most elegant because you'll have to be explicit about each node's IP in it's own definition
[2012-06-04 23:18:25 -0400] other_guy: yeah, I guess it's not clear to me which thing is supposed to supercede the other.  It seems like roles are supposed to modify recipes
[2012-06-04 23:18:39 -0400] other_guy: but to do what I want I have to have the recipes modify the roles
[2012-06-04 23:18:49 -0400] jeremyolliver: yeah, roles are essentially listing a group of recipes and configuration
[2012-06-04 23:19:00 -0400] jeremyolliver: they're not as flexible as a recipe
[2012-06-04 23:19:24 -0400] other_guy: Well it would be a really easy thing to fix I expect, because the Role must have some access to metadata about the thing it's running on
[2012-06-04 23:19:31 -0400] other_guy: it's just not exposed currently
[2012-06-04 23:19:32 -0400] jeremyolliver: you could also alter/fork the riak recipe and set the config file to setup the listen address to "node[:fqdn]"
[2012-06-04 23:19:44 -0400] jeremyolliver: I don't think so
[2012-06-04 23:20:05 -0400] other_guy: Well chef is calling the role
[2012-06-04 23:20:10 -0400] jeremyolliver: a "role" is just a json list of attributes that gets applied like a mask to each node, it doesn't have any logic
[2012-06-04 23:20:13 -0400] other_guy: the node context could be passed into it
[2012-06-04 23:20:49 -0400] other_guy: hmmm
[2012-06-04 23:21:31 -0400] other_guy: @jeremyolliver, well thanks. I'm going to have to prod at this thing a bit I guess.
[2012-06-04 23:22:44 -0400] other_guy: It just seems extremely likely that a role might need to be able to be somewhat dynamic based on what it's getting applied to, and when the masking is done it could be do_mask(configbits, newbits, object)
[2012-06-04 23:22:53 -0400] jeremyolliver: @other_guy if you're using the riak recipe off the community cookbooks site then try looking at the attributes/erlang.rb file
[2012-06-04 23:23:20 -0400] jeremyolliver: changing "default.riak.erlang.node_name = "riak@127.0.0.1"" to instead set "riak@#{node[:fqdn]}" might work
[2012-06-04 23:23:55 -0400] other_guy: Yeah that makes sense.  I was just trying to avoid screwing with the default recipe
[2012-06-04 23:24:12 -0400] jeremyolliver: I've had to mess with a few recipes myself
[2012-06-04 23:24:48 -0400] jeremyolliver: if you do modify them, bumping the version number in metadata.rb seems to be good so it doesn't look like the same version
[2012-06-04 23:24:58 -0400] hoover_damm: other_guy, github.com/damm/riak
[2012-06-04 23:25:08 -0400] hoover_damm: other_guy, it's a old riak cookbook I wrote... for mainly EC2
[2012-06-04 23:25:17 -0400] hoover_damm: don't know if that helps or hurts
[2012-06-04 23:25:23 -0400] other_guy: hoover_damm, thanks I'll take a look :-)
[2012-06-04 23:25:48 -0400] hoover_damm: other_guy, I didn't really add a whole lot of thought into it as you can see the attributes here https://raw.github.com/damm/riak/master/attributes/riak.rb
[2012-06-04 23:25:59 -0400] hoover_damm: other_guy, I just wanted a way to get riak up and working
[2012-06-04 23:26:18 -0400] other_guy: got it
[2012-06-04 23:26:25 -0400] hoover_damm: my patterns might not be the best, but it works
[2012-06-04 23:26:52 -0400] hoover_damm: and it's lame enough that it's super easy to modify :)
[2012-06-04 23:32:11 -0400] excalq: I have searching for a data-bag which determines branch/environment deployment working, but it doesn't seem very clean. I had to do this to prevent nil and [] from freaking out:
[2012-06-04 23:32:11 -0400] excalq: branch_data_bag = search(:deployment, "id:#{node.chef_environment}")
[2012-06-04 23:32:12 -0400] excalq: use_branch = (!branch_data_bag.empty? && branch_data_bag.first.has_key?("revision")) ? branch_data_bag.first["revision"] : "master"
[2012-06-04 23:32:22 -0400] excalq: is there a "cleaner" way?
[2012-06-04 23:33:32 -0400] werdnativ: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application_ruby/blob/master/providers/unicorn.rb#L60
[2012-06-04 23:33:33 -0400] werdnativ: This looks like it doesn't accept any of the environment options passed in, e.g. for PATH. Shouldn't it?
[2012-06-04 23:35:04 -0400] excalq: werdnativ: I didn't find the existing unicorn stuff to be very good. I'm hoping to contribute our when finished
[2012-06-04 23:35:39 -0400] hoover_damm: eventually everyone will have their own unicorn cookbook
[2012-06-04 23:35:44 -0400] excalq: If you search for "unicorn init scripts", there are some pretty good ones out there (non-chef specific), but you can make a template or cookbook_file of them
[2012-06-04 23:35:54 -0400] werdnativ: excalq: my problem is that the runit service can't find "bundle" (mine is in /usr/local/rbenv/shims/bundle), do you pass it an environment somehow?
[2012-06-04 23:36:03 -0400] hoover_damm: and runit starts bluepill
[2012-06-04 23:36:04 -0400] excalq: heh, rvm was hell
[2012-06-04 23:36:07 -0400] hoover_damm: rvm is hell
[2012-06-04 23:36:14 -0400] excalq: I ended up using a 12.04 PPA
[2012-06-04 23:36:26 -0400] excalq: and installing ruby_193 directly
[2012-06-04 23:36:33 -0400] excalq: another cookbook I hope to work on :p
[2012-06-04 23:36:39 -0400] hoover_damm: most people don't realize that runit, monit, etc don't source your .bashrc or load a full environment
[2012-06-04 23:36:44 -0400] hoover_damm: cron included
[2012-06-04 23:36:58 -0400] hoover_damm: so when you add things like rbenv, or rvm... you have to ensure that all those tools have the same environment
[2012-06-04 23:37:03 -0400] werdnativ: yeah  I think I just learned that. :(
[2012-06-04 23:37:13 -0400] hoover_damm: great for development
[2012-06-04 23:37:19 -0400] hoover_damm: slippery slope upstream
[2012-06-04 23:37:43 -0400] hoover_damm: github.com/damm/unicorn feel free to take whatever you like
[2012-06-04 23:37:47 -0400] werdnativ: wdym "same environment", it seems the runit scripts have "no" environment beyond what you specify?
[2012-06-04 23:38:02 -0400] hoover_damm: 0-downtime standard rails unicorn setup
[2012-06-04 23:38:09 -0400] werdnativ: thanks for links
[2012-06-04 23:38:35 -0400] hoover_damm: it's fun
[2012-06-04 23:38:48 -0400] hoover_damm: gonna update my graphite cookbook this week
[2012-06-04 23:39:37 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, btw i'm going to stop the sqlite thought in graphite and start depending on the postgresql cookbook
[2012-06-04 23:39:40 -0400] hoover_damm: *twitch*
[2012-06-04 23:39:51 -0400] miah: oh?
[2012-06-04 23:40:04 -0400] hoover_damm: yup
[2012-06-04 23:40:06 -0400] excalq: werdnativ: you might be able to explicitly set $PATH, $GEM_HOME, and stuff like that, but I found rvm to be an endless rabbithole
[2012-06-04 23:40:26 -0400] hoover_damm: it's quite snappier for the main reason
[2012-06-04 23:40:48 -0400] hoover_damm: that and my load dropped to 0.17 after moving back
[2012-06-04 23:40:49 -0400] hoover_damm: *grimmace*
[2012-06-04 23:40:56 -0400] werdnativ: excalq: I heard rbenv is easier, but so far has not proven to be true.
[2012-06-04 23:41:09 -0400] hoover_damm: I've never had sqlite3 act this bizzarely
[2012-06-04 23:41:13 -0400] hoover_damm: I wonder if it's really due to SSD
[2012-06-04 23:41:21 -0400] werdnativ: that's what I'm trying on the server with fnichol/chef-rbenv
[2012-06-04 23:41:24 -0400] hoover_damm: can't blame Sandybridge
[2012-06-04 23:41:44 -0400] werdnativ: I think I'll stick with brightbox PPA for 1.9.3 system ruby...
[2012-06-04 23:42:07 -0400] werdnativ: looks like they have 1.9.3-p194 now anyway.
[2012-06-04 23:42:23 -0400] hoover_damm: mine's still on p193, but it's lacking the debian gnarly patches
[2012-06-04 23:42:57 -0400] werdnativ: heh.
[2012-06-04 23:43:20 -0400] hoover_damm: most people do given enough time
[2012-06-04 23:47:51 -0400] werdnativ: kind of annoying how every low-level dependency ends up being in-house just to make everything work together though.
[2012-06-04 23:58:53 -0400] hoover_damm: well as more people contribute back the low-level dependencies to Opscode it will be less of a hassle
[2012-06-04 23:59:25 -0400] hoover_damm: this is more of an opportunity for people who are comfortable with a language (like coderanger does) to enhance the python cookbooks
[2012-06-04 23:59:40 -0400] coderanger: I did what in the where?
