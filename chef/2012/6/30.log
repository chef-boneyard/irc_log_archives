[2012-06-30 02:29:55 -0400] hakunin: c_t: the only explanation i could think of: testing caching
[2012-06-30 03:00:01 -0400] cakehero: How should I make sure nginx is running and has the latest config - should I call nginx -s reload on every run?
[2012-06-30 04:12:06 -0400] hoover_damm: riddle me this, how many more power outages can EC2 have before we start debating the question? does EC2 have power?
[2012-06-30 04:12:51 -0400] dumfries: without outages when would we have time to just talk like this though?
[2012-06-30 04:14:49 -0400] hoover_damm: oh I sit outages out.  Currently in the process of setting up a direct connect and just moving
[2012-06-30 04:15:24 -0400] hoover_damm: usually there isn't much you can do but twiddle your thumbs.  Trying to boot up more instances to recover usually is more of a hassle and can cause more damage...
[2012-06-30 04:15:43 -0400] hoover_damm: only works if you try to use at least 3 zones if not all 5
[2012-06-30 04:15:48 -0400] dumfries: instances are starting to come back, huzzah.
[2012-06-30 04:16:01 -0400] hoover_damm: my volumes are still dead
[2012-06-30 04:16:17 -0400] hoover_damm: collectd is still writing to graphite... so I have been watching the i/o as a 'sign' of recovery
[2012-06-30 04:17:54 -0400] dumfries: ah
[2012-06-30 04:18:23 -0400] hoover_damm: basically i have instances up but the ebs volumes are locked (ebs root)
[2012-06-30 04:18:52 -0400] hoover_damm: I could do just ephemeral only on AWS... but it makes stop/start a lot more scary
[2012-06-30 04:20:41 -0400] hoover_damm: so next up is 1d
[2012-06-30 04:20:43 -0400] hoover_damm: to do the full roundup
[2012-06-30 04:20:50 -0400] hoover_damm: (at least our 1d)
[2012-06-30 05:39:08 -0400] mrflip: running a local chef-server on OSX, I'm having weirdness with node search. I have a node that *mostly* disappears from the chef search as soon as it finishes running. If I search for 'name:*' it will find it, but if I search for 'tags:*' it will not, even though I've added values.
[2012-06-30 05:39:29 -0400] mrflip: Other nodes work as expected in search,
[2012-06-30 05:39:36 -0400] mrflip: and I can't see anything weird in the logs.
[2012-06-30 05:41:38 -0400] mrflip: when I update the node, I see the chef-expander kick in to gear just fine: 00:41:08 chef_expander.1  | [Sat, 30 Jun 2012 00:41:08 -0500] INFO: indexed node[de182bcf-87e4-457e-8dae-4eb7ff2d4413] database[chef]
[2012-06-30 05:41:49 -0400] mrflip: all ideas welcome.
[2012-06-30 05:44:03 -0400] Mithrandir: not all node values are persisted
[2012-06-30 05:46:55 -0400] hoover_damm: mrflip, http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2346
[2012-06-30 05:46:56 -0400] hoover_damm: ?
[2012-06-30 05:47:56 -0400] mrflip: that looks very promising hoover_damn
[2012-06-30 05:48:16 -0400] mrflip: just confirmed that it only starts disappearing after chef run has completed
[2012-06-30 05:48:39 -0400] hoover_damm: mrflip, lots of folks get hit with that
[2012-06-30 05:49:02 -0400] hoover_damm: mrflip, basically you have data, but not everything... sounds like what you described
[2012-06-30 05:53:11 -0400] mrflip: boom, thanks hoover_damn
[2012-06-30 05:54:30 -0400] hoover_damm: mrflip, sometimes I think that should be in the topic
[2012-06-30 05:54:54 -0400] mrflip: btw I noticed the first line of the solr logs:
[2012-06-30 05:55:21 -0400] mrflip: WARN: The maxFieldLimit for the mainIndex is set to 10000.  It's recommended to increase this value (in /usr/local/var/chef/solr/home/conf/solrconfig.xml).
[2012-06-30 05:56:24 -0400] mrflip: *head/desk*
[2012-06-30 05:57:53 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah the warning was added in 0.10.10
[2012-06-30 09:06:32 -0400] forestbird: i'm using the opscode mysql cookbook. now upon restarting my  box it generates a new seed file, then it uses debconf-set-selections to set the new seed.... i wonder why it would do this at all... i don't want it changed every time. anyway... then it goes on trying to do various things... never restarting the mysql. of course the new pw is ignored until mysql would be restarted. so it fails all the way. using chef solo and vagrant btw.
[2012-06-30 09:12:40 -0400] forestbird: so, shouldn't it first check if mysql is running? if yes it probably could check if the current passwords are valid and then do nothing...
[2012-06-30 09:22:56 -0400] forestbird: pff, i guess the easy fix is just to use a non-random pw
[2012-06-30 11:04:35 -0400] leitz: I'm reading the OPScode install guide for CentOS and the aegis.com repo link fails. Anyone know where the current link should be?
[2012-06-30 11:07:25 -0400] leitz: Ah, I see. They only support RHEL 5 and 6. Not Fedora. Hmm...
[2012-06-30 11:08:17 -0400] leitz: Well, no. I'm more confused than ever. Time to read up.
[2012-06-30 11:13:00 -0400] leitz: So here is what I understand. The URL in the article points to rhel and not Fedora. My error. The aegisco directory structure is "fc14", for example, and the $releasever is just "14". A little manual editing and it seems to be working.
[2012-06-30 11:18:41 -0400] schuckles: hi all
[2012-06-30 11:18:45 -0400] schuckles: anyone up?
[2012-06-30 11:23:11 -0400] leitz: Not really...

[2012-06-30 14:55:36 -0400] nefilim: trying to figure out what the difference is between node['platform'] and node[:platform]  ? the latter form isn't shown in the ruby  hash documentation
[2012-06-30 16:18:21 -0400] mrflip: I'm seeing 100% CPU load from chef-server's rabbitmq on OSX on the second time I start the app. Nuking it from orbit and re-installing led to the same issue. When I do `rabbitmqctl report`, it hangs listing `Queues on /chef`. rabbitmq is otherwise responsive to rabbitmqctl commands (in particular, stop and status).
[2012-06-30 16:19:30 -0400] mrflip: anyone see anything like this before?
[2012-06-30 16:19:39 -0400] z: sounds like you don't have the /chef vhost created
[2012-06-30 16:19:51 -0400] z: and its getting angry as a result
[2012-06-30 16:20:14 -0400] mrflip: I think it's there; the chef-server was working ok, and nodes were beeing expandered
[2012-06-30 16:20:40 -0400] z: is the right user/pass defined for amqp_user and amqp_pass?
[2012-06-30 16:21:06 -0400] z: rabbitmqctl add_user <new_user> <password>
[2012-06-30 16:21:06 -0400] z: rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /chef chef ".*" ".*" ".*"
[2012-06-30 16:21:13 -0400] z: May let you test that by adding a new one, or whatever :-)
[2012-06-30 16:22:08 -0400] mrflip: just checked, permissions look fine
[2012-06-30 16:23:53 -0400] mrflip: chef server, webui came up no problem.
[2012-06-30 16:41:00 -0400] forestbird: osx... ;)
[2012-06-30 19:10:02 -0400] cakehero: how do I access attributes inside a recipe?
[2012-06-30 19:10:19 -0400] cakehero: default[:myrecipe][:mykey] <-- that's what my attributes file looks like
[2012-06-30 19:10:58 -0400] _rc: node[:myrecipe][:mykey]
[2012-06-30 19:11:24 -0400] cakehero: k
[2012-06-30 19:13:52 -0400] cakehero: for some reason if I do node[:myrecipe] I don't get the values, I'm thinking that it should work just like a regular hash, is that incorrect?
[2012-06-30 19:14:08 -0400] cakehero: I want to pass the node[:myrecipe] values to a template
[2012-06-30 19:16:09 -0400] yfeldblum: cakehero, Node is not a Hash, and neither is Node::Attribute
[2012-06-30 19:16:29 -0400] yfeldblum: cakehero, if you want to pass a Hash to a template resource, you can use `node["myrecipe"].to_hash`
[2012-06-30 19:16:44 -0400] cakehero: ok, gotcha
[2012-06-30 19:16:53 -0400] cakehero: yeah I noticed it printed out a class name when I did a dump
[2012-06-30 19:17:31 -0400] yfeldblum: cakehero, Node and Node::Attribute sometimes work like a Hash, but sometimes do not, so if what you need is something that works like a Hash, you're best off asking Node or Node::Attribute to give you a Hash
[2012-06-30 19:17:57 -0400] cakehero: yfeldblum yes - this will work perfectly, thanks
[2012-06-30 19:18:09 -0400] cakehero: it looks like individual getters/setters are kinda like a hash
[2012-06-30 19:18:17 -0400] cakehero: but not a key containing a set of attributes
[2012-06-30 19:19:08 -0400] yfeldblum: cakehero, i wouldn't quite go that far
[2012-06-30 19:19:19 -0400] cakehero: k
[2012-06-30 19:40:53 -0400] hakunin: anybody got a bluepill config for resque-pool i could look at?
[2012-06-30 20:04:00 -0400] hoover_damm: bluepill and resque should be straight forward
[2012-06-30 20:04:12 -0400] hoover_damm: i can share with you a bluepill resque file if i have it still
[2012-06-30 20:04:20 -0400] hoover_damm: but it's not pool just resque worker
[2012-06-30 20:09:49 -0400] hakunin: hoover_damm: i'd prefer a pool example specifically
[2012-06-30 20:13:32 -0400] hoover_damm: i don't have pool
[2012-06-30 20:13:35 -0400] hoover_damm: so sorry
[2012-06-30 20:14:50 -0400] hakunin: hoover_damm: you are forgiven :)
[2012-06-30 20:15:04 -0400] hoover_damm: hakunin, fwiw they are likely interchangeable
[2012-06-30 20:15:13 -0400] hoover_damm: it's just rake
[2012-06-30 20:15:16 -0400] hoover_damm: and a f'ing pid
[2012-06-30 20:16:10 -0400] hakunin: hoover_damm: pool has init.d that it uses, which has shutdown schedule involving QUIT->INT->KILL progression with timeouts
[2012-06-30 20:19:22 -0400] hoover_damm: lol that's just a regular resque style stupidity
[2012-06-30 20:19:25 -0400] hoover_damm: nothing new there
[2012-06-30 20:19:59 -0400] hakunin: well in example monit config it has this: start program = "/etc/init.d/resque-pool start" with timeout 90 seconds
[2012-06-30 20:20:01 -0400] hoover_damm: hakunin, https://github.com/wegowise/chef-recipes/tree/master/resque is a cookbook a old client wrote
[2012-06-30 20:20:04 -0400] hoover_damm: really old client
[2012-06-30 20:20:06 -0400] hakunin: hoover_damm: do you konw how to do the same in bluepill?
[2012-06-30 20:20:21 -0400] hoover_damm: hakunin, https://github.com/wegowise/chef-recipes/blob/master/resque/templates/default/resque_all_queues.pill.erb
[2012-06-30 20:20:27 -0400] hoover_damm: hakunin, you basically want what we did on that stop command
[2012-06-30 20:20:50 -0400] hoover_damm: note that recipe was written for chef 0.6 so there's room for cleanup
[2012-06-30 20:21:00 -0400] hoover_damm: your goal is the pill, and there you go
[2012-06-30 20:21:13 -0400] yfeldblum: QUIT->INT->KILL? why doesn't it expect TERM->KILL?
[2012-06-30 20:21:42 -0400] hakunin: QUIT/30/INT/10/KILL/5
[2012-06-30 20:21:46 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, the problem with resque is the workers really
[2012-06-30 20:22:22 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, basically rails people put this whole evil logic into restarting resque
[2012-06-30 20:22:34 -0400] yfeldblum: oh right i remember a ticket where it was a problem on heroku because heroku does the normal thing of sending TERM and giving a proc 10 seconds to exit before sending KILL
[2012-06-30 20:22:35 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, first try and kill it nicely, then wait for a period of time (self determined)
[2012-06-30 20:22:38 -0400] yfeldblum: same problem with unicorn really
[2012-06-30 20:22:44 -0400] hoover_damm: nah not really
[2012-06-30 20:22:47 -0400] hoover_damm: unicorn is more graceful
[2012-06-30 20:23:06 -0400] hoover_damm: if you send a regular kill signal to unicorn such as term or quit or -6 it'll do the right thing
[2012-06-30 20:23:20 -0400] hoover_damm: you can send a regular kill signal to a resque worker and it's children and it can ignore that signal
[2012-06-30 20:23:31 -0400] hoover_damm: usually what happens is the actual main resque worker will quit
[2012-06-30 20:23:35 -0400] hoover_damm: but the child sticks around
[2012-06-30 20:24:46 -0400] erikh: -QUIT tells resque to finish the job and then stop
[2012-06-30 20:24:51 -0400] erikh: -TERM tells it to stop now
[2012-06-30 20:25:14 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, right unicorn is more graceful about it, but the ticket i was looking at is that both resque and unicorn use QUIT as the "nice TERM" when TERM is supposed to be nice and QUIT isn't supposed to be nice and heroku sends only TERM (and follows up with KILL in 10 seconds)
[2012-06-30 20:25:14 -0400] hoover_damm: erikh, another opinion.  Can I not care?
[2012-06-30 20:25:21 -0400] hoover_damm: erikh, it's not because I disagree with you or agree
[2012-06-30 20:25:26 -0400] hoover_damm: erikh, it's just not something I care about :)
[2012-06-30 20:25:29 -0400] erikh: that's not opinion, that's what the damn docs say
[2012-06-30 20:25:37 -0400] hoover_damm: well that's a fact based on docs
[2012-06-30 20:25:43 -0400] hoover_damm: but i've got opinions in old ey code that smell
[2012-06-30 20:25:51 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-06-30 20:25:55 -0400] erikh: ok
[2012-06-30 20:26:03 -0400] erikh: I'm going to find something worthwhile to pursue now
[2012-06-30 20:26:03 -0400] yfeldblum: wish resque and unicorn would fix that ...

[2012-06-30 22:15:30 -0400] erratic: wish I knew what was going on there and why it took 1 minute and 50 seconds to fail

[2012-06-30 22:55:26 -0400] bdataops: I thought it was pretty good.
[2012-06-30 22:55:39 -0400] bdataops: wondering if anyone had joined who I might have met
[2012-06-30 22:55:56 -0400] bdataops: is my nickname kind of funny?
[2012-06-30 22:55:58 -0400] hoover_damm: erratic, I have errands to run.  I'm fixing Amazon fires
[2012-06-30 22:56:00 -0400] hoover_damm: no thank you
[2012-06-30 22:56:15 -0400] hoover_damm: nothing but a busy day
[2012-06-30 22:56:26 -0400] erratic: lame
[2012-06-30 22:56:46 -0400] bdataops: erratic, where are you? I can go out for coffee
[2012-06-30 22:56:55 -0400] erratic: seattle, lake city specifically
[2012-06-30 22:57:00 -0400] hoover_damm: mrflip, yep.  Setting it too high will be bad
[2012-06-30 22:57:00 -0400] erratic: I can travel though
[2012-06-30 22:57:10 -0400] bdataops: ha. how far can you travel?
[2012-06-30 22:57:19 -0400] erratic: anywhere in the seattle area
[2012-06-30 22:57:26 -0400] erratic: might be willing to go as far as bellevue
[2012-06-30 22:57:28 -0400] mrflip: @hoover_damn I had turned it up to 200200 -- based on others in the thread saying 1M
[2012-06-30 22:57:39 -0400] bdataops: I'm in silicon valley
[2012-06-30 22:57:44 -0400] erratic: lol
[2012-06-30 22:57:54 -0400] bdataops: I love the coffee in seattle
[2012-06-30 22:58:01 -0400] bdataops: went there 6months ago
[2012-06-30 22:58:07 -0400] mrflip: I can't belive I didn't think harder about that
[2012-06-30 22:58:09 -0400] erratic: the weather here sucks
[2012-06-30 22:58:11 -0400] bdataops: got a speeding ticket on my way though
[2012-06-30 22:58:15 -0400] erratic: I want to be in silicon valley
[2012-06-30 22:58:39 -0400] erratic: hehe
[2012-06-30 22:58:44 -0400] bdataops: I kind of like raining days
[2012-06-30 22:58:52 -0400] mrflip: am ratcheting that back to 50k (increased from 10k)  and will make a note on the laborious bug I just filed
[2012-06-30 22:58:54 -0400] bdataops: make me quiet and focus
[2012-06-30 22:59:18 -0400] bdataops: what company are you working for? opscode ? aws?
[2012-06-30 23:00:19 -0400] erratic: I work for a small startup
[2012-06-30 23:00:38 -0400] erratic: making management software in the cloud
[2012-06-30 23:00:50 -0400] bdataops: that's cool
[2012-06-30 23:00:59 -0400] erratic: I'm the systems engineer and one of the software developers
[2012-06-30 23:01:41 -0400] bdataops: I was a sysadmin/dba/network eng...but recently joined a startup and want to be a develop
[2012-06-30 23:01:47 -0400] bdataops: er
[2012-06-30 23:08:35 -0400] erratic: ranger of the codes
[2012-06-30 23:08:41 -0400] erratic: and warez
[2012-06-30 23:26:02 -0400] hoover_damm: mrflip, that's not that much
[2012-06-30 23:26:04 -0400] hoover_damm: mrflip, weird
[2012-06-30 23:26:48 -0400] mrflip: it was increased to 200200 (200k) when I was seeing those problems
[2012-06-30 23:26:52 -0400] hoover_damm: how big are you storing in your node entry?
[2012-06-30 23:27:04 -0400] hoover_damm: s/big/many items
[2012-06-30 23:28:10 -0400] mrflip: nothing egregiously large comes to mind, but we do use node metadata freely
[2012-06-30 23:28:36 -0400] mrflip: the problems with rabbitmq came with nothing at all passing thru it
[2012-06-30 23:28:51 -0400] mrflip: tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3256
[2012-06-30 23:33:15 -0400] hoover_damm: nice bug report, let's see what opscode says
[2012-06-30 23:33:17 -0400] hoover_damm: also don't forget the ml
[2012-06-30 23:49:29 -0400] mrflip: ml?
[2012-06-30 23:49:29 -0400] bawt_: ml is better so ppl in all time zones get a chance to participate
[2012-06-30 23:49:40 -0400] mrflip: btw this is the config I'm using -- https://github.com/infochimps-labs/chimpstation-homebase / https://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan-pantry
[2012-06-30 23:52:24 -0400] mrflip: now that this is working I can spin up any machine in our stack in a local vagrant; guard-chef pushes every change immediately on save to the local chef server, so I can just keep ticking the vagrant chef client over until it looks right, then tear down and verify. it's like rocket fuel for cookbook development
