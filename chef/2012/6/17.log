[2012-06-17 00:04:59 -0400] sparc: I almost forgot about the Chef book.  Is that out yet?
[2012-06-17 01:29:57 -0400] williamherry: hi, I am prepare a share point about chef, can I answer the question: 'what chef can do?' with 'everything'
[2012-06-17 01:31:18 -0400] flaccid_: sure, you can
[2012-06-17 01:31:21 -0400] flaccid_: doesn't mean its right :)
[2012-06-17 01:36:01 -0400] williamherry: flaccid_, thanks, is there any shared ppt or some that introduce to people what is chef that I can refer ?
[2012-06-17 01:36:31 -0400] flaccid_: there is quite a few out there, but i don't think i have them bookmarked :(
[2012-06-17 01:49:30 -0400] williamherry: flaccid_, thank you any way
[2012-06-17 01:51:37 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, https://github.com/opscode/chef-fundamentals and if your looking for some presentations ... http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Presentations
[2012-06-17 01:52:01 -0400] hoover_damm: wiki.opscode.com should be your start page for any questions you have about chef
[2012-06-17 01:54:59 -0400] williamherry: hoover_damm, wow, thank you
[2012-06-17 01:56:05 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, don't forget http://www.opscode.com/training/ if you want someone to mentor/train
[2012-06-17 01:56:13 -0400] hoover_damm: or hire someone who can
[2012-06-17 01:56:38 -0400] flaccid_: its amazing what can be found when looking :p
[2012-06-17 01:57:12 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, but start with the training material / fundamentals and take it slow and if you have any questions it's best to grab a bunch of your questions and post them to the chef mailing list
[2012-06-17 01:57:36 -0400] hoover_damm: bawt_, lists?
[2012-06-17 01:57:36 -0400] bawt_: lists is http://lists.opscode.com
[2012-06-17 01:57:51 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, ^^ is where you can find an archive of the mailing lists
[2012-06-17 01:57:52 -0400] williamherry: ^)^, I have spend two one week to learn chef, now I can deploy and write a ntp recipe, My boss let me show other coworkers what chef is and very importantly what chef can do
[2012-06-17 01:58:11 -0400] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-06-17 01:58:32 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, but remember to enforce to everyone that this won't mean their job is obsolete
[2012-06-17 01:58:59 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, this is just a new skill to help your company produce a better defined production that is built out by code instead of hitting enter
[2012-06-17 01:59:00 -0400] flaccid_: ntp already done quite a few times iirc
[2012-06-17 01:59:12 -0400] hoover_damm: learning is important flaccid_
[2012-06-17 01:59:27 -0400] hoover_damm: one of the most basic things we do as humans is put together a 'puzzle'
[2012-06-17 01:59:33 -0400] flaccid_: yep and best learning can come from doing a new problem :)
[2012-06-17 01:59:45 -0400] hoover_damm: so part of Chef is taking a set of steps
[2012-06-17 01:59:48 -0400] hoover_damm: and condensing it into a cookbook
[2012-06-17 02:00:10 -0400] williamherry: we want use chef to manage our account, I have a little problem
[2012-06-17 02:00:25 -0400] hoover_damm: well which account? user account?
[2012-06-17 02:00:34 -0400] williamherry: user account
[2012-06-17 02:00:43 -0400] williamherry: I can use data bag to achieve it
[2012-06-17 02:00:43 -0400] hoover_damm: so what's the problem?
[2012-06-17 02:00:46 -0400] hoover_damm: right
[2012-06-17 02:00:53 -0400] hoover_damm: I actually use attributes
[2012-06-17 02:01:05 -0400] williamherry: but we have a lot of system most of them are centos,
[2012-06-17 02:01:07 -0400] hoover_damm: personal preference :)
[2012-06-17 02:02:09 -0400] flaccid_: ldap/pam is good for distributed auth on boxes
[2012-06-17 02:02:16 -0400] williamherry: hoover_damm, can you share your experience, I feel that use data bag is not the best method
[2012-06-17 02:03:19 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, well for a client of mine they have a staging and a production environment.  They wanted a different password for each
[2012-06-17 02:03:36 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, to do this in a databag means I have to create a databag for production and for staging
[2012-06-17 02:03:41 -0400] williamherry: hoover_damm, my question, we add user with long interval, and we want all server have that account as soon as quickly, so, what interval time should I use to client
[2012-06-17 02:03:54 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, so for us we put the password 'hash' in the environment
[2012-06-17 02:04:11 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, our username is static, password is only what changes... then just update the environment and run chef to update the password
[2012-06-17 02:04:17 -0400] flaccid_: real acl > different passwords
[2012-06-17 02:04:27 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, and we leave a failsafe password for when stuff is booted out of envs
[2012-06-17 02:04:33 -0400] hoover_damm: flaccid_, seriously
[2012-06-17 02:04:34 -0400] hoover_damm: or ssh keys
[2012-06-17 02:04:56 -0400] hoover_damm: but they're on rackspace so passwords is a clear obvious path for their brains
[2012-06-17 02:04:59 -0400] williamherry: we don't use password, we just ssh key
[2012-06-17 02:05:09 -0400] flaccid_: yes pretty easy to distribute public ssh keys
[2012-06-17 02:05:10 -0400] hoover_damm: so you'd put the ssh key in attributes
[2012-06-17 02:05:54 -0400] williamherry: I am totally new to chef, I now put ssh key to template
[2012-06-17 02:06:22 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, https://gist.github.com/ccb16f575b7a9e336106
[2012-06-17 02:06:26 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, that's the recipe I use
[2012-06-17 02:06:54 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, so you'd just want an action like how I drop id_rsa to update authorized_keys
[2012-06-17 02:07:15 -0400] hoover_damm: file or template resource works.  I just use file + content as a quick 'template' pattern
[2012-06-17 02:08:40 -0400] williamherry: hoover_damm, looks nice, I like it, what will you do when you need to add a account, does your account have group?
[2012-06-17 02:09:19 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, group is node[:application][:gname]
[2012-06-17 02:10:09 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, line 8 I add the group.  Line 12 I add the user, line 19 notifies to have Chef reload the group list so when I do owner "app" :) it works
[2012-06-17 02:10:10 -0400] williamherry: hoover_damm, I mean different type of user, like normal user, admin user,
[2012-06-17 02:10:28 -0400] hoover_damm: williamherry, line 22
[2012-06-17 02:11:34 -0400] hoover_damm: anywho good luck
[2012-06-17 02:12:30 -0400] williamherry: hoover_damm, I did make me clear, we have many server and many user, not all server have the all user, we have to group them, what I did now it use difference recipe, like recipe[user::admin] recipe[user::ops]....
[2012-06-17 02:12:53 -0400] williamherry: I will modify you recipe to suit my needs
[2012-06-17 02:13:24 -0400] yfeldblum: williamherry, in chef, recipes are written in Just Plain Ruby, and you can use any Ruby code you like, including shelling out to anything you like; they are typically run as root on every server being configured so they have all permissions; so there's nothing you can't do in a recipe
[2012-06-17 02:14:44 -0400] williamherry: yfeldblum, that's very right, I already feel the power of chef even I know chef a little
[2012-06-17 02:14:48 -0400] yfeldblum: williamherry, so feel free and abuse it; but if you aim a cannon at your foot and light the fuse, things might go a little haywire; so it's useful to learn and respect the recommended ways to use chef and try to stay within those guidelines
[2012-06-17 02:15:46 -0400] yfeldblum: williamherry, chef has no additional power ... you can use it as nothing more than a glorified script runner that you either run as root on-command, or that you run as root in a cron job, or that you run as root and daemonize
[2012-06-17 02:16:15 -0400] yfeldblum: williamherry, the power of chef doesn't lie in what you can do with it, since you can't do anything more with chef than you can do with a bash script
[2012-06-17 02:17:11 -0400] flaccid_: ruby can do a lot of things bash can't.
[2012-06-17 02:17:14 -0400] yfeldblum: williamherry, the power of chef comes from the fact that it lets you write your infrastructure code in a rather high-level, declarative way, and it offers a whole lot of specialized code for free around making many things it does reliable (you could do the same things in bash if you like)
[2012-06-17 02:17:25 -0400] yfeldblum: flaccid_, bash can shell out to perl
[2012-06-17 02:17:39 -0400] flaccid_: yes thats perl then not bash :)
[2012-06-17 02:17:59 -0400] yfeldblum: flaccid_, everything done in bash is done by shelling out to another program
[2012-06-17 02:18:20 -0400] flaccid_: wt, no its not.
[2012-06-17 02:18:41 -0400] flaccid_: bash has a lot of built ins. you don't shell out for those
[2012-06-17 02:18:47 -0400] yfeldblum: flaccid_, there are a few builtins, but every builtin has a matching program that you can find in /bin
[2012-06-17 02:18:59 -0400] flaccid_: incorerct
[2012-06-17 02:19:00 -0400] yfeldblum: not every, but many
[2012-06-17 02:19:02 -0400] williamherry: yfeldblum, at the very beginning we just want chef to manage our user account, we add one account like every few month, what interval time should I use to chef-client?
[2012-06-17 02:19:07 -0400] flaccid_: PE doesn't have a binary.
[2012-06-17 02:19:16 -0400] flaccid_: as well as all the actual built-ins
[2012-06-17 02:19:46 -0400] yfeldblum: flaccid_, the point is the technicalities, it's that everything that you can do with a chef recipe, you can also do with a bash script (that shells out to other things)
[2012-06-17 02:19:55 -0400] yfeldblum: the point is *not* the technicalities
[2012-06-17 02:20:26 -0400] flaccid_: i'm not sure what the point is
[2012-06-17 02:21:14 -0400] yfeldblum: flaccid_, the point is what is the point of chef; how is chef different from just writing some bash scripts
[2012-06-17 02:21:30 -0400] flaccid_: oh thats a different subject
[2012-06-17 02:22:40 -0400] yfeldblum: flaccid_, the answer is that chef offers a resource-oriented declare-then-converge framework that allows you to write complex infrastructure a lot more simply than you would have written it in bash
[2012-06-17 02:22:50 -0400] yfeldblum: williamherry, up to you
[2012-06-17 02:22:57 -0400] flaccid_: its framework yes
[2012-06-17 02:23:52 -0400] yfeldblum: flaccid_, the power of chef is that it allows you to express your intentions clearly, at least compared to other systems
[2012-06-17 02:24:05 -0400] flaccid_: sure
[2012-06-17 02:25:23 -0400] flaccid_: i love it
[2012-06-17 05:44:59 -0400] williamherry: knife search node "plat*:ubuntu" return error, not much on server.log
[2012-06-17 05:45:47 -0400] williamherry: help
[2012-06-17 05:57:55 -0400] yfeldblum: williamherry, didn't think that was a valid lucene query
[2012-06-17 05:58:48 -0400] yfeldblum: williamherry, http://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html
[2012-06-17 05:58:52 -0400] williamherry: yfeldblum, how about knife search node 'name:client*'
[2012-06-17 05:59:08 -0400] williamherry: yfeldblum, all return error
[2012-06-17 05:59:31 -0400] yfeldblum: williamherry, are the indexing-related services set up?
[2012-06-17 06:01:13 -0400] williamherry: yfeldblum, thank you, I start chef-solr, no more error
[2012-06-17 06:01:51 -0400] yfeldblum: williamherry, chef-solr, chef-expander, and rabbitmq
[2012-06-17 06:04:00 -0400] williamherry: all other service are up and running
[2012-06-17 06:14:07 -0400] PapaSierra3: morning, i'm using a third party vagrantfile and there is a line that simply says "package "git-core"". i'm getting this error and don't know what to do to fix it. http://hastebin.com/loqumiyuyo.txt
[2012-06-17 06:27:19 -0400] hector: error shows it is trying to install nodejs ? not git-core ? anyways, on the server running the chef-client, do an apt-cache search "name of package" e.g. git-core, nodejs. If nothing shows, then you will need to include the missing repository.
[2012-06-17 06:29:54 -0400] PapaSierra3: my apologies it's nothing to do with git-core. indeed it's nodejs that's causing the issue
[2012-06-17 06:30:40 -0400] PapaSierra3: ok, how do i "include the missing repository"?
[2012-06-17 06:31:04 -0400] hector: are you running ubuntu ?
[2012-06-17 06:31:14 -0400] PapaSierra3: yes lucid32
[2012-06-17 06:37:58 -0400] hector: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nodejs - need to include the repository in your sources.list, though I dont see a package available for lucid. it's provided by an untrusted archive
[2012-06-17 06:41:01 -0400] hector: you could add this repo at your own risk, instructions are provided on the page: https://launchpad.net/~therve/+archive/ppa
[2012-06-17 06:41:09 -0400] hector: PapaSierra3 ^
[2012-06-17 06:41:31 -0400] PapaSierra3: thanks, reading and trying to understand how this works...
[2012-06-17 06:42:30 -0400] PapaSierra3: in a vagrant set up with chef, where would the sources list be?
[2012-06-17 06:43:04 -0400] PapaSierra3: or is it in the linux box already?
[2012-06-17 06:43:07 -0400] hector: sources.list is on the server itself, create a file called therve-ppa.list under /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
[2012-06-17 06:43:15 -0400] flaccid_: that depends on the image/distro etc.
[2012-06-17 06:43:49 -0400] flaccid_: checkout apt cookbook for lwrp iirc
[2012-06-17 06:45:02 -0400] PapaSierra3: yup, i'm starting to understand what's gone wrong! i'm using a third party vagrantfile with recipes. they point to a 64 bit ubuntu box where they have obviously set up the sources appropriately. i'm at home with an old 32 bit laptop so i figured i'd swap out their box for lucid32 which is obviously lacking the sources that you're talking about
[2012-06-17 06:45:43 -0400] flaccid_: i think its called apt_repository and i've used it for ppa repos before
[2012-06-17 06:47:01 -0400] PapaSierra3: ok looking now...
[2012-06-17 06:47:04 -0400] hector: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Opscode+LWRP+Resources - yeah, apt cookbook will setup the config for you on the system. make sure you add the cookbook to your run list :)
[2012-06-17 06:47:43 -0400] PapaSierra3: brilliant!
[2012-06-17 08:58:14 -0400] motiejus: is there a rule of thumb when I should use node attributes vs data bags? In my case, I want to store some drbd stuff which:
[2012-06-17 08:58:14 -0400] motiejus: 1. is relevant for 2 nodes
[2012-06-17 08:58:14 -0400] motiejus: 2. I want to be quite sure they have the same information
[2012-06-17 08:58:15 -0400] motiejus: I think due to 2nd requirement it's better to have them in a data bag, but how do I then specify which data bags belong to which nodes? Or are node properties more appropriate here?
[2012-06-17 09:58:43 -0400] makuk66: motiejus: create a role, in the role use an override to set the name of the bag, read from the bag. Or don't bother with the bag and use the override properties. I find bags most useful if you want to use them from different cookbooks, or to keep sensitive info out of cookbooks
[2012-06-17 11:52:06 -0400] williamherry: does chef-solo mode need couchDB and rabbitmq?
[2012-06-17 11:52:25 -0400] erikh: no
[2012-06-17 11:52:42 -0400] erikh: it pretty much only needs ruby and a few gems.
[2012-06-17 12:07:13 -0400] williamherry: erikh, so, it store every thing in normal file, right?
[2012-06-17 12:07:28 -0400] erikh: correct.
[2012-06-17 12:07:33 -0400] williamherry: no search support?
[2012-06-17 12:07:41 -0400] erikh: correct.
[2012-06-17 12:08:24 -0400] williamherry: what should I do if a want backup my chef with chef server mode,
[2012-06-17 12:09:39 -0400] williamherry: erikh, do I have to backup CouchDB and rabbitmq or just cookbook?
[2012-06-17 13:24:32 -0400] motiejus1: hi all. How can I make chef execute line 56 only if line 52 was executed? https://github.com/Motiejus/chef-drbd/blob/master/providers/pair.rb#L56
[2012-06-17 13:24:42 -0400] motiejus1: (please ignore if I leave, I have very dodgy connection)
[2012-06-17 13:24:49 -0400] motiejus1: (will return in a couple of minutes then)
[2012-06-17 13:25:22 -0400] motiejus1: I suppose it's not really a choice to add an instance variable in execute block and check for it afterwards because of the compilation phase?
[2012-06-17 13:25:38 -0400] motiejus1: or is there a more elegant way to execute bundle of actions :)
[2012-06-17 13:27:03 -0400] motiejus1: and another question while my internet lets me be here: in the file you can see a commented out "cstate(what)" method. which does the obvious thing. However, if I uncomment it, I get syntax error that the method is not supposed to be there. Do I completely misunderstand that create :action block creates a new class, and I should be free to put instance methods to it? If not, how can I achieve what's in the code?
[2012-06-17 13:27:06 -0400] motiejus1: many thanks :)
[2012-06-17 13:29:40 -0400] motiejus1: makuk66: many thanks for the previous answer. I opted for the "no data bags" variant and it seems to be the right choice.
[2012-06-17 13:57:15 -0400] yfeldblum: motiejus1, use `notifies` or `subscribes`
[2012-06-17 13:57:33 -0400] motiejus1: hmm
[2012-06-17 13:57:52 -0400] motiejus1: thanks for hint, reading about it.
[2012-06-17 13:58:05 -0400] yfeldblum: motiejus1, actions are instance methods
[2012-06-17 13:58:25 -0400] yfeldblum: motiejus1, in lightweight providers, chef creates a class for you and then executes your lightweight provider file in the context of that class
[2012-06-17 13:59:17 -0400] motiejus1: so provider/pair.rb creates a class out of the file contents?
[2012-06-17 13:59:21 -0400] motiejus1: in my case
[2012-06-17 14:00:14 -0400] motiejus1: in that case.. I should put the method "cstate(what)" above the action :bootstrap statement?
[2012-06-17 14:00:22 -0400] yfeldblum: motiejus1, no, chef creates a class; subsequently, chef does provider_class.module_eval(File.read(provider_file))
[2012-06-17 14:01:53 -0400] motiejus1: mhm
[2012-06-17 14:02:29 -0400] yfeldblum: also your provider looks like it would be more suited to being a definition rather than a resource/provider ... you're asking questions of the node, you're performing searches, you're not taking actions in the provider action but merely expanding into new resources, etc
[2012-06-17 14:05:08 -0400] motiejus1: hmm, I don't get it. my current provider would be better off being a definition? could you elaborate on that?
[2012-06-17 14:08:16 -0400] motiejus1: definition of definition is very high level in opscode wiki and.. I don't really understand the "when to use definitions" part
[2012-06-17 14:10:14 -0400] motiejus1: * You are repeating a pattern of resources <=== yeah.. we are doing the same thing in providers
[2012-06-17 14:10:14 -0400] motiejus1: * You do not want to send actions directly to this resource - i.e., you never need to notify it <=== no clue what this one means
[2012-06-17 14:10:14 -0400] motiejus1: * You want to pass data from various recipes to one definition, to update  your /etc/aliases, /etc/sudoers, or something similar, with entries from  multiple recipes in a single chef run. <==== makes more sense, but I would assume a good definition would be "lvm" and "drbd" integration.
[2012-06-17 14:11:16 -0400] motiejus1: yfeldblum: could you point me to a well-written cookbook, that does something similar what I am trying to achieve, and properly (in terms of data manipulation and stuff hierarchy)?
[2012-06-17 14:11:48 -0400] motiejus1: i.e. "similar" can be totally different. The point is, to configure some kind of resource on the system which needs some data and to execute some commands
[2012-06-17 14:11:50 -0400] yfeldblum: motiejus1, the definitions wiki page is rather an unfortunate mess
[2012-06-17 14:13:43 -0400] yfeldblum: motiejus1, i'm just saying it seems you're using lightweight providers as though they were definitions instead of providers, because in the provider actions, you're inspecting the node, you're doing searches, and you're not actually taking any action against the system (merely declaring more resources); all of that is what definitions do
[2012-06-17 14:15:21 -0400] yfeldblum: motiejus1, this is an example provider included in chef: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/provider/user/useradd.rb
[2012-06-17 14:15:53 -0400] yfeldblum: motiejus1, and here is an example definition https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/apache2/blob/master/definitions/apache_site.rb
[2012-06-17 14:31:36 -0400] motiejus: yfeldblum: ok. thanks, I seem to get it now.
[2012-06-17 15:02:50 -0400] motiejus: If I add this line to my provider (soon will be moved to definition, but whatever):
[2012-06-17 15:02:50 -0400] motiejus: notifies :restart, resources(:service => "drbd"), :immediate
[2012-06-17 15:02:50 -0400] motiejus: I get this error message:
[2012-06-17 15:02:51 -0400] motiejus: drbd[setup global configuration] (drbd::default line 27) had an error: NameError: Cannot find a resource for resources on debian version 6.0.5
[2012-06-17 15:05:58 -0400] yfeldblum: what happens if it's a definition instead of a resource & provider?
[2012-06-17 23:03:11 -0400] tightwork: I have; notifies :write, "log[Process Complete]"  in a template block, but I get ResourceNotFound in resource template, template is configured to notify resource log with action write, but log cannot be found in the resource collection. ? I could have swore this code has worked in the past...
[2012-06-17 23:03:38 -0400] erikh: you need to define the log resource before you hit the notify
[2012-06-17 23:03:53 -0400] erikh: e.g., log("Process Complete") { action :nothing }
[2012-06-17 23:04:14 -0400] erikh: then your resources with your notifies
[2012-06-17 23:06:31 -0400] tightwork: ah I see.. I believe I have that just I changed the notify to say something else other than the resource
[2012-06-17 23:07:05 -0400] yfeldblum: erikh, generally right, although he can define the resources in either order (the log before the template or the template before the log, since he is using the string query format which prompts a delayed lookup at the point in time the notification is performed)
[2012-06-17 23:07:29 -0400] erikh: the short reply to that is "it depends"
[2012-06-17 23:07:35 -0400] erikh: especially if you're running in the compile phase.
[2012-06-17 23:07:50 -0400] tightwork: seems more logical to deifine the resource first
[2012-06-17 23:08:16 -0400] yfeldblum: tightwork, you can only notify a resource instance that the run-context's resource-collection knows about, and resources are identified by kind and name, so the resource "log[Process Complete]" is a query for a very specific thing: the resource in the run-context's resource-collection whose type is "log" and whose name is "Process Complete"
[2012-06-17 23:08:23 -0400] yfeldblum: erikh, right
[2012-06-17 23:08:36 -0400] yfeldblum: tightwork, there are two resources in play, not one
[2012-06-17 23:09:17 -0400] tightwork: the log and the notifies?
[2012-06-17 23:09:17 -0400] yfeldblum: erikh, generally, though, i assume people don't do silly things like resource actions during the compile phase :P
[2012-06-17 23:09:47 -0400] erikh: sometimes it's necessary.
[2012-06-17 23:10:02 -0400] erikh: if you're doing complicated providers with embedded resources it can get pretty gory.
[2012-06-17 23:10:03 -0400] yfeldblum: tightwork, no, as i said, the two resources are: 1) the resource with type "log" and name "Process Complete", and 2) the resource of type "template" with some name that you didn't mention
[2012-06-17 23:10:17 -0400] yfeldblum: erikh, look up Chef::Provider#recipe_eval, and think again
[2012-06-17 23:10:39 -0400] yfeldblum: erikh, and then check out this gist: https://gist.github.com/d85be145f3ff824ccc07
[2012-06-17 23:11:06 -0400] tightwork: ah log and template
[2012-06-17 23:11:19 -0400] erikh: that's a lot more complicated than my solution.
[2012-06-17 23:11:30 -0400] yfeldblum: erikh, which is?
[2012-06-17 23:11:48 -0400] erikh: your gist.
[2012-06-17 23:11:51 -0400] erikh: pretty much all of it.
[2012-06-17 23:12:00 -0400] yfeldblum: erikh, what's your solution?
[2012-06-17 23:12:40 -0400] erikh: resource.run_action(:foo)
[2012-06-17 23:12:42 -0400] yfeldblum: erikh, my gist is not complicated, but then again i'm a programmer; my gist is also what should be provided in chef itself and shouldn't have to be done by hand
[2012-06-17 23:12:48 -0400] erikh: I'm also a programmer.
[2012-06-17 23:13:03 -0400] erikh: I just don't like overblown solutions that seemingly solve no problems for me.
[2012-06-17 23:14:26 -0400] tightwork: bloat and cruft drives makes me sad
[2012-06-17 23:14:39 -0400] tightwork: lol wow
[2012-06-17 23:14:59 -0400] yfeldblum: erikh, do your providers mark the resources as updated exactly when the resources are indeed updated?
[2012-06-17 23:15:15 -0400] tightwork: Freud says drives me crazy as well
[2012-06-17 23:15:21 -0400] yfeldblum: erikh, that's the point of that gist
[2012-06-17 23:16:16 -0400] yfeldblum: erikh, that, and also to allow simple recipe-like code inside a block, with just some surrounding lines that make it all work nicely, and not do things like manual run_action calls in-line
[2012-06-17 23:17:13 -0400] yfeldblum: erikh, as in, all those run_action calls are extracted out to some surrounding boilerplate and you're left with a clean implementation inside
[2012-06-17 23:18:13 -0400] yfeldblum: erikh, that surrounding boilerplate can easily be done in e.g. a library method; you don't need to do it in every action
[2012-06-17 23:23:04 -0400] erikh: I disagree, but that's fine.
[2012-06-17 23:47:35 -0400] williamherry: all knife command fail with Error: internal server error
[2012-06-17 23:47:48 -0400] williamherry: Response: Connection failed - user: chef
[2012-06-17 23:48:47 -0400] williamherry: it worked before, I didn't do any thing, now it refuse to work, all server are up and running
