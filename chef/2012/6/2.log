[2012-06-02 00:09:23 -0400] macros: So in ruby 1.9 an array of node objects is not sortable
[2012-06-02 00:09:35 -0400] macros: Chef::Node is no longer comparable
[2012-06-02 00:09:40 -0400] macros: hosts = search(:node, "*:*").sort
[2012-06-02 00:10:02 -0400] macros: Works in 1.8.7 and fails with omnibus
[2012-06-02 00:24:38 -0400] yfeldblum: macros, fails how?
[2012-06-02 00:24:51 -0400] hoover_damm: ArgumentError: comparison of Chef::Node with Chef::Node failed
[2012-06-02 00:24:57 -0400] hoover_damm: what he said was fine
[2012-06-02 00:25:46 -0400] hoover_damm: macros, I don't understand why your sorting them but i'd suggest to change that behavior basically
[2012-06-02 00:26:07 -0400] macros: If you don't sort the order changes and the file is updated every run
[2012-06-02 00:26:13 -0400] macros: I sort every search result
[2012-06-02 00:26:31 -0400] yfeldblum: macros, anyway you would typically want to specify the sort order specifically: `hosts = search(:node, "*:*").sort_by(&:name)`
[2012-06-02 00:26:58 -0400] yfeldblum: or `hosts = search(:node, "*:*") ; hosts.sort_by!(&:name)`
[2012-06-02 00:27:27 -0400] yfeldblum: macros, because the way you were sorting it was just as bad, because you had no idea what you were sorting it *by*
[2012-06-02 00:28:54 -0400] macros: In 1.8.7 it sorted on id
[2012-06-02 00:29:44 -0400] hoover_damm: sort by id?
[2012-06-02 00:29:45 -0400] yfeldblum: macros, in the particular version of 1.8.7 you were using
[2012-06-02 00:29:58 -0400] hoover_damm: p249
[2012-06-02 00:30:02 -0400] macros: ubuntu 10.04 system ruby
[2012-06-02 00:30:14 -0400] hoover_damm: sorry to answer for macros but /me advised him to install omnibus
[2012-06-02 00:30:24 -0400] hoover_damm: the chef handler was ooming him
[2012-06-02 00:30:30 -0400] hoover_damm: err exception handler
[2012-06-02 00:30:44 -0400] macros: The to_json_pretty in the error_report
[2012-06-02 00:30:53 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-06-02 00:30:57 -0400] hoover_damm: 150k objects
[2012-06-02 00:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-06-02 00:31:14 -0400] hoover_damm: tmm1 had a pretty good writeup on how bad json was
[2012-06-02 00:31:23 -0400] hoover_damm: he also had a nice writeup on bad the mysql gem was too
[2012-06-02 00:31:39 -0400] hoover_damm: c extensions can make it much harder to debug and create :)
[2012-06-02 00:35:36 -0400] hoover_damm: macros, what version of the json gem did you have on 1.8.7?
[2012-06-02 00:36:31 -0400] macros: 1.7.3
[2012-06-02 00:37:15 -0400] hoover_damm: how is it running with 1.7.3?
[2012-06-02 00:37:22 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/chef.gemspec#L25
[2012-06-02 00:37:32 -0400] hoover_damm: chef has always tried to keep it between 1.4.4 and 1.6.1
[2012-06-02 00:37:44 -0400] hoover_damm: pick a spot like 1.6.1 and try it
[2012-06-02 00:40:30 -0400] hoover_damm: and this is entirely why Chef has tried to keep it here.  the json gem can be fun!
[2012-06-02 00:40:42 -0400] macros: I think I'm just going to fix up all the search instances and make the move to omnibus
[2012-06-02 00:40:51 -0400] hoover_damm: I would
[2012-06-02 00:40:58 -0400] hoover_damm: moving to 1.9.3 would be the best actually
[2012-06-02 00:41:05 -0400] hoover_damm: with all the load patches in there
[2012-06-02 00:41:34 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/damm/omnibus/tree/CHEF-2871
[2012-06-02 00:41:38 -0400] macros: Already on 0.10.10 everywhere
[2012-06-02 00:41:39 -0400] hoover_damm: 1.9.3 p193 with psyck
[2012-06-02 00:41:52 -0400] hoover_damm: and syck and all that blah
[2012-06-02 00:41:56 -0400] hoover_damm: *gargle*
[2012-06-02 01:17:51 -0400] yfeldblum: psych
[2012-06-02 01:52:22 -0400] hoover_damm: we need another yaml change, a json change... and let's start using hashes a different way
[2012-06-02 01:52:25 -0400] hoover_damm: starting tomorrow
[2012-06-02 01:58:04 -0400] yfeldblum: start storing values in the keys and keys in the values
[2012-06-02 02:07:47 -0400] nutron: Disclosure: I haven't googled.  Can some of you suggest a crash-course quick start document for chef?  I want to start implementing it but only have a small amount of limited time to do so.  =/
[2012-06-02 02:09:27 -0400] yfeldblum: nutron, yes, practice on the small scale with small requirements
[2012-06-02 02:10:00 -0400] yfeldblum: nutron, get ntp installed and running on all servers automatically
[2012-06-02 02:10:21 -0400] nutron: ok, I want to distribute /etc/anacrontab to 50 workstations.  Where can I go to read how to do this?
[2012-06-02 02:10:27 -0400] nutron: Aye have ntp running already
[2012-06-02 02:10:55 -0400] nutron: and each workstation is synced to the internal ntp server
[2012-06-02 02:13:33 -0400] yfeldblum: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Guide+to+Creating+A+Cookbook+and+Writing+A+Recipe
[2012-06-02 02:14:13 -0400] nutron: yfeldblum: thank you!
[2012-06-02 02:42:35 -0400] macros: I upgraded our staging environment and fixed up cookbooks
[2012-06-02 02:42:55 -0400] macros: chef-runs finish about 25% faster, memory use in half, no explosion on exception
[2012-06-02 02:44:19 -0400] macros: So omnibus is quite a win over 1.8.7
[2012-06-02 03:26:10 -0400] hoover_damm: yay
[2012-06-02 03:38:49 -0400] dagus: I'm trying to deploy using the application cookbook. I've got a deploy_key specified in the recipe. They key has no passphrase, but every time I run chef-client it asks for a passphrase and then dies with Permission denied.
[2012-06-02 03:39:04 -0400] dagus: Also spits out  Could not create directory '/nonexistent/.ssh'.
[2012-06-02 04:44:26 -0400] dagus: Is there a way to use a sub directory of a repo when deploying? In SVN this is trivial, but git does not allow for fetching sub directories
[2012-06-02 04:44:48 -0400] knuckolls: just deploy the whole repo and link to the folder you're interested in
[2012-06-02 04:44:56 -0400] knuckolls: that's what i've done in the past
[2012-06-02 04:46:02 -0400] dagus: is that something that the application supports or did you hardcode the path?
[2012-06-02 04:46:04 -0400] dagus: hardcode
[2012-06-02 05:29:57 -0400] knuckolls: dagus: just use the link resource
[2012-06-02 05:53:50 -0400] scanf: is there a good cookbook for LAMP+wordpress somewhere?
[2012-06-02 06:02:32 -0400] vegardx: Combine opscode apache + mysql and write your own for wordpress? Should be really easy.
[2012-06-02 15:56:49 -0400] motiejus: I am (ab)using chef-client -o <runlist>. Is there a similar way to set an attribute from command line?
[2012-06-02 15:57:15 -0400] motiejus: I want to re-write parts of chef-client cookbook not to start automatically once it's installed, depending on environment variable
[2012-06-02 15:59:24 -0400] motiejus: (I posted a use case for it 1 hour ago to mailing list, I`m bootstrapping chef from within xen-tools)
[2012-06-02 16:33:07 -0400] till__: i am trying to call multiple 'goals' on my provider.. action :foo, :bar - but i keep running into an argument error (2 for 1). so i am guessing my LWPR is not aware that it supports multiple arguments to action, anyone have a pointer how to fix this?
[2012-06-02 16:46:28 -0400] kallistec: till__: you have to wrap them in an array: `action [:foo, :bar]`
[2012-06-02 16:46:44 -0400] kallistec: seems kinda silly that you have to do that
[2012-06-02 16:46:55 -0400] kallistec: feel free to file a bug for it
[2012-06-02 16:47:03 -0400] kallistec: would be easy to fix, too
[2012-06-02 16:47:56 -0400] till__: ooh
[2012-06-02 16:48:01 -0400] till__: i didn't think of that
[2012-06-02 16:48:11 -0400] kallistec: yeah, it's not super intuitive
[2012-06-02 16:49:05 -0400] till__: works though!
[2012-06-02 16:49:16 -0400] till__: one last thing, i am using a script resource
[2012-06-02 16:49:20 -0400] till__: not sure if that is the best way
[2012-06-02 16:49:27 -0400] till__: maybe i should replace it with shellout
[2012-06-02 16:49:41 -0400] till__: but anyway, i was wondering if there is a way to pass a ruby var into the script block
[2012-06-02 16:50:56 -0400] kallistec: using resources inside a LWRP can behave in a slightly surprising way for notifications and such
[2012-06-02 16:51:18 -0400] kallistec: Chef actually inserts them into the resource collection after the LWRP
[2012-06-02 16:51:29 -0400] kallistec: you can work around that using run_action
[2012-06-02 16:51:38 -0400] kallistec: or, just use ShellOut
[2012-06-02 16:52:10 -0400] kallistec: as for "passing a variable in", what is it you need to do?
[2012-06-02 16:52:47 -0400] kallistec: does simple string interpolation work? e.g., x = "foo"; y = "#{x} bar" ?
[2012-06-02 16:52:51 -0400] till__: hmm, ShellOut looks a lot easier
[2012-06-02 16:52:55 -0400] till__: yeah, that does
[2012-06-02 16:52:56 -0400] kallistec: or you need something more complicated?
[2012-06-02 16:53:01 -0400] till__: but ShellOut makes it a lot, lot easier
[2012-06-02 16:55:20 -0400] yfeldblum: kallistec, or recipe_eval
[2012-06-02 16:56:01 -0400] yfeldblum: kallistec, action(:create) { recipe_eval { file "/etc/asdf.conf" } }
[2012-06-02 16:59:09 -0400] kallistec: yfeldblum: yeah, that works, too. but still makes notifications tricky :/
[2012-06-02 16:59:48 -0400] kallistec: I need to make a prototype of my idea for resource groups sometime
[2012-06-02 17:00:25 -0400] kallistec: where part of the idea is that the group would know if any resources within it were updated
[2012-06-02 17:00:53 -0400] kallistec: and could trigger notifications on other resources or groups after the group executed
[2012-06-02 17:01:19 -0400] yfeldblum: kallistec, yes, a very slightly changed recipe_eval is needed, which returns the child run-context, so that the provider can iterate the child run-context's resource-collection, ask each one if it was updated_by_last_action?, and if any was, set new_resource.updated_by_last_action(true)
[2012-06-02 17:01:45 -0400] kallistec: yfeldblum: what does it return now?
[2012-06-02 17:01:56 -0400] kallistec: I wrote that method but I forget ;)
[2012-06-02 17:01:59 -0400] yfeldblum: kallistec, the parent run-context
[2012-06-02 17:02:04 -0400] kallistec: hrm
[2012-06-02 17:02:07 -0400] yfeldblum: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/provider.rb#L78
[2012-06-02 17:02:31 -0400] kallistec: does anything use the return value?
[2012-06-02 17:03:09 -0400] yfeldblum: this should be the way to use it: `action(:create) { child = recipe_eval { resource1 ; resource2 } ; new_resource.updated_by_last_action(true) if child.resources.any?(&:updated_by_last_action?) }
[2012-06-02 17:04:22 -0400] yfeldblum: kallistec, i wouldn't necessarily say to make that automatic because that may have the negative effect of limiting the ways to use recipe_eval
[2012-06-02 17:04:43 -0400] kallistec: I'd encapsulate some of that logic in new methods, but that seems like a good idea
[2012-06-02 17:05:04 -0400] yfeldblum: kallistec, i'd wait and see how people use it
[2012-06-02 17:05:35 -0400] yfeldblum: kallistec, just recipe_eval needs to be changed to return the child run-context, and it would be able to help providers listen for child-resource changes
[2012-06-02 17:05:53 -0400] kallistec: it couldn't hurt to, say, add RunContext#any_resource_updated?
[2012-06-02 17:06:39 -0400] yfeldblum: kallistec, sure, a very simple shorthand like that would be nice ... just be clear what's API and what's implementation ...
[2012-06-02 17:06:57 -0400] till__: http://rubydoc.info/gems/chef/0.10.4/Chef/ShellOut
[2012-06-02 17:06:59 -0400] yfeldblum: kallistec, i'd recommend documenting API methods with # @api or something
[2012-06-02 17:07:01 -0400] till__: i am followng this example
[2012-06-02 17:07:02 -0400] kallistec: yfeldblum: yeah, I know what you're saying. If nothing that uses recipe_eval now, we could merge a patch for it
[2012-06-02 17:07:15 -0400] till__: but keep hitting 'can't convert String into Hash'
[2012-06-02 17:07:36 -0400] kallistec: re: API vs. Implementation, yeah, we need to make those boundaries more clear
[2012-06-02 17:08:37 -0400] kallistec: erm, if nothing that uses recipe_eval depends on the return, we could accept a patch that changes the return
[2012-06-02 17:11:11 -0400] kallistec: till__: gist your code?
[2012-06-02 17:17:44 -0400] till__: kallistec: i think :env wanted a hash
[2012-06-02 17:17:48 -0400] till__: that works
[2012-06-02 17:17:51 -0400] till__: almost there =)
[2012-06-02 17:41:36 -0400] yfeldblum: till__, yes, env always wants a Hash :P
[2012-06-02 17:42:08 -0400] till__: when i need certain executables inside my LWPR, like git, subversion, unzip, etc.
[2012-06-02 17:42:13 -0400] till__: should i install these as well
[2012-06-02 17:42:20 -0400] till__: or should i test for them and fail accordingly?
[2012-06-02 17:42:25 -0400] till__: is there a best practice?
[2012-06-02 17:44:40 -0400] yfeldblum: till__, you should require that they are available by the time your LWP executes, but *not* install them in the LWP
[2012-06-02 17:45:22 -0400] yfeldblum: till__, provide a recipe alongside the LWP whose sole job is to install these packages, but do *not* require that this recipe actually be run; make it available only as a convenience, and as documentation for the requirements of the LWP
[2012-06-02 17:45:39 -0400] yfeldblum: anybody using librarian-chef - think this would be useful? https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian/issues/78
[2012-06-02 17:45:45 -0400] yfeldblum: latez
[2012-06-02 17:50:30 -0400] till__: yfeldblum: makes sense, thanks
[2012-06-02 17:51:20 -0400] till__: when i, foo do action [ :step1, :step2 ] end - is the order of the steps save? i read somewhere that pre 1.9 there is no order in arrays
[2012-06-02 17:52:22 -0400] till__: i am guessing it's not
[2012-06-02 17:54:19 -0400] till__: there is a lot i don't understand about a ruby, e.g. why or how my 'find_php' method cannot return an exception (which it does when '@php_bin' is empty), but in the next step, @php_bin doesn't seem to have any value at all.
[2012-06-02 17:54:58 -0400] kallistec: till__: arrays are always ordered, it's hashes that don't preserve order before 1.9
[2012-06-02 17:57:47 -0400] till__: kallistec: https://github.com/till/easybib-cookbooks/blob/master/vagrant-test/recipes/default.rb
[2012-06-02 17:57:57 -0400] till__: :install runs first, :setup runs second
[2012-06-02 18:00:07 -0400] till__: and when 'setup' runs, it doesn't find php anymore and the @php_bin is empty all of a sudden
[2012-06-02 18:00:10 -0400] till__: https://github.com/till/easybib-cookbooks/blob/master/php/providers/composer.rb#L52-L58
[2012-06-02 19:08:02 -0400] till__: kallistec: just as a rule of thumb - once i do ShellExec, i probably cannot mix that with resources in chef, right?
[2012-06-02 19:10:02 -0400] kallistec: till__: you can, but it's potentially confusing--you have to keep in mind what I said above about inline resources being executed *after* your LWRP resource
[2012-06-02 19:10:17 -0400] hoover_damm: till__, @php_bin is empty because it's defined in another definition
[2012-06-02 19:10:25 -0400] hoover_damm: off the top of  my head is the wild guess as to why
[2012-06-02 19:10:34 -0400] hoover_damm: till__, it's public but you may need a $ (global)
[2012-06-02 19:12:21 -0400] kallistec: till__: so if you have resource_a; shell_out("command") ; resource_b, you'll end up with things getting executed as shell_out, resource_a, resource_b
[2012-06-02 19:28:05 -0400] thedeeno: can I set attributes from within my recipes? I'd like my default.rb recipe to leverage some variables to setup the node's attributes before the chef-run.
[2012-06-02 19:29:03 -0400] kallistec: thedeeno: that's best done in your default attributes file, unless there is a good reason not to
[2012-06-02 19:32:09 -0400] thedeeno: kallistec: hmm, well how would you handle this case: I'm using a cookbook which installs ruby for a given user. This same user will also run an app. Right now, I set this user's name in the two places in my role's default_attribute. I now need to do this in a third place.
[2012-06-02 19:32:37 -0400] thedeeno: I'd much rather set the name for this user in one place and then reference this attributes, but because I'm using different cookbooks I don't have total control
[2012-06-02 19:32:45 -0400] thedeeno: (new to chef so maybe I'm missing a feature)
[2012-06-02 19:33:49 -0400] thedeeno: I figured setting it in the recipe would let me do this, but was worried that this breaks convention (which it seems like it does)
[2012-06-02 19:35:19 -0400] kallistec: thedeeno: first things first, you can't count on the order for attributes files being processed, but you can force one to load before another using `include_attribute` in your attributes file
[2012-06-02 19:36:16 -0400] kallistec: so your custom cookbook can set the value of default[:my_stuff][:user] = node[:other_cookbook][:user]
[2012-06-02 19:37:51 -0400] thedeeno: but doing `default[:my_stuff] = 'something'` isn't recommended but possible?
[2012-06-02 19:39:35 -0400] kallistec: thedeeno: so to be clear, all of what I was saying works in your attributes file
[2012-06-02 19:40:06 -0400] thedeeno: oh! so I can actually set atrtibutes = to each other in the attribute file?
[2012-06-02 19:40:14 -0400] kallistec: anyway, you can, if you want, just put `default[:my_stuff][:user] = "bob"` in your attributes file
[2012-06-02 19:40:35 -0400] kallistec: but yes, you can calculate attributes from other attributes in your attributes file
[2012-06-02 19:41:09 -0400] thedeeno: now what about setting attributes from within recipes? Will I have a bad time?
[2012-06-02 19:41:17 -0400] kallistec: just make sure you use an `include_attribute("cookbook_name::attribute_file_name")
[2012-06-02 19:41:59 -0400] kallistec: thedeeno: well, you'll break people's expectations about where to look to see what attributes are available, and how they're set
[2012-06-02 19:42:49 -0400] kallistec: so when you go to change something in your cookbook in several months, and you wonder where a certain attribute is getting its value... you may have a bad time
[2012-06-02 19:44:17 -0400] thedeeno: kallistec: gotcha. Yeah that makes sense. Just using a calculated attribute totally solves my problem anyways. Thank you much
[2012-06-02 19:44:40 -0400] kallistec: np
[2012-06-02 19:45:53 -0400] thedeeno: kallistec: hmm, can I use calculated attributes in role definitions?
[2012-06-02 19:47:03 -0400] kallistec: thedeeno: you can't do it there, because your roles get compiled to static json before they're uploaded to the server
[2012-06-02 19:47:39 -0400] kallistec: if you're using chef-solo, you can use the ruby files for roles directly, but they won't have access to the node data
[2012-06-02 19:49:36 -0400] kallistec: which does bring up an important point: attributes from roles are applied after the attributes files are read
[2012-06-02 19:50:48 -0400] thedeeno: ok, so if I want to override the default attributes of another cookbook, I can do it in my custom cookbook's default_attributes. But if I define them in my role they'll get overridden further.
[2012-06-02 19:50:57 -0400] kallistec: so if you need a calculated value which will respect attributes from roles (instead of just setting a default) you might want to just use a local variable in your recipe
[2012-06-02 19:51:08 -0400] kallistec: or use the attribute from the other cookbook directly
[2012-06-02 19:51:41 -0400] thedeeno: am I right with the above?
[2012-06-02 19:51:45 -0400] kallistec: that is, when you have `default[:my_stuff] = node[:other_stuff]` in your attributes file
[2012-06-02 19:52:33 -0400] thedeeno: awesome, I get it now. Makes much more sense to me
[2012-06-02 19:52:34 -0400] kallistec: and you have a role that sets "other_stuff" to a new value, "my_stuff" will not be changed
[2012-06-02 19:52:55 -0400] thedeeno: right
[2012-06-02 19:55:10 -0400] miah: hi
[2012-06-02 19:55:18 -0400] miah: sup kallistec
[2012-06-02 19:56:07 -0400] kallistec: miah: ohai!
[2012-06-02 20:31:15 -0400] countdigi: anyone using chef-solo and simulating the "server knows all" functionality? just curious
[2012-06-02 20:31:38 -0400] countdigi: just starting out and i like the idea of vagrant/chef-solo to keep things simple
[2012-06-02 20:38:21 -0400] benr: how do you mean "server knows all"?
[2012-06-02 20:38:30 -0400] benr: I do all kinds of stuff with chef-solo
[2012-06-02 20:41:49 -0400] countdigi: hehe - i mean i can query attributes of another node from a node (classic example nagios server adding new config for newly added client)
[2012-06-02 20:42:08 -0400] countdigi: i know that wasnt a very clear description
[2012-06-02 20:43:20 -0400] benr: for that you'd want to use the search functionality which is uniquely provided by Chef Server.
[2012-06-02 20:43:31 -0400] countdigi: gotcha
[2012-06-02 20:44:21 -0400] benr: you could, of course, hack in something via traditional polling techniques, or add a script via chef-solo that reported itself
[2012-06-02 20:44:51 -0400] countdigi: yeah - i guess the good thing is u are under the glass in ruby so u can always hack a shim
[2012-06-02 20:44:57 -0400] countdigi: like that vs puppet a lot
[2012-06-02 20:45:06 -0400] countdigi: i know they have the dsl but its that extra layer
[2012-06-02 20:45:18 -0400] countdigi: above the glass
[2012-06-02 20:45:44 -0400] nphase: anyone have any experience with this chef PHP client? https://github.com/sazze/phpChef/blob/master/Chef.php
[2012-06-02 20:46:02 -0400] nphase: I'm having trouble/getting this error: Invalid signature for user or client 'nphase'
[2012-06-02 20:48:46 -0400] benr: countdigi: the other option is to look for services that wouldn't require it.  I use Zabbix because it has an auto-registration capability, which avoids having to do some of the trickery required with automating addition of Nagios clients.
[2012-06-02 20:48:52 -0400] countdigi: man trying to wrap my head around tdd w/ vagrant/chef - checking out cuken but im trying to do it at an rspec level first
[2012-06-02 20:51:06 -0400] countdigi: yeah i like and dislike that approach (but kudos that zabbix supports that)
[2012-06-02 20:51:34 -0400] countdigi: i am in a non-traditional environment - health care w/ aix and linux for infrastrucutre/research
[2012-06-02 20:53:00 -0400] countdigi: so i want to keep things static initially
[2012-06-02 21:23:13 -0400] upayavira: I'm finding knife ec2 server create is not honouring the security group, -G option (chef 0.10.10), anyone seen that. Anything I might be missing?
[2012-06-02 22:49:03 -0400] kallistec: upayavira: do you have default ec2 stuff configured in your knife.rb?
[2012-06-02 22:50:13 -0400] kallistec: there's a known issue where Chef::Config doesn't deep merge, and this can cause options on the command line to not be honored
[2012-06-02 22:50:28 -0400] hoover_damm: orly
[2012-06-02 22:51:10 -0400] kallistec: hoover_damm: yeah, but only for the cloudy stuff where the config value is a hash
[2012-06-02 22:51:24 -0400] kallistec: for top-level keys on Chef::Config it works fine
[2012-06-02 22:55:11 -0400] upayavira: kallistec: I have secret key/etc there, but nothing else. knife is creating hosts wonderfully, just not putting them in the right security group
[2012-06-02 22:55:25 -0400] hoover_damm: hrm, that's strange
[2012-06-02 22:55:31 -0400] hoover_damm: that works for me
[2012-06-02 22:55:39 -0400] upayavira: 0.10.10?
[2012-06-02 22:55:48 -0400] hoover_damm: yup
[2012-06-02 22:55:53 -0400] z: btm: Any word on when those OSX builds for 10.12 (rc) will hit S3?
[2012-06-02 22:55:55 -0400] upayavira: For now just putting my rules into default security group and making do.
[2012-06-02 22:56:23 -0400] hoover_damm: upayavira, I also don't use knife ec2 server create often.
[2012-06-02 22:56:29 -0400] hoover_damm: upayavira, I tend to just ec2-run and then bootstrap
[2012-06-02 22:57:30 -0400] upayavira: fair enough. This is first time for a long time (chance to impress some new colleagues: run knife ec2 server create, then tell them here's a VM with our entire stack on it for you to play with, for 15 people :-) )
[2012-06-02 22:58:09 -0400] upayavira: While I've got your attention - do you know how to shut up apt-get, when it asks config questions? e.g. postfix asks whether I'm wanting a satellite system or a relay, or an internet connected one
[2012-06-02 22:58:43 -0400] upayavira: but that breaks the bootstrap process, apt-get returns 100
[2012-06-02 22:59:30 -0400] hoover_damm: upayavira, this is where you need to 'preseed' answers to Debian
[2012-06-02 23:00:03 -0400] hoover_damm: this gist might explain preseeding best https://gist.github.com/1052428
[2012-06-02 23:00:27 -0400] hoover_damm: so you'll want to create a file called /var/cache/local/preseeding/postfix.seed with the answers to those questions
[2012-06-02 23:00:51 -0400] hoover_damm: drop the file, set them... then install the package
[2012-06-02 23:02:19 -0400] upayavira: wonderful. do you have a sample of the seed file?
[2012-06-02 23:02:22 -0400] hoover_damm: upayavira, https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/postfix should already handle the preseeding
[2012-06-02 23:02:23 -0400] kallistec: upayavira: see also: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql/blob/master/recipes/server.rb
[2012-06-02 23:02:33 -0400] upayavira: ahh, I'll go look at that, thx
[2012-06-02 23:02:47 -0400] upayavira: all v useful, many thanks
[2012-06-02 23:03:04 -0400] hoover_damm: upayavira, http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed
[2012-06-02 23:03:22 -0400] hoover_damm: it's best covered by that page really.  Each package has it's own preseed options
[2012-06-02 23:03:28 -0400] hoover_damm: so you need to determine what you need to set
[2012-06-02 23:05:07 -0400] upayavira: all wonderful, thanks all, will review in the morning (in theory, I'm asleep already.)
