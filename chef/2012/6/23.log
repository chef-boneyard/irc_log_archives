[2012-06-23 00:10:27 -0400] jameson: timops: if I can't find my ORGANIZATION-validator node anymore on may manage console
[2012-06-23 00:10:30 -0400] jameson: should i be concerend?
[2012-06-23 00:10:38 -0400] jameson: $ knife node list
[2012-06-23 00:10:40 -0400] jameson: redis-master
[2012-06-23 00:10:42 -0400] jameson: :|
[2012-06-23 00:12:08 -0400] timops: well, you need that if you're going to register any new nodes with hosted chef
[2012-06-23 00:12:22 -0400] jameson: i just registered a new node... :|
[2012-06-23 00:12:26 -0400] timops: does it exist when you look under the client tab?
[2012-06-23 00:12:35 -0400] jameson: ah
[2012-06-23 00:12:40 -0400] jameson: it's over there
[2012-06-23 00:12:42 -0400] timops: knife client list
[2012-06-23 00:12:49 -0400] timops: it's a client, but not a node
[2012-06-23 00:13:05 -0400] jameson: for a minute there
[2012-06-23 00:13:09 -0400] jameson: I thought something weird was going on
[2012-06-23 00:13:21 -0400] timops: don't worry, you're alright :)
[2012-06-23 00:52:28 -0400] jameson: is there a mass-deploy script for knife ec2?
[2012-06-23 00:52:47 -0400] jameson: I see http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Knife+Exec
[2012-06-23 00:52:48 -0400] hoover_damm: mass-deploy?
[2012-06-23 00:52:53 -0400] jameson: has a delete server
[2012-06-23 00:52:56 -0400] hoover_damm: like run chef-client everywhere?
[2012-06-23 00:53:10 -0400] jameson: like knife ec2 a few instances
[2012-06-23 00:53:24 -0400] jameson: just use vagrant-ec2 ?
[2012-06-23 00:53:26 -0400] hoover_damm: prolly the better pattern would be to use cloudinit
[2012-06-23 00:53:33 -0400] hoover_damm: and have cloudinit setup chef
[2012-06-23 00:55:37 -0400] hoover_damm: http://allanfeid.com/content/using-amazons-cloudformation-cloud-init-chef-and-fog-automate-infrastructure http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/cloud-init/trunk/view/head:/doc/examples/cloud-config-chef.txt
[2012-06-23 00:55:47 -0400] hoover_damm: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/cloud-init/trunk/view/head:/doc/examples/cloud-config-chef.txt is just the example
[2012-06-23 00:57:30 -0400] hoover_damm: jameson, there's other methods of doing this that ironfan has produced for example.
[2012-06-23 00:57:59 -0400] hoover_damm: jameson, https://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan
[2012-06-23 01:01:03 -0400] jameson: knife-cluster ?
[2012-06-23 01:08:45 -0400] hoover_damm: that's ironfan
[2012-06-23 02:19:51 -0400] jameson: i wish knife-exec was easier to user ~_~
[2012-06-23 02:19:54 -0400] jameson: *use
[2012-06-23 02:21:44 -0400] hoover_damm: jameson, i fire up shef -z when I have to do that
[2012-06-23 02:22:58 -0400] jameson: I want to do this via knife-exec
[2012-06-23 02:23:23 -0400] jameson: to provision and add without leaving chef's code :(
[2012-06-23 02:27:17 -0400] hoover_damm: let's start with step by step in shef
[2012-06-23 02:27:25 -0400] hoover_damm: and once it works, you can move it into knife exec
[2012-06-23 02:27:29 -0400] hoover_damm: but as it's not working
[2012-06-23 02:27:48 -0400] jameson: well following the knife exec example to delete servers
[2012-06-23 02:27:54 -0400] jameson: to create servers via knife-exec
[2012-06-23 02:28:30 -0400] jameson: many servers being the point.
[2012-06-23 02:28:41 -0400] hoover_damm: cleaning up servers isn't easy nor straight forward
[2012-06-23 02:28:58 -0400] hoover_damm: if you do ec2, you have to terminate.  If they have extra EBS Volumes you end up either snapshotting and deleting
[2012-06-23 02:29:01 -0400] hoover_damm: or something else
[2012-06-23 02:29:16 -0400] hoover_damm: the whole provisioning lifecycle isn't very straight forward
[2012-06-23 02:29:43 -0400] jameson: knife ec2 server delete someServer is terminating servers though
[2012-06-23 02:29:55 -0400] hoover_damm: right but it doesn't touch ebs volumes
[2012-06-23 02:30:02 -0400] hoover_damm: knife ec2 is just a light provisionng tool
[2012-06-23 02:30:17 -0400] hoover_damm: knife ec2 server delete will terminate the server, but not delete the node nor client entry in the chef server
[2012-06-23 02:30:28 -0400] jameson: if you do --purge it's suppose to
[2012-06-23 02:30:36 -0400] jameson: or so it says
[2012-06-23 02:31:06 -0400] hoover_damm: oh cool, learn something new every day :)
[2012-06-23 02:31:25 -0400] hoover_damm: I always do that manually for a reason
[2012-06-23 02:31:34 -0400] jameson: you also have to give it the node-name
[2012-06-23 02:31:42 -0400] jameson: not the instance-id if you want to --purge
[2012-06-23 02:31:43 -0400] hoover_damm: then again our cycle of retiring is moving them to retirement
[2012-06-23 02:31:47 -0400] hoover_damm: and running a script to clean them up
[2012-06-23 02:31:51 -0400] hoover_damm: and delete the volumes
[2012-06-23 02:31:59 -0400] jameson: ..
[2012-06-23 02:32:06 -0400] hoover_damm: retirement chef_environment
[2012-06-23 02:32:08 -0400] jameson: i may have create multiple ebs volumes O_o?
[2012-06-23 02:32:20 -0400] hoover_damm: I have 16 ebs volumes on some boxes
[2012-06-23 02:32:25 -0400] hoover_damm: you might have 2
[2012-06-23 02:32:30 -0400] hoover_damm: and knife has nothing to do with ebs
[2012-06-23 02:32:40 -0400] hoover_damm: as I said simple provisioning tool
[2012-06-23 02:33:02 -0400] hoover_damm: aws cookbook could do more with EBS.  Depends on what it is :)
[2012-06-23 02:33:18 -0400] jameson: mm no ebs's
[2012-06-23 02:33:50 -0400] hoover_damm: basically don't be let down.  Realize that Chef is a framework to help you do your job and that some bits and pieces are lacking because they are still being worked on mainly.  But somethings are highly personal
[2012-06-23 02:33:54 -0400] hoover_damm: and exceptionally hard to generalize
[2012-06-23 02:34:13 -0400] jameson: I think this is going to be easier
[2012-06-23 02:34:15 -0400] jameson: if I do..
[2012-06-23 02:34:27 -0400] hoover_damm: so basically what you want is a pattern of booting up multiple instances
[2012-06-23 02:34:37 -0400] hoover_damm: I'd suggest user-data as net-ssh/multi waiting for them to comeup is boring
[2012-06-23 02:34:48 -0400] jameson: i'm gdoing
[2012-06-23 02:34:59 -0400] jameson: a dictionary with fields that maps to config
[2012-06-23 02:35:24 -0400] hoover_damm: but basically you'll need to boot up many, bootstrap many
[2012-06-23 02:35:32 -0400] jameson: that Chef::Knife::Ec2ServerCreate uses
[2012-06-23 02:35:36 -0400] hoover_damm: if you write a service around this it'll be easy
[2012-06-23 02:35:52 -0400] jameson: well..
[2012-06-23 02:35:58 -0400] jameson: i could also just write a shell script
[2012-06-23 02:36:02 -0400] jameson: that calls
[2012-06-23 02:36:14 -0400] jameson: knife ec2 server create ***
[2012-06-23 02:36:20 -0400] jameson: one after the other
[2012-06-23 02:37:56 -0400] hoover_damm: then you have created a technical debt that will need to be lifted once you need to create more at the same time
[2012-06-23 02:38:07 -0400] jameson: well, i just have a dict
[2012-06-23 02:38:09 -0400] hoover_damm: otherwise you could run into race conditions
[2012-06-23 02:38:13 -0400] jameson: that i call
[2012-06-23 02:38:15 -0400] hoover_damm: right :) remember we start small
[2012-06-23 02:38:26 -0400] hoover_damm: think about tomorrow not just today
[2012-06-23 02:38:46 -0400] jameson: I am just having a hard time hooking into the servercreate..
[2012-06-23 02:39:14 -0400] hoover_damm: So Stop.  Any reason why you arn't trying to just bootstrap?
[2012-06-23 02:39:16 -0400] jameson: because ServerCreate is different than ServerDelete :|
[2012-06-23 02:39:18 -0400] hoover_damm: and use something else to create?
[2012-06-23 02:39:33 -0400] hoover_damm: ec2-run-instances and once it's up have it do a knife bootstrap?
[2012-06-23 02:39:54 -0400] jameson: at this point
[2012-06-23 02:39:54 -0400] hoover_damm: I am only trying to give the many paths available.  Pardon that annoyance
[2012-06-23 02:39:58 -0400] jameson: I may just do that
[2012-06-23 02:40:07 -0400] jameson: I think I am just going to finish the shell
[2012-06-23 02:40:18 -0400] jameson: that launches all the instances with their roles
[2012-06-23 04:43:38 -0400] aruntomar: hi! i've added my first windows 7 client to chef. i'm trying to install git, but i'm getting the following error. https://gist.github.com/2976883. any ideas how to resolve it
[2012-06-23 04:56:55 -0400] hoover_damm: aruntomar, windows cookbook not depended?
[2012-06-23 04:57:37 -0400] aruntomar: hoover_damm: thanks :), just figured that out.
[2012-06-23 04:57:40 -0400] hoover_damm: aruntomar, windows_package is provided by the windows cookbook.  So it sounds like your cookbook needs to 'depend' on that.  http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Metadata
[2012-06-23 04:57:56 -0400] hoover_damm: damn and i just hit enter
[2012-06-23 04:57:57 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-06-23 04:58:02 -0400] aruntomar: hoover_damm, i'm using the git cookbook from the community site
[2012-06-23 05:00:13 -0400] aruntomar: any idea why we can't use powershell for running chef-client
[2012-06-23 05:01:27 -0400] hoover_damm: if it's linux and chef or mac and chef I can help... i'm good at google
[2012-06-23 05:01:34 -0400] hoover_damm: but at this point i'd be searching for you :(
[2012-06-23 05:01:55 -0400] hoover_damm: so hopefully someone else can help you :) also the mailing lists are darn good.
[2012-06-23 05:01:57 -0400] hoover_damm: bawt list?
[2012-06-23 05:01:57 -0400] bawt: list is at lists.opscode.com
[2012-06-23 08:49:54 -0400] coderanger: aruntomar: Or just try asking when more of NA-timezone folks are on :)
[2012-06-23 08:51:00 -0400] aruntomar: coderanger, sure.
[2012-06-23 15:49:23 -0400] pehlert: Hey, I recently added a files directory to my cookbook but it doesn't seem to get uploaded to the servers correctly. I even did a version bump but it didn't help.. Any ideas?
[2012-06-23 16:03:24 -0400] pehlert: It even has the files/ directory when I browse the cookbook online, but it doesn't update it in the server's cache
[2012-06-23 16:03:28 -0400] pehlert: Isn't that weird?
[2012-06-23 16:57:01 -0400] jameson: so best way to have a nagios::server reload configurations
[2012-06-23 16:57:16 -0400] jameson: would be to have it do run the chef-client recipe
[2012-06-23 16:57:31 -0400] jameson: so it reloads the node information periodically
[2012-06-23 17:53:18 -0400] hoover_damm: chef-client -i 1800
[2012-06-23 20:29:29 -0400] miah: guh. i has a hunger. also. its super pretty today in sf.
[2012-06-23 21:33:13 -0400] jespada: cookbook to install rebar anyone?
[2012-06-23 21:34:45 -0400] cheeseplus: jespada: I haven't seen one but let me check some repos
[2012-06-23 21:34:50 -0400] gyre007: does Ubuntu 12.04 support chef ?
[2012-06-23 21:34:58 -0400] gyre007: Im trying to install debconf package...
[2012-06-23 21:34:58 -0400] cheeseplus: gyre007: yes
[2012-06-23 21:35:19 -0400] gyre007: and Im getting Cannot find a a resource for debconf on ubuntu version 12.04
[2012-06-23 21:35:28 -0400] jespada: cheeseplus, cool thanks
[2012-06-23 21:35:36 -0400] gyre007: yet the package itself is available via apt
[2012-06-23 21:35:37 -0400] cheeseplus: jespada: we use erlang and rebar so I'd be surprised if we didn't have one
[2012-06-23 21:35:39 -0400] jespada: cheeseplus, if not I'll write one
[2012-06-23 21:35:56 -0400] cheeseplus: jespada: good call, I'd totally use that
[2012-06-23 21:40:33 -0400] cheeseplus: gyre007: how are you trying to install it?
[2012-06-23 21:40:46 -0400] gyre007: cheeseplus, arrgh I was missing double quotes...
[2012-06-23 21:40:59 -0400] cheeseplus: gyre007: ah, glad you fixed it ;)
[2012-06-23 21:41:38 -0400] gyre007: sometimes these little things slip my attention :(
[2012-06-23 21:42:48 -0400] gyre007: whoever invented Chef deserves a Nobel Prize I swear....so many minutes of my work saved!!! :)
[2012-06-23 21:51:11 -0400] cakehero: miah i too has a hunger
[2012-06-23 21:51:16 -0400] cakehero: it is also very pretty today in nyc
[2012-06-23 22:06:02 -0400] gyre007: why doesn't directory resource have a "parent" action which allows you to create the full path like mkdir -p ?
[2012-06-23 22:06:31 -0400] gyre007: or does it ?
[2012-06-23 22:06:34 -0400] gyre007: mmm
[2012-06-23 23:55:24 -0400] coderanger: it, indeed, does
[2012-06-23 23:56:18 -0400] miah: yar
[2012-06-23 23:56:24 -0400] miah: recursive option
[2012-06-23 23:56:45 -0400] coderanger: miah: What time is the shindig at pivotal starting tomorrow?
