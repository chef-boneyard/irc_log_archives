[2012-05-19 00:02:23 -0400] fujin: dstufft: a lot of the settings unfortunately can't be set in knife.rb
[2012-05-19 00:02:50 -0400] dstufft: fujin: ah :(
[2012-05-19 00:13:34 -0400] hoover_damm: fujin, wasn't ssh_user added?
[2012-05-19 00:13:53 -0400] hoover_damm: knife[:ssh_attribute] = "ec2.public_hostname"
[2012-05-19 00:13:55 -0400] hoover_damm: for example
[2012-05-19 00:15:31 -0400] hoover_damm: dstufft, yep knife[:ssh_user] should work in 0.10.10
[2012-05-19 00:15:59 -0400] dstufft: hrm it didn't seem to, let me double check
[2012-05-19 00:16:35 -0400] dstufft: hrm
[2012-05-19 00:16:38 -0400] dstufft: gues sI typed it wrong before
[2012-05-19 00:16:40 -0400] dstufft: thanks :)
[2012-05-19 00:20:24 -0400] kallen: how could i find out which methods i can use against node.roles or node.run_list ?
[2012-05-19 00:20:34 -0400] kallen: can that be grabbed in irb somehow?
[2012-05-19 00:21:00 -0400] kallen: i do now i can use node.run_list.remove. i'm trying to "add", but "add" barfed at me - NoMethodError
[2012-05-19 00:21:08 -0400] kallen: s/ now/know/
[2012-05-19 00:21:42 -0400] JasonBox: maybe with shef?
[2012-05-19 00:22:18 -0400] hoover_damm: kallen, define what your trying to do?
[2012-05-19 00:23:28 -0400] kallen: in runtime, add a role to a node under certain conditions
[2012-05-19 00:23:40 -0400] yfeldblum: kallen, https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/knife/node_run_list_add.rb#L58-71
[2012-05-19 00:25:33 -0400] kallen: yfeldblum: i don't follow :\
[2012-05-19 00:26:33 -0400] ssd7: kallen: basically that bit of code is how knife adds things to the run list.  By doing something like: node.run_list << "role[foo]"
[2012-05-19 00:26:44 -0400] kallen: recipe code i tried, that barfed on method "add" -- node.roles.add("role[jenkins]") if not node.roles.include?("role[jenkins]")
[2012-05-19 00:27:41 -0400] hoover_damm: kallen, nlist = []
[2012-05-19 00:27:55 -0400] hoover_damm: kallen, put what you want your runlist to be in nlist
[2012-05-19 00:28:03 -0400] kallen: ok.
[2012-05-19 00:28:08 -0400] hoover_damm: node.run_list.each do |entry|
[2012-05-19 00:28:20 -0400] hoover_damm: nlist << entry
[2012-05-19 00:28:22 -0400] hoover_damm: then node.save
[2012-05-19 00:29:02 -0400] hoover_damm: you can also also do node.run_list.add("role[collectd]")
[2012-05-19 00:29:07 -0400] hoover_damm: alternatively
[2012-05-19 00:30:23 -0400] kallen: so, node.roles.add("role[collectd]") is invalid? object node.roles does exist..
[2012-05-19 00:30:44 -0400] hoover_damm: you add things to the run list, not to roles directly
[2012-05-19 00:30:48 -0400] hoover_damm: the runlist populates what is roles
[2012-05-19 00:31:31 -0400] kallen: ok
[2012-05-19 00:31:33 -0400] kallen: thanks!
[2012-05-19 01:18:12 -0400] Guest63506: hi anyone available to answer a question?
[2012-05-19 01:20:19 -0400] Guest63506: Is it possible to have chef prompt the user for action and wait for enter key? (Would like to display deploy key for input into github and have the user tell chef to continue after the key has been put into github.)
[2012-05-19 02:03:44 -0400] hoover_damm: It's possible, but it's not suggested as that is not how chef runs
[2012-05-19 02:03:57 -0400] hoover_damm: however it appears that guest has moved on
[2012-05-19 04:07:44 -0400] |shad0w|: so first meal after chefcon, fortune cookie says "A difference, to be a difference, must make a difference"

[2012-05-19 05:03:11 -0400] xiaotian: Hi, I am try to play with roles with chef solo
[2012-05-19 05:03:35 -0400] xiaotian: but I am getting "Role base_server is in the runlist but does not exist. Skipping expand."
[2012-05-19 05:03:56 -0400] xiaotian: I have a roles directory at same level as cookbooks
[2012-05-19 05:04:07 -0400] xiaotian: and it contains base_server.json
[2012-05-19 05:04:30 -0400] xiaotian: but looks like chef-solo isn't picking that up, am I missing something?
[2012-05-19 05:04:35 -0400] xiaotian: Thanks!
[2012-05-19 05:04:56 -0400] xiaotian: oh, here is the directory structure: http://pastebin.com/rrie3fAr
[2012-05-19 05:06:03 -0400] xiaotian: and the base_server.json: http://pastebin.com/eKRmmW6T
[2012-05-19 05:31:24 -0400] xiaotian: is this a bug in chef-solo?  I am getting NoMethodError: undefined method `run_list_for' for {"name"=>"base_server", "run_list"=>["recipe[mytools]"]}:Hash
[2012-05-19 05:34:13 -0400] xiaotian: never mind, my bad. needs to specify json_class. sorry
[2012-05-19 06:56:39 -0400] miah: althara: hullo
[2012-05-19 06:56:49 -0400] althara: miah: Hi!
[2012-05-19 06:56:56 -0400] miah: this is me
[2012-05-19 06:57:09 -0400] miah: i am from the planet of over tired
[2012-05-19 06:57:32 -0400] althara: I'm also from that planet. Such is life when oncall.
[2012-05-19 06:57:53 -0400] miah: i think i have been on call for the past 10 years
[2012-05-19 06:58:04 -0400] miah: i dont remember a time when i wasnt on call
[2012-05-19 06:58:12 -0400] miah: maybe when i was in high school?
[2012-05-19 06:58:18 -0400] althara: I'm lucky I get weeks off inbetween the hell. :)
[2012-05-19 06:58:28 -0400] miah: ya
[2012-05-19 06:58:40 -0400] miah: everything escalates to me though
[2012-05-19 06:58:51 -0400] miah: such is life
[2012-05-19 06:58:55 -0400] althara: Indeed
[2012-05-19 06:59:07 -0400] miah: its interesting and while i'll complain i still <3 it
[2012-05-19 06:59:29 -0400] miah: my brain is permenately stuck in 'solve all the problems' mode
[2012-05-19 06:59:38 -0400] althara: I don't <3 oncall, but I do like solving problems and making things work better.
[2012-05-19 06:59:48 -0400] miah: awesome
[2012-05-19 07:00:11 -0400] miah: getting woke up just means you have a more interesting and hopefully rare problem to interact with
[2012-05-19 07:00:13 -0400] althara: I especially like fixing alerts that suck and don't actually need to wake people up. :)
[2012-05-19 07:00:22 -0400] miah: its like finding a dodo
[2012-05-19 07:00:40 -0400] althara: haha, if only things were that refined in all the environments I have to touch.
[2012-05-19 07:00:48 -0400] miah: ya
[2012-05-19 07:01:01 -0400] miah: i have my share of tuning to do still
[2012-05-19 07:01:18 -0400] althara: I'm not sure it's a job that is ever done.
[2012-05-19 07:01:34 -0400] miah: i am just making my life harder actually as i'm implementing graphite / collectd. so that just means i'll be finding _more_ problems.
[2012-05-19 07:03:00 -0400] miah: i feel like i need to be in a drug program.. im addicted to problems.
[2012-05-19 07:03:46 -0400] althara: http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/20631892.jpg
[2012-05-19 07:04:00 -0400] miah: awesome
[2012-05-19 07:04:08 -0400] althara: :)
[2012-05-19 07:05:28 -0400] miah: my sleep schedule is all fubar.
[2012-05-19 07:05:47 -0400] miah: im super awake
[2012-05-19 07:06:25 -0400] miah: so its impossible to sleep :/
[2012-05-19 07:06:38 -0400] althara: Yeah, I should be sleeping. But then part of me is like: "you'll just get woken up by an alert. Why bother?"
[2012-05-19 07:06:47 -0400] miah: lol
[2012-05-19 07:06:53 -0400] miah: what kinds of problems are you dealing with lately?
[2012-05-19 07:08:26 -0400] althara: got one customer that isn't fixing an exploit in their website that some anime distribution sites are using, so it's causing some interesting load problems.
[2012-05-19 07:09:58 -0400] miah: oh awesome
[2012-05-19 07:10:07 -0400] miah: is there anything you can do to help prevent it?
[2012-05-19 07:11:04 -0400] miah: ips/load balancer filter/cache filter/nginx|apache configuration?
[2012-05-19 07:11:30 -0400] althara: Not really with the current infrastructure. It's only happening enough to be annoying. Once we see the problem we block the item in the apache config, since source IPs are all over the place.
[2012-05-19 07:11:52 -0400] althara: The custoemr really needs to fix their security flaw that is allowing people to download stuff without an account
[2012-05-19 07:12:03 -0400] miah: ah
[2012-05-19 07:13:25 -0400] miah: im pretty familiar with that problem actually
[2012-05-19 07:13:44 -0400] miah: i run cx.com infrastructure
[2012-05-19 07:14:00 -0400] althara: nice
[2012-05-19 07:14:37 -0400] miah: its fun. lots of problems.
[2012-05-19 07:15:18 -0400] miah: i've learned quite a bit this past year
[2012-05-19 07:15:30 -0400] althara: yeah. We have lots of interesting problems to solve with a very similar service.
[2012-05-19 07:15:58 -0400] althara: Customer isn't supposed to do public sharing though. It's all private sharing, or at least supposed to be.
[2012-05-19 07:16:06 -0400] althara: public sharing definitely ups the ante
[2012-05-19 07:16:41 -0400] miah: ah
[2012-05-19 07:17:37 -0400] miah: i've done some haproxy tricks for those types of users
[2012-05-19 07:25:44 -0400] althara: Ok. Sleepy time lest I be very cranky tomorrow.
[2012-05-19 07:25:57 -0400] miah: ok. good night. =)

[2012-05-19 20:57:25 -0400] davidcramer_: coderanger, ^^^^
[2012-05-19 20:58:22 -0400] davidcramer_: oh ruby 1.9 doesnt have grep
[2012-05-19 20:58:55 -0400] davidcramer_: someone should fix the hostname cookbook IMO
[2012-05-19 20:59:34 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah unfortunately I think ruby 1.8.x needs another release and that is as 1.9.3
[2012-05-19 20:59:47 -0400] hoover_damm: just so everyone moves over to 1.9 and is on the same page
[2012-05-19 21:09:20 -0400] mhalligan: what's the verdict, is it better to start out with the iptables cookbook or the firewall cookbook?
[2012-05-19 21:28:10 -0400] hoover_damm: feels like it should be more or less auto configure based on the roles on the node or attributes set
[2012-05-19 21:29:53 -0400] hoover_damm: for a client, hense the rewrite
[2012-05-19 21:38:59 -0400] tolland_: is there an idiom for inserting a line into a config file, or do a wrap perl/bash one-liner in an execute resource?

[2012-05-19 22:17:00 -0400] miah: mhalligan: i havent used either
[2012-05-19 22:17:10 -0400] miah: i think the firewall one has a easy to use lwrp

[2012-05-19 22:29:38 -0400] vluther: so I'm trying the omnibus installer on a new box.  the install works fine, but when I try to run chef-client it says it failed to authenticate and to check my node_name and client key
[2012-05-19 22:30:43 -0400] vluther: could that have been because i deleted the client from the clients list by accident? and i need to create a new client, and use that client's key?
[2012-05-19 22:56:29 -0400] miah: just create a new client and download/install the new key
[2012-05-19 22:56:45 -0400] miah: keys are easy to regenerate. no need to worry about saving them.
