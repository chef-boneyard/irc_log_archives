[2012-05-20 00:31:13 -0400] agoddard: aslan: sounds like a solr issue
[2012-05-20 00:31:34 -0400] aslan: agoddard: thanks ... what are the steps to fix it?
[2012-05-20 00:31:50 -0400] aslan: i noticed my indexers last log was 2 hours ago
[2012-05-20 00:33:32 -0400] agoddard: aslan: the chef-expander worker might be stuck, you could try killing it and it should re-spawn - are you only running one worker?
[2012-05-20 00:34:08 -0400] agoddard: aslan: (assuming you're on 0.10 or later..)
[2012-05-20 00:34:24 -0400] aslan: i am running 0.9
[2012-05-20 00:35:27 -0400] aslan: agoddard: i dont see an expander :/
[2012-05-20 00:35:35 -0400] agoddard: aslan: hrm.. I think you can bounce chef-solr-indexer then.. I'm stretching my memory ;)
[2012-05-20 00:35:47 -0400] agoddard: aslan: yep, expander was introduced in 0.10
[2012-05-20 00:36:09 -0400] aslan: agoddard: alright let me give that a try. should i bounce solr too?
[2012-05-20 00:36:34 -0400] agoddard: aslan: just try the indexer first I think, you should see the results pretty quick
[2012-05-20 00:39:13 -0400] aslan: agoddard: doesn't look like it
[2012-05-20 00:39:43 -0400] aslan: agoddard: strange part is i see activity under chef-solr logs
[2012-05-20 00:39:55 -0400] aslan: maybe those are just search
[2012-05-20 00:40:15 -0400] agoddard: aslan: was chef-solr-indexer running before the restart, or had the process died?
[2012-05-20 00:40:34 -0400] aslan: it was running
[2012-05-20 00:40:45 -0400] aslan: i killed the process
[2012-05-20 00:41:05 -0400] aslan: agoddard: oh shoot its indexing now
[2012-05-20 00:41:07 -0400] aslan: :)
[2012-05-20 00:41:19 -0400] agoddard: aslan: awesome! :)
[2012-05-20 00:41:31 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, gonna upgrade to 0.10 this year?
[2012-05-20 00:41:34 -0400] hoover_damm: ;)
[2012-05-20 00:41:34 -0400] aslan: so should i wait for it to index the runlist too ?
[2012-05-20 00:42:15 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, either rebuild the index to populate missing entries or run node.save on the clients to re-index
[2012-05-20 00:42:26 -0400] hoover_damm: (e.g. shef -z and then just run node.save)
[2012-05-20 00:42:51 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: = ))  ... i will ... I promise. I am actually on a paternity leave and they called me from office that chef is having issues
[2012-05-20 00:43:35 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, ouch
[2012-05-20 00:43:37 -0400] aslan: my boss keeps repriotiing other stuff and chef upgrade gets pushed back. but this time i am going to do it
[2012-05-20 00:45:35 -0400] hoover_damm: but then politics is never been a good thing for me
[2012-05-20 00:46:23 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: well we are growing really fast. out traffic is increasing by the day. They dont want to risk anything
[2012-05-20 00:46:59 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: good thing is I have to other chef-servers for my qa and integration environments ... i can test it there and convince my boss that there is not much into it
[2012-05-20 00:48:36 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: i did run the node.save but the run_list search is still missing one of my servers :(
[2012-05-20 00:48:53 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: does it take too long for the indexer to index?
[2012-05-20 00:51:52 -0400] aslan_: hoover_damm: does it take too long for the indexer to index?
[2012-05-20 00:54:40 -0400] aslan: :/
[2012-05-20 01:02:27 -0400] agoddard: aslan: currently you have a single node on which you've added items to the run list, and they're not showing up in the run_list, is that correct?
[2012-05-20 01:02:56 -0400] agoddard: or just when you do a search for nodes containing the added items in their run lists?
[2012-05-20 01:03:49 -0400] aslan: agoddard: so the story is this was an existing role/run_list this morning it was having problems(ec2 related) my co worker killed the server and spawn a new one
[2012-05-20 01:03:52 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, not very long
[2012-05-20 01:04:18 -0400] aslan: the new server is not showing up on search results . like when i do a knife status -r i can't see it
[2012-05-20 01:04:26 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, remember to check the indexer logs
[2012-05-20 01:04:35 -0400] aslan: when other recipes search for the role they can't find it
[2012-05-20 01:04:59 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: the indexer is busy logging stuff all i see is like : Indexing node b4633033-3cee-4255-aaa9-29d3730eb102 from chef status ok}
[2012-05-20 01:05:42 -0400] hoover_damm: well it spawned under a new name no?
[2012-05-20 01:05:52 -0400] hoover_damm: or did your coworker build another one using the same name?
[2012-05-20 01:07:01 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: hostname you mean?
[2012-05-20 01:07:28 -0400] aslan: my ec2 servers are named based on their internal DNS name. so all names are different
[2012-05-20 01:07:29 -0400] hoover_damm: fqdn/hostname/yep
[2012-05-20 01:07:41 -0400] hoover_damm: ahh, so you just use search
[2012-05-20 01:07:47 -0400] hoover_damm: and don't care about names, weird
[2012-05-20 01:08:02 -0400] hoover_damm: now they do at least
[2012-05-20 01:08:38 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, does knife node show -l actually query solr in 0.9.x?
[2012-05-20 01:09:01 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: not sure about it
[2012-05-20 01:09:02 -0400] hoover_damm: even knife node show you can see the difference really
[2012-05-20 01:09:10 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: this is the search line that is failing : campaigns  = search(:node, "run_list:role*solitude_campaigns*")
[2012-05-20 01:09:17 -0400] hoover_damm: where recipes: will be empty on a node that hasn't completed it's chef run
[2012-05-20 01:09:22 -0400] hoover_damm: yet run list is populated
[2012-05-20 01:10:17 -0400] hoover_damm: weird, the one problem I have with using the internal DNS name is when you get the same name twice
[2012-05-20 01:10:23 -0400] agoddard: aslan: is chef-client running fine on the new node your co-worker setup?
[2012-05-20 01:10:39 -0400] hoover_damm: running node.save should have the same effect as chef-client
[2012-05-20 01:10:47 -0400] aslan: agoddard: yeah chef completes fine
[2012-05-20 01:10:48 -0400] hoover_damm: he said he did it up there ^^
[2012-05-20 01:10:58 -0400] hoover_damm: but if you can do another node.save aslan
[2012-05-20 01:11:00 -0400] hoover_damm: might be helpful
[2012-05-20 01:11:12 -0400] hoover_damm: you can also just load up the node in your console to reindex it
[2012-05-20 01:11:15 -0400] hoover_damm: but it's a little more fun
[2012-05-20 01:11:34 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: how do you do that?
[2012-05-20 01:12:10 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, shef -z
[2012-05-20 01:12:18 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: knife node show i-25bac043 returns fine and shows the run_list at the end
[2012-05-20 01:12:20 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, bob=Chef::Node.load("nameoftarget")
[2012-05-20 01:12:22 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, bob.save
[2012-05-20 01:12:38 -0400] hoover_damm: this is also a good way of scripting removing and adding items from the runlist
[2012-05-20 01:13:06 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: i have to learn shef
[2012-05-20 01:13:11 -0400] hoover_damm: chef > bob=Chef::Node.load("sensu-test") => node[sensu-test]
[2012-05-20 01:13:12 -0400] hoover_damm: chef > bob.save => node[sensu-test]
[2012-05-20 01:13:30 -0400] hoover_damm: eventually it comes down to pure ruby
[2012-05-20 01:13:46 -0400] hoover_damm: and manipulating the object in ruby
[2012-05-20 01:15:56 -0400] hoover_damm: so much more automation to do
[2012-05-20 01:16:05 -0400] hoover_damm: I want to automate this damned Cisco switch next...
[2012-05-20 01:16:16 -0400] hoover_damm: wish I could put chef-client directly on it
[2012-05-20 01:16:40 -0400] hoover_damm: ot
[2012-05-20 01:18:40 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: bob.save executed fine
[2012-05-20 01:18:48 -0400] aslan: but still no search
[2012-05-20 01:19:08 -0400] martinisoft: is the official cookbook repos in github.com/opscode/cookbooks or github.com/opscode-cookbooks ?
[2012-05-20 01:19:13 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, what was bob's runlist?
[2012-05-20 01:19:30 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, it's a mash/node so you can treat bob like node
[2012-05-20 01:19:47 -0400] agoddard: martinisoft:  github.com/opscode/cookbooks is legacy, they're all separate repos now ( github.com/opscode-cookbooks )
[2012-05-20 01:19:52 -0400] hoover_damm: chef > bob.recipes => ["sensu::client"]
[2012-05-20 01:20:08 -0400] martinisoft: ah just noticed the deprecation, sorry for asking :)
[2012-05-20 01:20:09 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, also you should gem install pry and read over the pry manual when you have time
[2012-05-20 01:20:12 -0400] martinisoft: thanks agoddard
[2012-05-20 01:20:17 -0400] hoover_damm: you'll find pry a great replacement for irb for repl
[2012-05-20 01:20:22 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: the correct run_list
[2012-05-20 01:20:52 -0400] martinisoft: trying to learn to use chef, feels like I have taken a dive into a vast ocean :x
[2012-05-20 01:21:10 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, what happens when you run search
[2012-05-20 01:21:16 -0400] hoover_damm: that search line may be the core defect
[2012-05-20 01:21:34 -0400] agoddard: martinisoft: make sure you check out the wiki and the community site http://wiki.opscode.com and http://community.opscode.com
[2012-05-20 01:21:54 -0400] martinisoft: yeah, going through it pieces by piece
[2012-05-20 01:22:01 -0400] hoover_damm: it appears to work so that's neat
[2012-05-20 01:22:06 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: agoddard : this is the search line : campaigns  = search(:node, "run_list:role*solitude_campaigns*")
[2012-05-20 01:22:08 -0400] hoover_damm: and for me works
[2012-05-20 01:22:13 -0400] martinisoft: finally got my client working with hosted chef, learning how this whole cookbook management thing works
[2012-05-20 01:22:14 -0400] martinisoft: :)
[2012-05-20 01:22:16 -0400] agoddard: martinisoft: nice (and welcome - Chef is aaawesome)
[2012-05-20 01:22:17 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, right what happens when you run in shef
[2012-05-20 01:22:17 -0400] aslan: it always worked. and it workes for othere run lists
[2012-05-20 01:22:28 -0400] hoover_damm: campaigns  = search(:node,"run_list:role*solitude_campaigns*")
[2012-05-20 01:22:40 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: i get an empty array
[2012-05-20 01:22:43 -0400] martinisoft: yeah I've toyed with it before, but I finally realized I can use it to entirely replace deploying with deployment tools
[2012-05-20 01:23:34 -0400] martinisoft: I only want to manage 2 to 3 servers with it, but I feel Chef is worth learning because its annoying to manage multiple systems and trying to apply the same thing over and over
[2012-05-20 01:23:40 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, and bob has role of solitude_campaigns in it?
[2012-05-20 01:23:50 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: yes
[2012-05-20 01:24:03 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, check the solr logs for errors?
[2012-05-20 01:24:06 -0400] martinisoft: thank you for the warm welcome though agoddard :)
[2012-05-20 01:24:43 -0400] agoddard: martinisoft: have fun with it :)
[2012-05-20 01:25:06 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: nothing obvious ... I have feeling i have to rebuild the index
[2012-05-20 01:25:11 -0400] aslan: :(
[2012-05-20 01:26:49 -0400] martinisoft: I have a question that doesn't seem to be addressed in the wiki about cookbooks.  I want to tweak a few of the community cookbooks, so do I fork them and add my own stuff or just download then modify?
[2012-05-20 01:27:06 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, yep now you know why we keep telling you to upgrade
[2012-05-20 01:27:06 -0400] martinisoft: Don't know the best practice there
[2012-05-20 01:27:11 -0400] hoover_damm: it's okay 0.10.10 is around the corner aslan
[2012-05-20 01:27:27 -0400] hoover_damm: your doing better then when I worked for EY with 0.6.0.0.2
[2012-05-20 01:28:09 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: yeah... as i told you boss thinks there is more risk involved and down time costs more money
[2012-05-20 01:28:19 -0400] aslan: i have to convince him that staying on 0.9 might cost more
[2012-05-20 01:29:43 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: that aside i still think something in solr or indexer is not working properly
[2012-05-20 01:32:51 -0400] agoddard: martinisoft: I'd recommend using librarian-chef (https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian), forking them and then pointing your Cheffile to your fork.
[2012-05-20 01:33:35 -0400] agoddard: martinisoft: though you may be able to customize them just with attributes, make sure you don't just need to change attributes before you modify the code.
[2012-05-20 01:33:55 -0400] martinisoft: if its just attributes, I do that via data bags right?
[2012-05-20 01:34:14 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, right you can turn up the debug mode on the indexer
[2012-05-20 01:34:16 -0400] hoover_damm: and restart it
[2012-05-20 01:34:20 -0400] hoover_damm: log level that is
[2012-05-20 01:34:24 -0400] hoover_damm: you might want to try that on the chef server
[2012-05-20 01:34:48 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, and restart chef-solr with debug mode because basically what should be happening isn't.  Now your fishing expedition starts
[2012-05-20 01:34:51 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: chef-solr or chef-solr-indexer?
[2012-05-20 01:34:56 -0400] hoover_damm: both
[2012-05-20 01:34:57 -0400] agoddard: martinisoft: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Attributes - there's a hierarchy of where you can set them
[2012-05-20 01:35:11 -0400] hoover_damm: modify the config files in /etc/chef to change that behavior
[2012-05-20 01:35:32 -0400] martinisoft: ah, got it
[2012-05-20 01:35:33 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, btw your time and chef working properly is the price
[2012-05-20 01:35:39 -0400] hoover_damm: that's how you sell it
[2012-05-20 01:35:52 -0400] aslan: ;)
[2012-05-20 01:36:44 -0400] hoover_damm: because now here you are on a saturday night at 6pm trying to figure out why the indexer isn't indexing
[2012-05-20 01:36:52 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: were do yo set the debug flag for solr?
[2012-05-20 01:37:40 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, hrm you don't it looks
[2012-05-20 01:37:49 -0400] hoover_damm: but looks like at least in my case solr is running under stdout
[2012-05-20 01:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: sucks as this isn't under runit
[2012-05-20 01:38:05 -0400] hoover_damm: so that's going to the wall
[2012-05-20 01:38:50 -0400] hoover_damm: or not, must be redirection trickery
[2012-05-20 01:39:16 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: i remember i have done it in the past
[2012-05-20 01:39:25 -0400] aslan: just not sure where i set it
[2012-05-20 01:39:38 -0400] hoover_damm: command line likely
[2012-05-20 01:39:44 -0400] hoover_damm: but you shouldn't really need solr in debug
[2012-05-20 01:39:48 -0400] hoover_damm: i don't think the problem is with solr
[2012-05-20 01:41:07 -0400] hoover_damm: because what you want is when you run bob.save you can look on the server-api logs and see the indexer id it sent the transaction as
[2012-05-20 01:41:13 -0400] hoover_damm: and then you should see that in the expander logs
[2012-05-20 01:45:51 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: does chef 0.9 have expander?
[2012-05-20 01:48:17 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, sorry indexer
[2012-05-20 01:48:26 -0400] hoover_damm: indexer was renamed to expander
[2012-05-20 01:48:30 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: the indexer debug mode is crazy
[2012-05-20 01:48:36 -0400] aslan: hard to read useful information
[2012-05-20 01:48:48 -0400] hoover_damm: stop your clients?
[2012-05-20 01:48:51 -0400] hoover_damm: if that's possible
[2012-05-20 01:49:02 -0400] aslan: i have 250 clients :/
[2012-05-20 01:49:25 -0400] aslan: in any case the bob.save command does not trigger anything on the indexer
[2012-05-20 01:49:40 -0400] hoover_damm: so check the server-api logs
[2012-05-20 01:50:09 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, it may help if you add a runlist item and then delete one
[2012-05-20 01:50:30 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: just a dummy one?
[2012-05-20 01:50:35 -0400] aslan: can do that
[2012-05-20 01:51:10 -0400] hoover_damm: or remove and re-add the role in question
[2012-05-20 01:54:13 -0400] hoover_damm: bob.run_list_add("role[bob]")
[2012-05-20 01:55:55 -0400] hoover_damm: err wait
[2012-05-20 01:57:14 -0400] martinisoft: agoddard, the chef-repo I make, should that be private or public?
[2012-05-20 01:57:23 -0400] hoover_damm: well actually adding and removing isn't that straight forwrd
[2012-05-20 01:57:36 -0400] hoover_damm: martinisoft, chef-repo is private as you store your private keys in nit
[2012-05-20 01:57:52 -0400] martinisoft: ah
[2012-05-20 01:58:28 -0400] hoover_damm: often it's a final product and not what you want to share on the web with everyone
[2012-05-20 01:59:00 -0400] hoover_damm: if you want to open source or share something you generally make the cookbook self contained like how opscode does their cookbooks now
[2012-05-20 02:00:18 -0400] martinisoft: yeah I want to be able to open source these cookbooks, but that seems complicated now
[2012-05-20 02:00:50 -0400] agoddard: martinisoft: look at librarian, and gitignore your cookbooks directory
[2012-05-20 02:00:56 -0400] hoover_damm: generally open sourcing cookbooks is complicated as you can toss em out as you use them and hope they stick; but often you need to document and think about more then what you care about
[2012-05-20 02:01:08 -0400] agoddard: ^ +1
[2012-05-20 02:01:13 -0400] martinisoft: agoddard, ah now that makes sense :)
[2012-05-20 02:02:02 -0400] agoddard: martinisoft: this needs work, but it might kind of explain some of the different workflows http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cookbook+Workflows
[2012-05-20 02:03:39 -0400] agoddard: gotta fly :(
[2012-05-20 02:04:44 -0400] martinisoft: thanks for the help agoddard, much appreciated! \o/
[2012-05-20 02:06:22 -0400] agoddard: martinisoft: no probs. spend a chunk of time on the wiki, it's really good.. check out cookbook providers and resources, and check out the attribute hierarchy stuff.. it'll all make a ton of sense in no time.. and have fun :)
[2012-05-20 02:06:53 -0400] aslan: hoover_damm: is there anyway to get a second solr up and have that build a new index while the currnet version is still running?
[2012-05-20 02:07:11 -0400] hoover_damm: aslan, not off the top of my head
[2012-05-20 02:07:20 -0400] martinisoft: yeah I have spent all weekend in the wiki, its... just a lot of information to take in at once
[2012-05-20 02:07:54 -0400] hoover_damm: martinisoft, and comfortable with ruby of course?
[2012-05-20 02:08:06 -0400] martinisoft: oh yeah :)
[2012-05-20 02:08:11 -0400] martinisoft: Ruby part is easy
[2012-05-20 02:08:18 -0400] martinisoft: this whole Chef thing is just blowing my mind
[2012-05-20 02:09:35 -0400] hoover_damm: yep and don't worry about taking it all in at once
[2012-05-20 02:09:59 -0400] hoover_damm: as chef takes hold how you use chef will change and you'll start digging into more features and adding more
[2012-05-20 02:10:17 -0400] hoover_damm: but at the first steps overthinking the question will often lead to hours of confusion
[2012-05-20 02:12:00 -0400] martinisoft: its just a lot of terms all at once
[2012-05-20 02:12:19 -0400] martinisoft: the hosted chef site has... well a lot more than I'll ever need
[2012-05-20 02:14:19 -0400] hoover_damm: yep but going the solo route often means you have to do more work
[2012-05-20 02:14:45 -0400] martinisoft: yeah, its so different that it becomes confusing
[2012-05-20 02:15:11 -0400] hoover_damm: so yeah
[2012-05-20 02:15:32 -0400] hoover_damm: well wrong wording, worked at a paas maintaining chef recipes that used chef.solo
[2012-05-20 02:15:39 -0400] martinisoft: so even with hosted chef, a chef-repo is still the route to go, yeah?
[2012-05-20 02:15:48 -0400] hoover_damm: totally
[2012-05-20 02:16:12 -0400] martinisoft: cool, and for data bags and node info, should I just create that stuff in the hosted chef console or do it via knife?
[2012-05-20 02:16:17 -0400] hoover_damm: makes your landing into code your systems a lot more comfortable as your learning a lot you don't have to maintain chef
[2012-05-20 02:16:20 -0400] hoover_damm: or worry about scaling it
[2012-05-20 02:16:42 -0400] hoover_damm: just boot up what you need with the knife command or however you want to, bootstrap and run
[2012-05-20 02:16:58 -0400] martinisoft: yeah I only plan to manage my own small personal nodes, so im in that 5 or less category with the free account
[2012-05-20 02:17:05 -0400] hoover_damm: Chef does use couchdb and rabbitmq and solr so it can be confusing and annoying when it breaks
[2012-05-20 02:17:37 -0400] hoover_damm: as if you haven't used those tools that's your first steep hill
[2012-05-20 02:18:13 -0400] martinisoft: yeah, theres a super steep learning curve I feel
[2012-05-20 02:18:23 -0400] martinisoft: starting to feel it all click, but its very overwhelming
[2012-05-20 02:18:23 -0400] hoover_damm: also the hosted is running the erlang chef
[2012-05-20 02:18:40 -0400] hoover_damm: which should be fun once they open source that code :) (if it's not already)
[2012-05-20 02:18:47 -0400] hoover_damm: when/if
[2012-05-20 02:19:31 -0400] hoover_damm: for me it's dropping solr as it was just a bad replacement to a bad problem (ferret which was the original indexer)
[2012-05-20 02:19:52 -0400] hoover_damm: but it worked without screwing up much, so i shutup
[2012-05-20 02:19:55 -0400] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-05-20 02:56:40 -0400] martinisoft: thank you hoover_damm
[2012-05-20 14:50:34 -0400] countdig1: could anyone suggest an opensource prov tool for vmware esx 4 or later? right now using chef at home w/ vbox but interested in testing at work
[2012-05-20 14:51:01 -0400] countdig1: using vagrant w/ vbox i should say
[2012-05-20 14:53:44 -0400] lflux: I use knife vsphere, but that's more for avoiding the vcenter client
[2012-05-20 14:56:05 -0400] countdig1: cool tx what i want is total cmdline
[2012-05-20 14:56:08 -0400] countdig1: tx
[2012-05-20 18:54:38 -0400] ssd7: Ohai Chefs!
[2012-05-20 19:28:59 -0400] DCODE: @ALL: Quick question - is it possible to create & use encrypted databags with solo?
[2012-05-20 19:32:19 -0400] hoover_damm: not sure what value that would add
[2012-05-20 19:32:36 -0400] hoover_damm: you'd provide the encrypted data and the key on the same host
[2012-05-20 19:33:26 -0400] hoover_damm: decrypt is just openssl so assuming you setup the databags right it should work, but there's very little value in encrypting it at this point
[2012-05-20 19:33:38 -0400] hoover_damm: imo
[2012-05-20 19:33:57 -0400] hoover_damm: if they get access to the server then they have both the encrypted and the key to decrypt
[2012-05-20 19:34:11 -0400] hoover_damm: almost feels like a full house of loss to me
[2012-05-20 19:36:22 -0400] DCODE: I am working on a POC and the aim is the show case the capabilities of chef. I dont have enough infra to dedicate for a chef server and so trying to work with solo. One of the key requirement is encrypted databags offered by chef..
[2012-05-20 19:36:45 -0400] DCODE: whenever i try to use knife to create encrypted databags..it looks for client.pem and bails out..
[2012-05-20 19:37:00 -0400] hoover_damm: if your doing a poc you should be doing a POC for what your end goal is
[2012-05-20 19:37:04 -0400] hoover_damm: not a middle ground
[2012-05-20 19:37:21 -0400] hoover_damm: can you use hosted chef in your POC?
[2012-05-20 19:37:39 -0400] hoover_damm: and then if they agree then you can move to a full chef server
[2012-05-20 19:37:45 -0400] DCODE: end goal is encrypted data bags. question is can i use solo to deliver that?
[2012-05-20 19:37:47 -0400] hoover_damm: that you host if you want, or keep it
[2012-05-20 19:38:12 -0400] hoover_damm: it should work, but it seems pretty stupid imo
[2012-05-20 19:38:36 -0400] DCODE: i cant, the network is private and does not talk to outside world
[2012-05-20 19:38:36 -0400] hoover_damm: just as the whole point to me is to keep the content encrypted off-site
[2012-05-20 19:40:07 -0400] hoover_damm: additioinally there is some encryption on between the chef-client and the server-api
[2012-05-20 19:40:28 -0400] hoover_damm: i won't say it's the strongest in the universe but if your worried about ssl keys being copied over the wire
[2012-05-20 19:40:41 -0400] hoover_damm: that is not likely to happen easily
[2012-05-20 19:42:56 -0400] DCODE: again the idea is the show case capability to get a buy in ..instead of recommending a deployment architecture to be followed. (think of it as showcasing ssh login on a local machine to prove how ssh could be useful even though in reality no one would ssh to a local box)
[2012-05-20 19:44:07 -0400] DCODE: any pointers on how can i create encypted databags for solo with knife or someother way..?
[2012-05-20 19:57:22 -0400] coderanger: DCODE: That wouldn't make much sense
[2012-05-20 19:57:35 -0400] coderanger: Encrypted data bags exist only to encrypt them while stored on the server
[2012-05-20 19:57:43 -0400] coderanger: if there is no server, it wouldn't do anything :-)
[2012-05-20 19:58:49 -0400] DCODE: got it.
[2012-05-20 19:58:58 -0400] DCODE: thanks guys!
[2012-05-20 19:59:08 -0400] coderanger: No problem
[2012-05-20 20:00:18 -0400] coderanger: (to be more specific, at all times the client needs have access to both the encrypted data and a key for decryption so it can use the bag, so there is no security on the client side, just on the server which lacks the key)
[2012-05-20 20:01:54 -0400] DCODE: make sense!
[2012-05-20 20:26:07 -0400] bip: I'm trying to do a File.read on a file I download with remote_file over http. But I get enoent (file doesn't exist) but if I comment out the File.read line he file get's created. Is remote_file async somehow and how can I get around it?
[2012-05-20 20:27:04 -0400] coderanger: bip: Pastebin the code
[2012-05-20 20:27:19 -0400] coderanger: Are you trying to read the file at compile time or in a ruby_block?
[2012-05-20 20:28:26 -0400] bip: http://pastebin.com/66MBGdrZ
[2012-05-20 20:28:40 -0400] coderanger: So yeah, you are reading it at compile time
[2012-05-20 20:28:43 -0400] bip: compile_time
[2012-05-20 20:28:45 -0400] bip: yeah
[2012-05-20 20:28:46 -0400] coderanger: throw that in a ruby_block
[2012-05-20 20:29:39 -0400] bip: Ahhh!
[2012-05-20 20:29:41 -0400] bip: Ruby code in ruby_block resources is evaluated with other resources during convergence, whereas Ruby code outside ruby_block resources is evaluated before other resources, during recipe evaluation (compilation).
[2012-05-20 20:30:08 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, all recipe files are run ("compiled") in one pass and then run in another pass
[2012-05-20 20:30:24 -0400] coderanger: since before they are run, notification targets and such need to be resolved
[2012-05-20 20:30:46 -0400] bip: makes sense
[2012-05-20 20:36:17 -0400] terryjfundak: I've got a basic question that everybody probably knows the answer to: Where do I go to search past Q & A of #chef ... kinda a FAQs first approach before bothering others...... And as part of the answer to this question..... Is there an offline database of these?
[2012-05-20 20:36:41 -0400] yfeldblum: when recipes run, they declare a list of resources, but no actions are taken against the system; when recipes are finished running, chef loops over the list of resources and takes actions against the system based on the list of resources your recipes declared
[2012-05-20 20:37:39 -0400] coderanger: terryjfundak: The IRC logs are available on community.opscode.com and you can search them there, but you can always just ask, we really don't mind :D
[2012-05-20 20:39:32 -0400] terryjfundak: coderanger: Thanx for the hug .... still like to sample the corporate wisdom of the many too ... and oddly, sometimes people are offline.....
[2012-05-20 20:40:16 -0400] coderanger: Hah, then yeah, http://community.opscode.com/chat/chef
[2012-05-20 20:41:27 -0400] terryjfundak: coderange: That the number.... thanx
[2012-05-20 20:42:37 -0400] bip: coderanger: My Ruby foo is too low. I still can't get it right: http://pastebin.com/9mw67a7D
[2012-05-20 20:43:18 -0400] yfeldblum: bip, what overall are you trying to do?
[2012-05-20 20:43:29 -0400] coderanger: bip: That looks correct
[2012-05-20 20:44:27 -0400] coderanger: Whats the issue?
[2012-05-20 20:44:39 -0400] bip: The usecase is quite simple. deploy an erlang otp. Fetch the latest version from url/latest, cat latest and prepend to url/version.tar.gz and download that and deploy
[2012-05-20 20:44:41 -0400] coderanger: Remember you can't then use filename in later resources directly
[2012-05-20 20:45:36 -0400] bip: Everything has been working perfectly when I hardcoded the version in the databag but my download url/latest trick has gotten me stuck
[2012-05-20 20:46:02 -0400] coderanger: bip: You are probably going to need to either find or build an LWRP that uses net/http directly and such
[2012-05-20 20:46:54 -0400] bip: hmm, so I can't use: remote_file to download url/latest and then a ruby File.read to a var and use in a new remote_file ?
[2012-05-20 20:48:24 -0400] coderanger: Not without some magic, remember that there is that compile/run pass dichotomy
[2012-05-20 20:48:45 -0400] coderanger: You can do it, but you would want to do it within an LWRP
[2012-05-20 20:50:46 -0400] bip: Ok, fair enough. I'll read up on lwrp then
[2012-05-20 21:39:50 -0400] yfeldblum: coderanger, yeah, bip should probably just http get the version file
[2012-05-20 22:06:32 -0400] valdezjoelt: help im having an error FATAL: Net::HTTPServerException: 401 "Unauthorized"

[2012-05-20 23:51:50 -0400] xiaotian: Hi, does anyone know for chef-solo, how do I have dynamic attribute values in node.json (the one passed in -j option)?  for example, when I use rvm::user recipe,  I'd like to set the "user" attribute to ENV['SUDO_USER']
