[2012-05-12 00:03:23 -0400] sparc_: Hey... do we have to be super-cool to get a promotional code for ChefConf? :D
[2012-05-12 00:03:37 -0400] sparc_: Because I can dance and sing and stuff
[2012-05-12 00:03:45 -0400] sparc_: and write cookbooks for CDNs
[2012-05-12 00:03:47 -0400] sparc_: hehe
[2012-05-12 00:04:27 -0400] sparc_: i should write some kind of perl extension for templates or something
[2012-05-12 00:05:08 -0400] sparc_: oh there's one from FoodFight
[2012-05-12 00:05:14 -0400] sparc_: thank you BryanBerry
[2012-05-12 00:08:48 -0400] sparc_: Sorry, the promotional code you entered has expired.
[2012-05-12 00:09:00 -0400] sparc_: awww... jesse robins :(
[2012-05-12 00:09:04 -0400] sparc_: hehe
[2012-05-12 00:11:40 -0400] cheeseplus: sparc_: I still think there is a valid 15% one
[2012-05-12 00:12:19 -0400] sparc_: hmm ok.  i hadn't run into that one
[2012-05-12 00:12:26 -0400] sparc_: aah well. it'll still be worth it
[2012-05-12 00:12:47 -0400] cheeseplus: trying to find it now, just remember a tweet about it
[2012-05-12 00:13:49 -0400] cheeseplus: sparc_: OPSGEEK for 10%
[2012-05-12 00:14:19 -0400] sparc_: nice!
[2012-05-12 00:14:42 -0400] sparc_: thanks muchly
[2012-05-12 00:14:50 -0400] cheeseplus: No problem
[2012-05-12 00:15:29 -0400] cheeseplus: best was a 20% off, not sure if any are still valid
[2012-05-12 00:32:08 -0400] sparc_: heh, the hotel filled up too
[2012-05-12 00:37:31 -0400] axolx: hey guys -- is it possible to use knife ec2 on us-west-1?
[2012-05-12 00:37:55 -0400] axolx: knife ec2 server list --region us-west-1 doesnt show any instances even tho i have several
[2012-05-12 00:38:10 -0400] axolx: knife ec2 server list --region us-east-1 shows them
[2012-05-12 01:51:35 -0400] macros: Creating caches in my cookbooks to make my chef runs faster, I feel a little dirty
[2012-05-12 01:52:22 -0400] macros: perl -e 'use #{params[:name]} #{params[:version]}' is an expensive way to check if a module is installed
[2012-05-12 01:52:57 -0400] macros: 25s shaved off runs
[2012-05-12 01:54:49 -0400] macros: Starting to think returning node objects from a search is a really bad idea
[2012-05-12 01:56:13 -0400] macros: We end up sending the same node objects up to a dozen times over the wire in a run
[2012-05-12 01:59:32 -0400] miah: zookeeper / noah ?
[2012-05-12 02:01:40 -0400] macros: No
[2012-05-12 02:01:52 -0400] macros: Search should just return node ids to be fetched
[2012-05-12 02:02:23 -0400] macros: And fetch nodes as needed
[2012-05-12 02:02:37 -0400] macros: If it is already in the local node cache don't fetch again this run
[2012-05-12 02:02:48 -0400] macros: And a fetch api that can take a list of node ojects
[2012-05-12 02:03:08 -0400] macros: Even better node/attribute and build up a selective node cache
[2012-05-12 02:06:40 -0400] macros: Would address client-side memory usage as well as speed/size of api calls
[2012-05-12 02:07:04 -0400] macros: Less work server side serializing json search results
[2012-05-12 02:11:30 -0400] macros: Do other regularly hear complaints about run-times on already converged machines?
[2012-05-12 03:31:10 -0400] hoover_damm: macros, I think ignorance is a little still here
[2012-05-12 03:31:42 -0400] hoover_damm: macros, search can get really noisy with a lot of attributes... I know some people who actually have 2megs of atttributes coming over the wire
[2012-05-12 03:31:46 -0400] hoover_damm: macros, not easy
[2012-05-12 03:31:55 -0400] miah: ignorance in the sense that this is a very new field to many of us, so lots to learn about optimization
[2012-05-12 03:33:27 -0400] hoover_damm: macros, there's a point where your learning, and a point where you polish
[2012-05-12 03:33:40 -0400] hoover_damm: speaking of which an ironfan cookbook decided to timebomb on me today
[2012-05-12 03:34:25 -0400] hoover_damm: metachef started making the redis cookbook bomb out as ClusterChef wasn't defined
[2012-05-12 03:34:29 -0400] miah: doh
[2012-05-12 03:34:31 -0400] hoover_damm: as it couldn't source a file that existed
[2012-05-12 03:34:41 -0400] hoover_damm: pretty bizzare
[2012-05-12 03:34:54 -0400] hoover_damm: as it worked for months
[2012-05-12 03:34:59 -0400] hoover_damm: we didn't upload or change it
[2012-05-12 03:35:15 -0400] hoover_damm: well froze it today, but meh... regressions from freezing cookbooks makes my balls hurt
[2012-05-12 03:35:28 -0400] hoover_damm: it's like doh! that should have been the same #@!#!@!#@ thing
[2012-05-12 03:37:13 -0400] hoover_damm: I don't wanna make a git hook to upload whenever we push
[2012-05-12 03:37:15 -0400] hoover_damm: seems wrong
[2012-05-12 03:38:05 -0400] miah: i think people really need to start working on better chef cookbook / roles / etc deployment routines
[2012-05-12 03:38:30 -0400] hoover_damm: do you version your cookbooks in your environments?
[2012-05-12 03:38:38 -0400] hoover_damm: that really made development less scary
[2012-05-12 03:38:51 -0400] hoover_damm: production and staging are locked to versions, and acceptance of a story 'bumps' the cookbook_version
[2012-05-12 03:38:58 -0400] miah: yes, i do version them
[2012-05-12 03:39:06 -0400] hoover_damm: test it in staging, good, bump production... accept story, run happy
[2012-05-12 03:39:29 -0400] hoover_damm: I'm a big abuser of attributes over data bags so it makes roles more imporant
[2012-05-12 03:39:34 -0400] hoover_damm: important* as well as environments
[2012-05-12 03:39:41 -0400] miah: yup
[2012-05-12 03:40:01 -0400] hoover_damm: partially because I actually dislike running search in a recipe, I really prefer to just manipulate the data already loaded
[2012-05-12 03:40:29 -0400] hoover_damm: usually if I search I end up doing a horrible search, and then .each and pass it off
[2012-05-12 03:40:53 -0400] hoover_damm: sometimes I feel like I did something wrong in a search when I didn't
[2012-05-12 03:41:09 -0400] miah: woo down to 12k
[2012-05-12 04:14:24 -0400] LinuxHorn: anyone around?
[2012-05-12 04:14:33 -0400] LinuxHorn: have a bootstrap question
[2012-05-12 04:18:02 -0400] LinuxHorn: our environment had a cloud server die a horrible death tonight  we are going to re-image the cloud server with a standard ubuntu 10.04 image as it was before  i want to use bootstrap to install chef and re-add all of the server's configurations from chef
[2012-05-12 04:18:18 -0400] miah: ok
[2012-05-12 04:18:19 -0400] LinuxHorn: how does bootstrap work with a node that already exists in our chef instance?
[2012-05-12 04:18:43 -0400] miah: hrm. im not sure how to handle that.
[2012-05-12 04:19:16 -0400] LinuxHorn: yeah, me neither
[2012-05-12 04:21:16 -0400] LinuxHorn: normally i would just do something like:
[2012-05-12 04:21:29 -0400] LinuxHorn: knife bootstrap mycloudserver -N mycloudserver -E ele-stage -r'role[ele-base]' -P rootpassword -u myuser -x root
[2012-05-12 04:22:01 -0400] LinuxHorn: i'm guessing if i remove the environment and run_list options it should hopefully keep what was there already in chef and apply it
[2012-05-12 04:22:02 -0400] knuckolls_: LinuxHorn: are you starting from a fresh ubuntu image? or you've rebooted the cloud server and you want to re-run the bootstrap on the node
[2012-05-12 04:22:14 -0400] LinuxHorn: cloud server completely dead
[2012-05-12 04:22:26 -0400] LinuxHorn: it's backend storage died
[2012-05-12 04:22:32 -0400] LinuxHorn: so re-imaging from a fresh ubuntu image
[2012-05-12 04:22:36 -0400] knuckolls_: so you're effectively firing up a new instance and bootstrapping a new node
[2012-05-12 04:22:40 -0400] LinuxHorn: yes
[2012-05-12 04:22:49 -0400] LinuxHorn: but using the existing setting for this node
[2012-05-12 04:22:59 -0400] LinuxHorn: run_list, environment, attributes, etc...
[2012-05-12 04:24:11 -0400] knuckolls_: well it depends on how you've been managing that node
[2012-05-12 04:24:26 -0400] LinuxHorn: i'm assuming i'll need to delete and re-add the client to create a new client.pem
[2012-05-12 04:24:33 -0400] LinuxHorn: but don't want to delete the node
[2012-05-12 04:24:50 -0400] knuckolls_: have you been changing that node config w/ knife since you initially bootstrapped it?
[2012-05-12 04:25:02 -0400] LinuxHorn: yes
[2012-05-12 04:25:18 -0400] LinuxHorn: also, we back up the attributes and such from the node to a json file
[2012-05-12 04:25:34 -0400] knuckolls_: see, i've never found myself in that situation. everything that touches the chef server lives in a file and we just upload those all w/ knife
[2012-05-12 04:25:42 -0400] knuckolls_: in this situation we'd just reupload all the files
[2012-05-12 04:25:46 -0400] LinuxHorn: oh wait
[2012-05-12 04:25:47 -0400] LinuxHorn: no
[2012-05-12 04:25:48 -0400] LinuxHorn: non
[2012-05-12 04:25:50 -0400] LinuxHorn: no
[2012-05-12 04:25:55 -0400] LinuxHorn: we do everything from the file
[2012-05-12 04:26:01 -0400] LinuxHorn: sorry, not from knife commands
[2012-05-12 04:26:11 -0400] LinuxHorn: only thing we might ever change with knife command is the run_list
[2012-05-12 04:26:47 -0400] LinuxHorn: how do you upload a node config file?
[2012-05-12 04:26:47 -0400] miah: are there hand crafted attributes on the node that matter?
[2012-05-12 04:26:57 -0400] knuckolls_: yeah i think that's the crux of it
[2012-05-12 04:27:01 -0400] LinuxHorn: no, everything comes from recipes, roles, and env's
[2012-05-12 04:27:04 -0400] miah: if everything is just autoassigned by your cookbooks just create a new node
[2012-05-12 04:27:10 -0400] knuckolls_: yeah just create a new node
[2012-05-12 04:27:11 -0400] LinuxHorn: we never set attributes directly on a node
[2012-05-12 04:27:13 -0400] miah: nake sure it has the same roles etc
[2012-05-12 04:27:22 -0400] knuckolls_: it should theoretically be identical
[2012-05-12 04:27:22 -0400] LinuxHorn: too easy to miss if you need to recreate the node or build a similar one
[2012-05-12 04:27:39 -0400] knuckolls_: here's what i do when i'm working with a dead ec2 instance
[2012-05-12 04:28:04 -0400] knuckolls_: knife ec2 server delete i-xxxxx && knife node delete <node name> && knife client delete <node name>
[2012-05-12 04:28:12 -0400] knuckolls_: the next bootstrap will recreate it all
[2012-05-12 04:28:37 -0400] knuckolls_: just run the same bootstrap command you did initially and as long as all the cookbooks and roles are the same on the chef server you'll get an identical server
[2012-05-12 04:29:20 -0400] LinuxHorn: the initial bootstrap command only had one thing in run list
[2012-05-12 04:29:25 -0400] LinuxHorn: and we added everything else later
[2012-05-12 04:29:39 -0400] knuckolls_: k so just make a new node with whatever the run_list was when it died
[2012-05-12 04:29:47 -0400] LinuxHorn: but i could just put the base role in the bootstrap, and then edit the run list manually to add everything else back in
[2012-05-12 04:30:01 -0400] knuckolls_: if you want to do that
[2012-05-12 04:30:34 -0400] knuckolls_: i think it shouldn't matter
[2012-05-12 04:30:41 -0400] knuckolls_: you can add all the cookbooks in just like it is now
[2012-05-12 04:30:59 -0400] knuckolls_: as long as the run_list is in the order they were applied i suppose
[2012-05-12 04:31:11 -0400] LinuxHorn: could i just do a "knife node from file <file.json>? after the initial bootstrap using my backed up json of the current node config?
[2012-05-12 04:31:11 -0400] knuckolls_: are you working to make sure your cookbooks are idempotent?
[2012-05-12 04:31:18 -0400] LinuxHorn: and then re-run chef-client
[2012-05-12 04:31:25 -0400] knuckolls_: good question, i've never done that but it's not a bad idea
[2012-05-12 04:32:08 -0400] knuckolls_: the only thing that should matter is the run list though
[2012-05-12 04:32:23 -0400] knuckolls_: which you can grab out of the .json node backup file and just plop it in the bootstrap command
[2012-05-12 04:32:52 -0400] LinuxHorn: right
[2012-05-12 04:33:07 -0400] LinuxHorn: we are using the chef_backup script from opscode to dump the node config to json btw
[2012-05-12 04:33:50 -0400] knuckolls_: then doing the knife node from file will likely work, but like i said i've never done that :)
[2012-05-12 04:34:21 -0400] LinuxHorn: i hear ya
[2012-05-12 04:34:55 -0400] LinuxHorn: turns out we have a backup image on our rackspace account, but it's from december  still, if we can apply that and then just run chef-client this is all a moot point
[2012-05-12 04:35:03 -0400] LinuxHorn: that would by far be easiest
[2012-05-12 04:35:29 -0400] miah: not really
[2012-05-12 04:35:29 -0400] knuckolls_: i tend to try to make all my cookbooks really idempotent and keep my roles real clean. like i have a node-load-balancer role that just encapsulates it's run list. keep that in git, control the cookbook versions with environments and spork
[2012-05-12 04:35:38 -0400] knuckolls_: i think making a brand new node would be the easiest
[2012-05-12 04:35:42 -0400] miah: just rebuild the node. if all the attributes are automatic then there is no reason to restore anything.
[2012-05-12 04:37:52 -0400] LinuxHorn: gonna do it in a bit
[2012-05-12 04:37:57 -0400] LinuxHorn: thanks for the help all
[2012-05-12 04:38:27 -0400] knuckolls_: np good luck ;)
[2012-05-12 05:56:06 -0400] id2: hello. is it possible to alter attributes inside LWRP? it seems like node instance is accessible and when i log attributes from inside LWRP - it seems like they are altered. but outside LWRP, in next resource being applied, the changes are gone. am i doing smth. wrong and there are some limitations?
[2012-05-12 07:14:52 -0400] id2: it looks like node.save inside LWRP is the key
[2012-05-12 07:23:50 -0400] hoover_damm: unless solo
[2012-05-12 08:13:24 -0400] vdvluc: morning chefs
[2012-05-12 08:58:31 -0400] specialsauce: woah, you can break chef by adding or removing an entry in a client's host file
[2012-05-12 08:58:56 -0400] specialsauce: on centos5 if you have a FQDN host entry for it, the client key won't match if its been generated against a FQDN client name
[2012-05-12 12:26:57 -0400] raz: can someone please apply this patch and push
[2012-05-12 12:26:57 -0400] raz: http://gist.github.com/2666295
[2012-05-12 12:27:23 -0400] raz: i hereby transfer total ownership over that giant patch to opscode, etc.
[2012-05-12 12:34:50 -0400] specialsauce: hehe, epic patch
[2012-05-12 12:35:36 -0400] raz: yea, in current chef you simply can't set the no-sudo option
[2012-05-12 12:35:46 -0400] raz: which is a bit of a pita when you're not using ubuntu
[2012-05-12 12:37:22 -0400] raz: perhaps there's a way to override in knife.rb or such, but i couldn't make that work
[2012-05-12 12:50:34 -0400] specialsauce: i'm pretty new to the world of ruby but stuff is so fresh/untested I'm basically patching everything locally as I go just to get it to work, its a brave new world for me
[2012-05-12 12:50:42 -0400] specialsauce: i do need to start commiting stuff back
[2012-05-12 13:22:24 -0400] yfeldblum: raz, http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/How+to+Contribute
[2012-05-12 13:23:45 -0400] yfeldblum: raz, it's a PITA, but unfortunately opscode does not use #chef as their overarching issue-tracking system
[2012-05-12 13:24:32 -0400] yfeldblum: raz, they use tickets.opscode.com instead (they don't use pull requests, since they had already been using tickets.opscode.com well before github introduced pull requests)
[2012-05-12 14:03:03 -0400] specialsauce: is there an easy way to import a client into couchdb from a saved pem file?
[2012-05-12 14:03:24 -0400] specialsauce: i have a bunch of PEM files saved for my clients and want to re-import them into a second chef server instance
[2012-05-12 14:27:42 -0400] raz: yfeldblum: repeating that doesn't make it better :)
[2012-05-12 14:48:50 -0400] codebeaker: hi all, can anyone cast a quick look at https://github.com/fnichol/chef-ruby_build - and tell me, as a beginner, am I missing something, I don't see how to use that to install a ruby version (JSON node config, chef-solo)
[2012-05-12 14:53:00 -0400] codebeaker: or is the idea to use this repository to create one's own recipes
[2012-05-12 14:55:55 -0400] specialsauce: from the documentation the cookbook "Build and install a Ruby from a definition file" - you set an attribute of where to fetch the ruby build definition file from (git repo url) and another attribute of where to build the ruby binary to
[2012-05-12 14:56:01 -0400] specialsauce: is that what you're trying to achieve?
[2012-05-12 14:56:13 -0400] specialsauce: codebreaker: ^
[2012-05-12 14:56:26 -0400] codebeaker: specialsauce: thanks for picking me up -- I'd like it to install Ruby via ruby-build (takes care of nonsense about Ruby missing readline/etc)
[2012-05-12 14:56:40 -0400] codebeaker:  but so far it's installed ruby-build, but I can't seem to make it install a ruby
[2012-05-12 14:56:55 -0400] specialsauce: have you set the needed attributes as given in the documentation?
[2012-05-12 14:57:09 -0400] codebeaker: I believe so
[2012-05-12 14:57:10 -0400] specialsauce: yuo need to make sure your node is being set an attribute for the git url, path to install etc
[2012-05-12 14:57:21 -0400] codebeaker: but I don't see which attribute is supposed to install a ruby
[2012-05-12 14:57:33 -0400] codebeaker: and the cookbook's recipe definition doesn't seem to ever install a ruby
[2012-05-12 14:57:35 -0400] specialsauce: ok, you can check if the node is getting these attributes by using "knife node show -l [nodename]"
[2012-05-12 14:59:11 -0400] codebeaker: ok, and the attributes should be simple: https://gist.github.com/c52ba2549efeef95f21c
[2012-05-12 14:59:13 -0400] codebeaker: is what I have
[2012-05-12 14:59:24 -0400] codebeaker: but I don't see the connection between LWRPs and the attribute lsit
[2012-05-12 14:59:25 -0400] codebeaker: list*
[2012-05-12 15:00:18 -0400] codebeaker: and here, doesn't look like it does anything to read attributes for whic Ruby to install - https://github.com/fnichol/chef-ruby_build/blob/master/recipes/default.rb
[2012-05-12 15:00:37 -0400] specialsauce: ok, unfortunately i'm just heading off for the day so I was just making a quck hit-and-run suggestion but it sounds like you've loked into it more than i have time t do right now
[2012-05-12 15:01:07 -0400] codebeaker: specialsauce: thanks, I appreciate your time - I think tbh the cookbook doesn't include features for installing the rubies
[2012-05-12 15:01:18 -0400] codebeaker: I think it's providing something to provide other recipes to install ruby
[2012-05-12 15:01:22 -0400] codebeaker: but not via attributes
[2012-05-12 15:01:25 -0400] codebeaker: which seems odd
[2012-05-12 15:01:59 -0400] specialsauce: yeah i'm not familiar witht he cookbook at this point i'm afraid other than a quick scan of the docs, sorry haven't got time to help properly
[2012-05-12 15:02:11 -0400] codebeaker: np, have a good day, appreciate your time :)
[2012-05-12 15:08:21 -0400] Dr_Agon: Hi all! Can anybody help me? Is there a way to get cookbook name from recipe in this cookbook?
[2012-05-12 15:12:03 -0400] eherot: you mean like get the name of the parent cookbook of the current running recipe?
[2012-05-12 15:12:47 -0400] Dr_Agon: yep, exactly!
[2012-05-12 15:15:50 -0400] eherot: trouble is, I don't know offhand.  ;-)  Although there are various ways of referencing the parent method in ruby but I don't know if that will actually be of use here
[2012-05-12 15:16:11 -0400] eherot: i'll see if I can figure it out and get back to you if you haven't figured it out on your own by then
[2012-05-12 15:17:33 -0400] Dr_Agon: that would be great! I actually know how to get this from within provider: we have new_resource.cookbook_name there.
[2012-05-12 15:18:01 -0400] Dr_Agon: But it does not help me very much
[2012-05-12 15:23:05 -0400] dcrosta: Is it possible to upload cookbooks to the community site which use metadata.rb only (and not metadata.json)? Also, is there a way to connect the community site directly to my github, rather than having to upload a tar ball?
[2012-05-12 15:56:15 -0400] cnf: damned cfwiki is still down!
[2012-05-12 16:21:36 -0400] eherot: Dr_Agon (if you decide to come back!): self.cookbook_name
[2012-05-12 16:23:32 -0400] raz: fyi, mdadm resource is broken on debian squeeze (--bitmap option does not exist)
[2012-05-12 16:32:06 -0400] raz: actually.. this should not work on any distro...
[2012-05-12 17:20:30 -0400] hoover_damm: why do people still use mdadm?
[2012-05-12 17:20:34 -0400] hoover_damm: is device-mapper not enough?
[2012-05-12 18:15:48 -0400] raz: mdadm is still the standard way to make a softraid
[2012-05-12 18:15:51 -0400] raz: unless i missed something
[2012-05-12 18:33:45 -0400] raz: hmm
[2012-05-12 18:34:16 -0400] raz: however it seems i'm the only one actually using it. that mdadm resource is definitely broken on 10.10...
[2012-05-12 18:35:44 -0400] raz: gnah.. now i need to find a way to bootstrap with an older/patched chef
[2012-05-12 19:11:10 -0400] rayrod2030: will the default bootstrap script work with 12.04?
[2012-05-12 19:11:40 -0400] cwj: rayrod2030: theres a 12.04 template in chef 0.10.10 which shipped yesterday
[2012-05-12 19:13:08 -0400] rayrod2030: cwj: thanks.  Hunting the file down now
[2012-05-12 19:14:19 -0400] cwj: anyone tried the pennyworth example jobs recently? out of the box i have some stuff failing
[2012-05-12 19:15:14 -0400] cwj: the ruby1.9.3-full package is built and installed successfully, but the resulting ruby doesn't work
[2012-05-12 19:15:33 -0400] cwj: <internal:gem_prelude>:1:in `require': cannot load such file -- rubygems.rb (LoadError) from <internal:gem_prelude>:1:in `<compiled>'
[2012-05-12 19:33:10 -0400] rayrod2030: upgrading from .10.8 to .10.10 is just a matter up upgrading the chef gem?
[2012-05-12 19:34:18 -0400] cwj: assuming thats how the former was installed, yeah
[2012-05-12 19:36:43 -0400] hoover_damm: ruby1.9.3-full?
[2012-05-12 19:36:45 -0400] hoover_damm: no such package
[2012-05-12 19:36:49 -0400] hoover_damm: ruby-1.9.1-full no?
[2012-05-12 19:36:52 -0400] hoover_damm: that's actually 1.9.3
[2012-05-12 19:37:14 -0400] hoover_damm: but sounds like your ruby1.9.3-full is missing rubygems
[2012-05-12 19:37:22 -0400] cwj: right
[2012-05-12 19:37:24 -0400] hoover_damm: that should have come with ruby
[2012-05-12 19:37:29 -0400] hoover_damm: as of 1.9.2 rubygems comes with ruby
[2012-05-12 19:37:50 -0400] cwj: just expected these example jobs to work, but its ok
[2012-05-12 19:38:02 -0400] cwj: pennyworth is still pretty awesome
[2012-05-12 19:38:24 -0400] hoover_damm: I unfortunately have the package manager mentality.  So Pennyworth scares me
[2012-05-12 19:38:30 -0400] rayrod2030: for automated deployment from jenkins?
[2012-05-12 19:38:44 -0400] cwj: automated packaging via jenkins
[2012-05-12 19:38:56 -0400] rayrod2030: interesting.
[2012-05-12 19:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: yep, automate packages with fpm and provide the code to build it
[2012-05-12 19:39:02 -0400] hoover_damm: with a simple json databag
[2012-05-12 19:39:22 -0400] hoover_damm: it will work for people who don't care about packaging and just want 'x' with 'y' and now.
[2012-05-12 19:39:28 -0400] hoover_damm: and have it work
[2012-05-12 19:39:59 -0400] cwj: i would like to start using it to package python modules that our django app depends on
[2012-05-12 19:40:19 -0400] hoover_damm: you don't use virtualenv?
[2012-05-12 19:40:24 -0400] cwj: i do
[2012-05-12 19:40:38 -0400] hoover_damm: then packaging up  your python modules pretty much nils out with virtualenv
[2012-05-12 19:40:53 -0400] hoover_damm: as generally python setup.py install will drop it in the system
[2012-05-12 19:40:56 -0400] cwj: i use chef to configure the virtualenv and pip install packages, but 0.10.10 has broken some of it
[2012-05-12 19:41:09 -0400] hoover_damm: hrm, pip is kinda broken I agree
[2012-05-12 19:41:13 -0400] hoover_damm: but only in the sense of the username
[2012-05-12 19:41:31 -0400] hoover_damm: in my graphite cookbook I chown /opt/graphite to graphite:graphite because virtualenv runs as root
[2012-05-12 19:41:40 -0400] hoover_damm: and the resource doesn't honor the user option (and I haven't patched it)
[2012-05-12 19:41:53 -0400] cwj: the problem i am having is that there are some modules i only get from remote vcs
[2012-05-12 19:41:55 -0400] hoover_damm: outside of that what's wrong with the python cookbook
[2012-05-12 19:42:01 -0400] hoover_damm: right
[2012-05-12 19:42:11 -0400] hoover_damm: you should have a tarball for those
[2012-05-12 19:42:15 -0400] cwj: under 0.10.8 they would just install every time
[2012-05-12 19:42:25 -0400] cwj: which is dumb but i was living with it
[2012-05-12 19:42:29 -0400] cwj: under 0.10.10 they fail
[2012-05-12 19:42:31 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/damm/graphite/blob/master/recipes/default.rb#L55
[2012-05-12 19:42:40 -0400] hoover_damm: that little thing there?
[2012-05-12 19:43:00 -0400] cwj: is that idempotent for you?
[2012-05-12 19:43:01 -0400] hoover_damm: that works for me in 0.10.10
[2012-05-12 19:43:17 -0400] hoover_damm: it appeared to be
[2012-05-12 19:43:21 -0400] hoover_damm: but I could be wrong
[2012-05-12 19:43:23 -0400] cwj: ok
[2012-05-12 19:43:27 -0400] cwj: i will try that
[2012-05-12 20:20:02 -0400] cwj:   0.10.10 poops the bed when i use python_pip to install a module from a remote revision control or a remote tarball url
[2012-05-12 20:21:05 -0400] cwj: the provider's load_current_resource tries to find the url in the output of pip freeze, which will always fail
[2012-05-12 20:21:42 -0400] cwj: whats curious to me is why that changes between chef versions as the cookbook providing the python_pip lwrp remains the same
[2012-05-12 20:28:38 -0400] hoover_damm: i'd need to see a strack trace or see more
[2012-05-12 20:28:48 -0400] hoover_damm: because I can't really say without knowing more
[2012-05-12 20:40:54 -0400] BryanWB_: ohai chefs! i'm on my way!
[2012-05-12 21:00:38 -0400] miah: yay
[2012-05-12 21:00:52 -0400] miah: i think tomorrow is bbq day =)
[2012-05-12 21:07:02 -0400] BryanWB_: miah sounds great, i love bbqs
[2012-05-12 21:12:13 -0400] miah: awesome
[2012-05-12 21:12:18 -0400] miah: =)
[2012-05-12 21:12:36 -0400] miah: girlfriend is flying tonight. i thought she was leaving tuesday. :/ but still. bbq will be yums.
[2012-05-12 21:18:12 -0400] miah: i hope nobody is allergic to cats though.. because i am a crazy cat lady with _2_ cats.
[2012-05-12 21:18:26 -0400] miah: (or maybe just a crazy lady)
[2012-05-12 23:15:29 -0400] rayrod2030: anybody know of a good mysql 5.5 cookbook anywhere?
[2012-05-12 23:29:53 -0400] miah: no. i use percona =)
