[2012-05-11 00:11:35 -0400] __chrisf__: Is there a bug in 0.10.4 where environment files with blank env_run_lists for a defined environment don't actually fall back onto the default run_list?
[2012-05-11 00:12:29 -0400] __chrisf__: I just tested where env_run_lists: { sandbox: [] }, run_list: { "recipe[one]", "recipe[two]" } doesn't work
[2012-05-11 00:12:55 -0400] __chrisf__: as in, if I launch with knife ec2 server create --environment sandbox, the reported run list is []
[2012-05-11 00:13:27 -0400] __chrisf__: but if I duplicate the default run_list into the env_run_lists: { sandbox: [  ] }, it runs as expected
[2012-05-11 00:31:20 -0400] hoover_damm: and your on 0.10.4 why?
[2012-05-11 00:33:06 -0400] miah: i dont believe its meant to fall back to _default
[2012-05-11 00:33:18 -0400] miah: if you define a empty run list, thats what you get
[2012-05-11 00:34:04 -0400] miah: the "_default" environment is still an environment
[2012-05-11 00:34:53 -0400] miah: new hosts created without an environment defined will be assigned to it, but that doesn't mean it holds higher weight if a host's runlist is empty
[2012-05-11 00:52:18 -0400] Kwanasolis: o/

[2012-05-11 02:18:41 -0400] gchristensen: Can I use LWRPs in a role file? Or do I have to put them in a reciope?
[2012-05-11 02:43:46 -0400] yfeldblum: gchristensen, roles set up data in attributes and set up pieces of the run-list; cookbooks create a list of resources, whether the built-in resources or whether your own lightweight resources
[2012-05-11 02:43:58 -0400] yfeldblum: recipes* create a list of resources
[2012-05-11 02:44:14 -0400] gchristensen: yeah it was a silly question
[2012-05-11 02:44:25 -0400] gchristensen: I've been at this for $lotsof hours and getting silly
[2012-05-11 02:45:07 -0400] yfeldblum: heh
[2012-05-11 02:59:41 -0400] jnh: Hey all. I'm using a runit_service to start a thin cluster for a rails app. the template resource that contains the config file for thin notifies the service of restart but that throws an exception if the service isnt running. Ideas?
[2012-05-11 03:00:56 -0400] LinuxHorn: dumb question for y'all
[2012-05-11 03:02:41 -0400] LinuxHorn: in a recipe, what would an if statement look like to only do something if a specific node attribute exists?  specifically node[:buildbot][:other_slaves]
[2012-05-11 03:03:03 -0400] LinuxHorn: (very new to ruby/chef)
[2012-05-11 03:07:55 -0400] mehlah: LinuxHorn if node[:buildbot][:other_slaves]
[2012-05-11 03:07:55 -0400] mehlah: end
[2012-05-11 03:08:09 -0400] LinuxHorn: that simple?
[2012-05-11 03:08:13 -0400] LinuxHorn: hmmm
[2012-05-11 03:08:28 -0400] LinuxHorn: thought it would need an "exists" or something
[2012-05-11 03:09:02 -0400] atomic-penguin: There is an .exists? method
[2012-05-11 03:09:24 -0400] LinuxHorn: but it's not needed?
[2012-05-11 03:09:25 -0400] atomic-penguin: But do you want to know if its set, or if it exist
[2012-05-11 03:09:44 -0400] LinuxHorn: if it exists
[2012-05-11 03:10:12 -0400] LinuxHorn: i'm going to have a recipe that needs to use it, but only if the node has a specific other role
[2012-05-11 03:10:30 -0400] LinuxHorn: and that role is setting the default attribute of [:buildbot][:other_slaves]
[2012-05-11 03:10:53 -0400] LinuxHorn: so if role B is running the recipe i want it to skip this section
[2012-05-11 03:11:16 -0400] yfeldblum: if node["buildbot"].has_key?("other_slaves")
[2012-05-11 03:12:40 -0400] atomic-penguin: ^^
[2012-05-11 03:12:45 -0400] atomic-penguin: what he said
[2012-05-11 03:13:14 -0400] atomic-penguin: using ohai attributes as conditionals is unreliable, as they could be set to true or false
[2012-05-11 03:13:35 -0400] atomic-penguin: ...any attributes for that matter
[2012-05-11 03:14:35 -0400] LinuxHorn: that makes sense
[2012-05-11 03:14:41 -0400] atomic-penguin: Only use them as conditionals, if you know they're set that way.
[2012-05-11 03:15:17 -0400] LinuxHorn: but, i created the ["buildbot"] section under default attributes specifically for other_slaves
[2012-05-11 03:15:27 -0400] LinuxHorn: if other_slaves is not there, buildbot won't be either
[2012-05-11 03:15:49 -0400] yfeldblum: if node.has_key?("buildbot") && node["buildbot"].has_key?("other_slaves")
[2012-05-11 03:16:36 -0400] LinuxHorn: i c
[2012-05-11 03:16:51 -0400] yfeldblum: latez
[2012-05-11 03:17:59 -0400] LinuxHorn: thanks all

[2012-05-11 07:58:29 -0400] linuxboy_: I seem to be getting different results from running chef-client manually then to just letting the daemon run
[2012-05-11 08:11:24 -0400] vdvluc: linuxboy_: When you run the daemon, from a startup script, it probably passes some parameters that make chef-client behave in a certain way
[2012-05-11 08:12:36 -0400] vdvluc: linuxboy_: but these parameters should not influence the chef run results, just the daemon itself
[2012-05-11 08:24:04 -0400] m4rcu5: does anyone have experiance running Chef on OpenBSD?
[2012-05-11 08:24:16 -0400] linuxboy_: vdvluc: thats what I figured :/

[2012-05-11 08:41:06 -0400] BryanWB: at least not yet
[2012-05-11 08:41:29 -0400] BryanWB: m4rcu5: andreacampi has done a lot running chef on FreeBSD
[2012-05-11 08:41:31 -0400] jeekl: BryanWB: Anyone working on it?
[2012-05-11 08:43:16 -0400] m4rcu5: BryanWB: so it is possible :) i will do some testing today then to see if it can be done without overbloating the box
[2012-05-11 08:43:35 -0400] m4rcu5: jeekl: there was some heafty discussion about it on the mailing list
[2012-05-11 08:43:35 -0400] BryanWB: jeekl: opscode is

[2012-05-11 08:47:08 -0400] BryanWB: jeekl: not a killer feature imho
[2012-05-11 08:47:16 -0400] BryanWB: jeekl: as it was often wrong in puppet
[2012-05-11 08:47:21 -0400] m4rcu5: jeekl: have a look: http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2012-02/msg00237.html
[2012-05-11 08:47:44 -0400] BryanWB: much better off using chef-minitest and a vagrant box
[2012-05-11 08:49:54 -0400] jeekl: Yeah, I'm trying to put more chef stuff in jenkins to test changes and deploys, but I still think a dry run option would be very helpful.

[2012-05-11 08:51:14 -0400] BryanWB: jeekl: check out chefspec
[2012-05-11 08:54:40 -0400] m4rcu5: the real way to test for me is something like chef-solo

[2012-05-11 10:28:25 -0400] Osax: I've created a cookbook vhosts which contains include_recipe "apache2" & using the web_app definition exactly as in https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/tree/master/apache2
[2012-05-11 10:28:38 -0400] Osax: now I get : Chef::Mixin::Template::TemplateError (undefined method `each' for nil:NilClass) on line #3:    1: <VirtualHost *:80>   2:   ServerName <%= @params['server_name'] %>   3:   ServerAlias <% @params['server_aliases'].each do |a| %><%= "#{a}" %> <% end %>   4:   DocumentRoot <%= @params['docroot'] %>   5:   RewriteEngine On
[2012-05-11 10:29:37 -0400] Osax: I've copied the default apache template into my cookbook, but it seach there is no "each" method....what could I be doing wrong?
[2012-05-11 10:30:33 -0400] Osax: Seems to be a simple task to achieve, but isn't working for some reason
[2012-05-11 10:31:08 -0400] Osax: any ideas?
[2012-05-11 10:34:12 -0400] Osax: Could this be a issue with the apache2 recipe?
[2012-05-11 10:34:53 -0400] m4rcu5: Osax: seems there are no aliases defined? is it in the attributes or set somewhere?
[2012-05-11 10:35:36 -0400] Osax: Thats kinda what I made from it, however I feed all the data into it:   server_aliases [node['fqdn'], "my-site.example.com"]
[2012-05-11 10:35:54 -0400] Osax: I also tried   server_aliases ["test.example.com", "my-site.example.com"]
[2012-05-11 10:36:09 -0400] Osax: just incase the fqdn attribute isnt set
[2012-05-11 10:36:50 -0400] Osax: I literately copied & pasted the example from  https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/tree/master/apache2
[2012-05-11 10:40:22 -0400] Osax: Also is there a way to comment out the code in the templates?
[2012-05-11 10:54:34 -0400] Osax: So is everyone really dumb-struct by the problem, I understand that the template is not getting it the data it needs which is why it fails...can someone please confirm if this is a bug I should log or if Im just doing something wrong?
[2012-05-11 10:58:11 -0400] Osax: Im using version [1.1.8] of the apache cookbook

[2012-05-11 11:07:42 -0400] gale: BryanWB, just the job thanks :)
[2012-05-11 11:08:00 -0400] gale: obvious I should have tried "pychef" before asking
[2012-05-11 11:08:13 -0400] BryanWB: gale: also, if u do some serious work w/ python and chef, u should hit up coderanger
[2012-05-11 11:08:23 -0400] BryanWB: iirc he used to be a core python dev

[2012-05-11 11:31:11 -0400] ukio: but Rome sounds a little bit more warm ;-)

[2012-05-11 11:33:12 -0400] BryanWB: ukio: don't know, i think 0.10.10 rc4 came out last night, so seems imminent
[2012-05-11 11:33:22 -0400] BryanWB: but next week is chefconf, so likely not
[2012-05-11 11:33:59 -0400] ukio: ok, sounds good
[2012-05-11 11:34:03 -0400] ukio: i'm preparing a workshop to be held on may 21st

[2012-05-11 11:34:57 -0400] ukio: would it be wise to upgrade to 0.10.10 rc4 or rather stick with 0.10.8 - what do you think?
[2012-05-11 11:36:30 -0400] BryanWB: ukio: no idea, what does 0.10.10 offer that u really need/
[2012-05-11 11:36:31 -0400] BryanWB: ?
[2012-05-11 11:36:42 -0400] BryanWB: btw, i have no idea what 0.10.10 contains
[2012-05-11 11:37:55 -0400] ukio: BryanWB: good question - i need to reflect over that... :-)
[2012-05-11 11:38:26 -0400] ukio: acutally there's nothing special i would need, just thought that i might get some bug fixes with it...
[2012-05-11 11:38:59 -0400] ukio: ...and wanted to ship an up-to-date version on the lab vms
[2012-05-11 11:40:04 -0400] gale: ukio - what are the lab vms for out of interest?
[2012-05-11 11:40:04 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB, so ... travis-ci needs to support windows ...
[2012-05-11 11:42:10 -0400] BryanWB: yfeldblum: windows? doe people still use that old thing?
[2012-05-11 11:43:26 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB, https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian/issues/68
[2012-05-11 11:44:08 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB, apparently, some people like to let you know about regressions on windows within hours
[2012-05-11 11:44:43 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB, because they're using windows or something
[2012-05-11 11:45:13 -0400] gale: windows?
[2012-05-11 11:45:14 -0400] bawt: windows is http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installation+on+Windows
[2012-05-11 11:45:44 -0400] gale: seems a fooling thing to do that
[2012-05-11 11:45:49 -0400] gale: foolish
[2012-05-11 11:48:51 -0400] ukio: gale: it's a chef-server vm and some vagrant base boxes that come bundled with a pre-configured chef-repo. the idea is that people fire up a vagrant vm (chef-server) and can start immediately playing with chef
[2012-05-11 11:49:25 -0400] gale: ukio: cool idea
[2012-05-11 11:52:19 -0400] ukio: gale: thx :-)
[2012-05-11 11:53:47 -0400] gale: ukio: got a url I can point people at?
[2012-05-11 11:54:55 -0400] BryanWB: yfeldblum: that must be hard to support, don't know if I would be willing to unless paid to
[2012-05-11 11:55:01 -0400] fraggeln: Do i just untar a cookbook and place it in the cookbooks'dir, or do I need to do something else?
[2012-05-11 11:55:15 -0400] fraggeln: <-- totaly new to chef.
[2012-05-11 11:55:25 -0400] ukio: gale: unfortunately not - it's not in a state yet where it could be published yet.
[2012-05-11 11:56:32 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB, heh ... well i just pushed a fix for a related *nix issue, and hopefully it helps on windows too
[2012-05-11 11:57:11 -0400] gale: ukio: please let me know when it is, I know of a few peeps that would be interested in a hands on demo environment like that
[2012-05-11 11:57:26 -0400] ukio: gale: but the idea is to have a zip package with all you need to get started with chef (on windoze - did i mention that :-/), i.e. ruby, vagrant, chef, veewee, preconfigured chef server and vagrant boxes, etc...
[2012-05-11 11:58:18 -0400] ukio: gale: sure i will - once it's ready i would come back here or to the chef mailing list for your feedback first
[2012-05-11 11:58:59 -0400] jtimberman: jeekl: "dry run" mode will ship later this year. active work is being done in a branch.
[2012-05-11 11:59:27 -0400] gale: ukio: some of the people I have in mind are cursed with windows so they'd like that - plus probably relatively little work to port to linux or os x anyway
[2012-05-11 12:03:12 -0400] ukio: gale: good to know that there is interest in that - i will let you know definitely as soon as something usable is ready
[2012-05-11 12:10:23 -0400] BryanWB: fraggeln: correct
[2012-05-11 12:20:42 -0400] ukio: some of you mentioned travis-ci previously - can it also host the binaries it builds (e.g. like vagrant baseboxes built with veewee)?
[2012-05-11 12:27:01 -0400] geekbri: Am I being a bonehead?  Im creating a knife plugin, and I want to have a base file thats included in it... but when i do require 'chef/knife/basefile.rb' it can't find it.  I assume this is because i have my plugin in my .chef/plugins/knife directory.  Should i just give it the full path in that case, until i turn my plugin into a gem?
[2012-05-11 12:32:11 -0400] BryanWB: ukio: don't think so
[2012-05-11 12:33:53 -0400] ukio: BryanWB: would have been my guess too... so then the practice is probably to push the binaries to a maven repo / gem repo / s3 / etc.. ?
[2012-05-11 12:37:23 -0400] BryanWB: ukio: believe so
[2012-05-11 12:38:01 -0400] oponder: Hey chefmeisters, is it safe / smart to add environment variables with passwords to your database, so your applications can auto configure?
[2012-05-11 12:40:10 -0400] BryanWB: oponder: i recommend using encrypted databags instead
[2012-05-11 12:40:49 -0400] oponder: ah! smart
[2012-05-11 12:41:01 -0400] BryanWB: oponder: quite nice to work w/
[2012-05-11 12:41:58 -0400] jperry2: can the passwords be encrypted on the server side?
[2012-05-11 12:42:38 -0400] atomic-penguin: jperry2, that would be the point of using the data bags, you can encrypt them on the chef server
[2012-05-11 12:43:10 -0400] BryanWB: jperry2: tks for tip about :bridged mode in vagrant
[2012-05-11 12:43:35 -0400] jperry2: okay I just want to be sure for some reason I remember them not being encrypted when I view the encrypted databag in the chef server ui
[2012-05-11 12:43:50 -0400] jperry2: BryanWB: np
[2012-05-11 12:44:31 -0400] BryanWB: also, i have a fork of minitest-hanlder-cookbook that works /w chef-solo
[2012-05-11 12:44:36 -0400] BryanWB: mya interest u
[2012-05-11 12:44:57 -0400] jperry2: BryanWB: the only problem with the :bridge option is if you have ethernet and airport networks you get prompted
[2012-05-11 12:45:31 -0400] jperry2: BryanWB: but you can specify the full name but if you are working with a bunch of people that have different names it will still prompt
[2012-05-11 12:46:27 -0400] BryanWB: jperry2: ah, i use linux so haven't seen that
[2012-05-11 12:46:36 -0400] jperry2: BryanWB: thx about the minitest-handler-cookbook for chef-solo but we are using chef server
[2012-05-11 12:47:15 -0400] jperry2: I may look into it though as it could allow you to test locally
[2012-05-11 12:47:21 -0400] jperry2: before pushing to the server
[2012-05-11 12:47:46 -0400] jperry2: my only grip is that you have to put stuff through your code to check if you are running with chef-solo since some things don't work
[2012-05-11 12:47:59 -0400] jperry2: s/grip/gripe/
[2012-05-11 12:49:44 -0400] BryanWB: jperry2: i use it when testing at home w/ vagrant vms
[2012-05-11 12:49:55 -0400] BryanWB: jperry2: y, it's a bit annoying
[2012-05-11 12:50:09 -0400] jperry2: yeah something I will need to think about
[2012-05-11 12:50:26 -0400] jperry2: but good to know you add that functionality
[2012-05-11 12:50:35 -0400] jperry2: I'll put a watch on it as a reminder
[2012-05-11 12:50:37 -0400] jperry2: thx
[2012-05-11 13:31:29 -0400] __chrisf__: if my knife ssh command for a node suddenly stops working because of error "FATAL: no nodes returned from search!" does that mean something is happening with my Solr component of Chef Server? This command worked just fine for months
[2012-05-11 13:44:09 -0400] geekbri: Is there a sensible way to create a Module that is shared by a bunch of knife plugins.  I dont want to create this file as a Chef::Knife subclass because I dont want it to be included in the knife sub command list... and I also do
[2012-05-11 13:44:27 -0400] geekbri: don't want it to have to be instantiated.  I seem to be having a horrible time simply trying to require the module im creating though
[2012-05-11 13:45:32 -0400] geekbri: oh ok nevermind, what i was doing now decided to magically work for no apparent reason
[2012-05-11 13:58:38 -0400] atomic-penguin: TIL about unicorn and nginx
[2012-05-11 13:59:56 -0400] atomic-penguin: it took an embarrassing amount of time to get a good nginx config
[2012-05-11 14:01:09 -0400] hoover_damm: it does
[2012-05-11 14:01:20 -0400] hoover_damm: and if you use passenger or unicorn it gets sick
[2012-05-11 14:01:34 -0400] hoover_damm: I've never published my nginx configs I use for rails apps... just share it with clients
[2012-05-11 14:01:35 -0400] sampikesley: thin
[2012-05-11 14:01:39 -0400] sampikesley: thin is your friend
[2012-05-11 14:01:45 -0400] hoover_damm: thin has nothing to do with it
[2012-05-11 14:02:42 -0400] cnf: i use nginx for single purpose boxes
[2012-05-11 14:02:46 -0400] cnf: and apache for everything else
[2012-05-11 14:07:08 -0400] geekbri: I use nginx for everything, and apache when I need to.  Which isn't frequently :)
[2012-05-11 14:09:18 -0400] sampikesley: ^ that
[2012-05-11 14:09:59 -0400] geekbri: However, different strokes for different folks.  I haven't got to try it, but i heard apaches newest release is very nice.
[2012-05-11 14:10:25 -0400] geekbri: nginx in my experience can still server more requests with a smaller memory footprint though.
[2012-05-11 14:10:35 -0400] geekbri: And I find it easier to configure, and easier to read other peoples configurations.
[2012-05-11 14:15:55 -0400] cnf: geekbri: yeah, i hear people find that
[2012-05-11 14:16:01 -0400] cnf: for me it's the other way round
[2012-05-11 14:16:23 -0400] cnf: i can read apache config easy, nginx on the other hand, i find less than clear ^^;
[2012-05-11 14:16:29 -0400] geekbri: I mean above all, if you know how to configure apache really well, and you dont know how to configure nginx really well... its better to use what you know how to work better.
[2012-05-11 14:16:36 -0400] geekbri: I mean thats not ALWAYS true... but a lot of times it is.
[2012-05-11 14:18:58 -0400] sampikesley: http://people.apache.org/~rbowen/presentations/apacheconEU2005/hate_apache.pdf
[2012-05-11 14:20:01 -0400] sampikesley: nginx conf is clean and consistent
[2012-05-11 14:20:39 -0400] atomic-penguin: I've seen rbowen speak several times
[2012-05-11 14:21:14 -0400] cnf: sampikesley: matter of opinion
[2012-05-11 14:21:23 -0400] sampikesley: for sure
[2012-05-11 14:21:37 -0400] sampikesley: but my dafault choice now is nginx
[2012-05-11 14:21:51 -0400] sampikesley: and I've been doing this a long time
[2012-05-11 14:22:20 -0400] atomic-penguin: I'm used to apache and its weirdness though
[2012-05-11 14:22:25 -0400] atomic-penguin: I find it comforting
[2012-05-11 14:22:38 -0400] atomic-penguin: Usually easy to troubleshoot
[2012-05-11 14:22:57 -0400] cnf: yeah, indeed
[2012-05-11 14:23:18 -0400] geekbri: the dude who sits 3 feet to my left is an apache lover and in am nginx lover so we often butt heads but... ultimately i dont think either of them is a bad choice
[2012-05-11 14:23:21 -0400] cnf: nginx is just all weird
[2012-05-11 14:23:38 -0400] atomic-penguin: its no weirder than apache honestly
[2012-05-11 14:23:43 -0400] cnf: geekbri: yeah, i agree
[2012-05-11 14:24:02 -0400] cnf: atomic-penguin: oh, true, but i'm used to apache config
[2012-05-11 14:24:07 -0400] atomic-penguin: it seems, to me at least, apache's weirdness is documented more widely though
[2012-05-11 14:24:48 -0400] geekbri: i believe the expression is "the devil you know is better than the devil you don't"
[2012-05-11 14:24:54 -0400] cnf: yep
[2012-05-11 14:25:10 -0400] atomic-penguin: i struggled to put together a good config, 'cause all I could find were examples with unnecessary proxying, or header rewriting on nginx
[2012-05-11 14:25:11 -0400] geekbri: theres a lot of nginx documentation out there now.
[2012-05-11 14:25:33 -0400] cnf: yeah stuff like http://kbeezie.com/view/nginx-configuration-examples/ makes me frown ^^;
[2012-05-11 14:25:36 -0400] geekbri: the nginx wiki is pretty good if youre willing to give it a read through.. especially their pitfalls section
[2012-05-11 14:26:16 -0400] atomic-penguin: hah, the quick and "easy" starter config, of course
[2012-05-11 14:26:22 -0400] geekbri: cnf: that files not all that bad.  I mean the majority of the gunk is just him passing fast cgi params to whatever fcgi he is using
[2012-05-11 14:26:47 -0400] geekbri: that same file in apache's xml wouldn't look all that much nicer :-P
[2012-05-11 14:26:49 -0400] hoover_damm: It's great to see people desire change and using nginx from apache
[2012-05-11 14:27:01 -0400] cnf: geekbri: yeah, why?
[2012-05-11 14:27:04 -0400] hoover_damm: but I really wish people would get over their silly hatred of apache
[2012-05-11 14:27:09 -0400] hoover_damm: Apache's configuration is html style btw
[2012-05-11 14:27:10 -0400] hoover_damm: not xml
[2012-05-11 14:27:19 -0400] geekbri: xhmtl ;)
[2012-05-11 14:27:21 -0400] atomic-penguin: Tomcat is da xml
[2012-05-11 14:27:21 -0400] geekbri: there ya go, now we both win
[2012-05-11 14:27:28 -0400] atomic-penguin: Which is not Apache
[2012-05-11 14:27:42 -0400] hoover_damm: right and if your doing Java XML shouldn't scare you
[2012-05-11 14:27:46 -0400] hoover_damm: and if XML scares you, your editor sucks
[2012-05-11 14:27:50 -0400] geekbri: the nginx configs i write, i think at least, are easy to read and understand.
[2012-05-11 14:27:59 -0400] geekbri: xml doesn't scare me, i just find it to be more verbose than i like.
[2012-05-11 14:28:07 -0400] cnf: i'm not a fan of {} style config stuff in general
[2012-05-11 14:28:09 -0400] atomic-penguin: shibboleth scares me, not the java or xml bit
[2012-05-11 14:28:15 -0400] geekbri: Having dealt with hadoop configurations lately, im tired of xml
[2012-05-11 14:28:30 -0400] hoover_damm: basically I find the excuses for avoiding apache to be pretty weak.  If you wanna avoid apache to just avoid it, cool.
[2012-05-11 14:28:35 -0400] hoover_damm: just don't make up some reason
[2012-05-11 14:28:55 -0400] cnf: and nginx should have something like mod_php ^^;
[2012-05-11 14:29:00 -0400] hoover_damm: they confuse people and teach people an incorrect lesson
[2012-05-11 14:29:07 -0400] geekbri: cnf: ahh but thats not what nginx does, thats why its different than apache!
[2012-05-11 14:29:15 -0400] geekbri: if nginx was just trying to do everything apache did i would call it a total waste.
[2012-05-11 14:29:19 -0400] yfeldblum: Java XML scares me
[2012-05-11 14:29:33 -0400] cnf: geekbri: dealing with php is painful enough
[2012-05-11 14:29:35 -0400] sampikesley: Nginx is cut down
[2012-05-11 14:29:35 -0400] hoover_damm: java xml shouldn't scare you
[2012-05-11 14:29:42 -0400] sampikesley: Like a Ferrari F40
[2012-05-11 14:29:49 -0400] sampikesley: feels much more Unixy
[2012-05-11 14:29:49 -0400] geekbri: cnf: yeah but thats a whole different pain point unrelated to nginx or apache ;)
[2012-05-11 14:29:57 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, basically I learned one thing.  Only thing worse then a Java programmer? is a Ruby programmer who thinks he's better then the Java Programmer.
[2012-05-11 14:30:03 -0400] cnf: geekbri: well, in apache it's drop in, it runs
[2012-05-11 14:30:03 -0400] yfeldblum: <file><import><path><element>org</element><element>apache</element><element>commons</element></path></import></file>
[2012-05-11 14:30:16 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, at EY they managed all their clusters in XML
[2012-05-11 14:30:18 -0400] geekbri: yfeldblum: ^
[2012-05-11 14:30:19 -0400] cnf: hoover_damm: :P
[2012-05-11 14:30:27 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, so we had to man up and get over our xml issues
[2012-05-11 14:30:37 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, and handle editing xml directly
[2012-05-11 14:30:40 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, Java's fine; XML's fine; Java XML scares me
[2012-05-11 14:30:41 -0400] geekbri: I often man up and use xml, but that doesn't mean i have to ever like it!
[2012-05-11 14:30:46 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, see above
[2012-05-11 14:30:59 -0400] hoover_damm: Java serialization on top of xml maybe
[2012-05-11 14:31:08 -0400] hoover_damm: but that gets away from the point
[2012-05-11 14:31:10 -0400] knuckolls: hey so are there any good wrappers for knife for launching servers other than spiceweasel?
[2012-05-11 14:31:28 -0400] geekbri: knuckolls: not that i' have found, i've had to start writing my own knife plugin for us.
[2012-05-11 14:31:49 -0400] knuckolls: geekbri: i will likely have to do the same
[2012-05-11 14:32:10 -0400] knuckolls: i'll at least release it as a gem if i get it nice enough
[2012-05-11 14:32:16 -0400] cnf: ah well, i'll likely one day spend some time getting to know nginx better
[2012-05-11 14:32:19 -0400] geekbri: knuckolls: my goal is to eventually make it generic enough anybody can use it, but we have a pressing need so that will have to wait until I am done just making it work for us
[2012-05-11 14:32:25 -0400] cnf: but atm, i got plenty of other crap to learn ^^;
[2012-05-11 14:33:02 -0400] knuckolls: geekbri: understood. mine will likely go that way initially as well
[2012-05-11 14:33:24 -0400] geekbri: knuckolls: if you need any help with authoring knife plugins im pretty elbow deep in it ATM. Feel free to holler.
[2012-05-11 14:33:28 -0400] geekbri: I can't promise I have all the answers however
[2012-05-11 14:33:37 -0400] knuckolls: geekbri: indeed i will ;) thanks
[2012-05-11 14:37:09 -0400] hoover_damm: you can spend a lifetime learning web operations stack
[2012-05-11 14:37:33 -0400] geekbri: the list never gets shorter, thats for sure.
[2012-05-11 14:38:17 -0400] BryanWB: put haproxy on the list!
[2012-05-11 14:38:28 -0400] hoover_damm: nope
[2012-05-11 14:38:33 -0400] hoover_damm: it's a never ending story that keeps you learning
[2012-05-11 14:39:16 -0400] geekbri: the list can get longer than that!  Varnish, squid can probably be thrown on as well :-P
[2012-05-11 14:39:24 -0400] hoover_damm: totally
[2012-05-11 14:42:35 -0400] KarlHungus: reqs/minute?
[2012-05-11 14:42:48 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-05-11 14:43:04 -0400] KarlHungus: ~700req/s?
[2012-05-11 14:43:18 -0400] hoover_damm: KarlHungus, truthfully Rails customers confuse me.  using Newrelic to determine your RPM and how you scale is weird
[2012-05-11 14:43:26 -0400] KarlHungus: reqs/min is a weird measure =)
[2012-05-11 14:43:38 -0400] cnf: newrelic seems cool
[2012-05-11 14:44:04 -0400] frank____: it is
[2012-05-11 14:44:23 -0400] KarlHungus: we do 200-300 new connections/sec on rails. next time i talk about scaling it, i'll have to use RPM so i can show off a fatter number. haha
[2012-05-11 14:44:58 -0400] KarlHungus: thats fun =)
[2012-05-11 14:45:58 -0400] atomic-penguin: Yay! gitlab cookbook working now
[2012-05-11 14:51:34 -0400] yfeldblum: KarlHungus, you can always use RPY
[2012-05-11 14:51:46 -0400] yfeldblum: "ten bajillion RPY"
[2012-05-11 14:52:14 -0400] KarlHungus: i think it was Theo Schlossnagle who was joking about results per fortnight
[2012-05-11 15:03:47 -0400] BryanWB: atomic-penguin: awesome! i should totally use that
[2012-05-11 15:04:06 -0400] atomic-penguin: Just cleaning it up, should have it out today
[2012-05-11 15:04:29 -0400] atomic-penguin: Setting up gitolite with it was a total brainfuck
[2012-05-11 15:05:11 -0400] BryanWB: atomic-penguin: any ideas on what the hackday should focus on? I want to make it focused enough to get something done but not too focused to kill creativity
[2012-05-11 15:05:44 -0400] btm: BryanWB: fixing my minitest-handler cookbook. :)
[2012-05-11 15:05:44 -0400] atomic-penguin: BryanWB, cook advice, maybe?
[2012-05-11 15:06:19 -0400] atomic-penguin: BryanWB, I totally have a cool feature someone pushed to nfs cookbook, but its not working.  I need another set of eyes for it
[2012-05-11 15:06:21 -0400] BryanWB: atomic-penguin: hmm, we will have varying ability levels, so need something to keep more experiecned people bbusy
[2012-05-11 15:06:29 -0400] BryanWB: atomic-penguin: happy to look at it
[2012-05-11 15:07:03 -0400] BryanWB: atomic-penguin: the focus will be testing, but am wondering whether to focuso on one cookbook and one approach or have everyone add tests to their own cookbooks
[2012-05-11 15:07:15 -0400] atomic-penguin: So I was hoping to get some smarter people to look at it on hackday
[2012-05-11 15:07:23 -0400] BryanWB: btm: what's broken in it? i sent u my chef-solo fix ;)
[2012-05-11 15:07:31 -0400] BryanWB: atomic-penguin: i  look at it
[2012-05-11 15:07:55 -0400] BryanWB: btm: i notice sometimes issues where out-of-date tests left around
[2012-05-11 15:08:18 -0400] atomic-penguin: I've been in deep hack mode on gitlab cb, for a week
[2012-05-11 15:09:24 -0400] BryanWB: atomic-penguin: this one? https://github.com/atomic-penguin/cookbook-nfs/pull/1
[2012-05-11 15:09:45 -0400] BryanWB: looks pretty sweet
[2012-05-11 15:10:05 -0400] atomic-penguin: BryanWB, master is the current rev I have
[2012-05-11 15:10:46 -0400] atomic-penguin: His LWRP throws a no such method on .exists when it encounters a duplicate directory
[2012-05-11 15:10:58 -0400] BryanWB: oops
[2012-05-11 15:11:07 -0400] BryanWB: that would be a sweet lwrp to add tests fro
[2012-05-11 15:11:38 -0400] atomic-penguin: Not even sure it should "check" for duplicity, because you could have one export defined for multiple CIDRs
[2012-05-11 15:12:17 -0400] BryanWB: true
[2012-05-11 15:13:11 -0400] atomic-penguin: So the only way to guard that, is check the whole export line
[2012-05-11 15:14:01 -0400] btm: BryanWB: I haven't had time to play with it, but there was a little drama on a github issue or pull.
[2012-05-11 15:14:21 -0400] atomic-penguin: btm, link to the drama?
[2012-05-11 15:15:30 -0400] BryanWB: btm: oh, i probably fucked up the git rebase, apologies
[2012-05-11 15:16:09 -0400] BryanWB: btm: u mean where calavera kind of pooped on the cookbook?
[2012-05-11 15:16:18 -0400] btm: BryanWB: yeah. :) https://github.com/btm/minitest-handler-cookbook/issues/6#issuecomment-5469882
[2012-05-11 15:16:39 -0400] btm: BryanWB: I lol'd at "pooped on the cookbook"
[2012-05-11 15:16:44 -0400] BryanWB: hehe
[2012-05-11 15:16:44 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-05-11 15:17:09 -0400] hoover_damm: didn't he make rspec-chef?
[2012-05-11 15:17:17 -0400] hoover_damm: or take it from the ey v2 product?
[2012-05-11 15:17:24 -0400] hoover_damm: or one form of it?
[2012-05-11 15:19:01 -0400] btm: hoover_damm: he did make rspec-chef, and the minitest-chef-handler. Because of EY history it was chef-solo focused which is how my minitest-chef-cookbook was born one night in a hotel.
[2012-05-11 15:20:08 -0400] Axsuul: how would I output commands to STDOUt, or whats the proper way to debug?
[2012-05-11 15:20:38 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, you realize they don't understand or have a good argument for using chef-solo still?
[2012-05-11 15:20:44 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, :)
[2012-05-11 15:21:03 -0400] btm: Axsuul: if you run 'chef-client -l debug' you should see the output of the commands.
[2012-05-11 15:21:15 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, rspec-chef was from v2 mainly
[2012-05-11 15:21:22 -0400] Axsuul: btm: i need to check the values of some variables also
[2012-05-11 15:21:40 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, ed and dan and curt had rspec rocking with chef 0.9 and 0.10 :) early on
[2012-05-11 15:21:43 -0400] BryanWB: Axsuul: u need pry
[2012-05-11 15:22:01 -0400] btm: Axsuul: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Log
[2012-05-11 15:22:03 -0400] BryanWB: Axsuul:     $ gem install pry pry-nav pry-doc
[2012-05-11 15:22:21 -0400] BryanWB: pry?
[2012-05-11 15:22:21 -0400] bawt: pry is voodoo
[2012-05-11 15:22:28 -0400] BryanWB: but great voodoo!
[2012-05-11 15:22:43 -0400] hoover_damm: which makes me laugh at them using minitest
[2012-05-11 15:22:49 -0400] BryanWB: Axsuul:  and inside recipe   code   require 'pry' ; binding.pry
[2012-05-11 15:23:03 -0400] btm: hoover_damm: yeah, chef-solo + EY always felt like a bit of a social fork to me from the start.
[2012-05-11 15:23:25 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, well they were designing a product they couldn't abstract the scale and chef 0.6 sucked at scaling
[2012-05-11 15:23:57 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, and EY has always had this desire to stay out of the request flow of the customer.  EY's downtime should not hurt a client
[2012-05-11 15:23:58 -0400] Axsuul: thanks
[2012-05-11 15:24:20 -0400] BryanWB: Axsuul: and watch the screencast at pry.github.com
[2012-05-11 15:24:38 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, I always felt the problem was more that the product was born.  They stopped caring, and fast forward a year or two and having to catch up
[2012-05-11 15:24:41 -0400] hoover_damm: not easy
[2012-05-11 15:24:53 -0400] btm: hoover_damm: agreed.
[2012-05-11 15:24:57 -0400] hoover_damm: btm, they have a lot of hard work ahead of them as they have chef 0.6 and a 2008 distro to maintain
[2012-05-11 15:25:19 -0400] hoover_damm: I basically wish them luck in their lunacy
[2012-05-11 15:25:27 -0400] btm: alright, I'm off to find breakfast. I'm considering cutting 0.10.10 today too as long as I don't need to go back to UDS for anything.
[2012-05-11 15:26:14 -0400] BryanWB: later chefz, next time i log on, it will be from SF!, can't wait
[2012-05-11 15:26:31 -0400] Axsuul: BryanWB, btm: But just for the sake of asking, is there any way to tap into the INFO:, DEBUG: output I see when provisioning/running the chef recipes
[2012-05-11 15:27:12 -0400] btm: Axsuul: what you do mean "tap into"? You want to modify what is being printed or print more?
[2012-05-11 15:27:20 -0400] Axsuul: btm: I want to print more
[2012-05-11 15:27:32 -0400] btm: Axsuul: use the log resource I linked to. that does exactly that.
[2012-05-11 15:27:46 -0400] Axsuul: Ah gotcha, sorry I assumed it logged to a file
[2012-05-11 15:28:22 -0400] btm: Axsuul: nah, it's a convenience resource to Chef::Log, which is what the rest of Chef uses for logging.
[2012-05-11 15:28:31 -0400] paulmooring: Axsuul: It logs to where ever -L tells it to log STDOUT by default but you can -L /path/to/log.txt if you want
[2012-05-11 15:30:07 -0400] Axsuul: thanks guys
[2012-05-11 15:33:25 -0400] mattray: Axsuul: you can also send to syslog or something like that if you want
[2012-05-11 15:35:46 -0400] Axsuul: mattray: ah ok, good to know
[2012-05-11 15:54:03 -0400] kryptek: I'm trying to bootstrap a box behind my VPC on AWS, I passed in the --subnet id and it's just sitting there.. can someone please help?
[2012-05-11 16:09:42 -0400] therobot: kryptek: usually instances inside a VPC don't have outbound communication unless they have an elastic ip associated, so basically your chef client is not able to reach your chef server
[2012-05-11 16:10:20 -0400] therobot: I am implying that you are using vpc scenario number 1
[2012-05-11 16:12:01 -0400] kryptek: yeah
[2012-05-11 16:12:21 -0400] kryptek: We had a coworker that left about a month ago and didn't document how he bootstrapped boxes in the VPC
[2012-05-11 16:12:35 -0400] kryptek: I know we need elastic IP's on them, I'm just not sure if he created the box, assigned the EIP and then boot strapped it or what
[2012-05-11 16:12:53 -0400] kryptek: I could have sworn he modified his ohai plugin
[2012-05-11 16:17:48 -0400] therobot: I am not a chef master, but AFAIK is difficult to think that ohai has anything to do with this issue
[2012-05-11 16:18:39 -0400] kryptek: yeah, agreed
[2012-05-11 16:19:00 -0400] kryptek: I think his ohai modification dealt with the plugin getting the IP instead of the FQDN from the node since vpc nodes don't have a pub dns
[2012-05-11 16:19:22 -0400] kryptek: I appreciate your help
[2012-05-11 16:19:35 -0400] therobot: I'm happy to help :)
[2012-05-11 16:19:50 -0400] kryptek: You going to #Chefconf2012 ?
[2012-05-11 16:21:28 -0400] therobot: nope, a bit expensive for me to flight to SFO
[2012-05-11 16:22:12 -0400] kryptek: I hear you;  my company is sending me this year otherwise I'd not be going
[2012-05-11 16:22:22 -0400] kryptek: I'm really looking forward to it.  Just started using Chef last year
[2012-05-11 16:22:49 -0400] therobot: I will be a fantastic conference, that's for sure
[2012-05-11 16:23:28 -0400] UForgotten: yeah I priced it out, the whole thing would be about $2800
[2012-05-11 16:23:36 -0400] UForgotten: thats too much money for my company atm
[2012-05-11 16:23:39 -0400] UForgotten: but I'd love to go.
[2012-05-11 16:25:06 -0400] kryptek: Trying to get my hands on more chef stuff, but I'm loving it
[2012-05-11 16:38:47 -0400] geekbri: UForgotten: same situation for me :)
[2012-05-11 16:43:39 -0400] kryptek: So, I stopped my knife ec2 create for the VPC (since it couldn't connect via ssh), associated an elastic IP to it, and just bootstrapped it with 'knife bootstrap'
[2012-05-11 16:43:55 -0400] kryptek: There's gotta be a way of shortcutting this though.. right?
[2012-05-11 16:48:20 -0400] kryptek: FATAL: ArgumentError: Attribute fqdn is not defined!
[2012-05-11 16:51:47 -0400] rayrod2030: is it possible to apply a role with an empty run list?
[2012-05-11 16:53:08 -0400] StormSilver: rayrod2030: yes
[2012-05-11 16:53:16 -0400] rayrod2030: sweet thanks
[2012-05-11 16:54:33 -0400] rshade98: guys is there any anyway to notify :delayed, but make it the last service to restart?
[2012-05-11 16:57:03 -0400] coderanger: Not directly, you could use some complex ruby code to do it though
[2012-05-11 16:57:25 -0400] kryptek: can't you just put the recipe in the bottom of your role?
[2012-05-11 17:00:24 -0400] mattray: or make all the others :immediately
[2012-05-11 17:06:19 -0400] rays: we're using http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/memcached how do you set the version number you want installed, its installing 1.4.2 which is pretty damn old
[2012-05-11 17:07:14 -0400] rayrod2030: it installs package specific versions based on distro
[2012-05-11 17:07:23 -0400] rshade98: @mattray, :immediately in the others mean many restarts if they are repeated right?
[2012-05-11 17:07:40 -0400] rayrod2030: rays: it installs package specific versions based on distro
[2012-05-11 17:07:44 -0400] mattray: rshade98: yes
[2012-05-11 17:07:47 -0400] rshade98: I want only one restart of each service, I just want that one last
[2012-05-11 17:08:04 -0400] rshade98: the service is monit, btw
[2012-05-11 17:08:36 -0400] rshade98: I am using the monit startup sleep, but just want to be sure
[2012-05-11 17:08:43 -0400] rshade98: and have it restart last
[2012-05-11 17:08:54 -0400] rays: rayrod2030: so how do I change that
[2012-05-11 17:09:49 -0400] rshade98: thanks guys btw for any info..
[2012-05-11 17:09:57 -0400] rshade98: still new to chef
[2012-05-11 17:10:50 -0400] rayrod2030: maybe using ppa for debian or setting alternate repos for el6.
[2012-05-11 17:11:33 -0400] rayrod2030: but basically the memcached cookbook you are using doesn't build memecached from source and therefore isn't pulling a particular version that can be changed via an attribute.
[2012-05-11 17:12:19 -0400] rayrod2030: rays: might be worth looking for some other memcached cookbooks out there. I'm sure there has to be on that builds from source.
[2012-05-11 17:13:27 -0400] rayrod2030: rays: btw the latest version of memcached is 1.4.13 so I'm not sure how you got 1.4.2 or why you think that's old.
[2012-05-11 17:13:36 -0400] rayrod2030: rays: at least latest stable
[2012-05-11 17:18:49 -0400] LowGravitas: Hey!
[2012-05-11 17:20:53 -0400] LowGravitas: I just installed chef on an Ubuntu 11.10 VM via chef-solo on vagrant, it's running as a runit service but doesn't seem to have created the validation.pem file.
[2012-05-11 17:25:05 -0400] LowGravitas: Anyone any experience of this kind of problem.
[2012-05-11 17:25:07 -0400] LowGravitas: ?
[2012-05-11 17:38:53 -0400] rays: rayrod2030: ubuntu 10.04 is why the memc server is so old
[2012-05-11 17:39:16 -0400] rays: rayrod2030: not having huge luck figuring out how to install from source or a newer package
[2012-05-11 17:39:20 -0400] miah: moin
[2012-05-11 17:39:41 -0400] rays: rayrod2030: also ppa?
[2012-05-11 17:40:04 -0400] rayrod2030: rays: but if memcached lastest stable is 1.4.13 then why is 1.4.2 old?
[2012-05-11 17:40:18 -0400] rayrod2030: rays: unless we are confusing these version numbers
[2012-05-11 17:40:39 -0400] rays: .13 is newer than .2
[2012-05-11 17:40:45 -0400] miah: 1.4.2 < 1.4.13
[2012-05-11 17:41:11 -0400] rays: .13 has some bug fixes and new stats info I need that 1.4.2 does not have
[2012-05-11 17:41:16 -0400] damienj: morning! :)
[2012-05-11 17:41:19 -0400] miah: you could install from ppa if you already installed that ppa's apt details
[2012-05-11 17:41:24 -0400] rayrod2030: rays: holy confusing versioning
[2012-05-11 17:41:35 -0400] miah: and then package masked the memcached provided by your debian/ubuntu repo
[2012-05-11 17:41:42 -0400] miah: rayrod2030: semver.org
[2012-05-11 17:41:52 -0400] rays: rayrod2030: heh, versions are not decimals, just period delimited ints
[2012-05-11 17:41:59 -0400] damienj: hey is it possible to use knife to display a nested attribute? i.e. knife node show `hostname -f` -a [:interesting][:nested][:attr]?
[2012-05-11 17:42:37 -0400] miah: knife node search 'fqdn:$(hostname -f)' -a interesting.nested.attr
[2012-05-11 17:42:40 -0400] miah: er
[2012-05-11 17:42:42 -0400] rays: miah: I'd install from a ppa if I could figure out what ppa to use and how it use it :p
[2012-05-11 17:42:42 -0400] miah: knife search node
[2012-05-11 17:42:44 -0400] miah: I ALWYA DO THIS
[2012-05-11 17:42:46 -0400] damienj: miah: thanky :)
[2012-05-11 17:43:20 -0400] miah: rays: https://help.launchpad.net/
[2012-05-11 17:43:54 -0400] miah: you could just as easily package memcached yourself and host your own apt repo, or just distribute the package and install it
[2012-05-11 17:44:02 -0400] miah: there is no hard requirement to use launchpad's ppa
[2012-05-11 17:45:14 -0400] rays: miah: I feel like a ppa should exist for this use case already
[2012-05-11 17:45:31 -0400] miah: probably. go find some memcached packages, and test them out.
[2012-05-11 17:47:13 -0400] hoover_damm: using ppa's is a chore over s3
[2012-05-11 17:48:14 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, using or hosting?
[2012-05-11 17:50:56 -0400] mattray: damienj: yes, just dot them
[2012-05-11 17:51:14 -0400] mattray: knife node show HOST -a .cloud.public_hostname
[2012-05-11 17:52:57 -0400] raz: how do i list all available bootstrap templates with knife, and where are the templates stored?
[2012-05-11 17:59:19 -0400] geekbri: they are generally stored in .chef/bootstrap
[2012-05-11 18:01:46 -0400] yfeldblum: raz, bootstrap templates are part of your infrastructure repo, and are not uploaded to any chef-server
[2012-05-11 18:02:10 -0400] raz: hm and where are the templates that ship with chef?
[2012-05-11 18:02:15 -0400] raz: i'm having trouble finding a list
[2012-05-11 18:03:39 -0400] yfeldblum: so ... Pathname#relative_path_from is wildly slow ...
[2012-05-11 18:03:45 -0400] mattray: raz: https://github.com/opscode/chef/tree/master/chef/lib/chef/knife/bootstrap
[2012-05-11 18:03:55 -0400] raz: thx
[2012-05-11 18:04:06 -0400] mattray: that's trunk, so once 0.10.10 comes out they'll all be there
[2012-05-11 18:04:28 -0400] mattray: chef-full and ubuntu12.04-gems are new
[2012-05-11 18:06:36 -0400] egoblin: hi guys, morning
[2012-05-11 18:07:35 -0400] egoblin: I had a question regarding resources/providers since I am writing one.
[2012-05-11 18:09:48 -0400] egoblin: I am writing a provider which wraps around the deployment resource.
[2012-05-11 18:10:44 -0400] egoblin: I want to detect if the deployment resource did anything (i.e. if he deployed the latest tag or did it not have to since the latest tag is already deployed ) and use that set the updated_by_last_action for my resource
[2012-05-11 18:10:51 -0400] egoblin: any ideas how to achieve this ?
[2012-05-11 18:20:19 -0400] jkyle: I'm setting up a haproxy to a chef-webui backend server. Some of the requests cause the server to throw an exception, but _only_ when given through the proxy.
[2012-05-11 18:20:42 -0400] jkyle: for example

[2012-05-11 18:22:58 -0400] cooper_: afternoon, all.
[2012-05-11 18:23:00 -0400] cooper_: any idea why knife rackspace server create fails when creating centos 6 & rhel 6 images?
[2012-05-11 18:23:01 -0400] cooper_: it seems to try to use apt-get to install ruby for some reason. not sure where to dig into the code to see where it might be going wrong.
[2012-05-11 18:23:01 -0400] cooper_: http://pastebin.com/QeBjh11y
[2012-05-11 18:28:55 -0400] jessicab: cooper_ - are you specifying the template to use with -t or -d?
[2012-05-11 18:29:03 -0400] jessicab: by default it uses ubuntu
[2012-05-11 18:29:38 -0400] cooper_: jessicab: ah. that must be it. odd'cause i thought i had this working before w/out specifying the template. i'll give it a shot.
[2012-05-11 18:29:39 -0400] jessicab: cooper_ - you probably just want to add something like '-d centos5-gems' to the end of the command
[2012-05-11 18:30:36 -0400] cooper_: jessicab: does centos5-gems work for version 6?
[2012-05-11 18:31:35 -0400] jessicab: cooper_ - i was able to get an ami to install with it in ec2, but i didnt test it too much.. you can always make your own custom template if you see issues though
[2012-05-11 18:31:55 -0400] cooper_: jessicab: kk. cool. good to know. thx!

[2012-05-11 18:51:26 -0400] egoblin: @yfeldblum: I can check that value and set the new_resource.updated_by_last_action?
[2012-05-11 18:51:46 -0400] egoblin: in my own provifder ?
[2012-05-11 18:51:54 -0400] egoblin: thanks... I'll try that out :D
[2012-05-11 18:53:02 -0400] yfeldblum: egoblin, yes, however, it is very tricky to do since you must know exactly how providers operate internally
[2012-05-11 18:53:25 -0400] egoblin: not sure I follow...
[2012-05-11 18:55:20 -0400] egoblin: do I do the check after the deploy_revision block in my code ?
[2012-05-11 18:55:49 -0400] jkyle: I've noticed the logs for chef-server say it's a merb application...I thought merb was absorbed into rails?

[2012-05-11 19:00:22 -0400] lallier: how do I create a node attribute based on a template name? for ex. template "/path/to/file" do { ... } - I'd like to node.set[:foo][:template] = #{template}
[2012-05-11 19:01:53 -0400] mehlah: Anyone can enlighten me about how to manage a chef-repo (cookbooks + roles + data_bags ...) and version it ?
[2012-05-11 19:02:06 -0400] mehlah: Do you guys have it as a private repo for your organization ?
[2012-05-11 19:02:19 -0400] eherot: gale: for most puposes you can just treat it like one anyway
[2012-05-11 19:02:45 -0400] eherot: gale: implicitly, that is
[2012-05-11 19:03:36 -0400] gale: eherot: I was hoping someone would say that - my problem must be elsewhere - thanks
[2012-05-11 19:03:42 -0400] mehlah: I hanv't find any tip or best practice about that
[2012-05-11 19:03:53 -0400] lallier: mehlah: use git
[2012-05-11 19:03:55 -0400] eherot: gale: is this in a recipe you're trying to do this?
[2012-05-11 19:05:52 -0400] gale: eherot: yep I was trying to pass them as variables to a template which works fine and I was being stupid :)
[2012-05-11 19:06:09 -0400] eherot: gale: happens to the best of us, heh
[2012-05-11 19:24:44 -0400] gondoi: is it possible to create a node before bootstrap and when bootstrap happens it will pull info about the node?
[2012-05-11 19:25:59 -0400] lallier: it it possible to Chef::Log.info a template? For ex. a template gets created but I'd like to log its name or full path of the file
[2012-05-11 19:26:37 -0400] lallier: the end goal is to create a node attribute which equals the template name
[2012-05-11 19:43:21 -0400] delivarator: Can anyone tell me why I'm getting NameError: wrong constant name Apt.Repository?
[2012-05-11 19:52:17 -0400] btm: lallier: the template is plain ruby, you can call Chef::Log in there. You can also use the 'log' resource in the recipe to reduce the code in the template (which is usually good to do).
[2012-05-11 20:11:22 -0400] LowGravitas: Hey! I'm getting an irritating problem where the chef-server::rubygems recipe seems to be finding an incorrect bindir.
[2012-05-11 20:11:54 -0400] LowGravitas: I'm using RVM on the system in question and was wondering whether that would have any negative interactions with chef.
[2012-05-11 20:12:03 -0400] LowGravitas: specifically with the gem_package resource.
[2012-05-11 20:19:22 -0400] btm: LowGravitas: it should be using the gem path for the ruby you're running chef-client/chef-solo under.
[2012-05-11 20:19:50 -0400] matschaffer: does anyone know of some librarian-aware `knife cookbook upload`? that'd be handy to have
[2012-05-11 20:19:52 -0400] btm: LowGravitas: that said, rvm/rbenv/bundler are all rockstars at producing a confusing environment, however useful.

[2012-05-11 20:26:11 -0400] matschaffer: but what with the news of new features googling wasn't proving useful
[2012-05-11 20:27:43 -0400] btm: matschaffer: I don't know of any knife-windows plans yet. I'm working on figuring out the state of the build boxes for omnibus + the MSI. that's all in a bit of flux right now.
[2012-05-11 20:28:30 -0400] matschaffer: gotcha
[2012-05-11 20:29:11 -0400] matschaffer: I'm using knife-windows' bootstrap script at the moment, so I guess I'd need to specify my own to make use of the impending 0.10.10 drop

[2012-05-11 21:09:21 -0400] rayrod2030: can anyone recommend a decent iptables cookbook?
[2012-05-11 21:09:44 -0400] rayrod2030: that isn't dependent on each cookbook implementing their own iptable_rule
[2012-05-11 21:09:48 -0400] mattray: rayrod2030: it would be nice if someone added it to the firewall cookbook
[2012-05-11 21:10:05 -0400] mattray: firewall currently only has ufw, but it's pluggable
[2012-05-11 21:10:09 -0400] rayrod2030: I'm thinking of something similar to how AWS security groups work.
[2012-05-11 21:10:21 -0400] rayrod2030: define a group and apply
[2012-05-11 21:10:49 -0400] mattray: the ufw cookbook leverages the firewall that way (among several ways)
[2012-05-11 21:10:54 -0400] rayrod2030: wrap that around the current iptables cookbook
[2012-05-11 21:11:58 -0400] rayrod2030: mattray: project I'm working on is on centos but more and more I'm contemplating switching over to ubuntu.
[2012-05-11 21:12:00 -0400] nekoneok: is chef stable for ubuntu 12.04LTS?
[2012-05-11 21:15:14 -0400] mattray: nekoneok: I haven't heard any real complaints. There's a new 12.04-gems template in 0.10.10
[2012-05-11 21:15:50 -0400] mattray: rayrod2030: check out the ufw cookbook, it has several techniques for managing firewall rules https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/ufw
[2012-05-11 21:16:10 -0400] mattray: rayrod2030: if you wanted to use those patterns with iptables, I don't expect that would be a ton of work
[2012-05-11 21:17:07 -0400] rayrod2030: mattray: thanks.  Any idea when the new chef server using erlang and mysql is going to hit the oss version?
[2012-05-11 21:17:23 -0400] mattray: rayrod2030: Chef 11.
[2012-05-11 21:17:33 -0400] mattray: expect news next week at ChefConf
[2012-05-11 21:17:52 -0400] rayrod2030: ah wish I could make it to chefconf but I'll be slumming it in Barcelona for a week. :(

[2012-05-11 21:56:13 -0400] heph: btm: huh... so uh, apparently it installed this time, but we get an error with mixlib shellout when we execute some cookbooks: [Fri, 11 May 2012 21:54:25 +0000] FATAL: Mixlib::ShellOut::ShellCommandFailed: python_pip[hoover] (live-tracker::default line 49) had an error: Mixlib::ShellOut::ShellCommandFailed: Expected process to exit with [0], but received '1'

[2012-05-11 22:09:45 -0400] kindsol: what is omnibus?
[2012-05-11 22:12:12 -0400] btm: cgriego: it's going to have to wait, we're right in the middle of transitioning from the clojure based build servers to the ruby based build servers.
[2012-05-11 22:13:51 -0400] cgriego: kindsol: it builds a full-stack single installer for chef-client. bundles self-contained ruby, etc
[2012-05-11 22:14:42 -0400] btm: kindsol: http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2011-12/msg00225.html

[2012-05-11 22:16:05 -0400] kindsol: gotcha. thx!
[2012-05-11 22:16:22 -0400] jtimberman: cgriego: you *should* be able to just do a gem install in the full stack chef with its gem program to upgrade
[2012-05-11 22:16:32 -0400] jtimberman: i just tested that in ubuntu and windows.
[2012-05-11 22:17:08 -0400] btm: cgriego: probably a week. I expect the final offical release within a month.
[2012-05-11 22:24:32 -0400] cgriego: btm: thanks, that's helpful to know
[2012-05-11 22:25:14 -0400] btm: as jtimberman points out, for now you can just use 0.10.8 and upgrade the gem alright.
[2012-05-11 22:42:23 -0400] daaaan: hm, i'm trying to use remote_file to download some stuff and even with the right sha256sum in the block it still downloads the file every time
[2012-05-11 22:42:34 -0400] daaaan: shoudl there be anything in the logs (i'm running -ldebug) in regards to the checksum
[2012-05-11 22:45:44 -0400] miah: how did you generate the sha256sum ?
[2012-05-11 22:45:52 -0400] miah: are you 100% that the shasum matches?
[2012-05-11 22:46:02 -0400] daaaan: sha256sum [downloadedfilename]
[2012-05-11 22:46:06 -0400] miah: also. do you have a gist?
[2012-05-11 22:46:28 -0400] daaaan: sure, i'm gonna let this chef run finish out then i'll paste it
[2012-05-11 22:52:07 -0400] Osax: To use knife ssh do I first need to key the nodes myself or does chef already key them?
[2012-05-11 22:53:55 -0400] Osax: I've bootstrapped a few nodes & I can see them in the node list, but get authentication failed on knife ssh
[2012-05-11 22:54:22 -0400] Osax: I already figured out I have to specify the -a ip address attribute because fqdn is not set yet
[2012-05-11 22:54:50 -0400] Osax: just need to know if I should go & setup my own keys now aswel or if chef has already done it
[2012-05-11 22:55:26 -0400] daaaan: what kind of nodes are these? ec2? you have already needed to be able to ssh to them, you would use the same keys to ssh later
[2012-05-11 22:56:14 -0400] Osax: Its my own chef server & own environment not ec2, when I bootstrapped them I specified the password
[2012-05-11 22:58:01 -0400] Osax: So I guess I'll have to go key them all now?
[2012-05-11 22:58:10 -0400] daaaan: oh, you need to put keys in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys for whatever user you want
[2012-05-11 22:58:15 -0400] daaaan: look at the users cookbook
[2012-05-11 22:58:41 -0400] daaaan: miah: https://gist.github.com/fd776c4529a6795394cb
[2012-05-11 22:58:51 -0400] daaaan: it seems smart enough to not overwrite the file on disk but it downloads it to test it anyway
[2012-05-11 23:02:43 -0400] Osax: cool, thanx
[2012-05-11 23:03:30 -0400] miah: you could add 'create_if_missing' but im not sure if that mucks up checksum
[2012-05-11 23:03:50 -0400] daaaan: yeah that's what i thought about, but if the checksum doesn't match what's on disk then it'll just bail out i think
[2012-05-11 23:03:53 -0400] daaaan: i'll test it out
[2012-05-11 23:04:03 -0400] miah: ya
[2012-05-11 23:05:48 -0400] jkyle: what are the ports that must be opened for clients to fully interact with chef? 4040 and 4000, anymore?
[2012-05-11 23:07:17 -0400] hoover_damm: clients don't need the port open, only the server
[2012-05-11 23:09:28 -0400] daaaan: yeah you just need 80/443 out i think
[2012-05-11 23:10:11 -0400] hoover_damm: only if you put it behind apache/nginx
[2012-05-11 23:10:16 -0400] hoover_damm: but there really isn't a reason to do that
[2012-05-11 23:18:53 -0400] jkyle: holoway: right, the server must have ports open for the client to interact :)
[2012-05-11 23:20:07 -0400] jkyle: I'm proxying chef behind nginx (and firewalls) so need to know all the services. I see there's a 4000 for web, 4040 for the api, I also see a 8983 for chef-solr
[2012-05-11 23:20:14 -0400] jkyle: but not sure if chef-solr is needed by clients
[2012-05-11 23:20:50 -0400] daaaan: i thought the clients just made http requests
[2012-05-11 23:22:24 -0400] hoover_damm: jkyle, nah that goes through chef-server
[2012-05-11 23:22:30 -0400] hoover_damm: jkyle, you only need chef-server-api open
[2012-05-11 23:22:32 -0400] jkyle: they seem to push json reqests/responses so likely restful. but they run on non-standard ports
[2012-05-11 23:22:33 -0400] hoover_damm: one way
[2012-05-11 23:22:36 -0400] hoover_damm: don't need it open both ways
[2012-05-11 23:22:46 -0400] jkyle: hoover_damm: correct.
[2012-05-11 23:22:54 -0400] hoover_damm: ports are fairly standardish
[2012-05-11 23:24:15 -0400] jkyle: they're pretty arbitrary. 4000 is terabase or ICQ in most services files
[2012-05-11 23:24:32 -0400] jkyle: they're unprotected ports, can run anything on them
[2012-05-11 23:24:51 -0400] jkyle: which is all I meant :)
[2012-05-11 23:30:51 -0400] jkyle: yeah, looks like you just need 4000 for chef-server-webui
[2012-05-11 23:31:12 -0400] hoover_damm: port 4000 is unregistered
[2012-05-11 23:31:15 -0400] hoover_damm: so it can be whatever it wants to be
[2012-05-11 23:31:16 -0400] jkyle: right
[2012-05-11 23:31:52 -0400] jkyle: but, it looks like you don't use the 4040 port with chef-server listening on it with knife, you just the :4000 port, same as the chef-server-webui
[2012-05-11 23:38:44 -0400] miah: 4040 is webui
[2012-05-11 23:38:47 -0400] miah: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Server
[2012-05-11 23:39:43 -0400] miah: so yes. all you need is port 4000 (or whatevs your api runs on)
[2012-05-11 23:47:13 -0400] jkyle: yeah, I think I got it backwards. all good now
[2012-05-11 23:47:18 -0400] jkyle: s/got/had/
