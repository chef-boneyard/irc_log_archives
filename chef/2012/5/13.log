[2012-05-13 00:10:50 -0400] raz: hm
[2012-05-13 00:10:54 -0400] raz: so the new default bootstrap template
[2012-05-13 00:11:08 -0400] raz: pulls a script from opscode.com and executes it as root
[2012-05-13 00:11:11 -0400] raz: via http
[2012-05-13 00:12:25 -0400] raz: whenever you think opscode has reached the bottom of incompetency, they up it one more..
[2012-05-13 00:17:31 -0400] Randm: that's pretty par for the course with certain projects
[2012-05-13 00:17:41 -0400] Randm: brew, node, just off the top of my head
[2012-05-13 00:33:17 -0400] miah: raz: you have the ability to write your own bootstrap templates
[2012-05-13 00:33:32 -0400] miah: if you don't feel it meets adequate security you can do something about it
[2012-05-13 00:47:03 -0400] raz: miah: sure. i can also write my own chef. or use puppet. or babushka. or poke a hole into my knee and whistle a tune through it.
[2012-05-13 00:47:17 -0400] raz: that doesn't make it better
[2012-05-13 00:48:01 -0400] raz: i'm still hoping it might improve if i nag enough
[2012-05-13 00:48:20 -0400] miah: rather than nag, make suggestions
[2012-05-13 00:48:30 -0400] raz: ship the script instead of download
[2012-05-13 00:48:39 -0400] raz: or if you have to download at least use https with a cert
[2012-05-13 00:48:51 -0400] raz: and fire whoever comes up with such ideas in first place..
[2012-05-13 00:53:50 -0400] laurent\: agreed, i also dislike people for providing "wget | sh" scripts
[2012-05-13 00:54:26 -0400] raz: it's one thing when you do that as your install procedure for whatever toy app on github
[2012-05-13 00:54:47 -0400] laurent\: raz: tickets.opscode.com otherwise it will be lost
[2012-05-13 00:55:10 -0400] raz: but an entirely different thing when you put it at the core of a tool supposedly designed to embody sane practices..
[2012-05-13 00:55:40 -0400] raz: yea, i filed the odd ticket, but it's getting old
[2012-05-13 00:55:44 -0400] laurent\: pretty sure you'll be a bit more diplomatic when filling then ticket :)
[2012-05-13 00:55:49 -0400] raz: apparently basic things like that are "not a priority"
[2012-05-13 00:56:18 -0400] raz: no, i'm not diplomatic at all, i'm impolite and offending
[2012-05-13 00:56:46 -0400] raz: i'll be polite when the bugs start being less offensive
[2012-05-13 00:56:53 -0400] laurent\: i wouldn't say that, i've seen worse
[2012-05-13 00:57:23 -0400] raz: well, it's the second absolutely insane bug that i'm spotting in two days
[2012-05-13 00:58:29 -0400] raz: the other was that chef-client uses no lockfile
[2012-05-13 00:59:16 -0400] raz: so, as it stands, chef is now wide open to dns poisoning/opscode hijacking attacks
[2012-05-13 00:59:30 -0400] raz: and in most common operation modes the outcome of chef-client runs is effectively undefined
[2012-05-13 00:59:34 -0400] miah: if you choose to install it via that template
[2012-05-13 00:59:35 -0400] laurent\: i'd say it's a bit more than a bug, the wget|sh things are insanities !
[2012-05-13 00:59:57 -0400] miah: which i agree, most people will as its the default
[2012-05-13 00:59:58 -0400] raz: miah: last time i checked it's the *default* now
[2012-05-13 01:00:16 -0400] raz: and the lockfile is "not a priority" according to the ticket
[2012-05-13 01:00:31 -0400] dstufft: wget|sh is no worse than more than one language level package manager
[2012-05-13 01:00:33 -0400] raz: i have no idea what their priorities are, but they really need to adjust them
[2012-05-13 01:00:43 -0400] miah: write the patch for the lockfile and submit a pull request
[2012-05-13 01:01:45 -0400] raz: dstufft: i can spell that out: not only is everyone at the mercy of opscode.com being up and reachable at all times. but we're also at the mercy of their security practices (COUGH) and vulnerable to dns poisoning attacks.
[2012-05-13 01:02:00 -0400] laurent\: but to be fair, wget|sh could be as bad as installing deb/rpm from unknown sources...
[2012-05-13 01:02:11 -0400] dstufft: raz: don't mind me, I'm grumpy about python packages
[2012-05-13 01:02:21 -0400] dstufft: and wget|sh
[2012-05-13 01:02:22 -0400] dstufft: :|
[2012-05-13 01:02:47 -0400] laurent\: oops i'm not fast enough, it's 3am what about going to bed ? :)
[2012-05-13 01:03:27 -0400] raz: dstufft: yea, chef is not alone with this practice. but kids doing stupid things is one thing. chef is not in a position to get that kind of basics wrong.
[2012-05-13 01:21:40 -0400] red5: hi guys! i would like to know if there are books about Chef ?
[2012-05-13 01:25:39 -0400] atomic-penguin: red5, there is one on cucumber-chef, quite small
[2012-05-13 01:26:01 -0400] atomic-penguin: red5, another definitive guide is due out sometime this summer, you can pre-order from oreilly
[2012-05-13 01:26:30 -0400] atomic-penguin: red5, http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025146.do
[2012-05-13 01:27:04 -0400] red5: atomic-penguin: awesome! i've used puppet and now i'd like to study chef
[2012-05-13 01:30:01 -0400] jtimberman: raz: You are welcome to download the install.sh script and review it yourself before you use it with the bootstrap template.
[2012-05-13 01:30:27 -0400] jtimberman: All it does is inspect the OS of the local system to determine what S3 link to download for the chef-full package on your platform.
[2012-05-13 01:35:03 -0400] jtimberman: raz: we have a vested interest in being good open source citizens.
[2012-05-13 01:54:39 -0400] jtimberman: raz: if you have additional concerns, feel free to email support@opscode.com
[2012-05-13 02:04:56 -0400] dstufft: jtimberman: I think the concern is that someone might intercept the download to install.sh and replace it with their own copy that does something nefarious, not what install.sh itself actually does
[2012-05-13 02:17:13 -0400] yfeldblum: raz, so build your own chef-full packages (using omnibus, the full-stack installer builder opscode wrote so they could release full-stack chef-client installers), or cache the ones opscode built for you on infrastructure you own or your s3 buckets, etc
[2012-05-13 02:18:50 -0400] yfeldblum: raz, as in, that's what people commonly do already when they build their own packages and have internal package repository servers
[2012-05-13 02:19:43 -0400] yfeldblum: raz, also, chef-full is still in beta
[2012-05-13 02:20:49 -0400] mehlah: Giving PHP cookbook attributes as example: https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/blob/master/php/attributes/default.rb
[2012-05-13 02:21:02 -0400] yfeldblum: raz, also what do you mean by "lockfile"?
[2012-05-13 02:21:39 -0400] mehlah: How can I override default['php']['configure_options'] in a role file, since this attrbitute is related to others defined in attributes.rb
[2012-05-13 02:22:08 -0400] mehlah: like #{lib_dir}, conf_dir etc ...
[2012-05-13 02:24:27 -0400] yfeldblum: mehlah, what's the issue you're facing?
[2012-05-13 02:25:40 -0400] mehlah: yfeldblum Not that confortable with ruby actually. In a role file, I want to override default['php']['configure_options'].
[2012-05-13 02:26:13 -0400] mehlah: doing so, force me to hardcode things like #{lib_dir}, since I can't use them within the role file
[2012-05-13 02:26:28 -0400] mehlah: I'm clear ? Or need to reword ^^
[2012-05-13 02:26:37 -0400] yfeldblum: default_attributes({"php" => {"configure_options" => ["asdf", "1234"]}})
[2012-05-13 02:26:47 -0400] yfeldblum: mehlah, yes, you may need to do that
[2012-05-13 02:26:54 -0400] mehlah: mmm
[2012-05-13 02:27:01 -0400] yfeldblum: mehlah, if you try to do it in a role
[2012-05-13 02:27:18 -0400] yfeldblum: mehlah, and not your own recipe
[2012-05-13 02:27:48 -0400] mehlah: Yep. I'll move that to a recipe
[2012-05-13 02:27:52 -0400] mehlah: thanks ;-)
[2012-05-13 03:30:58 -0400] vildrik: Any advice on best practices creating a recipe that executes a sql file?
[2012-05-13 20:33:15 -0400] mosez: hi
[2012-05-13 20:33:30 -0400] mosez: knows somebody good recipes for xen or openvz management?
[2012-05-13 22:29:33 -0400] valdezjoelt: hi
[2012-05-13 22:38:18 -0400] Cope_: ohai
[2012-05-13 22:38:32 -0400] miah: hi
[2012-05-13 23:30:33 -0400] BryanWB_: ssd7, around?
[2012-05-13 23:34:29 -0400] atomic-penguin: BryanWB_, did you decide on a cb yet for the hack day?
[2012-05-13 23:34:50 -0400] BryanWB_: atomic-penguin, changing it all around based on excellent feedback from Cope
[2012-05-13 23:35:09 -0400] BryanWB_: atomic-penguin, who is also generously helping out
[2012-05-13 23:35:22 -0400] atomic-penguin: Me, or Cope?
[2012-05-13 23:36:44 -0400] atomic-penguin: BryanWB_, fixed my nginx issues today, btw
[2012-05-13 23:36:54 -0400] BryanWB_: atomic-penguin, i saw, sweet!
[2012-05-13 23:36:59 -0400] BryanWB_: atomic-penguin, Cope and u
[2012-05-13 23:37:24 -0400] atomic-penguin: BryanWB_, I'd be glad to help, I'm a testing noob though
[2012-05-13 23:37:34 -0400] BryanWB_: atomic-penguin, but u know the ckbks
[2012-05-13 23:37:40 -0400] atomic-penguin: BryanWB_, my testing consists of does this run, or not?
[2012-05-13 23:37:53 -0400] BryanWB_: atomic-penguin, and ur supercalafragilistic expialidocious ;)
[2012-05-13 23:37:58 -0400] atomic-penguin: BryanWB_, blow machine away, does it run again?
[2012-05-13 23:38:35 -0400] BryanWB_: atomic-penguin, do u use vagrant to speed up that process?
[2012-05-13 23:38:50 -0400] atomic-penguin: I started testing against against a kvm guest today, same principle
[2012-05-13 23:39:17 -0400] BryanWB_: atomic-penguin, sweet, actually something wanted to work on or have someone work on at hackday
[2012-05-13 23:39:26 -0400] BryanWB_: know any ruby wrappers that work w/ kvm?
[2012-05-13 23:39:27 -0400] atomic-penguin: What, kvm testing?
[2012-05-13 23:39:49 -0400] atomic-penguin: kvm is stupid easy
[2012-05-13 23:39:51 -0400] BryanWB_: using kvm instead of virtualbox to spin up a new vm and run chef
[2012-05-13 23:39:59 -0400] BryanWB_: well, i m stupid
[2012-05-13 23:40:17 -0400] atomic-penguin: I can demo it right quick on Tues
[2012-05-13 23:40:36 -0400] BryanWB_: i bet u could modify toft, or do something like it to wrap kvm
[2012-05-13 23:40:38 -0400] atomic-penguin: Will we have wireless so I can hit our corp. VPN?
[2012-05-13 23:40:43 -0400] BryanWB_: atomic-penguin, y
[2012-05-13 23:40:51 -0400] BryanWB_: but no ethernet connections
[2012-05-13 23:41:23 -0400] BryanWB_: atomic-penguin, i want   1) a file like Vagrantfile  to define a vm and recipes to apply + cookbook_path
[2012-05-13 23:42:29 -0400] BryanWB_: 2) easy commandline to start, provision, and destroy
[2012-05-13 23:43:25 -0400] yfeldblum: modify toft to wrap libvirt, which has multiple virtualization drivers (including remote virtualization drivers)
[2012-05-13 23:43:33 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, exaclty
[2012-05-13 23:44:19 -0400] yfeldblum: and get network isolation up and working with libvirt, including with wlan network devices :P
[2012-05-13 23:45:01 -0400] yfeldblum: so that you can spin up a cluster of six lxc's, 3 mongos & 2 apps & 1 lb, and test it
[2012-05-13 23:45:16 -0400] yfeldblum: but that may be getting crazy :P
[2012-05-13 23:46:21 -0400] atomic-penguin: networking is the one thing that is painful with kvm/qemu if you want anything more than NAT networking
[2012-05-13 23:46:43 -0400] yfeldblum: atomic-penguin, yep
[2012-05-13 23:47:19 -0400] atomic-penguin: Not that its hard to set up bridged, best way to do it is editing files though
[2012-05-13 23:47:21 -0400] BryanWB_: atomic-penguin, that's a big pain point, cuz we need bridging in order to spin up mulitipe vs
[2012-05-13 23:50:31 -0400] ssd7: Ohai Chefs!
[2012-05-13 23:50:38 -0400] Cope: woo ssd7
