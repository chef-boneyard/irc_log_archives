[2012-05-28 01:11:53 -0400] hippiehacker: are the conference sessions online?
[2012-05-28 01:31:06 -0400] atomic-penguin: hippiehacker, http://youtube.com/user/opscode
[2012-05-28 01:31:33 -0400] atomic-penguin: hoover_damm, did you pull request your nginx work for the community version?
[2012-05-28 01:33:24 -0400] makerbrkr: is there a roku channel for that?
[2012-05-28 01:36:04 -0400] atomic-penguin: makerbrkr, for the chefconf or youtube?
[2012-05-28 01:36:10 -0400] atomic-penguin: neither, really
[2012-05-28 01:36:25 -0400] atomic-penguin: but there is one for justin.tv/twitch.tv, which is awesome
[2012-05-28 01:37:52 -0400] makerbrkr: either/or
[2012-05-28 01:38:04 -0400] makerbrkr: hrm, I think the roku has twitch
[2012-05-28 01:56:09 -0400] kvanderw: how do I pass the --node-name into the hostname and /etc/hosts file of the newly created VM ??
[2012-05-28 01:59:15 -0400] atomic-penguin: makerbrkr, it does, as I was saying.  Which is awesome
[2012-05-28 02:08:57 -0400] makerbrkr: atomic-penguine, where do i find it on twitch?
[2012-05-28 02:23:12 -0400] hoover_damm: atomic-penguin, no
[2012-05-28 02:23:20 -0400] hoover_damm: atomic-penguin, I did not ask if my client wanted that, so I didn't.
[2012-05-28 02:24:08 -0400] hoover_damm: in this case, I just wrapped some basic passenger wrapping around the nginx cookbook
[2012-05-28 02:24:11 -0400] hoover_damm: it's nothing significent
[2012-05-28 02:24:37 -0400] hoover_damm: just compiles with passenger, and drops the right passenger_root and passenger_ruby vars in
[2012-05-28 02:24:47 -0400] hoover_damm: you do the rest with nginx_site :)
[2012-05-28 02:25:11 -0400] hoover_damm: which is sadly why I did that.  Passenger cookbook was what they used, and when I took em to unicorn *cough* it got messy
[2012-05-28 02:25:36 -0400] hoover_damm: so had to refactor the passenger into the nginx cookbook and then just drop everything in their application cookbook
[2012-05-28 02:26:33 -0400] hoover_damm: that way my clients employee's can follow in the same pattern / style
[2012-05-28 02:29:15 -0400] zodiak: hey guys/gals, I seem to be having a problem running a 'bundle install' as a command from a Chef script. even though I specify user and cwd, it never seems to work "quite right"
[2012-05-28 02:29:42 -0400] zodiak: anyone got any example chef recipes where they do a bundle install ?
[2012-05-28 02:31:09 -0400] hoover_damm: zodiak, something wrong with the opscode application cookbook?
[2012-05-28 02:31:34 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application/blob/master/recipes/rails.rb#L168-L181
[2012-05-28 02:31:37 -0400] zodiak: I couldn't find a bundler recipe in there.. let me go check
[2012-05-28 02:31:59 -0400] hoover_damm: that link there has the highlighted portions
[2012-05-28 02:32:19 -0400] zodiak: spiffy .. ta
[2012-05-28 02:32:21 -0400] hoover_damm: If your new to chef it may be better to start with the opscode cookbooks then trying to write everything on your own
[2012-05-28 02:32:45 -0400] zodiak: well, I got most of the ones from opscode working jst peachy.. but now I am trying to deploy our code on top of the new vm
[2012-05-28 02:32:49 -0400] zodiak: that's where I am tripping up
[2012-05-28 02:32:50 -0400] hoover_damm: there's quite a bit to it, and they've put a lot of thought into the cookbooks and documented them which does help :)
[2012-05-28 02:32:55 -0400] zodiak: thanks for the pointers :)
[2012-05-28 02:32:59 -0400] hoover_damm: hrm
[2012-05-28 02:33:02 -0400] hoover_damm: then bundler key set?
[2012-05-28 02:33:31 -0400] zodiak: should be.. I have rvm installed and told it to install bundler. vagrant is also in the mix, I am sure that's not helping matters ;)
[2012-05-28 02:34:04 -0400] hoover_damm: Vagrant not working as root by default seems to complicate the whole process
[2012-05-28 02:34:06 -0400] hoover_damm: immensely
[2012-05-28 02:34:10 -0400] vluther: i'm trying to install a package by using the remi repository, when i specify options "--enablerepo=remi" it's telling me no such version found.. yet when i do yum -y --enablerepo=remi install php-fpm it works.. any ideas?
[2012-05-28 02:34:12 -0400] zodiak: let me tinker and I will scream if I have any probs. thanks for the pointer/info
[2012-05-28 02:34:18 -0400] zodiak: yeah.. it sure does :D
[2012-05-28 02:34:40 -0400] zodiak: hah
[2012-05-28 02:35:05 -0400] hoover_damm: I know i'll get the ticket of write a ci system in lxc :) gosh that'll be a peach
[2012-05-28 02:35:36 -0400] zodiak: lxc is nice ~IF~ everyone uses the same hardware
[2012-05-28 02:35:53 -0400] zodiak: but when you have people in your dev team that use fedora, ubuntu, osx and winblowz.. well ;P
[2012-05-28 02:36:07 -0400] zodiak: different folks, different strokes though
[2012-05-28 03:06:42 -0400] atomic-penguin: makerbrkr, I just meant there is a channel for justin/twitch on roku.  The chefconf stuff is on youtube.com/user/opscode.  Unfortunately there is no roku youtube channel.
[2012-05-28 05:18:22 -0400] kvanderw: trying to set node[:name] as the hostname - while I can do it in the attributes/default.rb file - I must be able to manage many nodes dynamically, the attributes location feels all wrong - any clues ?
[2012-05-28 08:03:42 -0400] BryanWB_: ohai chefs!
[2012-05-28 09:24:21 -0400] zebers: I'm writing a LWRP that uses a template in a provider, am I able to pass variables into through the resource and have them be managed by the LWRP (not by the service calling the LWRP) ugh I hope that makes sense ~.~
[2012-05-28 10:25:14 -0400] ashb: zebers: it doesn't quite. can you give an example of how you want to use it?
[2012-05-28 10:25:32 -0400] zebers: ashb, actually I already figured it out :)
[2012-05-28 10:26:05 -0400] ashb: coo
[2012-05-28 10:26:08 -0400] ashb: ll
[2012-05-28 12:48:06 -0400] kvanderw: I have a knife command: knife xenserver vm create --vm-template Deb6-64 --vm-name test31 --vm-memory 512 --vm-cpus 2 --node-name test31 -s http://chef.domain.com:4000 --vm-networks "Pool-wide network associated with eth0" -r hostname.
[2012-05-28 12:48:34 -0400] kvanderw: How do I pass a value (like hostname, IP address) in this command?
[2012-05-28 12:48:46 -0400] kvanderw: I need Per Node attribute values.
[2012-05-28 12:54:32 -0400] BryanWB_: kvanderw: i haven't used knife xenserver, but iirc there might be a '-a'  option for specifying attributes
[2012-05-28 12:56:18 -0400] kvanderw: BryanWB_: checking...
[2012-05-28 12:58:04 -0400] kvanderw: BryanWB_: nope - says invalid option: -a
[2012-05-28 12:58:14 -0400] ashb: there was a ticket for 0.10.10 about passing node attributes to bootstrap
[2012-05-28 12:58:52 -0400] kvanderw: BryanWB_: there is a -E (--environment) switch, but I can't find details on how to format an attribute assignment using the -E
[2012-05-28 12:59:19 -0400] kvanderw: ashb: I am using 0.10.10. Does that hurt me or help me?
[2012-05-28 12:59:26 -0400] BryanWB_: kvanderw: that is only for setting the chef_environment, won't affect  the attributes
[2012-05-28 12:59:27 -0400] ashb: maybe I got the version wrong
[2012-05-28 13:00:58 -0400] ashb: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KNIFE_RACKSPACE-30 and http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KNIFE_EC2-58
[2012-05-28 13:01:09 -0400] ashb: kvanderw: you might need a similar patch for knife xenserver
[2012-05-28 13:03:00 -0400] ashb: but i'm just guessing here
[2012-05-28 13:10:28 -0400] kvanderw: ashb: reading - trying to understand it enough to apply similar
[2012-05-28 13:11:06 -0400] kvanderw: BryanWB_: that was the way I was reading the docs - was hoping I was missing something :(
[2012-05-28 13:14:11 -0400] kvanderw: BryanWB_: so, is there a way to define a list of attributes on a per node basis? I am trying to build a series of Drupal nodes, each holding 50 drupal site. Each site needs a seperate IP. So, over time, as a node expands to the 50,  I need to be able to update the node details to include the new folder info, apache config details, IP address, etc.
[2012-05-28 13:14:52 -0400] kvanderw: I'm sure there is a way to do this, but after a dozen tutorials and 10 days of reading, I'm haveing trouble groking this part of the framework.
[2012-05-28 13:17:04 -0400] BryanWB_: kvanderw: i have no experience w/ knife-xenserver, there is a way to do it w/ knife bootstrap iirc
[2012-05-28 13:17:22 -0400] BryanWB_: kvanderw: have u sent a mail to the ml? that is usually pretty responsive
[2012-05-28 13:17:28 -0400] BryanWB_: more so than irc
[2012-05-28 13:18:03 -0400] kvanderw: BryanWB_: I have not - what is the address for the ml?
[2012-05-28 13:18:46 -0400] BryanWB_: kvanderw: http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/lists/opensource , i have always found it to be quite responsive
[2012-05-28 13:19:00 -0400] kvanderw: BryanWB_: thanks
[2012-05-28 13:28:36 -0400] BryanWB_: kvanderw: u may want to wait a bit for mattray to show up later today, he is very knowledgeable about those kinds of plugins
[2012-05-28 14:42:51 -0400] hcastro: anyone using the minitest handler cookbook and notice issues because the stdlib minitest is being used instead of minitest gem?
[2012-05-28 14:43:21 -0400] BryanWB_: hcastro: hmm, i haven't, but i use my fork of it
[2012-05-28 14:43:35 -0400] BryanWB_: hcastro: hello! btw ;)
[2012-05-28 14:44:06 -0400] hcastro: BryanWB_: good morning (possibly, not sure what timezone you're in)
[2012-05-28 14:44:29 -0400] BryanWB_: https://github.com/bryanwb/minitest-handler-cookbook, it's late afternoon ;)
[2012-05-28 14:46:19 -0400] hcastro: BryanWB_: what ruby version are you running chef with?
[2012-05-28 14:46:32 -0400] BryanWB_: 1.8.7
[2012-05-28 14:46:59 -0400] BryanWB_: hcastro: u?
[2012-05-28 14:47:00 -0400] hcastro: ah, i think my issues are related to 1.9.2
[2012-05-28 14:50:30 -0400] BryanWB_: hcastro: the stdlib minitest behaves differently than the gem??
[2012-05-28 14:51:07 -0400] hcastro: there appears to be at least one inconsistency -- working to reproduce it right now
[2012-05-28 14:55:33 -0400] lowg: Hi
[2012-05-28 14:58:36 -0400] lowg: Anyone got experience of installing crystal reports runtime using chef?  I need an estimation of what sort of timeout to set
[2012-05-28 14:58:50 -0400] lowg: (I assume 'feels like forever' is not a valid value)
[2012-05-28 17:26:48 -0400] hoover_damm: lowg, timeout forever is the only answer when you don't know what the average time is for your reports to run
[2012-05-28 17:27:10 -0400] hoover_damm: lowg, oh wait I read that wrong as running reports vs installation...
[2012-05-28 17:27:44 -0400] hoover_damm: lowg, yeah likely forever is the wrong behavior.  Can you time how long it takes to install and then take the longest, add 25% and then average them?
[2012-05-28 18:41:27 -0400] lowg: hoover_damn, thanks.  It's not interacting correctly; I'm getting timeout exceptions on it and then end up with a number of setup.exe processes running
[2012-05-28 18:42:44 -0400] hoover_damm: lowg, ahh.  I'd suggest mailing the mailing list to see if anyone has tried to automate crystal reports
[2012-05-28 18:42:54 -0400] hoover_damm: bawt, lists?
[2012-05-28 18:42:54 -0400] bawt: lists is http://lists.opscode.com
[2012-05-28 18:43:27 -0400] hoover_damm: tiz a holiday in the US, not sure how much attention you'll get in irc
[2012-05-28 18:48:04 -0400] lowg: ok, thanks
[2012-05-28 19:51:28 -0400] kisoku: where can I get my hands on the chef-server omnibus installers
[2012-05-28 20:23:20 -0400] ellisera: hey guys, I'm having problems with a recipe, I need to not reference a non-existent data bag for a standalone environment but allow for referencing for our other environments and an ' if node.chef_environment != "standalone" ' wrap around the recipe doesn't seem to work (sorry if it's a stupid question, but I'm new to both chef and ruby)
[2012-05-28 20:47:08 -0400] john1400_: I am trying to do my first chef server install on ubuntu 10.04, but when I run "chef-server > knife configure -i", I get an error: "/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/mixlib/config.rb:37:in `read': Permission denied - /etc/chef/server.rb (Errno::EACCES)
[2012-05-28 20:47:09 -0400] john1400_: from /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/mixlib/config.rb:37:in `from_file'" -- any ideas on what I am doing wrong?
[2012-05-28 21:13:35 -0400] brofus: Hi. How can I add a recipe to the run_list that is part of a role with shef? I'm doin the defacto.. shef -z, recipe, include_recipe "myrecipe" but I get name error when it is shown in the runlist when shef starts
[2012-05-28 21:14:10 -0400] qurve: Hello all. What is the general practice for splitting the installation of a package (eg, nginx) from the configuration of the package (my custom configs) in cookbooks?
[2012-05-28 21:14:49 -0400] qurve: I'm using the standard nginx cookbook, but now I need to drop my custom nginx configs in for the various sites that will run in nginx, and I'm not sure if I need a separate cookbook, or if I should just add it to the nginx/recipe/default?
[2012-05-28 21:15:18 -0400] qurve: Apologize if this is very obvious, haven't worked with chef before today.
[2012-05-28 21:22:05 -0400] hoover_damm: qurve, by default with the nginx recipe you only apply nginx::source and you drop in nginx.conf and then you use nginx_site to enable your sites
[2012-05-28 21:22:26 -0400] hoover_damm: qurve, so there should very little need to customize the nginx cookbook itself
[2012-05-28 21:22:49 -0400] qurve: Well, my use case is that for each webserver I have, it hosts about 5 sites (the network that makes up the organization)
[2012-05-28 21:23:01 -0400] qurve: Right now I have 5 separate nginx configs with server{} blocks
[2012-05-28 21:23:08 -0400] qurve: blog.foo, forum.foo, www.foo, etc.
[2012-05-28 21:23:13 -0400] hoover_damm: yep that's fine
[2012-05-28 21:23:16 -0400] qurve: I'm unsure of where I put the configurations for those.
[2012-05-28 21:23:25 -0400] hoover_damm: create a cookbook called application
[2012-05-28 21:23:30 -0400] hoover_damm: nginx_site 'forum.foo' do
[2012-05-28 21:23:35 -0400] qurve: OK, that's what I figured
[2012-05-28 21:23:57 -0400] qurve: So I really need to create an 'app' cookbook that is repsonsible for doing all non-infrastructure tasks
[2012-05-28 21:24:10 -0400] qurve: I assume that's also where I would pull down the codebases onto the node?
[2012-05-28 21:24:26 -0400] hoover_damm: it's where you store it
[2012-05-28 21:24:52 -0400] hoover_damm: in this case assume Chef is your framework to help you decide the pattern you want to take
[2012-05-28 21:25:11 -0400] qurve: Yeah, I'm just starting out today, so some of it I'm not sure what the 'right' way is yet.
[2012-05-28 21:25:23 -0400] qurve: I would imagine that I do not want to modify third-party cookbooks if at all possible.
[2012-05-28 21:25:26 -0400] hoover_damm: Personally, I actually have an application cookbook and a recipe called 'webstack' that has all my webstack stuff in it
[2012-05-28 21:26:04 -0400] hoover_damm: grabs all the ssl certs, sets up htpasswd if needed, includes the nginx/or apache cookbook if needed, then enables passenger or unicorn
[2012-05-28 21:26:16 -0400] hoover_damm: then does nginx_site 'mainsite.foo.com' do action :enable end
[2012-05-28 21:26:27 -0400] qurve: Neat.
[2012-05-28 21:26:28 -0400] hoover_damm: then start nginx at the end, and yeah
[2012-05-28 21:26:29 -0400] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-05-28 21:26:32 -0400] hoover_damm: done
[2012-05-28 21:26:51 -0400] hoover_damm: it's a big of unicorn/passenger right now in my cookbook myself
[2012-05-28 21:27:02 -0400] hoover_damm: and everything is stored in attributes just because I'm used to that...
[2012-05-28 21:27:05 -0400] qurve: Yeah I do all my company's stuff in rails with nginx/unicorn
[2012-05-28 21:27:25 -0400] qurve: But I'm moving my non-profit organization's infrastructure to AWS and I've decided that's a good a time as any to learn Chef
[2012-05-28 21:27:39 -0400] qurve: That infrastructure is all php sites (WordPress, vBulletin, custom stuff, etc.)
[2012-05-28 21:27:44 -0400] hoover_damm: it is
[2012-05-28 21:27:52 -0400] hoover_damm: Chef
[2012-05-28 21:27:55 -0400] qurve: So goal 1 is nginx+php-fpm running each of the sites.
[2012-05-28 21:31:38 -0400] qurve: Thank you for your help hoover, I think this has given me enough clue to move forward.
[2012-05-28 21:31:48 -0400] qurve: I'll start by just creating an application cookbook where I do all my custom stuff.
[2012-05-28 21:32:09 -0400] qurve: Is it appropriate for a cookbook to be responsible for cloning a git repo to retrieve a codebase?
[2012-05-28 21:32:12 -0400] qurve: I assume so.
[2012-05-28 21:50:10 -0400] qurve: hoover_damm: Are you still here by chance?
[2012-05-28 22:08:49 -0400] qurve: Hrm, I keep getting this sporadically on an ubuntu 12.04 LTS VM: /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/ohai-0.6.12/lib/ohai/mixin/command.rb:273: [BUG] Segmentation fault
[2012-05-28 22:09:03 -0400] qurve: Usually if I run it a few times it works fine.
[2012-05-28 22:33:37 -0400] qurve: Strangely chef-client works every third time.
[2012-05-28 23:12:05 -0400] Ramblurr: what's the best way to run a bash command store the contents of the output in an attribute?
[2012-05-28 23:12:50 -0400] Ramblurr: i tried using ruby to get the data i need in a ruby_block, but when i set the attribute in the block it doesnt seem to stick
[2012-05-28 23:12:59 -0400] Ramblurr: like this https://pastee.org/8phtb
[2012-05-28 23:36:14 -0400] mhalligan: I'm trying to figure out the best way to sync up my instance list from my cloud provider (rackspace) with my node / client list. I was thinking that on my monitoring services I would have them read the output of `knfie rackspace server list` into ohai attributes
[2012-05-28 23:36:15 -0400] mhalligan: an
[2012-05-28 23:36:31 -0400] mhalligan: any suggestions? Does that seem reasonable or is there a more standard way of doing t his?

[2012-05-28 23:54:50 -0400] cwj: [Neurotic]: not aware of one that's available now, although i think ORA has a book slated to be published in the next year or so
[2012-05-28 23:55:06 -0400] silk: ramblurr, try node.set[:blah]
[2012-05-28 23:55:26 -0400] cwj: this is the only chef book i have seen, but it is not really for new chef users: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020042.do
[2012-05-28 23:56:09 -0400] cwj: ah heres the preorder page http://www.amazon.com/Chef-Definitive-Guide-Stephen-Nelson-Smith/dp/1449327443
[2012-05-28 23:56:13 -0400] [Neurotic]: yeah, i saw that
[2012-05-28 23:56:39 -0400] [Neurotic]: ah nice, I'll wishlist it
[2012-05-28 23:57:07 -0400] [Neurotic]: we're doing the usual 'puppet or chef' thing :) it's been interesting
[2012-05-28 23:58:12 -0400] [Neurotic]: so just looking at learning resources
[2012-05-28 23:58:34 -0400] qurve: Just got a blank machine turned into a web server pulling code from github and running properly. This is so cool.
[2012-05-28 23:59:00 -0400] qurve: I've been doing similar stuff with custom-written scripts for a year or two, but chef is much nicer :)
[2012-05-28 23:59:25 -0400] Ramblurr: silk: that works outside the block, but not inside :(
