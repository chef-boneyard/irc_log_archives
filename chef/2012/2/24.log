[2012-02-24 08:00:00 -0500] flaccid: ah got it
[2012-02-24 12:27:00 -0500] tolland: whats the preferred way to publish cookbooks to github? (to deal with the kind of mixed repo on your workstation in non borked way
[2012-02-24 12:27:00 -0500] tolland: )
[2012-02-24 13:07:00 -0500] rgsteele: So, I have a cookbook that handles network interfaces.  Basically, you defined a hash of one or more interfaces, with each interface's value being a sub-hash containing keys and values (e.g., address => '1.2.3.4').  Since no pre-defined hash will work for every situation, those using the cookbook will have to define their own interfaces hash.  That, however, poses an interesting problem.
[2012-02-24 13:08:00 -0500] rgsteele: Using overrides isn't really a good solution, because there can be many nodes sharing a role, and not each will have the same IP's.  I was thinking of using 'knife node edit ...' to set the values, but it feels hacky.  Using a databag or an external data source (like LDAP) doesn't feel any better.  Suggestions?  Is the implementation faulty?
[2012-02-24 14:10:00 -0500] itwasntandy: hey
[2012-02-24 14:10:00 -0500] itwasntandy: should knife node from file actually work?
[2012-02-24 14:10:00 -0500] itwasntandy: https://gist.github.com/1901145
[2012-02-24 14:34:00 -0500] tolland: rgsteele: typically some where has to have the authoritative list of Ip to hostname, really I just see attributes as a convenient way to transfer that data.
[2012-02-24 14:35:00 -0500] tolland: if you intend to keep your ip/hostname mappings in chef, then I would just go nuts an make a bit hash in my environment attributes, or alternatively have a network data bag
[2012-02-24 14:36:00 -0500] tolland: I meant "big hash"
[2012-02-24 14:37:00 -0500] jmazzi: Using one shared secret for all your servers sounds dangerous. Has anyone worked on a per-host secret setup yet?
[2012-02-24 15:54:00 -0500] ssd7_: Ohai Chefs!
[2012-02-24 15:58:00 -0500] ssd7_: itwasntandy: If you're still around you might try adding "json_class":"Chef::Node" to that json hash
[2012-02-24 16:04:00 -0500] rgsteele: It appears that the attribute overrides, when doing a 'knife node edit', go in the "normal" section, but I'm a little unclear as to what the correct syntax should be when setting a hash this way.  This is what's not working: http://pastie.org/3447124
[2012-02-24 16:07:00 -0500] rgsteele: Oh, nevermind - had to use double-quotes I guess
[2012-02-24 16:08:00 -0500] ssd7_: rgsteele: Yeah, discounting the small syntax error, I think that adding either default or override attributes via knife node edit won't work as expected.
[2012-02-24 16:12:00 -0500] rgsteele: Well, I think that you have to set it in the "normal" section to override attributes set in the attributes file.
[2012-02-24 16:13:00 -0500] rgsteele: But, I don't think you can override overrides yet, because it doesn't work properly (or that's what I've gathered from reading other sources, in addition to what you said)
[2012-02-24 16:15:00 -0500] ssd7_: rgsteele: Right, whether that is a bug or just needs to be better documented is up for discussion.  I haven't tested it myself, but at the beginning of the chef-client run, we blow away all default and override attributes and then rebuild them from the recipes and roles.  This ensures that default or override attributes set in roles are removed from the node when the role is removed.  But, it has the side effect of meaning you can't manually set
[2012-02-24 16:18:00 -0500] itwasntandy: ssd7: thanks
[2012-02-24 16:19:00 -0500] itwasntandy: ssd7: thing is I created the file by doing knife role edit <node>
[2012-02-24 16:19:00 -0500] itwasntandy: and then saving that out.
[2012-02-24 16:19:00 -0500] itwasntandy: er s/role/node/
[2012-02-24 16:19:00 -0500] ssd7: itwasntandy: Yeah.  Same happens if you knife node show NODENAME -Fj > node.json
[2012-02-24 16:20:00 -0500] ssd7: itwasntandy: I updated http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2352 to mention that the commands don't work together well enough
[2012-02-24 16:20:00 -0500] itwasntandy: thanks
[2012-02-24 16:20:00 -0500] mattdawson: the python_pip provider reliest on the --environment flag to work, which has been removed from the most recent pip. :(
[2012-02-24 16:20:00 -0500] mattdawson: *relies
[2012-02-24 16:21:00 -0500] itwasntandy: ssd7: confirmed that works

[2012-02-24 16:28:00 -0500] dajia: We're having some trouble bootstrapping an Oracle OEL 6.1 AMI on EC2.  We're getting the following error:  https://gist.github.com/fdff7e6bef2d3045010d
[2012-02-24 16:28:00 -0500] dajia: Does anyone have any idea what the line package[strace] (server_base_misc::default line 71) had an error: You must override load_current_resource in #<Chef::Provider::Package:0x00000002454e38> means?
[2012-02-24 16:28:00 -0500] sivy: erikh: ok. going to try single-quoting the output of the ``s and see if that helps
[2012-02-24 16:28:00 -0500] erikh: dajia: your provider is busted
[2012-02-24 16:29:00 -0500] erikh: it needs a load_current_resource method in it
[2012-02-24 16:29:00 -0500] erikh: sivy: it won't
[2012-02-24 16:29:00 -0500] erikh: unless you mean "``"
[2012-02-24 16:29:00 -0500] erikh: that might do what you want
[2012-02-24 16:29:00 -0500] erikh: I think [[ ]] will solve your issue though
[2012-02-24 16:29:00 -0500] erikh: but not in the way you think
[2012-02-24 16:30:00 -0500] sivy: erikh: yeah: [ '`#{pip} freeze | grep #{package} | cut -d'=' -f3`' = '#{version}' ]
[2012-02-24 16:31:00 -0500] ssd7: dajia: Also of interest would be to log into the node and run: ohai platform to see which platform it is identifying as if you are relying on Chef to select the package provider.
[2012-02-24 16:31:00 -0500] dajia: I'm going to do that now.
[2012-02-24 16:31:00 -0500] mattdawson: where should i file a bug on the pip resource being broken? should i use jira or github issues for the cookbooks repo?
[2012-02-24 16:31:00 -0500] dajia: This is a colleague's code.  I think he might be relying on Chef to do that.
[2012-02-24 16:34:00 -0500] sivy: mattdawson: broken how?
[2012-02-24 16:35:00 -0500] mattdawson: sivy: the pip resource uses the --environment flag, which was removed in pip 1.1 that came out last week.
[2012-02-24 16:35:00 -0500] sivy: ah
[2012-02-24 16:35:00 -0500] ssd7: erikh: What is intereting about that x trick is that even in old shells where that is necessary, you could avoid it by just doing [ "thing" = "$var" ] rather than [ "$var" = "thing" ]
[2012-02-24 16:35:00 -0500] ssd7: mattdawson: JIRA
[2012-02-24 16:35:00 -0500] erikh: eh, it makes me feel special
[2012-02-24 16:35:00 -0500] mattdawson: sivy: yeah, it actually sucks bad.
[2012-02-24 16:36:00 -0500] erikh: don't take that away :)
[2012-02-24 16:36:00 -0500] ssd7: erikh: :)
[2012-02-24 17:00:00 -0500] Urocyon: mattdawson: I got around the pip problem temporarily by making sure an earlier version of pip gets installed before running the python/pip code.
[2012-02-24 17:06:00 -0500] mattdawson: Urocyon: yep, that's what i was doing to.
[2012-02-24 17:06:00 -0500] mattdawson: Urocyon: though it actually looks like it's a bug in the provider that might be easily fixed.
[2012-02-24 17:07:00 -0500] mattdawson: or, rather, *i'm* seeing it because of a bug.

[2012-02-24 17:38:00 -0500] bluenemo_: hi guys, i'm having problems with removing recipes from node runlists: knife node run_list remove testVM1 recipe[emacs]  wont remove emacs, also if i sudo chef-client on testVM1 and it works out without errors the recipe wont be removed from the run_list
[2012-02-24 17:43:00 -0500] jbz: bluenemo_: Is that recipe in an attributes.json being loaded by chef-client?
[2012-02-24 17:44:00 -0500] bluenemo_: hm now it works.. got to be in the cookbook directory on the workstation for it to work..
[2012-02-24 17:44:00 -0500] bluenemo_: but thank you very much jbz
[2012-02-24 17:44:00 -0500] jbz: np
[2012-02-24 17:45:00 -0500] jbz: bluenemo_: Sounds like the proper .chef directory and config files are in the cookbook directory in that path
[2012-02-24 17:45:00 -0500] jbz: *or in that path
[2012-02-24 17:45:00 -0500] jbz: (maybe at the repository level, if you're using that).
[2012-02-24 17:45:00 -0500] bluenemo_: its ../.
[2012-02-24 17:45:00 -0500] bluenemo_: ../..
[2012-02-24 17:46:00 -0500] bluenemo_: but what i dont get; by default if i run chef-client it should remove the stuff that worked from the run list right?
[2012-02-24 17:46:00 -0500] jbz: Not at all.
[2012-02-24 17:46:00 -0500] jbz: chef-client is meant to be run, if necessary, regularly.
[2012-02-24 17:46:00 -0500] bluenemo_: ah ok i see
[2012-02-24 17:47:00 -0500] jbz: It is not performing imperative actions ("do this and then finish") it is performing idempotent ones ("Every time you run, make things look like this")
[2012-02-24 17:47:00 -0500] bluenemo_: ah ok i see
[2012-02-24 17:47:00 -0500] jbz: So properly written recipes, when the system is configured as desired, do nothing.
[2012-02-24 17:47:00 -0500] jbz: Whoop, sorry, got pedantic.
[2012-02-24 17:47:00 -0500] bluenemo_: cant i tag or so that stuff only needs to be run once?
[2012-02-24 17:47:00 -0500] bluenemo_: ah ok i see..
[2012-02-24 17:47:00 -0500] jbz: Not easily.  You can make recipes that remove themselves from runlists
[2012-02-24 17:47:00 -0500] bluenemo_: hm thats an idea as well
[2012-02-24 17:48:00 -0500] jbz: but it's a much better idea to make a recipe that does what you want it to do and checks to see if that's been done already, and if so, does nothing.
[2012-02-24 17:48:00 -0500] bluenemo_: jup
[2012-02-24 17:48:00 -0500] jbz: That way, if the 'thing you want to do' gets undone at some point, the recipe (which is still running) will just fix it again. :-)
[2012-02-24 17:48:00 -0500] bluenemo_: thanks for those informations :)
[2012-02-24 17:48:00 -0500] jbz: You're welcome.
[2012-02-24 18:02:00 -0500] itwasntandy: if I do a knife node from file for a node which has not yet registered, and then register that node, and run chef
[2012-02-24 18:02:00 -0500] itwasntandy: I seem to get into a lovely stack trace in chef.
[2012-02-24 18:02:00 -0500] itwasntandy: if I do the same thing, after the node has registered for the first time, and then re-run chef
[2012-02-24 18:03:00 -0500] itwasntandy: the runlist all runs through fine
[2012-02-24 18:03:00 -0500] itwasntandy: is that expected behaviour?
[2012-02-24 18:03:00 -0500] jbz: itwasntandy: When you say 'register that node' you seem to be implying that the node isn't registering itself, is that correct?
[2012-02-24 18:04:00 -0500] itwasntandy: the node does register itself
[2012-02-24 18:04:00 -0500] itwasntandy: what I mean is
[2012-02-24 18:04:00 -0500] itwasntandy: the first time I run chef-client on that node

[2012-02-24 18:06:00 -0500] jbz: itwasntandy: It sounds like what's going on is that the node doesn't have permission to save its nodestate back to the server
[2012-02-24 18:06:00 -0500] itwasntandy: hrm ok
[2012-02-24 18:06:00 -0500] jbz: the node has to be registered to do that and a *client* as well as a node must be available
[2012-02-24 18:06:00 -0500] jbz: a node consists of a node record and a client associated with the node
[2012-02-24 18:07:00 -0500] jbz: If there's no client, the node can't make changes to the runstate
[2012-02-24 18:07:00 -0500] jbz: (on the server).
[2012-02-24 18:07:00 -0500] jbz: While creating the node on the server using knife takes care of there being a node record, there's no client available for the node until it registers and creates one.
[2012-02-24 18:07:00 -0500] jbz: (does that make sense)
[2012-02-24 18:07:00 -0500] jbz: ?
[2012-02-24 18:07:00 -0500] itwasntandy: ok, but surely it shoudl be fine to do a knife node from file foo.json for a node which doesn't yet exist, so on first run a node has a useful runlist?
[2012-02-24 18:07:00 -0500] itwasntandy: (whichis what I'm trying to do
[2012-02-24 18:08:00 -0500] itwasntandy: let me pu thtis into gist to explain
[2012-02-24 18:15:00 -0500] itwasntandy: jbz: https://gist.github.com/1902516
[2012-02-24 18:17:00 -0500] jbz: itwasntandy: What was in the stacktrace?
[2012-02-24 18:18:00 -0500] itwasntandy: https://gist.github.com/1902543
[2012-02-24 18:18:00 -0500] jbz: Yeah.  Okay.  So at the end of the first run, the client isn't allowed to make changes to the node record.  This is probably because of the following:
[2012-02-24 18:19:00 -0500] jbz: 1) when you create the node using knife, your user has permission to make changes to that node.  Nothing else does.
[2012-02-24 18:19:00 -0500] jbz: 2) When the node first contacts the server, it realizes it doesn't have a client, so it creates one ("Registering").
[2012-02-24 18:19:00 -0500] jbz: 3) BUT, since the node record already exists, that client cannot grant itself permissions to modify the node record!  Your user has those perms.
[2012-02-24 18:19:00 -0500] itwasntandy: ah
[2012-02-24 18:19:00 -0500] jbz: 4) When you delete the node record and re-run chef, there is no node record, so when the chef-client on the node tries to save the runstate it is allowed to create one.
[2012-02-24 18:20:00 -0500] itwasntandy: that mkaes sense
[2012-02-24 18:20:00 -0500] jbz: This is why it's generally a good idea to let nodes handle registering and creating their clients first - otherwise it getscomplex. :-)
[2012-02-24 18:21:00 -0500] itwasntandy: yep - but that makes on the fly provisioning of stuff a pain
[2012-02-24 18:21:00 -0500] jbz: no
[2012-02-24 18:21:00 -0500] jbz: use the attributes.json file on the node.
[2012-02-24 18:21:00 -0500] itwasntandy: oh to set the runlist there
[2012-02-24 18:21:00 -0500] itwasntandy: yeh that could work
[2012-02-24 18:21:00 -0500] jbz: If you put the runlist, environment and attributes there, it works
[2012-02-24 18:22:00 -0500] jbz: I think that's how knife bootstrap does it, but not positive.
[2012-02-24 18:22:00 -0500] itwasntandy: for most of what I'm doing knife bootstrap is good stuff
[2012-02-24 18:23:00 -0500] jbz: We handle this by having the node include a single role in the attributes.json and then later if we need to mod the runlist we just change that role on the server.
[2012-02-24 18:23:00 -0500] jbz: Since roles can include roles, we're all good.

[2012-02-24 18:38:00 -0500] marty: is it just using the package from 11, or did you build a package from source?
[2012-02-24 18:39:00 -0500] marty: was going to write a collectd plugin from source but then i was like wait a minute
[2012-02-24 18:39:00 -0500] coderanger: I rebuilt the 11.04 package on lucid
[2012-02-24 18:39:00 -0500] marty: ahh cool cheers man
[2012-02-24 18:39:00 -0500] coderanger: but I don't have access to that deb anymore, from $LASTJOB
[2012-02-24 18:39:00 -0500] marty: haha @ $LASTJOB
[2012-02-24 18:39:00 -0500] marty: nice
[2012-02-24 18:41:00 -0500] aslan: hi all... i have a question about apache recipe
[2012-02-24 18:43:00 -0500] aslan: i noticed the way the recipe is setup once you start the machine it requires apache to restart for every module that you want to enable. and this sometimes causes apache to fail. i am not sure why they fail but i assume the restart commands step on each others toes
[2012-02-24 18:44:00 -0500] aslan: and then there is my own site config file which also causes another restart. can't all of these be converted to one restart?
[2012-02-24 18:46:00 -0500] marty: are you sure those restarts arent delayed and stacked up into 1 restart?
[2012-02-24 18:48:00 -0500] bdha: What do folks use to diff cookbooks before they upload them?
[2012-02-24 18:48:00 -0500] bdha: ie, what you're about to upload and what's actually on Chef Server.
[2012-02-24 18:49:00 -0500] aslan: mattray: they are all delayed but they are not stacked up to one restart
[2012-02-24 18:49:00 -0500] marty: bdha: version numbering, git flow and knife cookbook download
[2012-02-24 18:50:00 -0500] aslan: mattray: is the delayed directive suppose to convert all of the restart requests into one?
[2012-02-24 18:50:00 -0500] marty: im not mattray but i believe so
[2012-02-24 18:50:00 -0500] mattray: aslan: pretty sure you mean marty
[2012-02-24 18:50:00 -0500] aslan: mattray: my bad
[2012-02-24 18:51:00 -0500] aslan: marty:  they are all delayed but they are not stacked up
[2012-02-24 18:51:00 -0500] marty: hmm sorry thats all i understood about it
[2012-02-24 18:51:00 -0500] mattray: aslan: no worries, my IRC client kept beeping at me
[2012-02-24 18:52:00 -0500] SplasPood: Can anyone point me to where chef (specifically opscode's private 'platform', but I imagine it's the same for standard chef) stores the mappings on permissions for clients?  I want to delete a specific client, chef isn't letting me either via the API or webui and it won't even show me the permissions (no permissions to view..) so I wanna check on the backend
[2012-02-24 18:59:00 -0500] laurent\: SplasPood: i'm not really helping, but the opensource chef doesn't have the acl/permissions thing
[2012-02-24 19:00:00 -0500] SplasPood: laurent\: oh no?  I thought it did
[2012-02-24 19:00:00 -0500] holoway: SplasPood: probably fastest to file a ticket via support@opscode.com
[2012-02-24 19:00:00 -0500] SplasPood: holoway: I did, attempting to speed things up by doing my own digging in the mean time ;)
[2012-02-24 19:00:00 -0500] holoway: SplasPood: you probably need to be in the admins group
[2012-02-24 19:01:00 -0500] SplasPood: I am tho
[2012-02-24 19:01:00 -0500] SplasPood: thats the confusing part..
[2012-02-24 19:01:00 -0500] holoway: cool - the support folks will help ya out
[2012-02-24 19:25:00 -0500] jdeamattson: I am not seeing a clean and clean example of setting default_attributes based on environment. Is this possible? If so, can someone give me a pointer to the appropriate documentation? Reading the documentation, it seems possible, but isn't clear that it is...
[2012-02-24 19:38:00 -0500] Guest60346: Hi Everyone. I'm evaluating Chef. Looks like it does a great job of helping to provision a new machine. How appropriate is it for applying updates to an existing machine?
[2012-02-24 19:38:00 -0500] KarlHungus: its for converging configuration on any machines
[2012-02-24 19:39:00 -0500] KarlHungus: new or existing
[2012-02-24 19:39:00 -0500] KarlHungus: its not for provisioning in the traditional sense. provisioning is os installation, bios config, etc
[2012-02-24 19:40:00 -0500] ggolin: hi all - im trying to use begin-rescue with a package resource, something like this  https://gist.github.com/1903209 however chef-client fails when said package cannot be found. what am i doing wrong?
[2012-02-24 19:41:00 -0500] Guest60346: Thanks KarlHungus. Sounds like it might be a good fit then. All our machines will already have the OS and everything below it ready to do. It will mostly be libraries and applications that we need to deploy.
[2012-02-24 19:42:00 -0500] ssd7: ggolin: That won't work becuase of some implementation details of how chef works.  However, you shoudl be able to set ignore_failure true within the resource
[2012-02-24 19:42:00 -0500] ggolin: ssd7, yes, it just hit me as well, thank you
[2012-02-24 19:42:00 -0500] mattray: ggolin: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-CommonAttributes
[2012-02-24 19:51:00 -0500] Kabe: Hi all, i've exhausted google search so if this is a common request please accept my apologies. I'm looking for any information on how i might make edits to files (adding some additional includes to some .h files) with chef as part of my recipe.
[2012-02-24 19:54:00 -0500] mattray: Kabe: if they're packaged within your cookbook, we recommend templates
[2012-02-24 19:54:00 -0500] mattray: Kabe: editing files in place can be tricky
[2012-02-24 19:56:00 -0500] lusis: there was, however, a post to the mailing list recently about it
[2012-02-24 19:56:00 -0500] Twirrim: http://rubydoc.info/gems/chef/0.8.16/Chef/Util/FileEdit   if you really must edit in place
[2012-02-24 19:56:00 -0500] lusis: yeah that
[2012-02-24 19:56:00 -0500] lusis: heh
[2012-02-24 19:57:00 -0500] Kabe: ok thanks! i need to edit some files that are part of a tarball that i pull down as part of the recipe. for sure i can see how it would be very tricky.
[2012-02-24 19:58:00 -0500] lusis: you can also use templates with local file
[2012-02-24 19:58:00 -0500] lusis: s
[2012-02-24 19:59:00 -0500] Twirrim: you could override the file in the tar ball with a template, maybe?
[2012-02-24 20:00:00 -0500] Kabe: OK will look at that too. thanks everyone for your help
[2012-02-24 20:31:00 -0500] Twirrim: I might be being a bit daft at the moment, but it looks like the chef-client recipe is broken?  It's struggling to find the chef-client file on amazon s3 from the looks of the strace output
[2012-02-24 20:41:00 -0500] Twirrim: hmm.. weird, that's bizarre behaviour.  knife cookbook download chef-client fetched it a-ok
[2012-02-24 20:41:00 -0500] jbz: Twirrim:  Opscode stores cookbooks for the platform on S3.  So if you look at trace info, you'll see it trying to get S3 objects.
[2012-02-24 20:42:00 -0500] jbz: Knife will (I think) retrieve the cookbook from the server (or at least, you won't see it get redirected to S3) but chef-client will show itself trying to pull cookbooks on the Opscode platform from S3.
[2012-02-24 20:42:00 -0500] jbz: (in logs)
[2012-02-24 20:50:00 -0500] ggolin: so.. chef-full - gem_package installs gems into /opt/opscode/
[2012-02-24 20:50:00 -0500] ggolin: good times...
[2012-02-24 20:50:00 -0500] jbz: ggolin: By default.  I think you can set that.
[2012-02-24 20:51:00 -0500] ggolin: gem_binary i take it
[2012-02-24 20:51:00 -0500] Twirrim: jbz: sure.. I just seem to be what now looks to be intermittent connectivity issues with S3 I guess.
[2012-02-24 20:52:00 -0500] Twirrim: keep getting EOENT route messages back.  Frustrating but could be anywhere along the chain :D
[2012-02-24 20:52:00 -0500] Twirrim: have managed to finally grab what I needed!
[2012-02-24 20:52:00 -0500] jbz: ggolin:  Now I've confused myself :-D
[2012-02-24 20:53:00 -0500] jbz: maybe?  Yeah?
[2012-02-24 20:53:00 -0500] jtimberman: ggolin: yeah, gem_binary parameter to the gem_package resource will use a different gem executable. the 0.10.10 release will have a new "chef_gem" resource that will be for specifically installing gems for Chef to use.
[2012-02-24 20:54:00 -0500] jbz: Twirrim: Yeah, I had a couple of S3 hiccups about 20 mins ago
[2012-02-24 20:58:00 -0500] nictrix1: does anyone know if I specify cookbook constraints in the environment file, will that environment stop any new cookbooks from being deployed in that environment?
[2012-02-24 21:01:00 -0500] Brad_K: if you specify a particular version of a cookbook, then only that version of that cookbook will get deployed to machines in that environment.  we're using that to protect our production environment from development that is ongoing with some of our cookbooks.
[2012-02-24 21:01:00 -0500] gchristensen: hi, is this apps section here using a databag called `ngnx` -> `apps` ? https://github.com/gchef/nginx-cookbook
[2012-02-24 21:04:00 -0500] Brad_K: gchristensen: i'm not seeing any obvious data bag use in that cookbook.  where did you see something that led you to that question?
[2012-02-24 21:04:00 -0500] rbarrero: Hi all
[2012-02-24 21:04:00 -0500] rbarrero: I have a recipe that works welll, but it runs every time I re-apply the role to a set of servers
[2012-02-24 21:04:00 -0500] gchristensen: Brad_K: I guess I'm just not really sure where different cookbooks are getting their information, and I don't know how to tell the difference
[2012-02-24 21:05:00 -0500] rbarrero: ideally it would only do so if the file or package wasn't there
[2012-02-24 21:05:00 -0500] Brad_K: gchristensen: most of the information in that cookbook would either come from attributes that are defined in files in the attributes subdirectory, or from attributes that you specify in your role definition.
[2012-02-24 21:06:00 -0500] gchristensen: mm ok
[2012-02-24 21:06:00 -0500] Brad_K: rbarrero: what "not_if" or "only_if" statements do you have in the recipe to detect when there is no need for the recipe to run again?
[2012-02-24 21:07:00 -0500] Brad_K: gchristensen: all those attributes would get put together and you would see the results displayed in the templates that get deployed to the node with the appropriate recipes.
[2012-02-24 21:08:00 -0500] gchristensen: Brad_K: I understand that. I appreciate your help
[2012-02-24 21:09:00 -0500] Brad_K: rbarrero: otherwise, the recipe isn't going to be able to detect whether or not it should run if the roles & recipes in the run list are different from the last time it ran.  it will think that this is a first-time run of that recipe, and so it will run it.  after that, it should be able to determine if any of the cached copies of the recipe are different from the last time it ran the recipe, and therefore be able to determine whether or not it should r
[2012-02-24 21:50:00 -0500] Twirrim: http://pastebin.com/ZmF4k7d9  Any particular thoughts?  That's from trying to run the openldap::auth script.
[2012-02-24 21:51:00 -0500] Twirrim: I'm fairly new at reading these stack traces but so far as I can figure there is no reference to why the template hasn't been created or what happened to it.
[2012-02-24 21:52:00 -0500] Twirrim: it completed part of it, created /etc/ldap.conf okay
[2012-02-24 21:54:00 -0500] locke105: looks like its trying to put it in /etc/ldap/ldap.conf? do you have a /etc/ldap/ directory?
[2012-02-24 21:55:00 -0500] lusis: ENOENT is the key
[2012-02-24 21:56:00 -0500] lusis: what's your template DSL look like in the recipe?
[2012-02-24 21:56:00 -0500] Twirrim: no, no /etc/ldap directory.  Wouldn't generally expect one on an CentOS box.
[2012-02-24 21:56:00 -0500] lusis: template[/etc/ldap/ldap.conf]
[2012-02-24 21:56:00 -0500] lusis: it's trying to create a file there though
[2012-02-24 21:57:00 -0500] lusis: if you don't have an /etc/ldap/, it can't create the file
[2012-02-24 21:58:00 -0500] lusis: It's not going to infer that it needs to create the directory to put the template there
[2012-02-24 21:58:00 -0500] Twirrim: I guess I assumed it would create appropriate directories.  Okay.. time to figure out the other problem then.  Why it's trying to write to /etc/ldap when it should be writing to /etc/openldap if it's processing attributes correctly
[2012-02-24 21:58:00 -0500] lusis: because it would need to know the permissions
[2012-02-24 21:58:00 -0500] lusis: owner/group
[2012-02-24 21:58:00 -0500] lusis: where does it stop? What if /etc/ doesn't exist
[2012-02-24 21:58:00 -0500] lusis: yeah it's a bit of a "wtf moment"
[2012-02-24 21:58:00 -0500] lusis: but the safer solution
[2012-02-24 21:59:00 -0500] Twirrim: absolutely
[2012-02-24 21:59:00 -0500] lusis: there's an email on the mailing list about this exact thing right now btw ;)
[2012-02-24 21:59:00 -0500] lusis: recursive directory creation
[2012-02-24 21:59:00 -0500] locke105: you can do that with the directory resource...
[2012-02-24 22:00:00 -0500] locke105: or you are talking about the openldap::auth book. nvm
[2012-02-24 22:00:00 -0500] Twirrim: looks like this should be classified under 'bug' for the recipe, I'll file a bug and see if I can fix it.  It tries to create /etc/ldap/ldap.conf regardless of the platform, even though it's set in attributes
[2012-02-24 22:01:00 -0500] lusis: him maybe tehre isn't a ticket
[2012-02-24 22:01:00 -0500] lusis: I swear I just saw this discussion
[2012-02-24 22:01:00 -0500] lusis: Twirrim: is this an official cookbook?
[2012-02-24 22:03:00 -0500] Twirrim: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/openldap
[2012-02-24 22:03:00 -0500] lusis: locke105: yes you can but note the issue around permissions
[2012-02-24 22:04:00 -0500] Twirrim: it doesn't explicitly support centos, so I was expecting problems :)
[2012-02-24 22:05:00 -0500] lusis: er
[2012-02-24 22:05:00 -0500] lusis: one sec
[2012-02-24 22:06:00 -0500] lusis: what version do you have?
[2012-02-24 22:06:00 -0500] lusis: (check metadata.rb)
[2012-02-24 22:07:00 -0500] lusis: 0.9.4 is on github
[2012-02-24 22:07:00 -0500] Twirrim: 0.9.3
[2012-02-24 22:07:00 -0500] lusis: I haven't poked at all the recipes
[2012-02-24 22:07:00 -0500] lusis: but there are conditionals in the attributes
[2012-02-24 22:07:00 -0500] lusis: hrmm
[2012-02-24 22:07:00 -0500] Twirrim: yup, but look at the auth.rb recipe
[2012-02-24 22:08:00 -0500] lusis: yeah
[2012-02-24 22:08:00 -0500] lusis: okay
[2012-02-24 22:08:00 -0500] lusis: easy enough to fix ;)
[2012-02-24 22:09:00 -0500] Twirrim: seems both Chef and Puppet are fairly heavily focussed around Ubuntu, which adds extra fun doing this in a centos environment :D
[2012-02-24 22:09:00 -0500] Twirrim: that and I'm being lazy and not writing my own recipes.
[2012-02-24 22:10:00 -0500] lusis: nah, opscode is getting better about writing more cross-distro recipes
[2012-02-24 22:10:00 -0500] lusis: and I've always found puppet to be more rhel friendly
[2012-02-24 22:11:00 -0500] locke105: puppet tends to fit better with the RHEL audience anyways
[2012-02-24 22:12:00 -0500] locke105: lusis: i don't understand what you mean by problems with permissions...
[2012-02-24 22:14:00 -0500] lusis: locke105: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Directory look under recursive
[2012-02-24 22:15:00 -0500] sardaven: exit
[2012-02-24 22:15:00 -0500] sardaven: exit
[2012-02-24 22:15:00 -0500] locke105: lusis: gotcha, forgot about that
[2012-02-24 22:16:00 -0500] dhruvbansal: I'm having some trouble understanding how default/override attributes apply to nested hashes.  If I set 'default[:foo][:users] = {}' in an attributes file, and later, in a role, override node[:foo][:users] with { :user1 => {...}, :user2 => {...}}, shouldn't the value of node[:foo][:users][:user1] be the hash I set in the role?  That's not the behavior I'm seeing...
[2012-02-24 22:18:00 -0500] dhruvbansal: What's even more confusing is that I see the expected attributes data in the web UI but it seems different during chef-client execution b/c I get an error...
[2012-02-24 22:43:00 -0500] and311: Do "notifies" statements in a template resource only notify if the resulting file has changed from its previous contents?
[2012-02-24 22:44:00 -0500] mattray: and311: yes
[2012-02-24 22:45:00 -0500] and311: mattray: Interesting. This wasn't clear from the docs.
[2012-02-24 22:45:00 -0500] mattray: and311: these docs? http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Notifications
[2012-02-24 22:46:00 -0500] and311: mattray: Yes, and the one for Templates and Files.
[2012-02-24 22:47:00 -0500] and311: mattray: It says "Notify another resource to take an action if this resource changes state for any reason.", but "change state" is ambiguous to me. Not sure if that means the resource ran, or if there is some internal check in the resource/provider to inspect for change.
[2012-02-24 22:48:00 -0500] mattray: the resources will always run
[2012-02-24 22:48:00 -0500] siezer: it should notify for any "fix"
[2012-02-24 22:48:00 -0500] mattray: but whether or not they make a change is what triggers
[2012-02-24 22:48:00 -0500] siezer: contents, mode, user, etc
[2012-02-24 22:49:00 -0500] and311: Makes sense.
[2012-02-24 22:49:00 -0500] and311: So then it's up to the resource to inspect whether or not the run resulted in anything different?
[2012-02-24 22:50:00 -0500] and311: Or the provider I guess.
[2012-02-24 22:50:00 -0500] siezer: exactly
[2012-02-24 22:51:00 -0500] and311: Ok, maybe some words on the wiki to clarify this would be great.
[2012-02-24 22:51:00 -0500] mattray: yeah, inside the provider there's an method new_resource.updated_by_last_action(true) that gets thrown
[2012-02-24 22:52:00 -0500] mattray: and311: well, it is a wiki :) Something in here http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Notifications
[2012-02-24 22:52:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: ahoy shefs.
[2012-02-24 22:53:00 -0500] and311: Can the public edit?
[2012-02-24 22:53:00 -0500] and311: I can provide the change if that's the case.
[2012-02-24 22:54:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: I have a weird issue using the nagios cookbook.  There's a "nagios_conf" definition that notifies nagios to restart if a template has changed.
[2012-02-24 22:54:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: But it seems to think my template has changed *every* time.
[2012-02-24 22:55:00 -0500] mattray: and311: yeah, just login and go nuts
[2012-02-24 22:56:00 -0500] mattray: nuts of course, is relative
[2012-02-24 22:56:00 -0500] mattray: gmcinnes1: is it passing in a hash?
[2012-02-24 22:56:00 -0500] and311: mattray: Haha, ok.
[2012-02-24 22:57:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: mattray: what do you mean a hash? I'm passing in variables, if that's what you mean.
[2012-02-24 22:58:00 -0500] mattray: gmcinnes1: right, just wondering if order is changing in your variables and that's causing rewrites
[2012-02-24 22:58:00 -0500] siezer: I propose we name the wiki Chewbacca
[2012-02-24 22:58:00 -0500] siezer: "chewbacca! what a wiki!" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjQMpBb1gps
[2012-02-24 22:58:00 -0500] mattray: siezer: Berzerker!
[2012-02-24 22:59:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: mattray: oh. I see what you mean.  No, its just a string, I think. Let me check.
[2012-02-24 22:59:00 -0500] mattray: gmcinnes1: run it with -l debug?
[2012-02-24 22:59:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: yup. I have. I got:  template[/etc/nagios3/conf.d/pagerduty_nagios.cfg] sending restart action to service[nagios] (delayed)
[2012-02-24 22:59:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: but its not clear why.
[2012-02-24 23:00:00 -0500] chip_: Now that site-cookbooks is deprecated, what's the recommended workflow for keeping my personal cookbooks separate from vendored ones?
[2012-02-24 23:00:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: well, it is.
[2012-02-24 23:00:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: it changes owner, group, mode and updates content.
[2012-02-24 23:02:00 -0500] denysonique__: anyone usig chef-rvm?
[2012-02-24 23:02:00 -0500] denysonique__: I get often: NOTE: Gem::SourceIndex#add_spec is deprecated, use Specification.add_spec. It will be removed on or after 2011-11-01.
[2012-02-24 23:02:00 -0500] denysonique__: How can I fix this?
[2012-02-24 23:04:00 -0500] mattray: chip_: vendor branching
[2012-02-24 23:05:00 -0500] mattray: chip_: fork it locally
[2012-02-24 23:05:00 -0500] mattray: and track upstream
[2012-02-24 23:06:00 -0500] chip_: mattray: how's that keep apache::customer.rb out of customer2's logs when the apache cookbook gets pulled?
[2012-02-24 23:07:00 -0500] mattray: chip_: not sure I follow
[2012-02-24 23:13:00 -0500] Twirrim: lusis: I'll grab a look at the weekend but it looks like that openldap thing will need a complete overhaul from a RedHat/CentOS/whatever 6 perspective.  They've made some serious changes under the hood with LDAP auth.
[2012-02-24 23:14:00 -0500] siezer: I have a most-of-the-way-done freeipa cookbook that I never work on because I'm too busy doing things that people give a shit about ;)
[2012-02-24 23:15:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: arrgh. This is effed.
[2012-02-24 23:16:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: It says the template hasn't changed, but it keeps restarting because of that template.
[2012-02-24 23:16:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: Curse this infernal device.
[2012-02-24 23:21:00 -0500] mattray: gmcinnes1: which version of Chef?
[2012-02-24 23:31:00 -0500] mlei: i'm testing the effect of disabling ohai plugins... is there any way to see the ohai attributes list *with* the plugins disabled?
[2012-02-24 23:32:00 -0500] mlei: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Disabling+Ohai+Plugins says i can't disable plugins when running ohai manually
[2012-02-24 23:34:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: So, for some reason, chef thinks the current content of my config file's checksum is nil. Why would that be?
[2012-02-24 23:46:00 -0500] cmceldowney: hi all- I know how to use the notifies command to trigger a service restart from a template, but what about from a separate recipe?
[2012-02-24 23:47:00 -0500] Babar: you need to include_recipe
[2012-02-24 23:49:00 -0500] cmceldowney: Babar: ok. is including the recipe sufficient, or how do I reference the service defined by the recipe and trigger a deferred restart?
[2012-02-24 23:51:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: wtf: http://pastie.org/3451076
