[2012-02-04 11:07:00 -0500] mosez: is it possible that the opscode apt cookbook doesnt work for chef solo?
[2012-02-04 11:08:00 -0500] mosez: the repository provider seems to be broken for me :( when i'm loading the apt cookbook i'm getting this: [Sat, 04 Feb 2012 12:03:54 +0100] DEBUG: Re-raising exception: NameError - wrong constant name Apt.Repository
[2012-02-04 15:25:00 -0500] jtimberman: mosez: are you using the cookbook from http://github.com/opscode/cookbooks master? or from http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/apt ?
[2012-02-04 15:26:00 -0500] jtimberman: the former is "in development, unreleased, untested" - the latter is "tested and released" and you should it instead of the one in github.
[2012-02-04 15:26:00 -0500] jtimberman: the README in the cookbooks project should make that pretty clear.
[2012-02-04 17:10:00 -0500] miah: moin
[2012-02-04 17:21:00 -0500] yfeldblum: moin
[2012-02-04 17:53:00 -0500] Cope: moin
[2012-02-04 17:55:00 -0500] mosez: jtimberman: but the one on community and on github looks on most parts identical
[2012-02-04 17:55:00 -0500] mosez: jtimberman: i tried the on from github
[2012-02-04 17:56:00 -0500] Cope: mosez: if you use upstream development cookbooks from git, there's every chance it's broken.
[2012-02-04 17:58:00 -0500] Cope: mosez: download the community one, and try that. If *that* is broken, raise an issue :)
[2012-02-04 18:00:00 -0500] mosez: ok
[2012-02-04 18:39:00 -0500] Cope: mosez: how's that going?
[2012-02-04 19:09:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: is there any way to run ohai to fill out node info before i run my cookbooks?
[2012-02-04 19:10:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: randomly my chef run will fail because the node doesnt have its ip address defined yet
[2012-02-04 19:11:00 -0500] yfeldblum: ohai always runs first
[2012-02-04 19:12:00 -0500] yfeldblum: what's the scenario in which the node doesn't have its ipaddress yes? is it when you're doing the first chef-client run on a node, and the run is doing a search, and the search result includes your node?
[2012-02-04 19:13:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: yes
[2012-02-04 19:13:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: first run on a node
[2012-02-04 19:13:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: doing a search
[2012-02-04 19:14:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: basically doing a search for all ip addresses in my environment (for ip tables)
[2012-02-04 19:16:00 -0500] yfeldblum: arrowtoknee, so when you're looping through the node search results, when you come to the node result whose name is equal to the current node's name, then you must use the data from the current node rather than from the node from the search result
[2012-02-04 19:16:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: hmm
[2012-02-04 19:16:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: environment_ips = search(:node, "chef_environment:#{node.chef_environment}").reject{|n| defined?(n.ipaddress)}.collect { |n| n.ipaddress }
[2012-02-04 19:16:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: thats what im using
[2012-02-04 19:17:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: whats a better way to do that?
[2012-02-04 19:17:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: i dont even really need the ip of the server itself
[2012-02-04 19:17:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: as i dont have to add itself to its own firewall
[2012-02-04 19:18:00 -0500] yfeldblum: why `.reject{|n| defined?(n.ipaddress)}` in there?
[2012-02-04 19:21:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: skip any nodes that dont have ip address defined
[2012-02-04 19:21:00 -0500] Damm: you shouldn't be getting indexes nodes without an ipaddress defined
[2012-02-04 19:21:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: that fixed a lot of my initial issues
[2012-02-04 19:21:00 -0500] Cope: arrowtoknee: that code looks like it does the opposite
[2012-02-04 19:21:00 -0500] Damm: ideally
[2012-02-04 19:22:00 -0500] yfeldblum: arrowtoknee, http://pastie.org/private/qsdbrkeotor4ypxs6goa
[2012-02-04 19:22:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: awesome thanks yfeldblum!
[2012-02-04 19:23:00 -0500] Damm: yfeldblum, +1 to compact
[2012-02-04 19:23:00 -0500] Damm: :)
[2012-02-04 19:23:00 -0500] Cope: arrowtoknee: also, compact is better than that reject stuff
[2012-02-04 19:23:00 -0500] Damm: alot cleaner
[2012-02-04 19:23:00 -0500] Cope: arrowtoknee: and ftr, if w're picking, map is more idiomatic
[2012-02-04 19:24:00 -0500] yfeldblum: also, Kernel#defined? doesn't actually do what you're trying to do here ... if you're trying to check if a node has a key, use n.has_key?("ipaddress")
[2012-02-04 19:24:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: coooooooool
[2012-02-04 19:24:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: thanks again
[2012-02-04 19:25:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: was working ok just wasnt perfect
[2012-02-04 19:25:00 -0500] yfeldblum: Cope, switched it to #map
[2012-02-04 19:26:00 -0500] yfeldblum: apparently #collect is idiomatic smalltalk, #map is idiomatic in every other language
[2012-02-04 19:27:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: ok so i should use the map version?
[2012-02-04 19:27:00 -0500] Cope: arrowtoknee: they're aliases
[2012-02-04 19:27:00 -0500] Cope: arrowtoknee: but map is more idiomatic ruby than collect
[2012-02-04 19:27:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: k
[2012-02-04 19:27:00 -0500] yfeldblum: arrowtoknee, #map and #collect are the same method, but everyone typically uses #map
[2012-02-04 19:27:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: gotcha
[2012-02-04 19:27:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: hoping this turns my 10% failure rate to 0!
[2012-02-04 19:28:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: doing auto scaling
[2012-02-04 19:28:00 -0500] Cope: to the cloud!
[2012-02-04 19:28:00 -0500] yfeldblum: climb that magic beanstalk!
[2012-02-04 19:28:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: WOOOO YEAH
[2012-02-04 19:29:00 -0500] yfeldblum: anyway the point of it all was this line: map{|n| n.name == node.name ? node : n}
[2012-02-04 19:30:00 -0500] yfeldblum: cheers
[2012-02-04 19:30:00 -0500] Damm: select, collect
[2012-02-04 19:30:00 -0500] Damm: all the ways to do it wrong
[2012-02-04 19:31:00 -0500] Damm: that's actually kinda why I like fujin's https://github.com/fujin/chef-discovery
[2012-02-04 19:33:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: ahh thats nice wish i would have saw this before
[2012-02-04 19:33:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: original code not written by me just trying to fix it
[2012-02-04 19:37:00 -0500] Damm: hindsight's 2020
[2012-02-04 19:50:00 -0500] aeris: how i can merge attribute on a node with multiple role ?
[2012-02-04 19:50:00 -0500] aeris: hello #chef
[2012-02-04 19:50:00 -0500] aeris: i have a question
[2012-02-04 19:51:00 -0500] aeris: for example, role1 :value => [ 1, 2 ], role2 :value => [ 3 ], and a node with role1 and role2 must have :value => [1, 2, 3]
[2012-02-04 19:55:00 -0500] Cope: aeris: it would help us if you actually told us what problem you're trying to solve
[2012-02-04 19:55:00 -0500] aeris: i create a recipe to manage firewall
[2012-02-04 19:56:00 -0500] aeris: so sshserver role open 22 and webserver role open 80 and 443
[2012-02-04 19:56:00 -0500] Cope: okay
[2012-02-04 19:56:00 -0500] Cope: and you set attributes in your role?
[2012-02-04 19:56:00 -0500] aeris: yes
[2012-02-04 19:57:00 -0500] aeris: uh, i have a most serious problem first run of chef-client ok, but other lead to 403 forbidden ><
[2012-02-04 19:58:00 -0500] Cope: bit more detail would help; are you using hosted chef?
[2012-02-04 19:59:00 -0500] aeris: yes, hosted for the moment
[2012-02-04 19:59:00 -0500] Cope: ok, and at what point do you see 403s?
[2012-02-04 19:59:00 -0500] Cope: could you provide logs?
[2012-02-04 19:59:00 -0500] aeris: yep
[2012-02-04 19:59:00 -0500] aeris: very short the logs :
[2012-02-04 20:00:00 -0500] Cope: back in 5
[2012-02-04 20:00:00 -0500] aeris: http://pastebin.com/CEVjREgR
[2012-02-04 20:00:00 -0500] Cope: put the logs somewhere we can see them :) and run with -l debug
[2012-02-04 20:03:00 -0500] aeris: hum
[2012-02-04 20:03:00 -0500] aeris: found it
[2012-02-04 20:04:00 -0500] aeris: seems knife create role with any permission on hosted
[2012-02-04 20:04:00 -0500] aeris: adding clients read permission and it's ok
[2012-02-04 20:05:00 -0500] aeris: and seems it's good for attribute once the permission fixed =)
[2012-02-04 20:06:00 -0500] jstump: Is there a way to "merge" attributes for roles (or environments)?
[2012-02-04 20:07:00 -0500] jstump: e.g. If I have a role with an attribute of [foo, bar] and another role that the node is in with an attribute of [baz] does that attribute become [foo, bar, baz] when Chef runs?
[2012-02-04 20:07:00 -0500] aeris: jstump
[2012-02-04 20:07:00 -0500] aeris: <aeris> hello #chef
[2012-02-04 20:07:00 -0500] aeris: <aeris> i have a question
[2012-02-04 20:07:00 -0500] aeris: <aeris> how i can merge attribute on a node with multiple role ?
[2012-02-04 20:07:00 -0500] aeris: <aeris> for example, role1 :value => [ 1, 2 ], role2 :value => [ 3 ], and a node with role1 and role2 must have :value => [1, 2, 3]
[2012-02-04 20:07:00 -0500] aeris: exactly same question :
[2012-02-04 20:07:00 -0500] Cope: that's teh very same question!
[2012-02-04 20:08:00 -0500] aeris: but the response is
[2012-02-04 20:08:00 -0500] aeris: chef handle this case correctly
[2012-02-04 20:08:00 -0500] jstump: aeris: All just magically eh? You expect me to trust that it's that simple?! ;)
[2012-02-04 20:08:00 -0500] aeris: yes
[2012-02-04 20:08:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: attributes are deep merged when Chef runs
[2012-02-04 20:08:00 -0500] jstump: aeris: Cool. Now I can continue with my world domination plans.
[2012-02-04 20:08:00 -0500] aeris: just define attributes in each role
[2012-02-04 20:09:00 -0500] aeris: jstump > this is MY plan :
[2012-02-04 20:09:00 -0500] jstump: Can someone explain what override_attributes are then? And are attributes deep merged across environment, node, and role?
[2012-02-04 20:09:00 -0500] jstump: aeris: Haha, sounds like great minds think (and question) alike. :-D
[2012-02-04 20:10:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: sure
[2012-02-04 20:10:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: so... the Chef attribute system has a precedence model
[2012-02-04 20:10:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: We set sane defaults in cookbook attributes files
[2012-02-04 20:10:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: but can override in roles
[2012-02-04 20:11:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: we can also calculate on the fly and apply to the node.  Since attributes are just on the Node object
[2012-02-04 20:13:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: for most purposes, setting sane defaults in the cookbook and overriding in the role provides enough flexibility, but there are more options than that available.
[2012-02-04 20:13:00 -0500] jstump: Cope: Right, that much I get, but what I don't quite understand is how environment/roles work (sounds like node, environment, cookbook, and role attributes are deep merged by default). In other words, the "attributes" key on a role, cookbook, or node would be merged and overwrite attributes/default.rb.
[2012-02-04 20:13:00 -0500] jstump: But I know environments and others have "override_attributes". What are those and why would you use them?
[2012-02-04 20:13:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: so, you can set attributes in 4 places
[2012-02-04 20:14:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: environment, cookbook, role, recipe/direct on node
[2012-02-04 20:15:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: tere re also 3 'levels' for attributes, so you get a matric
[2012-02-04 20:16:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: if you have a node in a given environment (separate subject) you have the option of setting that at a default level in the environment file
[2012-02-04 20:16:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: setting attributes on that node, I mean
[2012-02-04 20:17:00 -0500] Cope: So nodes in a 'test' environment could have a database set to sqllite, or some other such relevant setting
[2012-02-04 20:17:00 -0500] jstump: Right.
[2012-02-04 20:17:00 -0500] Cope: with enc you can only set default or override
[2012-02-04 20:18:00 -0500] jstump: I think I have how regular "attributes" work overall: cookbook -> environment -> role -> node.
[2012-02-04 20:18:00 -0500] Cope: and in precendence terms, you're either very low or very high
[2012-02-04 20:18:00 -0500] jstump: What I don't understand is the "override_attributes" that I see in my environments file.
[2012-02-04 20:18:00 -0500] jstump: Oh, wait, does that allow me to override at a higher level what's going on at a lower level?
[2012-02-04 20:18:00 -0500] Cope: ok... so override_attributes is a method, it trimps all others
[2012-02-04 20:19:00 -0500] Cope: aoart from setting on a node directly in a recipe
[2012-02-04 20:19:00 -0500] jstump: Gotcha. So  I can manually code something into a recipe, which will always trump all metadata (which makes sense), but otherwise an override_attributes key/val would override a role/node from an environment.
[2012-02-04 20:20:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: exactly so; you can override the default attributes in a number of places; the one with maximum prioroty is setting directly on the node in a recipe; the very lowest is default attributes in a cookbook attributes file
[2012-02-04 20:21:00 -0500] jstump: Cope: I think I'm 99.9999% clear on the subject now. My last question is about what all nodes should have to make Chef really sing. I was groping around about how to set interval to find out that all Chef servers should have the chef-client recipe. Looks like I should add ohai too?
[2012-02-04 20:22:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: chef-client will run ohai; and a standard bootstrap will ensure ohai is there.
[2012-02-04 20:23:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: if you do a chef-client -l debug, you'll see a buch of 'plugins' being loaded (and a bunch failing)
[2012-02-04 20:23:00 -0500] jstump: Cope: Right, but it won't actually manage it unless I add the recipe.
[2012-02-04 20:23:00 -0500] Cope: that's ohai running plugins, when the node it built
[2012-02-04 20:24:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: ohai's just a system profiler, which is used to gather info about a node; chef then indexes that for search and other purposes.
[2012-02-04 20:24:00 -0500] jstump: Cope: Yeah, I'm on board with it is. What I'm asking is if you add the OpsCode ohai recipe to your nodes to make sure it's maintained properly?
[2012-02-04 20:24:00 -0500] jstump: Or if that is advised.
[2012-02-04 20:24:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: no need at all; when you bootstrap a node, you'll get ohai; it's always  going to be there.
[2012-02-04 20:25:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: and when chef-client runs, it uses it.
[2012-02-04 20:25:00 -0500] jstump: Cope: Gotcha. So only if I wanted to do something non-traditional with it.
[2012-02-04 20:25:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: right - you can use or abuse it in whatever way you want - it's actually a pretty powerful tool, and its' easy to add plugins.
[2012-02-04 20:26:00 -0500] jstump: Cope: I'm on AWS so I'm going to double check that ohai has all the sugar for that. Sounds like digging into that will be a good idea.
[2012-02-04 20:26:00 -0500] jstump: Cope: Thanks a bunch for your help.
[2012-02-04 20:26:00 -0500] Cope: jstump: yeah, ohai has a stack of cloud plugins.
[2012-02-04 20:26:00 -0500] Cope: for free
[2012-02-04 20:26:00 -0500] jstump: I like free stuff.
[2012-02-04 20:27:00 -0500] Cope: you bet
[2012-02-04 22:08:00 -0500] aeris: one question again about attributes merge
[2012-02-04 22:08:00 -0500] aeris: i have a role, with some attributes
[2012-02-04 22:08:00 -0500] aeris: but just for one node, i want to add a value to an attribute
[2012-02-04 22:09:00 -0500] aeris: in my case, all ssh server on 22 port but one node on 22 + 222
[2012-02-04 22:11:00 -0500] aeris: editing attr node from knife is ok (hosted webui show correct value), but first chef-client run erase all the job and only role attr are applied
[2012-02-04 22:33:00 -0500] Cope: aeris: what is special about that server?
[2012-02-04 22:34:00 -0500] Cope: does it live in a different environment? does it have a specific role?
[2012-02-04 22:34:00 -0500] aeris: just one more ssh port :
[2012-02-04 22:34:00 -0500] Cope: how would you describe what it does that makes it a unique case?
[2012-02-04 22:34:00 -0500] Cope: yeah - but in service terms - why does it have :2222 ?
[2012-02-04 22:35:00 -0500] aeris: workarround for corporate proxy =)
[2012-02-04 22:35:00 -0500] aeris: 22 is blocked, 2222 not
[2012-02-04 22:35:00 -0500] Cope: ok, so why don't most serbers need it?
[2012-02-04 22:36:00 -0500] aeris: 22 is used for git and mercurial
[2012-02-04 22:36:00 -0500] aeris: gitorious in particular
[2012-02-04 22:37:00 -0500] Cope: so - would it make sense to have an 'internal server' role, or environment ot something
[2012-02-04 22:37:00 -0500] Cope: i'm looking for the appropriate place to insert the attribute override :)
[2012-02-04 22:37:00 -0500] aeris: but most generaly for exemple, my dev server use mdns for dns, and need 5353 port to be open
[2012-02-04 22:38:00 -0500] aeris: so i define a dev.local.json, with specific attribute inside
[2012-02-04 22:38:00 -0500] aeris:  knife node show dev.local -a "firewall"  see the specific attribute
[2012-02-04 22:38:00 -0500] aeris: but chef-client not 
[2012-02-04 22:39:00 -0500] aeris: knife node show dev.local -a "firewall"

[2012-02-04 22:39:00 -0500] Cope: use gist or somesuch
[2012-02-04 22:39:00 -0500] aeris: i don't anticipate the huge output of knife ><

[2012-02-04 23:45:00 -0500] fujin: I just built a class that integrates pylon/dcell (in Redis mode) with chef-solo
[2012-02-04 23:45:00 -0500] fujin: so you can do celluloid class supervision across the network ^_^
[2012-02-04 23:47:00 -0500] wilton: Hello everyone. first time on this channel. Here goes a question regarding chef-repo.
[2012-02-04 23:48:00 -0500] wilton: I created a ruby DSL and JSO environment file under the environments directory. However, it seems rake install is not creating the environment on the chef-server. Did a miss something here?
[2012-02-04 23:48:00 -0500] wilton: I didn't see a rake task for environments as well
[2012-02-04 23:49:00 -0500] wilton: Using chef 0.10.8
[2012-02-04 23:50:00 -0500] yfeldblum: wilton, use knife
[2012-02-04 23:51:00 -0500] yfeldblum: wilton, `knife environment from file production.json`
[2012-02-04 23:52:00 -0500] wilton: Thanks, i understand knife will do it. In the wiki it stated that rake install would as well.
[2012-02-04 23:52:00 -0500] wilton: Environments created through this mechanism get compiled to JSON, and then are loaded in to the Chef Server. (We never execute ruby code directly on the chef server!) Each time you rake install your Chef Repository, we will re-compile the corresponding JSON and store it in the chef server.
[2012-02-04 23:52:00 -0500] wilton: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Environments
[2012-02-04 23:52:00 -0500] wilton: wondering if the wiki is not correct
[2012-02-04 23:52:00 -0500] wilton: I guess, I can write my own rake task under environments to just call knife
[2012-02-04 23:53:00 -0500] wilton: Was just wondering if I was missing something.
[2012-02-04 23:53:00 -0500] fujin: I can't see anything in the code for the chef_repo.rake that mentions environments
[2012-02-04 23:53:00 -0500] fujin: I'd say the wikiw as wrong
[2012-02-04 23:53:00 -0500] fujin: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/tasks/chef_repo.rake
[2012-02-04 23:56:00 -0500] wilton: Thanks fujin for confirming. Will work around it or just use knife.
