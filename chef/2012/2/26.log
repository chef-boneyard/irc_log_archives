[2012-02-26 09:56:00 -0500] JerryLee: hi guys.
[2012-02-26 09:57:00 -0500] JerryLee: is there any proven website guiding correct installation of chef for newbie..?
[2012-02-26 09:58:00 -0500] JerryLee: from the scratch..
[2012-02-26 14:00:00 -0500] natrium42: hey, is the _default environment merged to other environments?
[2012-02-26 14:01:00 -0500] natrium42: for example in a data bag?
[2012-02-26 14:01:00 -0500] natrium42: i would like to provide default values that production/staging environments can override if necessary
[2012-02-26 14:05:00 -0500] natrium42: :S
[2012-02-26 16:12:00 -0500] jtimberman: natrium42: each environment is a separate entity on the chef server. the _default environment exists so all nodes would have one, even if it wasn't specified.
[2012-02-26 16:13:00 -0500] jtimberman: they only relate in something like a data bag if you write the data bag to include different environment-specific data.
[2012-02-26 16:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: in other words, chef isn't a mind reader, especially when it comes to data bags as they are totally schemaless arbitrary key/value items
[2012-02-26 17:12:00 -0500] natrium42: jtimberman, gotcha, cheers!
[2012-02-26 17:12:00 -0500] natrium42: i just thought i could avoid duplication in my data bags for values that are identical or different environments
[2012-02-26 20:34:00 -0500] aeris: hello #chef
[2012-02-26 20:35:00 -0500] aeris: i have a problem with attribute merging between nodes attributes and roles attributes
[2012-02-26 20:36:00 -0500] aeris: http://pastebin.com/xVeEhnFC
[2012-02-26 20:36:00 -0500] aeris: here is my conf
[2012-02-26 20:36:00 -0500] |shad0w|: depending on how you set them, that might be expected behavior
[2012-02-26 20:37:00 -0500] aeris: rsync role set the firewall and node too
[2012-02-26 20:37:00 -0500] aeris: but only the node conf is apply =(
[2012-02-26 20:37:00 -0500] aeris: i try multiple combination override/normal/default, but nothing work =(
[2012-02-26 20:52:00 -0500] aeris: nobody ? =(
[2012-02-26 21:22:00 -0500] |shad0w|: aorry aeris, have my had buried in something else at the moment
[2012-02-26 21:48:00 -0500] flaccid: which resource should i use to download a file from a http source?
[2012-02-26 21:48:00 -0500] cwj: remote_file
[2012-02-26 21:50:00 -0500] flaccid: danke
[2012-02-26 22:14:00 -0500] flaccid: hhmmm someone wouldn't be able to try installing this http://rubygems.org/gems/right_rackspace ? i seem to get no metadata found in /tmp/right_rackspace-0.0.0.20111110.gem
[2012-02-26 22:32:00 -0500] aeris: is it possible to use a definition inside definition ?
[2012-02-26 22:32:00 -0500] aeris: seems lead to problem with default params
[2012-02-26 22:34:00 -0500] flaccid: *ERROR> [chef] recipe references the action <head> which is missing an implementation . hmm chef too old?
[2012-02-26 22:42:00 -0500] aeris: hum, seems related to http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-422
[2012-02-26 22:48:00 -0500] emperorcezar: When writing a recipe, what is the best way to set defaults in the node attribute?
[2012-02-26 22:52:00 -0500] emperorcezar: Ah, attributes/default.rb
[2012-02-26 23:03:00 -0500] tpot: emperorcezar: also, README.md (-:
[2012-02-26 23:04:00 -0500] flaccid: undefined method `headers' for Chef::Resource::HttpRequest probably too old for chef 0.8 :(
[2012-02-26 23:04:00 -0500] flaccid: emperorcezar: Attributes on wiki
[2012-02-26 23:12:00 -0500] orbus: Hello world
[2012-02-26 23:22:00 -0500] emperorcezar: What's the best way of finding out what root's home directory is?
[2012-02-26 23:23:00 -0500] coderanger: Chefs, what ohai attributes do you use most frequently?
[2012-02-26 23:45:00 -0500] jtimberman: coderanger: ipaddress, fqdn and domain (but not hostname as often), kernel['machine'], cpu['total'], memory['total'].to_i, platform, platform_version (looking forward to ohai 0.6.12's platform_family), languages (various ones), ohai_time, roles, recipes,
[2012-02-26 23:45:00 -0500] jtimberman: thats about it
[2012-02-26 23:51:00 -0500] ssd7: according to some grep and uniq -c, platform is the winner by a long shot :)
[2012-02-26 23:51:00 -0500] coderanger: jtimberman ssd7: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3962871/Screenshots/b8pt.png
[2012-02-26 23:53:00 -0500] coderanger: Need to reorg so I can fit more >_<
[2012-02-26 23:55:00 -0500] ssd7: coderanger: looks pretty good.  I've use cpu['total'] for some of the MPI and R stuff I've done and think it is pretty useful.  Not sure on the specific one that you mentioned, but "./cookbooks" is typically not what you will want for your cookbook_path :)
[2012-02-26 23:56:00 -0500] coderanger: ssd7: Yeah, adding a second column
[2012-02-26 23:58:00 -0500] ssd7: Grepping through the cookbooks repo, it is pretty interesting how few ohai attrs are actually used in recipes.
