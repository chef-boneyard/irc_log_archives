[2012-02-11 09:21:00 -0500] captnswing: I'm in ~/chef-repo on my chef workstation
[2012-02-11 09:21:00 -0500] captnswing: invoking "knife cookbook metadata base"
[2012-02-11 09:22:00 -0500] captnswing: I expect it to generate the file ~/chef-repo/cookbooks/base/metadata.json from  ~/chef-repo/cookbooks/base/metadata.rb
[2012-02-11 09:23:00 -0500] captnswing: instead, it seems to generate /var/chef/cookbooks/base/metadata.json from /var/chef/cookbooks/base/metadata.rb
[2012-02-11 09:23:00 -0500] captnswing: I didn't know the directory /var/chef/ existed. what is its relation to ~/.chef-repo ?
[2012-02-11 10:11:00 -0500] captnswing: another one:
[2012-02-11 10:11:00 -0500] captnswing: My understanding is, that when working with knife on my workstation, I am supposed to work from within the ~/chef-repo. or invoke rake tasks from there.That means that~/chef-repo/.chef/knife.rb is the config file that knife is using, ignoring my~/.chef/knife.rbfile
[2012-02-11 10:11:00 -0500] captnswing: but the~/.chef/knife.rb is more personalized and~/chef-repo/.chef/knife.rb, since it is in version control, shared by my teammates, does not contain e.g. my client cert.
[2012-02-11 10:12:00 -0500] captnswing: so while pwd is~/chef-repo/,rake install doesn't work, unless~/chef-repo/.chef/knife.rb contains my personal client cert.
[2012-02-11 10:12:00 -0500] captnswing: should i take~/chef-repo/.chef/knife.rb out of version control?
[2012-02-11 10:13:00 -0500] captnswing: or should the same client cert configured in ~/chef-repo/.chef/knife.rb be shared among different workstations?

[2012-02-11 15:31:00 -0500] leifmadsen: morning all!
[2012-02-11 15:31:00 -0500] leifmadsen: is there a recommended book on Chef I could purchase?
[2012-02-11 15:34:00 -0500] leifmadsen: hmmm, based on my searching at amazon, perhaps not so much
[2012-02-11 15:44:00 -0500] leifmadsen: so one thing I'm a bit confused on is using the deploy resources, and how to get files checked out on the node into the locations I want. So for example, I have a git repo (private) that has several configuration files. I can easily check those out from git onto the note using the git resource. However, I'm confused on how I would then move files from the subdir in that checkout to where I want.
[2012-02-11 15:45:00 -0500] leifmadsen: or perhaps my approach is incorrect. The problem I'm trying to solve is that I can't have symlinked files in my chef recipe in the files/default/ directory; those files are not copied to the node. But I need a way to get the files from my git repo, onto the node, and into the location I need.
[2012-02-11 21:00:00 -0500] maek: Im using https://github.com/azkaban/azkaban/tarball/master to download master tar.gz  - is it possible in the remotefile resources to figure out what the name of that file is?
[2012-02-11 21:38:00 -0500] jtimberman: maek: you have to tell it what the file is.
[2012-02-11 21:38:00 -0500] jtimberman: maek: unless you write some code to scrape the git commit sha1
[2012-02-11 23:24:00 -0500] bluenemo: hi guys, bootstraping chef on a ubuntu 10.04 client stops directly after entering the sudo password: http://pastebin.com/98jVXaqS
[2012-02-11 23:27:00 -0500] bluenemo: my error...
[2012-02-11 23:32:00 -0500] maek: jtimberman: ty
[2012-02-11 23:35:00 -0500] hoover_damm: honestly I almost would love to take some Ubuntu AMI's and remove that whole ubuntu user crap
[2012-02-11 23:36:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I prefer to ssh in as root; and not have some weird user to login and then sudo on.
[2012-02-11 23:36:00 -0500] hoover_damm: give me root; let me decide what my users are.
[2012-02-11 23:36:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and I can do that with my own AMI :)
