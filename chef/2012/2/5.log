[2012-02-05 11:43:00 -0500] jondot: hey guys, i'm following a quickstart tutorial (not from opscode) and i'm wondering where do i download the user private key?
[2012-02-05 11:57:00 -0500] Cope: jondot: from manage.opscode.com
[2012-02-05 11:57:00 -0500] Cope: assuming you're using hosted chef
[2012-02-05 11:57:00 -0500] jondot: Cope, yes, but on my profile page, all i see is a public RSA key
[2012-02-05 11:58:00 -0500] jondot: i generated the XX-validator.pem, chef config file, and now i'm in search for the user pem..
[2012-02-05 12:00:00 -0500] Cope: jondot: http://d.pr/VGAz
[2012-02-05 12:00:00 -0500] jondot: aha! so its in the 'change password' section :)
[2012-02-05 12:00:00 -0500] Cope: from the main management screen, click on your username next to "logged in as: "
[2012-02-05 12:00:00 -0500] jondot: i thought i was going crazy, thanks!
[2012-02-05 12:01:00 -0500] Cope: that takes you to the page I just showed you
[2012-02-05 12:02:00 -0500] jondot: yep thanks
[2012-02-05 12:03:00 -0500] Cope: any time :)
[2012-02-05 12:10:00 -0500] laurent\: getting a lot of "#<JSON::ParserError: 375: unexpected token" errors lately
[2012-02-05 12:33:00 -0500] jondot: Cope, I'm wondering. Generating a role with knife depends upon a chef server? how will the role JSON file be under version control?
[2012-02-05 12:38:00 -0500] Cope: jondot: use the ruby dsl, then knife role from file my-role.rb
[2012-02-05 12:43:00 -0500] jondot: Cope, i see. is that done typically with a /roles folder inside my cookbooks ? (and why not json in the same way?)
[2012-02-05 13:04:00 -0500] yfeldblum: jondot, to the chef-server, roles are just JSON data; you may write your roles either as JSON or using the ruby DSL as you like, but if you use the ruby DSL, then `knife role from file ROLE.rb` will compile that into JSON for you before uploading the role to the chef-server
[2012-02-05 13:04:00 -0500] yfeldblum: jondot, you may use any editor to create a role file (in chef-repo/roles) in either JSON or the ruby DSL; you don't need knife for that
[2012-02-05 13:06:00 -0500] jondot: yfeldblum, i see. so in order to keep my roles under version control, i better keep it as ruby. the reason i use json, is that i've started out with chef-solo - and i didn't see any way to use ruby roles there
[2012-02-05 13:06:00 -0500] yfeldblum: jondot, you may use either JSON or ruby DSL when writing roles and keeping them under version control; verson control doesn't care, and `knife role from file` doesn't care
[2012-02-05 13:07:00 -0500] yfeldblum: you can either `knife role from file ROLE.json` or `knife role from file ROLE.rb`
[2012-02-05 13:07:00 -0500] jondot: ah, ok then, if i keep it in JSON it'll fit nicer with chef-solo as well.
[2012-02-05 13:07:00 -0500] yfeldblum: sure, suit yourself
[2012-02-05 13:08:00 -0500] jondot: thanks
[2012-02-05 13:52:00 -0500] jondot: yfeldblum, any idea here? - uploading to the hosted chef from file. getting a role_from_file.rb:41:in `block in run': undefined method `save'
[2012-02-05 14:37:00 -0500] yfeldblum: not really ... is the json or ruby correct? is it in the right place? what was on the command line?
[2012-02-05 14:47:00 -0500] aeris: hello #chef
[2012-02-05 14:47:00 -0500] aeris: i have a problem with attribute merge
[2012-02-05 14:47:00 -0500] aeris: i define some attributes on role
[2012-02-05 14:48:00 -0500] aeris: in my case :firewall => {rules => [ { :dst_port => "ssh" } ] }
[2012-02-05 14:48:00 -0500] aeris: and a node  override  this with :firewall => {rules => [ { :dst_port => "mdns" } ] }
[2012-02-05 14:49:00 -0500] aeris: but merge result to only node attr and not role + node
[2012-02-05 14:49:00 -0500] aeris: role attr are default, node attr are normal
[2012-02-05 14:53:00 -0500] jondot: yfeldblum, had a typo in the chef_type. thanks
[2012-02-05 15:05:00 -0500] jondot: since my node needs ruby1.9.2 and knife bootstrap install 1.8.7, is there a way for this to work?
[2012-02-05 15:05:00 -0500] jondot: (without using rvm or rbenv - i dont believe in this for production machines)
[2012-02-05 15:07:00 -0500] yfeldblum: you can have `knife bootstrap` install whatever version of ruby you'd like, and you can also try using opscode's full-stack installer which installs an isolated copy of ruby that only chef-client can use so that it doesn't interfere with whatever you choose for the system ruby
[2012-02-05 15:10:00 -0500] jondot: i see. sounds great. in the meanwhile i'm getting bash: line 72: /usr/bin/chef-client: No such file or directory from the server though =\
[2012-02-05 15:11:00 -0500] yfeldblum: make sure that your bootstrap script installs ruby and chef-client?
[2012-02-05 15:12:00 -0500] jondot: from the log i see that it installed the required gem. but you know what, it may be that it installed 1.8.7 but 1.9.2 is taking over somewhow
[2012-02-05 15:15:00 -0500] jondot: chef-client exist in /usr/local/bin/chef-client
[2012-02-05 15:16:00 -0500] yfeldblum: compiling ruby from source?
[2012-02-05 15:17:00 -0500] jondot: no, i see that it gets it from apt. however on this machine i already have ruby1.9.2 build and installed from source
[2012-02-05 15:19:00 -0500] yfeldblum: heh
[2012-02-05 15:21:00 -0500] jondot: am I doing it wrong by providing chef with a machine which isn't totally clean?
[2012-02-05 15:22:00 -0500] yfeldblum: yes, if you're trying to learn chef :P
[2012-02-05 15:23:00 -0500] jondot: well i am i guess. perhaps this is related? http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2393
[2012-02-05 17:43:00 -0500] cezar: What is the best way to change the environment that "execute" runs under? I set the user but the program I'm running still thinks the home is '/root'.
[2012-02-05 17:50:00 -0500] hbarnes: cezar, I think you can set environment vars like this ... :environment => { 'HOME' => "/home/hbarnes" }
[2012-02-05 17:53:00 -0500] ssd7: cezar: hbarnes Basically right, I think the syntax you want inside an execute resource is environment({'HOME' => '/home/myhome'})
[2012-02-05 17:57:00 -0500] cezar: Thanks hbarnes ssd7 that works
[2012-02-05 18:29:00 -0500] doxavore: Has anyone else noticed Chef 0.10.8 running on Ubuntu or Debian unable to start chef-solr after a reboot due to /var/log/chef being owned by root instead of chef?
[2012-02-05 21:10:00 -0500] rocky: does anyone know if it's possible to setup the jenkins+apache2 proxying to proxy to a subpath rather than just at the root "/" for a proxied vhost ?
[2012-02-05 21:14:00 -0500] rocky: from looking at the apache erb template it looks like it's not possible
[2012-02-05 21:15:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: could always modify the template
[2012-02-05 21:16:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: does it just use mod_jk to proxy the traffic?
[2012-02-05 21:48:00 -0500] captnswing: I made a custom bootstrap template for a macintosh. ~/.chef/bootstrap/mac.erb
[2012-02-05 21:49:00 -0500] captnswing: What is a good place to put this mac.erb template in my chef repository?
[2012-02-05 21:49:00 -0500] captnswing: does it belong in the repository at all? I want to have it under version control....
[2012-02-05 21:49:00 -0500] tpot: i stick templates in $COOKBOOK_REPO/.chef/bootstrap u
[2012-02-05 21:49:00 -0500] tpot: which isn't ideal, but at least it's under version control
[2012-02-05 21:50:00 -0500] tpot: (er, ignore the "u" on the end)
[2012-02-05 21:51:00 -0500] captnswing: ok thanks!
[2012-02-05 21:51:00 -0500] captnswing: will do the same
[2012-02-05 22:12:00 -0500] captnswing: I did a "knife cookbook site install chef-client"
[2012-02-05 22:12:00 -0500] captnswing: "git tag" shows: cookbook-site-imported-chef-client-1.0.4
[2012-02-05 22:13:00 -0500] captnswing: I assume I can change the "cookbook-site-imported-" part to something else? shouldnt this be the name of my organization?
[2012-02-05 22:18:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: anyone else run in to the problem with metachef cookbook using syntax from ruby 1.9 even though knife bootstraps 1.8.7 at first?
[2012-02-05 22:18:00 -0500] ssd7: captnswing: Unfortunately that tag is not configurable
[2012-02-05 22:19:00 -0500] captnswing: ok thanks!
[2012-02-05 23:58:00 -0500] silk1: Is it possible to load an alternate environment (env_b) (well, the attributes of that environment) from env_a ?
