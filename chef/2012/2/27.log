[2012-02-27 11:59:00 -0500] ashb: i'm thinking of creating a hybrid cap/chef delpoy where capistrano deals with the deplyoing revisions and chef deals with just the config part
[2012-02-27 11:59:00 -0500] ashb: (mainly so that I can easily deploy just a single app on a host without having to have a full chef fun
[2012-02-27 12:00:00 -0500] ashb: does this seem in any way (in)sane
[2012-02-27 12:03:00 -0500] BryanWB_: ashb: sounds reasonable
[2012-02-27 12:05:00 -0500] lflux_: sounds like what I'm doing
[2012-02-27 12:05:00 -0500] ashb: lflux_: anything you can easily share?
[2012-02-27 12:06:00 -0500] lflux_: not really, I'm not going to use capistrano but probably mcollective and some homegrown tools
[2012-02-27 12:06:00 -0500] lflux_: since my web app is currently distributed as RPMs
[2012-02-27 12:08:00 -0500] lflux_: but basically let chef set up the configuration and inital setup of databases/files/packages and use mcollective to update
[2012-02-27 12:08:00 -0500] BryanWB_: here is a very interesting way to setting up the db for an app
[2012-02-27 12:08:00 -0500] BryanWB_: https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/blob/master/radiant/recipes/db_bootstrap.rb#L57
[2012-02-27 12:09:00 -0500] BryanWB_: very clever
[2012-02-27 12:17:00 -0500] lflux_: that looks clever yeah
[2012-02-27 12:18:00 -0500] ashb: huh, self modififying runlists. interesting
[2012-02-27 12:49:00 -0500] bluenemo: hi guys, why do some options have delete and some remove? i'm always writing the wrong one.. wouldnt remove only be more simple?
[2012-02-27 12:57:00 -0500] till_: is there a complete list of ohai plugins?
[2012-02-27 12:59:00 -0500] BryanWB_: till_: i think there is on the wiki somewhere, just google 'opscode ohai plugins'
[2012-02-27 13:18:00 -0500] till_: BryanWB_: yeah, it doesn't look too complete - maybe github.com/opscode/cookbooks/ohai/ is better
[2012-02-27 13:26:00 -0500] ctrabold: till_: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Community+Plugins#CommunityPlugins-Ohai
[2012-02-27 14:33:00 -0500] jtimberman: bluenemo: legacy code :)
[2012-02-27 14:34:00 -0500] jtimberman: bluenemo: depends on the context of th eparticular resource and what the author of the resource/provider thought made sense when writing it.
[2012-02-27 14:34:00 -0500] jtimberman: might be good to have an alias between the two where such a confusion exists.
[2012-02-27 14:35:00 -0500] bluenemo: jtimberman, thx
[2012-02-27 14:36:00 -0500] auxome: I had a quick question -- when I knife ec2 server create (bootstrap an ec2 node), is there a recommended way to have chef-client run every so often? I notice when I log in, there is no chef-client running as a daemon (so it can't wake up at interval+splay). If I add it to cron as part of a user-data script, it never seems to run successfully -- it runs, but if I add a new role to the system it doesn't seem to pick it up and download/in
[2012-02-27 14:36:00 -0500] auxome: unless i manually run chef-client via sudo. I installed it into the root crontab via sudo in the user-data script
[2012-02-27 14:36:00 -0500] jtimberman: auxome: use opscode's chef-client cookbook, it will set up the chef-client as a service in a variety of ways (init script, runit, daemontools, bluepill)
[2012-02-27 14:36:00 -0500] jtimberman: in fact it has a cron option as well.
[2012-02-27 14:37:00 -0500] auxome: thanks Joshua, that's the tip i was missing
[2012-02-27 14:37:00 -0500] jtimberman: :)
[2012-02-27 14:37:00 -0500] auxome: will try it and report back
[2012-02-27 14:38:00 -0500] jtimberman: if the initial run doesn't finish successfully, chef won't save the node data (including the run list) to the chef server
[2012-02-27 14:38:00 -0500] jtimberman: so subsequent runs won't have the run list
[2012-02-27 14:39:00 -0500] auxome: so in my example, the initial run finishes fine. then say I add a role to a running server. if I want it to pick up that role, I need chef-client to run. what's odd is I see it running via root's cron, but the new recipe isnt installed (something like rsyslog). I run it manually, and it picks up fine.
[2012-02-27 14:40:00 -0500] auxome: so it has to be something with the way I put it into cron, maybe, or the way that cron is executing things with permissions -- although it should be root permissions and fine by theory
[2012-02-27 14:41:00 -0500] BryanWB_: jtimberman: what about 'user' vs. 'owner' in different resources? seem to be used interchangeably
[2012-02-27 14:41:00 -0500] jtimberman: BryanWB_: not particularly.
[2012-02-27 14:41:00 -0500] jtimberman: BryanWB_: owner is used for file permissions
[2012-02-27 14:42:00 -0500] jtimberman: user is used for execution ID
[2012-02-27 14:42:00 -0500] BryanWB_: jtimberman: make sense
[2012-02-27 14:42:00 -0500] jtimberman: :)
[2012-02-27 14:43:00 -0500] ssd7: jtimberman: c'ya :)
[2012-02-27 14:44:00 -0500] ssd7: Ohai Chefs!
[2012-02-27 14:51:00 -0500] BryanWB_: hello Chef!
[2012-02-27 14:53:00 -0500] nico: hi guys
[2012-02-27 14:57:00 -0500] BryanWB_: hey nico !
[2012-02-27 15:28:00 -0500] hoover_damm: ohai
[2012-02-27 16:16:00 -0500] delinquentme: Whats the simplest chef implementation which can launch / configure servers?
[2012-02-27 16:17:00 -0500] gchristensen: delinquentme: I'd say start with Chef Hosted and follow the getting started docs
[2012-02-27 16:20:00 -0500] delinquentme: gchristensen, so I was moving forward w chef-client and chef-server ... but you're saying hosted seems better for this application?
[2012-02-27 16:21:00 -0500] delinquentme: which is simpler?
[2012-02-27 16:23:00 -0500] gchristensen: delinquentme: its just less to setup I think, since it will still let you bootstrap and config servers, but minus the complexities of setting up chef-server. my warning though is I'm really new to Chef, so that's just my uninformed opinion
[2012-02-27 16:29:00 -0500] delinquentme: gchristensen, thanks for the heads uP :D
[2012-02-27 16:30:00 -0500] gchristensen: :)
[2012-02-27 16:34:00 -0500] hcastro: delinquentme: i'd also consider chef-solo via vagrant
[2012-02-27 16:34:00 -0500] hcastro: http://vagrantup.com/docs/provisioners/chef_solo.html
[2012-02-27 16:35:00 -0500] delinquentme: all the technologies!
[2012-02-27 16:35:00 -0500] delinquentme: chef solo is just supposed to be running within a isolated instance .. but someones modified it to fire up outside resources huh? cool
[2012-02-27 16:37:00 -0500] gchristensen: delinquentme: take into consideration that virtualbox (which backs vagrant) has a tendency to cause kernel panics, and the Linux team has officially tainted it as crap :/
[2012-02-27 16:38:00 -0500] delinquentme: oo i've got VB!
[2012-02-27 16:39:00 -0500] delinquentme: lol its a really cool thing to have for IE testing .. but I think I've come up w a crazy heroku based workaround for my probremu
[2012-02-27 16:39:00 -0500] gchristensen: https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/10/6/317 is the commit
[2012-02-27 16:39:00 -0500] delinquentme: LOL!
[2012-02-27 16:41:00 -0500] gchristensen: :D its really unfortunate though, because I loved VB :(
[2012-02-27 16:41:00 -0500] delinquentme: i thought virtual box was ... oracle?
[2012-02-27 16:41:00 -0500] delinquentme: yeah!
[2012-02-27 16:41:00 -0500] ssd7: gchristensen: How often did you hit kernel panics?  I use virtualbox pretty extensively and haven't run into many problems, but my vm's typically have a pretty short life?
[2012-02-27 16:41:00 -0500] delinquentme: wow.
[2012-02-27 16:42:00 -0500] delinquentme: ^^
[2012-02-27 16:42:00 -0500] delinquentme: ive only used them for testing IE
[2012-02-27 16:42:00 -0500] miah: moin
[2012-02-27 16:42:00 -0500] gchristensen: ssd7: when I used one for a period of time and turn it off, rarely, but if I started and stopped it a few times, every 20 minutes
[2012-02-27 16:43:00 -0500] miah: community.opscode.com == 500 :(
[2012-02-27 16:43:00 -0500] ssd7: miah: looking
[2012-02-27 16:44:00 -0500] miah: (though i am on inflight wireless)
[2012-02-27 16:44:00 -0500] ssd7: miah: Looks OK from a quick check, any particular page that is 500'ing for you?
[2012-02-27 16:46:00 -0500] miah: looks like its possibly the in flight wireless breaking things :(
[2012-02-27 16:47:00 -0500] ssd7: miah: Yeah, all the 500s I see for community are from the same remote ip. :(
[2012-02-27 16:48:00 -0500] miah: https://gist.github.com/1925330
[2012-02-27 16:48:00 -0500] auxome: quick question -- I'm using the chef-client cookbook to init a knife-bootstrapped node as "cron
[2012-02-27 16:48:00 -0500] auxome: "
[2012-02-27 16:48:00 -0500] auxome: and i get this in the output of the bootstrap: [Mon, 27 Feb 2012 15:03:07 +0000] INFO: Processing log[Could not determine service init style, manual intervention required to start up the chef-client service.] action write (chef-client::service line 241) [Mon, 27 Feb 2012 15:03:07 +0000] INFO: Could not determine service init style, manual intervention required to start up the chef-client service.
[2012-02-27 16:48:00 -0500] auxome: but no better error/info. Anyone have a suggestion?
[2012-02-27 16:48:00 -0500] mlei: auxome: what OS?
[2012-02-27 16:49:00 -0500] auxome: linux, amazon-linux to be specific
[2012-02-27 16:49:00 -0500] miah: looks like you specified the wrong init_style
[2012-02-27 16:49:00 -0500] miah: or it can't determine what the proper init_style is for that ami
[2012-02-27 16:49:00 -0500] auxome: the docs on the wiki say set it to "none" for cron, but at another part of the same page says set it to "cron". even "init" gives this same error
[2012-02-27 16:50:00 -0500] miah: guess i'll have to file this bug after i land :/
[2012-02-27 16:50:00 -0500] mlei: auxome: what doc are you looking at
[2012-02-27 16:51:00 -0500] auxome: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/chef-client
[2012-02-27 16:52:00 -0500] auxome: under attributes you see the cron attributes say only valid if init_style is cron, lower down it says in the "cron" subsection: "You should set node["chef_client"]["init_style"] = "none" when you use this mode but it is not required."
[2012-02-27 16:52:00 -0500] miah: auxome: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources?r44b=no#Resources-Service
[2012-02-27 16:52:00 -0500] miah: look at the providers
[2012-02-27 16:52:00 -0500] miah: iirc, the provider for amazon linux is redhat
[2012-02-27 16:53:00 -0500] mlei: miah: well, the issue is that it shouldn't want to start anything in init
[2012-02-27 16:53:00 -0500] mlei: because it's supposed to be configured to be cronned
[2012-02-27 16:53:00 -0500] auxome: yeah amazon linux uses the fedora bootstrap profile
[2012-02-27 16:53:00 -0500] auxome: i guess the issue is that the documentation has two conflicting statements, and then the behavior on both is semi-weird
[2012-02-27 16:53:00 -0500] miah: no idea then. i just run chef as a daemon
[2012-02-27 16:53:00 -0500] mlei: auxome: what are you including in your run list
[2012-02-27 16:54:00 -0500] auxome:  "recipe[apache2]","recipe[chef-client]","recipe[chef-client::config]","recipe[chef-client::cron]"
[2012-02-27 16:54:00 -0500] mlei: try taking out chef-client
[2012-02-27 16:54:00 -0500] auxome: :wq
[2012-02-27 16:54:00 -0500] mlei: and just leave chef-client::config and chef-client::cron
[2012-02-27 16:55:00 -0500] mlei: actually i think you may not need ::config either
[2012-02-27 16:55:00 -0500] auxome: ok. the default recipe for chef-client is the one that calls service, correct? i was initially trying to get that to work, then changed gears to try cron instead
[2012-02-27 16:55:00 -0500] auxome: config wont be needed if all i have is cron
[2012-02-27 16:55:00 -0500] mlei: just ::cron
[2012-02-27 16:57:00 -0500] miah: what is the array that lists all the templates available inside a cookbook? eg, i want to check if a file exists inside a cookbook before executing a template resource
[2012-02-27 16:57:00 -0500] mlei: auxome: what did you have init-style set as when you got that message
[2012-02-27 16:57:00 -0500] auxome: and just for background, the whole reason I'm going this route is pasing --user-data a script that puts the cronjob into root's crontab makes the cron run, but the chef-client never appears to pick up any changes to the node on the server side (like adding a new role) unless I manually run the client
[2012-02-27 16:57:00 -0500] auxome: mlei: cron, init
[2012-02-27 16:57:00 -0500] auxome: i think none at one point also
[2012-02-27 16:58:00 -0500] mlei: i see there's a test in ::service for init that tries to find the appropriate init style
[2012-02-27 16:58:00 -0500] mlei: cron doesn't seem to be valid
[2012-02-27 16:58:00 -0500] mlei: it should behave the same as "none"
[2012-02-27 16:58:00 -0500] auxome: should fix the description on the cookbook page then to prevent confusion
[2012-02-27 16:58:00 -0500] mlei: i.e. do nothing
[2012-02-27 16:59:00 -0500] auxome: I'll have to get back to you on what the node does, I'm due in a mtg. bbiaf
[2012-02-27 17:11:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: is there a good tutorial for how to modify knife-ec2 bootstrap to install a newer version of ruby on ubuntu? Digging around inside the chef gem is taking some time
[2012-02-27 17:12:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: is it just inside the ubuntu10-04-apt-erb
[2012-02-27 17:12:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: modifying the script to install ruby 1.9 before chef?
[2012-02-27 17:13:00 -0500] spicyWith: anyone using the mongodb cookbook? https://github.com/edelight/chef-cookbooks/tree/master/mongodb
[2012-02-27 17:13:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: I use the 10gen on I think spicyWith
[2012-02-27 17:13:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: may be the same one
[2012-02-27 17:14:00 -0500] spicyWith: I'm using it as include_recipe mongodb, but it's complaining about not finding the template files inside that cookbook. Not sure why it's not looking in the mongodb cookbook for it?
[2012-02-27 17:14:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: not sure
[2012-02-27 17:14:00 -0500] spicyWith: flashmanbahadur: I think it's actually more of a chef question - do I need to copy over the template file as well
[2012-02-27 17:14:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: I dont have the link handy
[2012-02-27 17:15:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: but there is a page that tells your the search path for template files
[2012-02-27 17:16:00 -0500] JasonBox: hrm, on a just kickstarted install of SL6.1, the mysql::server recipe does indeed not enable it to run at boot with chkconfig
[2012-02-27 17:16:00 -0500] JasonBox: So it's not just me
[2012-02-27 17:21:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: JasonBox: just add it in I guess and submit a pull request
[2012-02-27 17:21:00 -0500] auxome: when you pass user-data via knife ec2 server create, with #!/bin/bash -ex, where does it log the output/results of the script execution?
[2012-02-27 17:21:00 -0500] auxome: I saw it earlier but cant find the reference now
[2012-02-27 17:29:00 -0500] JasonBox: flashmanbahadur: I've never messed with such things on github, what would one do for a pull request?
[2012-02-27 17:51:00 -0500] cap10morgan: opscode folks: I got knife linode server create working and issued a pull request for knife-linode. would love to see that gem released and I'm happy to help get it there.
[2012-02-27 18:02:00 -0500] btm: cap10morgan: Is there a ticket on http://tickets.opscode.com ? If not you can email me at btm@opscode.com and we can make plans to move forward there.
[2012-02-27 18:03:00 -0500] cap10morgan: btm: doesn't appear to be. i'll send you an email. thanks!
[2012-02-27 18:05:00 -0500] hoover_damm: anyone have an issue with knife rackspace create -E not working?
[2012-02-27 18:06:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I keep setting the environment on the create... and dammit! it keeps going to _default
[2012-02-27 18:06:00 -0500] hoover_damm: which is breaking
[2012-02-27 18:09:00 -0500] ssd7: hoover_damm: If you put environment "some_env" in your knife.rb and then do the create (with no -E) does it work?
[2012-02-27 18:09:00 -0500] Brad_K: hoover_damm: it was working fine for me over the weekend.  haven't tested it today, however.
[2012-02-27 18:09:00 -0500] ssd7: Also, what version of knife/chef are you on?
[2012-02-27 18:09:00 -0500] hoover_damm: ssd7, unfortunatly I can't test
[2012-02-27 18:09:00 -0500] hoover_damm: ssd7, I mention rackspace because I can't reproduce it with ec2
[2012-02-27 18:09:00 -0500] hoover_damm: but I can with rackspace
[2012-02-27 18:10:00 -0500] hoover_damm: rackspace is having issues with the account that I have so I can't boot up an instance
[2012-02-27 18:10:00 -0500] hoover_damm: sucks
[2012-02-27 18:10:00 -0500] Brad_K: lemme check
[2012-02-27 18:11:00 -0500] hoover_damm: knife rackspace server create --environment  staging --image 119 --flavor 2 --distro ubuntu11.10-ruby192 --server-name testingchef3
[2012-02-27 18:11:00 -0500] hoover_damm: that's the command
[2012-02-27 18:12:00 -0500] hoover_damm: private chef server is the only difference
[2012-02-27 18:13:00 -0500] Brad_K: i've got to fire up a new staging load balancer anyway.  here's what i'm testing with:
[2012-02-27 18:13:00 -0500] Brad_K: knife rackspace server create --image 114 --flavor 3 -d omnibus -r 'role[ihiji_base]' -E staging -S staginglb2 -N staginglb2
[2012-02-27 18:13:00 -0500] ggolin: guys, i am trying to install a rails app using the app+db cookbooks. i need to use rvm ruby and gems. is there an obvious way to make sure the system-wide ruby installation is not used?
[2012-02-27 18:17:00 -0500] Brad_K: hoover_damm: my new vm is starting up.  it's downloading and processing cookbooks now.
[2012-02-27 18:17:00 -0500] Brad_K: i'm on Hosted Chef, btw.
[2012-02-27 18:22:00 -0500] hoover_damm: Brad_K, yeah I can't imagine there's any difference between hosted vs private in this
[2012-02-27 18:22:00 -0500] Brad_K: i didn't figure there would be, but i wanted to include that information for the sake of completeness.
[2012-02-27 18:23:00 -0500] Brad_K: hoover_damm: which datacenter are you using?  we're in DFW1, i'm told.  maybe that makes a difference?
[2012-02-27 18:23:00 -0500] hoover_damm: Brad_K, same afaik
[2012-02-27 18:24:00 -0500] Brad_K: okay, well let me try duplicating your command exactly.  we don't need or use ubuntu on the server side, but it won't be alive for long.
[2012-02-27 18:24:00 -0500] hoover_damm: Brad_K, ok
[2012-02-27 18:24:00 -0500] hoover_damm: Brad_K, i'm fairly sure it's somethign to do with the command I just don't know why
[2012-02-27 18:26:00 -0500] hoover_damm: hums along _default until it hits our database dbag and goes woops no _default
[2012-02-27 18:26:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and bails
[2012-02-27 18:28:00 -0500] Brad_K: hoover_damm: my new "testingchef3" node came up.
[2012-02-27 18:33:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and likely in the right environment right?
[2012-02-27 18:34:00 -0500] delinquentme: <3 thanks for your help GUYS!
[2012-02-27 18:34:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I imagine if I bootstrap it with -E I bet it'd work
[2012-02-27 18:34:00 -0500] hoover_damm: there's nothing in first-run.json to indicate environment
[2012-02-27 18:34:00 -0500] hoover_damm: (as that's not in there afaik)
[2012-02-27 18:35:00 -0500] hoover_damm: it's set by the server, so i'm thinking this must be a difference between hosted chef vs private chef?
[2012-02-27 19:01:00 -0500] Brad_K: hoover_damm: did you file a ticket on this issue?  i'm sure that tech support could help you quickly figure out if this is a problem with Private Chef or not.
[2012-02-27 19:07:00 -0500] hoover_damm: Brad_K, going to wait for rackspace to fix themselves and then i was going to figure it out
[2012-02-27 19:07:00 -0500] hoover_damm: Brad_K, we were getting 400 error's trying to create earlier that the tech support agent at rackspace couldn't duplicate so we're kidna waiting on that (unless it's resolved itself)
[2012-02-27 19:07:00 -0500] Brad_K: i fear that you could be waiting a while.
[2012-02-27 19:08:00 -0500] mlei: hi |shad0w| or anyone else. i'm trying to debug if my issue is related to http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2346 but i'm running into the same issue someone ran into where expander.log is always empty
[2012-02-27 19:22:00 -0500] mlei: anyone know why i'm not getting any log output in /var/log/chef/expander.log when installed via rubygems?
[2012-02-27 19:22:00 -0500] cgibbons: hmmm, do i need to do anything special in order to be able to use the apt_resource LWRP? it's giving me an error that it isn't available here.
[2012-02-27 19:27:00 -0500] ssd7: cgibbons: Did you list the apt cookbook as a dependency in your metadata?
[2012-02-27 19:28:00 -0500] cgibbons: that would be why not :) thx
[2012-02-27 19:31:00 -0500] chip-: I need help figuring out a chef-repo workflow for my cookbooks.
[2012-02-27 19:31:00 -0500] chip-: Deal is this: I do agency work and I've got 30+ different projects all running from the same chef-repo
[2012-02-27 19:31:00 -0500] chip-: Problem is that I would like to write project-specific code, but the site-cookbooks model is deprecated.
[2012-02-27 19:31:00 -0500] chip-: I hear per-project branches are the way to go, but I'm not sure about the details of setting up that workflow.
[2012-02-27 19:32:00 -0500] chip-: What I'd like is recipe nginx::projecta that only shows up for projecta servers, and if nginx cookbook is installed on projectb, it'll never show up in logs when the cookbook is installed there.
[2012-02-27 19:35:00 -0500] miah: then you should have a 'wrapper' cookbook that sites above nginx
[2012-02-27 19:35:00 -0500] yfeldblum: meh, knife-side, how do i debug this?
[2012-02-27 19:35:00 -0500] yfeldblum: ERROR: Failed to authenticate to https://api.opscode.com/organizations/ORG as CLIENT with key /path/to/infrastructure/config/environments/production/CLIENT.pem
[2012-02-27 19:35:00 -0500] yfeldblum: Response:  Invalid signature for user or client 'CLIENT'
[2012-02-27 19:35:00 -0500] miah: eg, projecta, which then pulls in nginx and does what it needs
[2012-02-27 19:37:00 -0500] chip-: That's a huge step back in functionality from the site-cookbooks method
[2012-02-27 19:38:00 -0500] yfeldblum: chip-, why do you need one chef repos? why not have 30+ repos, one per client project?
[2012-02-27 19:39:00 -0500] miah: (and use librarian to manage them) =)
[2012-02-27 19:39:00 -0500] chip-: yfeldblum: That minimizes code re-use. I'd rather use environments and pin versions. Isn't that the point of the feature in the first place?
[2012-02-27 19:39:00 -0500] yfeldblum: miah, heh, sure, but there are plenty of other ways such as site-install ;P
[2012-02-27 19:40:00 -0500] chip-: yfeldblum: plus private repos cost money if I don't host my own repo.
[2012-02-27 19:40:00 -0500] cap10morgan: when knife [cloud] server create auto-generates the root password, does it store it or output it anywhere?
[2012-02-27 19:40:00 -0500] yfeldblum: chip-, codebasehq.com offers unlimited private repos for a flat fee
[2012-02-27 19:40:00 -0500] miah: i am trying to hack in 'config' support to runit, but i need to make sure that the template file exists in the cookbook before i try to install it. ideas? can't i check the contents of cookbook_files or something?
[2012-02-27 19:40:00 -0500] miah: (i want fancy log rotation and stuffs)
[2012-02-27 19:41:00 -0500] chip-: yfeldblum: doesn't solve the "lack of re-use" problem unless I get into making submodules, which breaks the vendor branch model.
[2012-02-27 19:41:00 -0500] yfeldblum: chip-, sure, but i much prefer the real code-reuse model
[2012-02-27 19:42:00 -0500] yfeldblum: chip-, which is that cookbooks are real projects, and you can fork cookbooks and use your fork, but you don't need to vendor them into each project
[2012-02-27 19:43:00 -0500] chip-: yfeldblum: down that road 20 hours a week of rebase and pull requests lie
[2012-02-27 19:43:00 -0500] yfeldblum: chip-, e.g. test each cookbook in isolation in vagrant before tagging that new version
[2012-02-27 19:43:00 -0500] chip-: when someone remembers to send a pull request in the first place, of course.
[2012-02-27 19:43:00 -0500] miah: development methods are hard to follow
[2012-02-27 19:46:00 -0500] yfeldblum: chip-, there are always tradeoffs, but on the whole, when code organization becomes a huge problem (30+ clients with individual customizations on the same codebase?) the solution is to split things, put up good interfaces between them, and version them
[2012-02-27 19:47:00 -0500] chip-: The idea is to minimize individual customizations, which so far has largely worked via the environments feature. Having true configuration exist at the intersection of environment and recipe is awesome.
[2012-02-27 19:47:00 -0500] chip-: Ditto pinning.
[2012-02-27 19:47:00 -0500] chip-: Environments have been HUGE for me. Love the feature.
[2012-02-27 19:48:00 -0500] chip-: But it only extends to attributes and cookbook versioning. It doesn't extend to having site-specific cookbooks. Which site-cookbooks used to solve, but now doesn't.
[2012-02-27 19:51:00 -0500] AntonZ: Hello, does anyone know of a cookbook with Centrify intergration?
[2012-02-27 19:53:00 -0500] Brad_K: never heard of Centrify.  what is that?
[2012-02-27 19:54:00 -0500] AntonZ: its Windows Activie rirectory authentication software, so i can authenticate my linux users against windows LDAP
[2012-02-27 19:55:00 -0500] AntonZ: bla, i cant type
[2012-02-27 19:55:00 -0500] hoover_damm: Brad_K, it was the bootstrap file
[2012-02-27 19:55:00 -0500] hoover_damm: Brad_K, I was an idiot and didn't catch that <%= start_chef %> wasn't /usr/local/chef-client -j /etc/chef/first-run.json`
[2012-02-27 20:00:00 -0500] Brad_K: oh.
[2012-02-27 20:00:00 -0500] Brad_K: that could do it.
[2012-02-27 20:10:00 -0500] geekbri: Inside of an attributes file how do you refer to already defined default attributes for the node?  IE normally in a recipe i would do node[:deploy_to].  Inside of the actual attributes file would I just use :deploy_to ?
[2012-02-27 20:12:00 -0500] geekbri: whoops i mean deploy_to not :deploy_to at the end there
[2012-02-27 20:12:00 -0500] fujin: geekbri: in the attributes file you can omit the 'node', yes
[2012-02-27 20:12:00 -0500] fujin: so if you were trying to access node[:deploy_to] you could just use 'deploy_to'
[2012-02-27 20:13:00 -0500] geekbri: fujin: thanks.
[2012-02-27 20:13:00 -0500] fujin: w/o singlequotes (for emphasis)
[2012-02-27 20:21:00 -0500] kc_edm: anyone know what is a valid argument to knife search --sort ?
[2012-02-27 20:21:00 -0500] kc_edm: none of the docs seem to say how to use it, guess i should know solr better
[2012-02-27 20:23:00 -0500] fujin: kc_edm: sorry, I don't know
[2012-02-27 20:23:00 -0500] fujin: but digging into the code yields
[2012-02-27 20:23:00 -0500] fujin: the default sort is
[2012-02-27 20:23:00 -0500] fujin: sort='X_CHEF_id_CHEF_X asc'
[2012-02-27 20:23:00 -0500] fujin: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/knife/search.rb#L110
[2012-02-27 20:23:00 -0500] fujin: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/search/query.rb#L39
[2012-02-27 20:24:00 -0500] fujin: perhaps that'll help
[2012-02-27 20:26:00 -0500] kc_edm: hmm, ok i can get things which are apparently valid and change the results but don't produce expected sorting
[2012-02-27 20:28:00 -0500] fujin: try --sort X_CHEF_id_CHEF_X dsc
[2012-02-27 20:28:00 -0500] fujin: lo
[2012-02-27 20:28:00 -0500] kc_edm: desc but ya, it works but doesn't seem sorted to me
[2012-02-27 20:29:00 -0500] fujin: using -Fj or the default formatter?
[2012-02-27 20:29:00 -0500] fujin: try -Fj
[2012-02-27 20:29:00 -0500] kc_edm: maybe its sorted by score or docid or something, not alpha like it'd expect
[2012-02-27 20:29:00 -0500] fujin: json mode
[2012-02-27 20:29:00 -0500] fujin: well X_CHEF_id_CHEF_X is probably something else
[2012-02-27 20:30:00 -0500] fujin: @obj_id
[2012-02-27 20:30:00 -0500] fujin: chef-expander/lib/chef/expander/solrizer.rb:      FLD_CHEF_ID_FMT = '<field name="X_CHEF_id_CHEF_X">%s</field>'
[2012-02-27 20:30:00 -0500] fujin: have a look at the solrizer code, may provide more hints
[2012-02-27 20:30:00 -0500] kc_edm: ya, thx
[2012-02-27 20:34:00 -0500] kc_edm: <str name="X_CHEF_id_CHEF_X">eac1babe-4e06-4dde-8ae8-b8b1ca2c0300</str>
[2012-02-27 20:34:00 -0500] kc_edm: lol
[2012-02-27 20:34:00 -0500] fujin: uuids? :)
[2012-02-27 20:35:00 -0500] fujin: tried --sort some_attribute_name asc ?
[2012-02-27 20:35:00 -0500] fujin: instead of sort by the ID
[2012-02-27 20:35:00 -0500] fujin: sort by vals
[2012-02-27 20:35:00 -0500] kc_edm: ya tried, doesn't seem to work. need to know what solr thinks they're called i guess
[2012-02-27 20:38:00 -0500] fujin: damn :\
[2012-02-27 20:41:00 -0500] geekbri: is it sane / allowed to do a ruby require inside of a chef recipe ?
[2012-02-27 20:42:00 -0500] cwj: geekbri: yes, totally sane and allowed
[2012-02-27 20:42:00 -0500] geekbri: cwj: awesome, thanks.
[2012-02-27 20:43:00 -0500] cwj: you bet
[2012-02-27 20:47:00 -0500] kc_edm: fujin: using solr's sort you can't sort on multivalued fields
[2012-02-27 20:47:00 -0500] kc_edm: content is multivalued and contains pretty much anything you'd want to sort nodes on
[2012-02-27 20:48:00 -0500] kc_edm: so unless that option was intended to be implemented in code and not a passthrough to solr sort, it's basically useless for practical purposes
[2012-02-27 20:48:00 -0500] fujin: ah
[2012-02-27 20:49:00 -0500] kc_edm: scoping down doesn't seem to work. i passed in sort=content:fqdn which shouldn't be multivalue but to no avail
[2012-02-27 20:49:00 -0500] kc_edm: sadness
[2012-02-27 20:56:00 -0500] fujin: you can of course, sort the results with ruby
[2012-02-27 21:16:00 -0500] |shad0w|: the server side of chef api strips args from the search requests iirc
[2012-02-27 21:21:00 -0500] |shad0w|: at least it did in 0.9
[2012-02-27 21:57:00 -0500] geekbri: do ruby blocks run before bash blocks with chef?  I'm having issues where my ruby_block is dependent upon something my bash block is doing but it seems like its trying to run the ruby_block first even though it appears after the bash block
[2012-02-27 22:00:00 -0500] cwj: geekbri: resources like bash blocks and ruby blocks run in the order they appear in the recipe
[2012-02-27 22:01:00 -0500] cwj: but ruby code which is not inside a ruby_block resource will execute before any of the resources
[2012-02-27 22:01:00 -0500] geekbri: cwj: yeah i have them appearing in the right order... maybe I'm not doing the ruby_block right as it still seems to somehow being executed before the bash block
[2012-02-27 22:01:00 -0500] yfeldblum: geekbri, gist it?
[2012-02-27 22:01:00 -0500] cwj: ^
[2012-02-27 22:03:00 -0500] geekbri: yfeldblum, cwj: https://gist.github.com/1927395
[2012-02-27 22:04:00 -0500] AntonZ: have you guys seen this error before:  Chef. The error message was:
[2012-02-27 22:04:00 -0500] AntonZ: Feb 27 16:39:08 ip-10-0-1-11 RightLink[2445]: us-west-1.ec2.amazonaws.com temporarily unavailable: (execution expired)
[2012-02-27 22:04:00 -0500] geekbri: oh duh, the reason its probably not working is because the variables are block scope
[2012-02-27 22:05:00 -0500] yfeldblum: geekbri, lines 21-22 are executed immediately during the compile phase, that is, the phase when you are setting up the resource definitions, while lines 14-16 are executed during the convergence phase, that is, the phase when the actions on the defined resources are executed
[2012-02-27 22:06:00 -0500] yfeldblum: geekbri, TL;DR: you used variables first, and defined them second
[2012-02-27 22:06:00 -0500] fujin: somedays you answer questions like a weird clone of me yfeldblum
[2012-02-27 22:06:00 -0500] yfeldblum: hi fujin!
[2012-02-27 22:07:00 -0500] geekbri: yfeldblum: is there a way to only fire off lines 21-22 after 14-16
[2012-02-27 22:07:00 -0500] fujin: =D
[2012-02-27 22:07:00 -0500] yfeldblum: geekbri, nope, because the chef way is to do all the computation up front, and that includes setting up all resources including all of their attributes up front
[2012-02-27 22:07:00 -0500] geekbri: yfeldblum: hrm i see
[2012-02-27 22:08:00 -0500] geekbri: yfeldblum: can you write blocks of ruby code inside of an attributes file?
[2012-02-27 22:08:00 -0500] geekbri: oh nevermind that wont solve my problem anyway
[2012-02-27 22:08:00 -0500] yfeldblum: geekbri, but you can run any ruby code you like inside a ruby_block resource
[2012-02-27 22:08:00 -0500] geekbri: yfeldblum: yeah i'll just have to not use the remote_file directive
[2012-02-27 22:08:00 -0500] yfeldblum: geekbri, as an escape hatch ... and that code gets run during the convergence
[2012-02-27 22:08:00 -0500] yfeldblum: geekbri, that's probably the solution
[2012-02-27 22:09:00 -0500] geekbri: yfeldblum: so it seems :)
[2012-02-27 22:09:00 -0500] fujin: you could use the remote_file directive during compile phase with the values you compute
[2012-02-27 22:09:00 -0500] fujin: hella dragons down the road you are walking though
[2012-02-27 22:10:00 -0500] geekbri: not even sure how to do that.
[2012-02-27 22:10:00 -0500] fujin: why are you putting the digest in the url source ?
[2012-02-27 22:10:00 -0500] fujin: you don't control the server location ?
[2012-02-27 22:11:00 -0500] geekbri: fujin: this is a tarball of a python virtual env... the way that they determine the id of the virtual env is a md5 of its pip_requirements file.  they are stored remotely under the directory name of that md5
[2012-02-27 22:12:00 -0500] yfeldblum: geekbri, you can just use ruby to check if the target file already exists and to download the file if not from the same ruby_block as where you're computing those values
[2012-02-27 22:13:00 -0500] geekbri: yfeldblum: right yes, that is what im going to do.
[2012-02-27 22:13:00 -0500] geekbri: yfeldblum: I was just trying to initially use the remote_file directive... but i see now that i cannot :)
[2012-02-27 22:14:00 -0500] yfeldblum: geekbri, just trying to bludgeon you with help :P
[2012-02-27 22:14:00 -0500] fujin: you could also write the value of the digest into the node.run_state[:some_key]
[2012-02-27 22:14:00 -0500] fujin: to share it across local scop[e
[2012-02-27 22:14:00 -0500] geekbri: fujin: hrm thats not a bad idea.
[2012-02-27 22:16:00 -0500] fujin: https://gist.github.com/1927483
[2012-02-27 22:18:00 -0500] geekbri: But won't that still not work, since the run_state at the time of remote_file will be empty since it runs before the ruby block?
[2012-02-27 22:21:00 -0500] fujin: oh yeh lol
[2012-02-27 22:21:00 -0500] fujin: my bad
[2012-02-27 22:21:00 -0500] fujin: still same problem
[2012-02-27 22:21:00 -0500] cwj: just to be excessively helpful, have you considered using the python cookbook to create and install your python virtualenvs and packages?
[2012-02-27 22:21:00 -0500] fujin: that too
[2012-02-27 22:22:00 -0500] fujin: and/or not having a crazy URI scheme.
[2012-02-27 22:22:00 -0500] fujin: [like why is the hash in the uri? unecessary; it's meta-data]
[2012-02-27 22:23:00 -0500] yfeldblum: fujin, it looks like it's a pre-packaging
[2012-02-27 22:23:00 -0500] fujin: pre packaged spaghetti!
[2012-02-27 22:23:00 -0500] fujin: just add water. 2 min
[2012-02-27 22:24:00 -0500] fujin: it would be nice (or evil) for casese like this to have late-bound attributes or whatever
[2012-02-27 22:24:00 -0500] fujin: like it doesn't try to query the val from that until converge actually runs
[2012-02-27 22:24:00 -0500] fujin: that is a bad idea. forget i said that
[2012-02-27 22:24:00 -0500] yfeldblum: fujin, it would be nice, but likely not the chef way :P
[2012-02-27 22:25:00 -0500] yfeldblum: fujin, personally, i think we should in general be very open to NOT having to use a resource for every single thing
[2012-02-27 22:25:00 -0500] yfeldblum: fujin, and i think this is a case where trying to use a resource gets in the way more than it helps
[2012-02-27 22:25:00 -0500] fujin: yes
[2012-02-27 22:26:00 -0500] fujin: i would not have used a resource when reachign to solve for this problem
[2012-02-27 22:26:00 -0500] fujin: ruby block I mean
[2012-02-27 22:27:00 -0500] fujin: i have in the past superclassed remote_file provider and put other behavior into it
[2012-02-27 22:27:00 -0500] fujin: geekbri: here is an example https://gist.github.com/654808
[2012-02-27 22:27:00 -0500] yfeldblum: fujin, hmm, i would say, just go for the ruby_block and stick a little ruby code in there, or go for the script resource and stick some bash code in there, because anything else would be a lot of work or painful
[2012-02-27 22:27:00 -0500] fujin: a remote_file that knows about s3.
[2012-02-27 22:27:00 -0500] fujin: hehe, true
[2012-02-27 22:28:00 -0500] geekbri: i've decided that this should be something that is set by a human in the role file anyway. but I will look into all this help anyway
[2012-02-27 22:28:00 -0500] geekbri: incase i come across this stuff again in the future
[2012-02-27 22:28:00 -0500] fujin: agree re: role file, would additional suggest: environment file
[2012-02-27 22:28:00 -0500] fujin: or databag
[2012-02-27 22:29:00 -0500] geekbri: databag might be an even better place for it
[2012-02-27 22:35:00 -0500] Urocyon: Is there a quick idiom for mapping a data bag entry to node attribute?  I'm currently explicitly doing this with lines like node[:my][setting] = bagentry[:my][:setting].
[2012-02-27 22:36:00 -0500] Urocyon: ruby fail on my part, just thought of a way to trim this down with a loop.
[2012-02-27 22:36:00 -0500] Urocyon: never mind.
[2012-02-27 22:37:00 -0500] fujin: databag.reject {|key,value| %w[id chef_type data_bag].include? key}
[2012-02-27 22:37:00 -0500] fujin: node.foo.merge(..)
[2012-02-27 22:37:00 -0500] fujin: Urocyon: ah, cool
[2012-02-27 22:38:00 -0500] Urocyon: ooh, I like that too.
[2012-02-27 22:38:00 -0500] Urocyon: Though it's harder to read than what I had in mind.
[2012-02-27 22:40:00 -0500] fujin: great! I live to confuse. :D
