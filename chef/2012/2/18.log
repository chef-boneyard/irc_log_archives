[2012-02-18 08:42:00 -0500] RoboTeddy: I'm trying to make an execute resource idempotent with not_if. I have a shell command that prints either a single word to stdout, or it sends nothing to stdout. how can I gate the resource based on the output of the shell command?
[2012-02-18 11:06:00 -0500] cientifico: Hi. I recently installed chef. I can list nodes with knife, and also was able to run chef-client (with and empty run_list) in to the nodes. While trying to upload new cookbooks, i get this error:

[2012-02-18 11:08:00 -0500] cientifico: On google i don't found any good answer
[2012-02-18 11:09:00 -0500] cientifico: Did someone know what I am doing wrong?
[2012-02-18 11:13:00 -0500] cientifico: Remove the offending line of /etc/hosts, and restart rabbit seems not to work
[2012-02-18 12:21:00 -0500] cientifico: Fixed. By default seems like root was the owner of /var/lib/chef/cookbook_index
[2012-02-18 12:25:00 -0500] cientifico: :-) All the things working
[2012-02-18 14:25:00 -0500] aeris: hello #chef
[2012-02-18 14:25:00 -0500] aeris: is chef compatible with ipv6 ?
[2012-02-18 14:26:00 -0500] aeris:  wget http://'[::1]':4040 -O -  lead to connexion refused
[2012-02-18 14:26:00 -0500] aeris: but 127.0.0.1 not
[2012-02-18 14:41:00 -0500] sivy: morning
[2012-02-18 15:28:00 -0500] ssd7: Morning all
[2012-02-18 15:44:00 -0500] sivy: hey ssd7: where does mysql keep it;s preseed files again?
[2012-02-18 15:45:00 -0500] sivy: my mysql recipe is preseeding mysql, but apparently not with the values i'm setting in [node][mysql]
[2012-02-18 15:45:00 -0500] sivy: :/
[2012-02-18 15:48:00 -0500] ssd7: within the cookbook it should be in templates/default/mysql-server.seed.erb
[2012-02-18 15:48:00 -0500] sivy: yeah, i'm looking on the filesystem
[2012-02-18 15:49:00 -0500] ssd7: it should be in /var/cache/local/preseeding, the recipe then just runs debconf-set-selections after that
[2012-02-18 15:49:00 -0500] ssd7: s/after/against/
[2012-02-18 15:52:00 -0500] sivy: ssd7: ok, ound it' yeah, it's seeding a random value, even though i'm trying to set the value in the role for the node
[2012-02-18 16:03:00 -0500] ssd7: sivy: Hmm.  It shoudl only generate the random value if you didn't specify your own.  Note that setting that attribute will only set the password on the first install I believe since it is a preeseed.
[2012-02-18 16:03:00 -0500] ssd7: So you can't really use it to change it after the fact
[2012-02-18 16:04:00 -0500] sivy: yeah, i suspect i'm not config'ing the value correctly
[2012-02-18 16:04:00 -0500] sivy: just nuked my VM so I can try fresh
[2012-02-18 16:05:00 -0500] sivy: https://gist.github.com/709be14e713362778f5e <-- ssd7: my role default_attributes
[2012-02-18 16:09:00 -0500] ssd7: looks right to me.
[2012-02-18 16:09:00 -0500] sivy: that's wht i thought
[2012-02-18 16:49:00 -0500] sivy: hey ssd7: check this interesting tidbit out: https://gist.github.com/1860143 <-- possible set_unless bug?
[2012-02-18 17:29:00 -0500] ssd7: sivy: Hmm, sorry, didn't look closely enough before.
[2012-02-18 17:29:00 -0500] ssd7: The problem is likely that you are setting at the default level and the set_unless sets at the normal level
[2012-02-18 17:30:00 -0500] jtimberman: not quite
[2012-02-18 17:30:00 -0500] jtimberman: set_unless will not touch the attribute if it already exists anywhere at any level
[2012-02-18 17:30:00 -0500] ssd7: jtimberman: if that is the intent
[2012-02-18 17:30:00 -0500] ssd7: then we have a bug
[2012-02-18 17:30:00 -0500] jtimberman: it says "set a normal level attribute UNLESS any value exists already"
[2012-02-18 17:30:00 -0500] ssd7: gist incoming
[2012-02-18 17:31:00 -0500] jtimberman: ssd7: that's how i understand it from kallistec
[2012-02-18 17:31:00 -0500] ssd7: https://gist.github.com/1860298
[2012-02-18 17:34:00 -0500] ssd7: The recipe should probably be using default_unless so that you can set the via a role.

[2012-02-18 19:53:00 -0500] maek: in chef 0.10.* is there a reason to use notify vs subscribe? know that you can notify a service thats defined later does it matter what is used?
[2012-02-18 20:51:00 -0500] cientifico: Hi. Can someone give me feedback on https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/pull/341 ?
[2012-02-18 20:51:00 -0500] cientifico: Thanks
[2012-02-18 21:04:00 -0500] cientifico: Is just and option to chef-client cookbook to allow write to syslog, so I can't track the chef-client through graylog2
[2012-02-18 21:31:00 -0500] miah: chef-client already logs to syslog
[2012-02-18 21:32:00 -0500] miah:  -l, --log_level LEVEL            Set the log level (debug, info, warn, error, fatal) -L, --logfile LOGLOCATION        Set the log file location, defaults to STDOUT - recommended for daemonizing
[2012-02-18 21:32:00 -0500] miah: also
[2012-02-18 21:32:00 -0500] miah: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Configuration+Settings#ChefConfigurationSettings-logoutput
[2012-02-18 21:44:00 -0500] cientifico: :-(
[2012-02-18 21:45:00 -0500] Axsuul: Do you guys use chef solo or chef client/server?
[2012-02-18 21:45:00 -0500] cientifico: both
[2012-02-18 21:46:00 -0500] Urocyon: rats, pip 1.1 broke the python cookbook.
[2012-02-18 21:47:00 -0500] Urocyon: Well, broke virutalenvs in the python cookbook.
[2012-02-18 21:48:00 -0500] Urocyon: "Removed -E option and PIP_RESPECT_VIRTUALENV; both use a restart-in-venv mechanism that's broken, and neither one is useful since every virtualenv now has pip inside it."
[2012-02-18 21:48:00 -0500] Urocyon: But that's the mechanism used in the cookobok.
[2012-02-18 21:49:00 -0500] cientifico: miah. Are you sure that chef-client logs to stdout? Reading the documentation nothing appears and in chef-client there is no option
[2012-02-18 21:51:00 -0500] cientifico: s/stdout/stderr/
[2012-02-18 22:06:00 -0500] mrflip: what's the right way to refer to libraries/ code in another cookbook?  I have some utility functions in http://bit.ly/nodeutils that I'd like to call from other cookbooks; but depending on load order, the library may not have been require'd yet.
[2012-02-18 22:17:00 -0500] miah: libraries?
[2012-02-18 22:17:00 -0500] bawt: libraries is http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Libraries
[2012-02-18 22:23:00 -0500] mrflip: @bawt yeah all it says though is "the library files will automatically be read - however you may need to do something else to actually use them, depending on their contents." Want to figure out how to ensure that they are read in the right order.
[2012-02-18 22:34:00 -0500] miah: mrflip: it gives you an example right after that
[2012-02-18 22:36:00 -0500] mrflip: i must be missing something -- the examples I see are for recipes using a library within its own cookbook. I have code in the libraries/ directory of the 'silverware' cookbook, but want to call that code from say the 'jenkins' cookbook.
[2012-02-18 22:36:00 -0500] miah: ok
[2012-02-18 22:37:00 -0500] mrflip: Even with a `depends 'silverware'` in the metadata.rb in jenkins, it isn't loaded first
[2012-02-18 22:38:00 -0500] mrflip: I can dive under the covers and load the file as chef does, but if there's a public interface method to do so (or if that behavior is expected and I'm doing something wrong) I'd prefer to do it the above-board way
[2012-02-18 22:38:00 -0500] miah: hrm
