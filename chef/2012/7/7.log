[2012-07-07 00:00:12 -0400] c_t: PapaSierra11: take a look here: https://launchpad.net/+help-soyuz/ppa-sources-list.html
[2012-07-07 00:00:53 -0400] PapaSierra11: c_t you're a true teacher :) thanks
[2012-07-07 00:02:45 -0400] c_t: glad to be of service
[2012-07-07 00:07:40 -0400] PapaSierra11: c_t though, i'm not sure what the PPA is and where to obtain it. in their example they mention ppa:gwibber-daily/ppa
[2012-07-07 00:08:54 -0400] c_t: ah, hmm
[2012-07-07 00:09:48 -0400] PapaSierra11: and for some reason $ dpkg --configure -a was necessary?!
[2012-07-07 00:10:25 -0400] c_t: actually
[2012-07-07 00:10:37 -0400] c_t: what version of ubuntu is it you're running?
[2012-07-07 00:11:10 -0400] PapaSierra11: 12.04
[2012-07-07 00:12:39 -0400] c_t: hmm, should be in there then actually
[2012-07-07 00:12:52 -0400] c_t: that link is, far as I can tell, just to the normal repo
[2012-07-07 00:13:09 -0400] c_t: maybe run apt-get update and rerun chef-client?
[2012-07-07 00:13:29 -0400] PapaSierra11: c_t yes i just observed the same thing. as in i just manually ran apt-get update then it told me to run dpkg --configure -a and then i ran chef solo and now it's working
[2012-07-07 00:13:58 -0400] c_t: bizarre
[2012-07-07 00:14:01 -0400] PapaSierra11: so the question now is how do i put the apt-get update and dpkg --configure -a into the recipe in the right place
[2012-07-07 00:14:24 -0400] PapaSierra11: i've had apt-get update issues with every single cookbook i've installed so far:(
[2012-07-07 00:14:31 -0400] PapaSierra11: always the same story
[2012-07-07 00:14:42 -0400] c_t: dpkg --configure -a is a new one
[2012-07-07 00:14:55 -0400] c_t: I remember fixing the apt-get update problem before though
[2012-07-07 00:17:23 -0400] c_t: ah, this is what I was looking for:
[2012-07-07 00:17:23 -0400] c_t: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/apt#usage
[2012-07-07 00:17:24 -0400] PapaSierra11: c_t is this what you're referring to? https://github.com/paulsschwarz/apt/commit/bcf90924ba820da726323d727259d66f78441d48
[2012-07-07 00:17:32 -0400] c_t: I remember that helped me at one point
[2012-07-07 00:17:56 -0400] c_t: that would be an example, yes
[2012-07-07 00:19:43 -0400] PapaSierra11: well i'm misunderstanding something because the link i just sent was me forking opscode/apt to "fix a bug".
[2012-07-07 00:21:30 -0400] c_t: hmm, maybe I misread the link you sent
[2012-07-07 00:21:44 -0400] c_t: but see what I linked to to force rebuilding the apt index
[2012-07-07 00:21:51 -0400] c_t: I know I totally do that somewhere
[2012-07-07 00:24:57 -0400] PapaSierra11: first off i have recipe[apt] as my first recipe. beyond that i don't understand the code snippet. where would that go? and it looks like it's adding a source, doesn't it?
[2012-07-07 00:28:36 -0400] Majost: is there any way to encrypt data bags with public key instead of symmetric encryption?
[2012-07-07 00:35:30 -0400] PapaSierra11: c_t next issue http://dpaste.com/768192/ :( i thought these recipes would just work
[2012-07-07 00:40:18 -0400] bdha: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/zone # yay
[2012-07-07 00:40:38 -0400] bdha: zpool and zfs.
[2012-07-07 00:40:42 -0400] bdha: marthag made my night.
[2012-07-07 00:41:10 -0400] hoover_damm: neat
[2012-07-07 00:41:11 -0400] Majost: likewise
[2012-07-07 00:41:21 -0400] hoover_damm: bdha, yeah cut a lot of work out
[2012-07-07 00:41:25 -0400] bdha: Yup.
[2012-07-07 00:41:36 -0400] Majost: There is also a zone and pkg cookbook she wrote
[2012-07-07 00:41:49 -0400] bdha: Yeah, I linked the zone one. Yay.
[2012-07-07 00:41:55 -0400] Majost: the zone one saves me some time for sure
[2012-07-07 00:42:02 -0400] bdha: Funny how similar to the Puppet def I wrote to do that years ago.
[2012-07-07 00:42:08 -0400] bdha: Only so many ways to do some things. :)
[2012-07-07 00:43:37 -0400] hoover_damm: now if i could only make my partman recipe work
[2012-07-07 00:47:26 -0400] Majost: time to go home
[2012-07-07 00:47:28 -0400] Majost: ttyl
[2012-07-07 00:47:51 -0400] hoover_damm: the fact that part man is in the ubuiqity package now
[2012-07-07 00:47:56 -0400] hoover_damm: makes it more fun to write recipes
[2012-07-07 00:48:01 -0400] hoover_damm: I really am not going to install X
[2012-07-07 00:48:13 -0400] hoover_damm: and no one should have to install X for partitioning
[2012-07-07 00:49:00 -0400] bdha: Indeed.
[2012-07-07 00:51:14 -0400] hoover_damm: wish i read http://ftp.dc.volia.com/pub/debian/preseed/partman-auto-recipe.txt 2 days ago
[2012-07-07 00:51:21 -0400] hoover_damm: it contained all the bits I needed
[2012-07-07 00:52:00 -0400] hoover_damm: now one more rebot and that should work, then putz around with 11.04 preseed crap possibly
[2012-07-07 00:52:05 -0400] hoover_damm: supply grub
[2012-07-07 00:52:05 -0400] hoover_damm: win
[2012-07-07 00:52:30 -0400] hoover_damm: really who wouldn't
[2012-07-07 00:56:58 -0400] anrange: hi
[2012-07-07 00:57:04 -0400] anrange: I am new to chef
[2012-07-07 00:57:26 -0400] anrange: have one question, what is the best way to create a group and add it to the sudoers list?
[2012-07-07 00:57:54 -0400] anrange: I can run it as a script, but was wondering if there's a better way
[2012-07-07 01:01:40 -0400] barefoot: anrange: there is a sudo cookbook you could use
[2012-07-07 01:05:44 -0400] bytheway: is anyone here using chef for maintaining hardware (not VMs) that exist long term?
[2012-07-07 01:06:04 -0400] bytheway: most examples and discussions of chef are about cloud, or first deployment scenarios
[2012-07-07 01:07:49 -0400] bytheway: we're mostly a weblogic shop and setup our weblogic instances once, and then deploy new code to the same domain over and over
[2012-07-07 01:08:07 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, my usage of chef is the same wether i'm on metal or not
[2012-07-07 01:08:08 -0400] bytheway: I've wanted to bring chef in to automate a lot of this, but am having a hard time figuring out how it matches our model
[2012-07-07 01:08:33 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, the problem with longterm evolution of manual hosting is we did a lot of one off changes over time
[2012-07-07 01:08:56 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, and you need to describe all the requirements into chef in order to automate that same world
[2012-07-07 01:09:18 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, so it's taking your current system and condensing all the one off's into json blobs of configuration data
[2012-07-07 01:09:18 -0400] bytheway: right, that's how we are currently. say we need to change a database connection pool, currently we log in to the console, make the change
[2012-07-07 01:09:32 -0400] bytheway: I'd love to have chef manage that piece
[2012-07-07 01:10:08 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, wouldn't it be also awesome if chef knew everything about the database connection so it could just write the config file and win?
[2012-07-07 01:10:16 -0400] bytheway: yes, exactly
[2012-07-07 01:10:22 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, if you need to bump up the pool just edit the environment to bump the attribute of the pool size
[2012-07-07 01:10:25 -0400] hoover_damm: re-run chef
[2012-07-07 01:10:26 -0400] hoover_damm: it restarts et al
[2012-07-07 01:10:27 -0400] hoover_damm: win
[2012-07-07 01:11:12 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, have you taken a look at the application cookbook? currently I think the release in github is newer then on the community site (i didn't look)
[2012-07-07 01:11:18 -0400] anrange: @barefoot thanks
[2012-07-07 01:11:24 -0400] bytheway: I'll take a look
[2012-07-07 01:11:33 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, the old method was using databags and the current method is using lwrp
[2012-07-07 01:11:57 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, basically it's describing the components you need to configure and then automating that component
[2012-07-07 01:12:14 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, gotta start somewhere... this sounds like a great small story for you to work on :)
[2012-07-07 01:12:20 -0400] bytheway: the thing I'm finding is most examples are action :create
[2012-07-07 01:12:49 -0400] hoover_damm: a lot of things are :create_if_missing or :create
[2012-07-07 01:12:54 -0400] hoover_damm: and :create will update if the content changes
[2012-07-07 01:12:59 -0400] bytheway: meaning first roll-out.  Geting the update side working (unless you just blow away previous stuff) is harder to find
[2012-07-07 01:14:03 -0400] hoover_damm: I think the :create / :modify can get confusing
[2012-07-07 01:14:11 -0400] hoover_damm: and you don't have to tag the action
[2012-07-07 01:14:19 -0400] hoover_damm: just template "/opt/foobar/config.sh" do
[2012-07-07 01:14:35 -0400] hoover_damm: variables({ :pool => node['somevar'] })
[2012-07-07 01:14:37 -0400] hoover_damm: end
[2012-07-07 01:15:38 -0400] bytheway: ok, good example
[2012-07-07 01:16:01 -0400] bytheway: does chef recreate that file if you change node['somevar']?
[2012-07-07 01:16:07 -0400] bytheway: or will it create every run?
[2012-07-07 01:16:23 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, it will try and create that file on every run... what it does is creates the template and shasums it
[2012-07-07 01:16:30 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, then sums th elocal file, if they are the same, no change
[2012-07-07 01:16:44 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, if it's different.  Chef will backup the original file and replace it
[2012-07-07 01:16:50 -0400] bytheway: makes sense
[2012-07-07 01:17:36 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, and remember to start small and work up
[2012-07-07 01:17:48 -0400] bytheway: that's the trick, I just need to start somewhere
[2012-07-07 01:17:51 -0400] hoover_damm: bytheway, you'll want to change / do things differently as you get used to chef.
[2012-07-07 01:17:52 -0400] bytheway: we are a huge shop
[2012-07-07 01:18:08 -0400] hoover_damm: size makes no difference
[2012-07-07 01:18:31 -0400] hoover_damm: the model of describing your infra as code is quite a degree different from where you are
[2012-07-07 01:18:32 -0400] bytheway: it does when I have a reduced influence on development side
[2012-07-07 01:18:53 -0400] hoover_damm: eventually you can introduce PXE booting that bootstraps into chef and use Chef to inventory your system
[2012-07-07 01:18:56 -0400] hoover_damm: as well
[2012-07-07 01:19:17 -0400] hoover_damm: ohai will 'collect' all sorts of information about the system and then chef Indexes these bits
[2012-07-07 01:19:21 -0400] hoover_damm: DMI, custom plugins
[2012-07-07 01:19:38 -0400] hoover_damm: these are the things that will help most shops like yours excel beyond the norm
[2012-07-07 01:19:59 -0400] hoover_damm: need to find a serial # for a box? look in chef
[2012-07-07 01:20:03 -0400] hoover_damm: :D
[2012-07-07 01:21:06 -0400] bytheway: yeah, I wish that were the case.  I'm actually on what they call a "middle tier" ops team, so another team actually does hardware stuff. so stuff like pxe isn't possible, but the inventory stuff will be a great thing, even for our slice
[2012-07-07 01:21:45 -0400] bytheway: we get the boxes already OSed and IPd and then put our stuff on it, so I'm looking for chef to take us from that point up.  Luckily we still have full sudo access
[2012-07-07 01:22:37 -0400] bytheway: we're so behind the automation times, at least for most of the infrastructure stuff, that any gain is a huge win
[2012-07-07 01:22:57 -0400] hoover_damm: interesting
[2012-07-07 01:23:17 -0400] bytheway: its a screwy way to do things, but its what we have
[2012-07-07 01:23:30 -0400] hoover_damm: pretty much
[2012-07-07 01:23:37 -0400] hoover_damm: but how the hen is run always is fun
[2012-07-07 01:23:54 -0400] bytheway: when getting a new IP provisioned in 3 days is a "rush job"...
[2012-07-07 01:24:05 -0400] hoover_damm: pass
[2012-07-07 01:25:33 -0400] bytheway: yeah, drives me crazy
[2012-07-07 01:26:37 -0400] bytheway: healthcare IT tends to lag a bit, though our IT was ahead of most.
[2012-07-07 01:26:46 -0400] bytheway: most other healthcare, I mean
[2012-07-07 01:30:02 -0400] bytheway: what I'd really like is to get to the point where updates are all automated, and deployments and updates are all "zero downtime"
[2012-07-07 01:30:31 -0400] hoover_damm: downtime is a requirement of life
[2012-07-07 01:30:51 -0400] bytheway: well, zero from teh user perspective
[2012-07-07 01:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: try and replace your 'downtime' with automating upgrades and automating your infra to the point where you can slide in upgrades and reconfigure the load balancer
[2012-07-07 01:31:17 -0400] bytheway: yeah, exactly the hope
[2012-07-07 01:31:38 -0400] hoover_damm: but otherwise 'no downtime' means doing whatever it takes to stay up
[2012-07-07 01:50:14 -0400] anrange: how do I run the git command within a reci[e/
[2012-07-07 01:50:18 -0400] anrange: recipe?
[2012-07-07 01:50:18 -0400] bawt_: recipe is only one 'gem_package' directive:  http://gist.github.com/300823
[2012-07-07 05:51:52 -0400] miah: hi
[2012-07-07 06:34:30 -0400] PapaSierra11: when installing php using opscode/php with install_method=source at what point is pear installed? i'm not sure how to install it because when i run the php recipe it crashes out on calling pear before it exists!
[2012-07-07 06:43:07 -0400] hoover_damm: PapaSierra11, isn't there a pear recipe too?
[2012-07-07 06:44:16 -0400] hoover_damm: i think the source invalidates that.
[2012-07-07 06:45:20 -0400] hoover_damm: PapaSierra11, so i guess the question you need to know is why isn't pear being installed with make install?
[2012-07-07 06:47:04 -0400] zuhaib: anyone having issues with opscode api right now?
[2012-07-07 06:47:18 -0400] PapaSierra11: there's no pear recipe in opscode
[2012-07-07 06:47:28 -0400] hoover_damm: PapaSierra11, doesn't matter as you did source
[2012-07-07 06:47:43 -0400] hoover_damm: PapaSierra11, that should come with source and if it doesn't then you need to do what's required to have it.
[2012-07-07 06:47:57 -0400] PapaSierra11: ok, so you mean intalling from source somehow installs pear as well?
[2012-07-07 06:48:07 -0400] hoover_damm: should
[2012-07-07 06:48:40 -0400] PapaSierra11: huh, well then i'm unclear as to why i would get an error
[2012-07-07 06:48:41 -0400] hoover_damm: https://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.getting.php
[2012-07-07 06:48:50 -0400] PapaSierra11: i also saw this http://stackoverflow.com/a/7959674
[2012-07-07 06:49:09 -0400] PapaSierra11: reading your link...
[2012-07-07 06:49:23 -0400] hoover_damm: basically you need a cookbook to install pear that way
[2012-07-07 06:50:19 -0400] PapaSierra11: ah i read something else interesting, let me find it...
[2012-07-07 06:50:41 -0400] hoover_damm: ohwell
[2012-07-07 06:51:42 -0400] PapaSierra11: ok just typed pear on the shell
[2012-07-07 06:51:43 -0400] PapaSierra11: The program 'pear' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
[2012-07-07 06:52:56 -0400] PapaSierra11: so i'll need a custom pear cookbook
[2012-07-07 06:53:03 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-07-07 06:53:07 -0400] hoover_damm: command-not-found is a pita
[2012-07-07 06:53:17 -0400] hoover_damm: that's what you saw there
[2012-07-07 06:54:37 -0400] hoover_damm: anywho follow that official pear guide and hopefully you'll have pear :)
[2012-07-07 06:54:47 -0400] hoover_damm: you should send a pull request with your cookbook when your done
[2012-07-07 06:54:53 -0400] hoover_damm: just so others don't have to share your pain
[2012-07-07 06:57:05 -0400] PapaSierra11: out of curiosity: the reason this is coming up is i'm building from source. the eason i'm bulding from source is because i'm on ubuntu12 and php only goes up to 5.3.10 in their repo. however in dotdeb's repo it goes up to 5.4.4. what's your opinion on adding dotdeb's repo to apt-get in order to get 5.4.4 as a package?
[2012-07-07 06:57:11 -0400] PapaSierra11: compared with building from source
[2012-07-07 06:59:31 -0400] PapaSierra11: hoover_damm ^
[2012-07-07 11:07:51 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: hi there. you know what would be coolhaving chef setup everything and use "git push" to deploy just like on heroku
[2012-07-07 11:53:35 -0400] cnf: jan0232: if you run your own gitserver, i'm sure you could set that up with post-hooks and knife
[2012-07-07 11:54:26 -0400] jan0232: yep that could work. well for now i'm still struggling with a regular chef deploy :D
[2012-07-07 11:54:34 -0400] cnf: uhu :P
[2012-07-07 11:54:36 -0400] jan0232: baby steps ;)
[2012-07-07 11:54:41 -0400] cnf: i know the feeling :P
[2012-07-07 11:54:58 -0400] cnf: it's not easy to get started with as a new user
[2012-07-07 11:55:06 -0400] cnf: damned thing makes me feel stupid half the time :/
[2012-07-07 11:56:25 -0400] jan0232: i sometimes think i could be so much faster just setting a server up by hand..and then log into ec2 and make an AMI out of it and be done with it...
[2012-07-07 11:56:36 -0400] cnf: :P
[2012-07-07 11:57:29 -0400] jan0232: but that wouldn't really be organized welland i want to learn that stuff, so :)  back to my failing cookbooks :D
[2012-07-07 11:58:41 -0400] cnf: uhu
[2012-07-07 11:59:19 -0400] cnf: jan0232: gets frustrating, doesn't it ^^;
[2012-07-07 11:59:22 -0400] jan0232: i am so much looking forward to just booting up 10 app server instances and let them automagically configure themselves with a load balancer :D ...
[2012-07-07 12:01:58 -0400] jan0232: i'm actually just trying to do the rails fast start guidebut with my own application and rails 3.2 and recent opcode recipes shouldn't be that hard. but stupid as i am :D ...
[2012-07-07 12:09:06 -0400] cnf: :P
[2012-07-07 12:10:57 -0400] cnf: jan0232: imo it's a painpoint in the community atm
[2012-07-07 12:11:06 -0400] cnf: it's too hard to get started with
[2012-07-07 12:12:30 -0400] jan0232: cnf: could be better i agree. but a lot of it was also my own faultthe docs are better than they seem at first ;)
[2012-07-07 12:24:33 -0400] jan0232: ok that's strange. having a permission issue with runit again probably because i don't get how runit works. how can i look and see where exactly it fails?? it just tells me: "unable to open supervise/ok: access denied"
[2012-07-07 13:27:33 -0400] jan0232: aarrggghhh!!
[2012-07-07 13:27:41 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, would be cool; also ecaws and azure do that
[2012-07-07 13:32:34 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: it turned out the runit /etc/init.d/app hup  problem still exists :D .. it is really weird. right now the application_ruby cookbook just seems not usable. no idea why they force runit either
[2012-07-07 13:48:20 -0400] pehlert: For someone who is relatively new to git.. I have my cookbook now and would like to publish it on github.. How can I extract it from my main chef repo and somehow add it as a third-party repo?
[2012-07-07 13:52:01 -0400] jan0232: pehlert: are you using librarian?
[2012-07-07 13:52:49 -0400] pehlert: jan0232: Nope, not yet.. But if it helps me organize my cookbooks, I'll definitely look into it
[2012-07-07 13:53:41 -0400] jan0232: pehlert: i'm a n00b, so build your own opinion :)  it helped me a lot though...
[2012-07-07 13:54:05 -0400] jan0232: you end up with a Cheffile  just like a Gemfile with bundler
[2012-07-07 13:54:39 -0400] jan0232: that way you could just publish your cookbook on github and use your own cookbook in that Cheffile
[2012-07-07 13:54:53 -0400] pehlert: Definately looks interesting, I'll check it out
[2012-07-07 13:54:57 -0400] pehlert: Thanks
[2012-07-07 13:56:20 -0400] jan0232: "librarian-chef install" wipes your cookbook directory and installs those you specify..in the end it wouldn't even be necessary to put the cookbooks directory in version control
[2012-07-07 13:57:16 -0400] jan0232: pehlert: this helped me get started http://blog.119labs.com/2012/03/rails-vagrant-chef/
[2012-07-07 14:33:26 -0400] jan0232: how do i change the PATH for the current chef-client run!?
[2012-07-07 14:33:59 -0400] jan0232: i did change the PATH variable for all users and when i log in with SSH it works...
[2012-07-07 14:34:12 -0400] jan0232: during the first chef-client run it doesn't
[2012-07-07 14:34:21 -0400] jan0232: the second run works
[2012-07-07 15:01:24 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, you can configure the install path in the most recent version of librarian-chef
[2012-07-07 15:02:17 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: ? no i don't mean change the path of librarian-chef...
[2012-07-07 15:03:38 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, you said a little over an hour ago: "librarian-chef install" wipes your cookbook directory and installs those you specify
[2012-07-07 15:04:00 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, i'm saying you can now change the target directory
[2012-07-07 15:04:05 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: oh oopsyes. well at least thats the default directory
[2012-07-07 15:04:13 -0400] jan0232: that is good to know
[2012-07-07 15:06:28 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: the ENV['PATH']  where is that set? that is what the shells PATH variable is right?
[2012-07-07 15:07:25 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, i suspect that chef-client simply inherits its PATH env var from the parent process
[2012-07-07 15:08:11 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, not sure why you would want to change it though; the default should normally be pretty good
[2012-07-07 15:08:44 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: ok because that ENV['PATH'] is what gem_package is using to find a gem binary with omnibus installs and my problem is that even after source /etc/profile and export PATH= etc. it still uses the old PATHonly when i do a second provisioning with chef-client it works
[2012-07-07 15:10:00 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: brand new VM -> install ruby -> gem_package installs in chef's embedded ruby   second run -> gem_package installs in MY installed ruby
[2012-07-07 15:10:04 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, sounds like you're installing the system ruby into somewhere funny
[2012-07-07 15:10:22 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: using rbenv
[2012-07-07 15:10:44 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, well where's rbenv trying to install ruby to?
[2012-07-07 15:11:46 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: /usr/local/rbenv/bin and /usr/local/rbenv/shims/bin is where global installs of rbenv reside it is all working except for the very first chef-client run...
[2012-07-07 15:11:59 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: because the PATH doesn't seem to get updated properly
[2012-07-07 15:12:48 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, well that's not the right way to install a system ruby ... my understanding is that it should be installed, if a package, to /usr/bin/ and, if compiled locally, to /usr/local/bin/
[2012-07-07 15:13:53 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: hmm i would agree. however, i think rbenv is an exception?
[2012-07-07 15:14:28 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, i wouldn't say that rbenv isn't an exception
[2012-07-07 15:14:49 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, do you need rbenv to install a new system ruby, rather than to install an isolated ruby?
[2012-07-07 15:16:34 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: hm actually i just need it to install a new system ruby for now. my idea using rbenv was that IF different apps might go an the same server then rbenv is a good fit to manage multiple ruby versions for the apps...
[2012-07-07 15:16:53 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: but for now..i really just want an easy way to install a specific ruby version system wide
[2012-07-07 15:18:19 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, well, i currently do something similar with rvm, only i make sure that rvm doesn't install a new system ruby ever; rvm is used only to provide a specific ruby for a specific app, and that rvm ruby never becomes the system ruby
[2012-07-07 15:19:47 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: hm. now that i think about thisthat seems to be much better. no idea why i thought i need a system ruby. in fact, i probably don't even need ruby except for running the apps
[2012-07-07 15:20:26 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, so for example, i might use the packaged mri 1.8.7 as the system ruby, and install rvm and have rvm install mri 1.9.3 isolated, and then the deploy steps for the application make sure always to take into account that fact
[2012-07-07 15:20:49 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, i don't know whether/how it works with the application cookbook, because as i said i'm not using it at all
[2012-07-07 15:22:12 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: my guess is that it should work. because it is using bundler to vendor everything inside the app in vendor/bundle  and to run the app with for example unicornit changes to the current release folder and runs bundle exec unicorn etc. ...
[2012-07-07 15:23:37 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, bundler doesn't fix it
[2012-07-07 15:23:54 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, you have to switch rubies first before running bundler in order for bundler to be run in the right ruby
[2012-07-07 15:24:34 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: i have .rbenv-version file inside my app folder that tells rbenv to use that ruby version as long as you switch to the directory first it should workhmm...
[2012-07-07 15:25:59 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, why should that work? sounds like it's making an assumption that may hold true on e.g. your workstation, but may not hold true elsewhere
[2012-07-07 15:31:31 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: hmmbut i mean if rbenv is installed properlywhen you change to a directory with a .rbenv-version file then that version of ruby should be used
[2012-07-07 15:32:50 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, why?
[2012-07-07 15:33:27 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, what is the particular mechanism by means of which that will happen?
[2012-07-07 15:35:51 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: by setting the path
[2012-07-07 15:37:01 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, no, i mean, what sets the path?
[2012-07-07 15:37:14 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, there has to be something that sets the path, right?
[2012-07-07 15:39:36 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: well.. you set up rbenv and with that you put a /etc/profile.d/rbenv.sh that sets the path. the rbenv/shims/ path has the binaries of all the gems you installed. those are pretty much wrapper scripts that then do "rbenv exec"  and that then checks which ruby version to use...
[2012-07-07 15:40:00 -0400] jan0232: so bundle look like: export RBENV_ROOT="/Users/jan/.rbenv" && exec rbenv exec "${0##*/}" "$@"
[2012-07-07 15:41:23 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: isn't that sort of what RVM does? i think RVM does other nasty things like overwriting the "cd" command
[2012-07-07 15:41:57 -0400] jan0232: with rvm you could also use .rvm-version inside your app
[2012-07-07 15:42:16 -0400] jan0232: to specify which specific ruby version your app requires
[2012-07-07 15:42:42 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, alright well then i might do something like drop scripts like `. /etc/profile.d/rbenv.sh ; bundle install --deployment ; rake assets:precompile ; script/rails s thin`
[2012-07-07 15:43:14 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, but i don't like that feature so i turn it off
[2012-07-07 15:43:34 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: oh i see
[2012-07-07 15:44:03 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, which means the scripts i would now need to drop (rvm version) look like `. /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh ; rvm use ruby-1.9.3-p194 ; bundle install --deployment ; ...`
[2012-07-07 15:45:01 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, and so long as, in my cookbook, i take care to make sure that application commands are always wrapped with these sorts of scripts to load rvm and ask rvm to switch to the app-specific ruby, it works
[2012-07-07 15:45:14 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: also maybe do bundle install with --binstubs
[2012-07-07 15:45:25 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, up to you
[2012-07-07 15:46:02 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: yea i mean i got it all workingi just didn't realize there is no need to actually install a system ruby :)
[2012-07-07 15:46:42 -0400] jan0232: that way it doesn't even matter what gem_package is doing since all you do is pretty much install your app bundle, that's it
[2012-07-07 15:46:55 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, that's right
[2012-07-07 15:47:26 -0400] jan0232: however if others want to use rbenv to install a system rubywell, then somehow gem_package won't use the updated path on the first chef-client run
[2012-07-07 15:48:48 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, right, because that's a silly approach in the first place :P
[2012-07-07 15:49:01 -0400] jan0232: and by now i really think i should just abandon the application_ruby recipe because out of the box it just won't workand i could probably could have developed my own recipe by now
[2012-07-07 15:49:18 -0400] jan0232: :D
[2012-07-07 15:49:28 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, at least offer feedback on which parts were troublesome to you
[2012-07-07 15:50:42 -0400] jan0232: debugging stuff is still kinda troublesome :(
[2012-07-07 15:50:46 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, in the open-source world, you don't have to pay money for stuff you don't use (or that you do use); you still have to pay, but one form of valuable payment is feedback :P
[2012-07-07 15:52:06 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: that's true. happy to do that..or help document stuff better. i'm probably a bad indicator thoughi'm completely new to chef and just a lonely app developer :)
[2012-07-07 15:54:48 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, been there
[2012-07-07 15:55:40 -0400] jan0232: and i would like to get back to developing the app instead of fiddling with this server crap as soon as possible ;) ...
[2012-07-07 15:55:50 -0400] jan0232: well it is fun though :)
[2012-07-07 16:08:02 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: are you using bluepill to monitor app processes?
[2012-07-07 16:08:55 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, not currently
[2012-07-07 16:20:17 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: what alternative do i have if i don't want the application_ruby cookbook for rails. any best practice cookbooks out there to get started?
[2012-07-07 16:22:51 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, one option is to go through the cookbook and try to understand what it actually does for a single app, and then write a recipe whose sole job is to deploy the app with a similar strategy but with much simpler code because everything can be hardcoded rather than generic
[2012-07-07 16:23:37 -0400] jan0232: hm ok yea that kind of what i thought
[2012-07-07 16:23:44 -0400] jan0232: thx will try some stuff :)
[2012-07-07 16:25:51 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, that's in fact what i started off with; once you get a handle on doing it hardcoding everything for a single app, it's much easier understanding how to build a more generic data-driven cookbook
[2012-07-07 16:30:42 -0400] jan0232: maybe i should use the other cookbooks more to read them and learn from them instead of actually using them...
[2012-07-07 16:30:51 -0400] jan0232: cause nothing never is quite the way you really want it to be
[2012-07-07 16:31:28 -0400] jan0232: not to mention they're probably still not quite ready considering they've been rewritten just a few months ago
[2012-07-07 16:33:05 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: i was naive at firsti thought plugin some of the opscode cookbooks, run themand everything would work ;)
[2012-07-07 16:33:46 -0400] jan0232: it's more like it will workwait for iteventually ;)
[2012-07-07 16:35:00 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, another option is to fork the application_ruby cookbook and make those fixes needed for your environment and contribute them back upstream, but that may be more or less complicated depending on a variety of factors
[2012-07-07 16:35:42 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: i would love toi think i would need to write my own stuff first thoughand then i have the skills to do that :)
[2012-07-07 16:35:57 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, cool
[2012-07-07 16:36:19 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: have you ever looked at the 37s_cookbooks?
[2012-07-07 16:37:14 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: https://github.com/37signals/37s_cookbooks  i know last commit is over 2 years ago.. no idea if they still apply for current chef versionsand they are not documented at all but those are probably pretty good!??
[2012-07-07 16:39:40 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, yeah, i looked at them a while back and used them for ideas; but i don't currently use any of them
[2012-07-07 16:50:31 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: how is your workflow when developing cookbooks? i can't find anything documented i'm just wondering if i'm doing it right. right now i'm using vagrant and virtual box to test the stuff out i do vagrant provision if everything works, yayif not, i try to fix it, and do vagrant provision again
[2012-07-07 16:51:16 -0400] jan0232: i set the log level to :debug so i can get hints on whats wrong in case something blows up
[2012-07-07 16:51:42 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, presently? simply a development set of servers (including a development chef-server and a development knife.rb!!!)
[2012-07-07 16:52:44 -0400] jan0232: ok so you fire up knife see if it worksgo fix it, do another chef-client run etc!? ...
[2012-07-07 16:53:39 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, yep, also, i've got a knife.rb that looks at the envvar KNIFE_ENV and, based on what it is, loads another sub-knife.rb that sets up the right configs for that for knife to load
[2012-07-07 16:53:55 -0400] jan0232: ah ok
[2012-07-07 16:54:26 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, so e.g. if i do `KNIFE_ENV=test knife role from file base.rb` it uploads to the chef-server in the test env
[2012-07-07 17:18:19 -0400] erGabber: Hi guys.. a question..  I have to write a cookbook to execute a perl script.. This require an human input on stdin..How  can I  do it? How can I send the values when the script ask to insert that?  thanks
[2012-07-07 17:19:12 -0400] _aeris_: erGabber > use expect library ?
[2012-07-07 17:19:51 -0400] erGabber: I don't know wich library I will use
[2012-07-07 17:20:07 -0400] _aeris_: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect
[2012-07-07 17:20:10 -0400] erGabber: I think use the resource Script  to run the perl script
[2012-07-07 17:20:34 -0400] _aeris_: yes, but if you need some interactivity, you can use lib expect for exemple
[2012-07-07 17:21:59 -0400] erGabber: great suggestion thanks :)   but in ruby there is somethings for do this?
[2012-07-07 17:22:34 -0400] erGabber: or any resoures of chef?
[2012-07-07 17:22:41 -0400] erGabber: *resources
[2012-07-07 17:23:39 -0400] _aeris_: i don't know
[2012-07-07 17:25:25 -0400] yfeldblum: erGabber, https://github.com/opscode/mixlib-shellout/blob/master/lib/mixlib/shellout.rb#L58-61
[2012-07-07 17:27:30 -0400] erGabber: yfeldblum>  Thanks!
[2012-07-07 18:10:34 -0400] loladiro: My "env" resources are ignored apparently due to only_if directives, but I am not using any of those
[2012-07-07 19:37:19 -0400] PapaSierra13: the opscode php cookbook claims to install php and pear. however i'm using it with install_method = source and for sure pear is not being installed.
[2012-07-07 20:00:18 -0400] hoover_damm: PapaSierra13, and installing pear the method I listed last night didn't work?
[2012-07-07 20:00:45 -0400] hoover_damm: PapaSierra13, dotdeb should be fine
[2012-07-07 20:01:00 -0400] hoover_damm: PapaSierra13, dotdeb also should include all the debian packages for pear and crud
[2012-07-07 20:01:06 -0400] hoover_damm: which should make your problem a lot less painful
[2012-07-07 20:01:51 -0400] PapaSierra13: hoover_damm well, it's just too fragile, it seems like no matter how much i patch up the cookbooks it's always necessary to manually run apt-get update and then run chef-solo again
[2012-07-07 20:02:28 -0400] PapaSierra13: right, i'm thinking of scrapping php from source and just going for dotdeb
[2012-07-07 20:02:45 -0400] PapaSierra13: confirm though it mean you're subject to their choice of compile options
[2012-07-07 20:06:32 -0400] hoover_damm: PapaSierra13, correct
[2012-07-07 20:06:39 -0400] hoover_damm: PapaSierra13, dotdeb's compile options i understand are fairly good
[2012-07-07 20:06:59 -0400] hoover_damm: PapaSierra13, and they provide a fairly robust php package
[2012-07-07 20:07:09 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-07-07 20:07:19 -0400] hoover_damm: i need to port my broken php apps to ruby or python
[2012-07-07 20:07:56 -0400] Mithrandir: hoover_damm: isn't "not having a working php installation" cause for celebration?
[2012-07-07 20:08:54 -0400] PapaSierra13: hoover_damm good, i'll try switch back to dotdeb again. i actually created a cookbook with package "php-pear" in it to install pear, but then an apt-get update was required for percona to work (a problem i fixed 2 days ago but mysterious popped up again)
[2012-07-07 20:10:16 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, it is
[2012-07-07 20:10:20 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, I'm debating blogging about it
[2012-07-07 20:10:27 -0400] hoover_damm: and finishing the act
[2012-07-07 20:10:39 -0400] s1__: better yet, reblog about it
[2012-07-07 20:10:53 -0400] hoover_damm: s1__, fwiw the Google Compute Engine... looks like a larger rackspace
[2012-07-07 20:11:03 -0400] hoover_damm: s1__, maybe they'll have proper inter-instance security unlike rackspace
[2012-07-07 20:11:20 -0400] s1__: hoover_damm: http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/7/2/c-is-for-compute-google-compute-engine-gce.html
[2012-07-07 20:11:29 -0400] s1__: this is a decent read that breaks down the tech stuff, probably according to google
[2012-07-07 20:11:54 -0400] s1__: more cloud crack
[2012-07-07 20:12:07 -0400] hoover_damm: s1__, highscalability usually is a good fud spot
[2012-07-07 20:12:11 -0400] s1_: we heading to roger waters in a few hours.  supposed to thunderstorm entire time we are there
[2012-07-07 20:12:22 -0400] hoover_damm: should be fun
[2012-07-07 20:12:22 -0400] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-07-07 20:12:29 -0400] s1_: indeed .. rolling deep with ponchos
[2012-07-07 20:12:34 -0400] s1_: and crossing our fingers it doesn't get cancelled
[2012-07-07 20:13:13 -0400] s1_: i am getting e-mail bombed by a $250/mo customer telling me we should bend over backwards for him because of his increasing "business" needs
[2012-07-07 20:13:55 -0400] s1_: that's pretty much word for word.  & i agree about highscalability + FUD .. it is better than what else is out there though for the most part
[2012-07-07 20:14:05 -0400] hoover_damm: s1_, If you have to bend for one customer, you have to bend for every customer eventually
[2012-07-07 20:14:11 -0400] hoover_damm: s1_, that's one sore back :(
[2012-07-07 20:14:38 -0400] hoover_damm: highscalability like gigom makes good articles to make people think and want cloud computing
[2012-07-07 20:14:48 -0400] s1_: haha
[2012-07-07 20:14:50 -0400] hoover_damm: they provide good marketing material
[2012-07-07 20:14:58 -0400] hoover_damm: note the word 'marketing'
[2012-07-07 20:14:59 -0400] s1_: gigaom is far worse
[2012-07-07 20:15:04 -0400] hoover_damm: yup
[2012-07-07 20:15:06 -0400] s1_: very broad stuff
[2012-07-07 20:15:11 -0400] s1_: good articles, poor content
[2012-07-07 20:15:22 -0400] s1_: and a lot of the times the guest posts are merely sponsored posts by said vendor
[2012-07-07 20:15:26 -0400] hoover_damm: arstechnica is still good content
[2012-07-07 20:15:28 -0400] hoover_damm: last i checked
[2012-07-07 20:15:45 -0400] s1_: gigaom doesn't do good on the tech nitty gritty though
[2012-07-07 20:15:50 -0400] Mithrandir: s1_: sad when people paying you $250/month doesn't realise that translates into just a few hours a month.
[2012-07-07 20:15:54 -0400] s1_: they are hawking that cloud crack though for sure
[2012-07-07 20:16:16 -0400] vluther: s1_: is $250 your highest price point?
[2012-07-07 20:16:46 -0400] s1_: vluther: durrr
[2012-07-07 20:17:03 -0400] vluther: i'm gonna go with, no :)
[2012-07-07 20:17:57 -0400] vluther: we get customers every now and then that do the same.. I understand 250 is a lot of them, but it's not something we're going to stop the presses for, so i'm curious how you're dealing with it
[2012-07-07 20:18:27 -0400] s1_: i have very few customers that small
[2012-07-07 20:18:37 -0400] s1_: mainly from when i just started out where i work now
[2012-07-07 20:19:00 -0400] s1_: they tend to sweat the small stuff more than anyone else and masters of bitching & moaning when something goes wrong
[2012-07-07 20:19:22 -0400] Mithrandir: we have one plan that's 3300/year, but which we basically just tell people "don't buy this, unless it's for pre-production"
[2012-07-07 20:20:08 -0400] vluther: yea, we get a lot of the same, the $25/month customer monitors his traffic and uptime 10X worse than a $1000/month customer
[2012-07-07 20:20:17 -0400] vluther: s1_: so what did you tell him in this instance?
[2012-07-07 20:21:48 -0400] s1_: there is some back story to it, but i basically told him tough titties.  i used to treat the tiny customers the same as the folks that spend $100k/mo with me, but bottom line is that is not always practcal
[2012-07-07 20:22:33 -0400] Mithrandir: you don't want to fuck them over, but you want to make it clear from what deal they have that they are paying little.
[2012-07-07 20:22:54 -0400] Mithrandir: we offer 3 business day response time guarantees to basic customers, for instance.
[2012-07-07 20:22:57 -0400] s1_: sure.  i work in a bigger company now, there is process and approvals and the like.  you can't just do everything willy nilly, gotta save your bullets where it matters
[2012-07-07 20:23:17 -0400] Mithrandir: which means we're covered if somebody goes "I'm not sure what's up, but I'll take a look" after 2.95 days.
[2012-07-07 20:23:26 -0400] s1_: what do you guy sdo
[2012-07-07 20:24:57 -0400] s1_: support side is a lot more straightforward than business side when it comes to bending rules in my experience
[2012-07-07 20:25:03 -0400] hoover_damm: saving your bullets is important
[2012-07-07 20:25:23 -0400] hoover_damm: and it's really hard to give a white glove experience and treat the customer like they're getting a good thing without giving them anything
[2012-07-07 20:25:28 -0400] hoover_damm: but that's why you have to accentuate the positive
[2012-07-07 20:25:32 -0400] hoover_damm: (sp)
[2012-07-07 20:25:40 -0400] hoover_damm: and sell the positive in those situations instead of the negative
[2012-07-07 20:26:43 -0400] Mithrandir: hoover_damm: and realise when you've lost a customer and focus on either making it into a neutral experience or at least not have them post rabid blog posts about your poor service on the internetz.
[2012-07-07 20:27:28 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, i'm one of thoese people that feel customers come and go.  If i try and save every customer
[2012-07-07 20:27:32 -0400] hoover_damm: i might as well cut my throat now
[2012-07-07 20:27:34 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-07-07 20:27:58 -0400] s1_: new business vs. churn.  in our space though churn should be under 1%
[2012-07-07 20:28:01 -0400] s1_: or else it will raise red flags
[2012-07-07 20:28:16 -0400] hoover_damm: One of the best policies I saw was at DD Meats the other day.  If your an an asshole or a prick to me, I will charge you 10$ more for putting up with you.
[2012-07-07 20:28:47 -0400] hoover_damm: If I was to start hosting customers again I would totally apply that policy
[2012-07-07 20:28:49 -0400] hoover_damm: except make it 10%
[2012-07-07 20:29:16 -0400] Mithrandir: hoover_damm: there's saving and there's saving.  I try to make it so we at least part on friendly terms, even if they feel they've had a poor experience.
[2012-07-07 20:29:21 -0400] s1_: i always explain it like this: you got assholes & whiners
[2012-07-07 20:29:27 -0400] s1_: *most* customers fit into one category or the other
[2012-07-07 20:29:42 -0400] hoover_damm: I must be the asshole
[2012-07-07 20:29:42 -0400] hoover_damm: :-P
[2012-07-07 20:29:49 -0400] s1_: neither, yet
[2012-07-07 20:29:53 -0400] Mithrandir: s1_: I must be lucky.  Most of my customers are excellent.
[2012-07-07 20:30:04 -0400] hoover_damm: s1_, I hate whining and I hate yelling
[2012-07-07 20:30:17 -0400] s1_: Mithrandir: lucky you .. I always prefer assholes over whiners
[2012-07-07 20:30:25 -0400] s1_: they are much more straight forward and don't let emotions get in the way of communicating their point
[2012-07-07 20:30:39 -0400] hoover_damm: I've had to let go clients who are too pushy/needy
[2012-07-07 20:30:43 -0400] s1_: i can take that .. the whining though?
[2012-07-07 20:31:19 -0400] s1_: Mithrandir: what do you guys do?
[2012-07-07 20:31:23 -0400] hoover_damm: dunno i'd take a whiner over someone who's pushy and constantly asking for an update
[2012-07-07 20:31:34 -0400] Mithrandir: s1_: https://www.varnish-software.com/ :-)
[2012-07-07 20:31:54 -0400] s1_: ah cool varnish
[2012-07-07 20:32:04 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, left Ubuntu for Varnish?
[2012-07-07 20:32:04 -0400] hoover_damm: cool
[2012-07-07 20:32:11 -0400] s1_: we use a lot of varnish
[2012-07-07 20:32:17 -0400] Mithrandir: hoover_damm: ages ago.  I left Canonical in 2008
[2012-07-07 20:32:27 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, ahh but your still active :)
[2012-07-07 20:32:30 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, got it
[2012-07-07 20:32:51 -0400] Mithrandir: "active".  I've still got my upload privs, I don't actually do anything in Ubuntu and haven't for a while.
[2012-07-07 20:33:16 -0400] Mithrandir: might be uploading some stuff to 12.10, since opscode have contracted me to get chef in there.
[2012-07-07 20:33:16 -0400] s1_: i see an increasing amount of server installs w/ ubuntu over last year
[2012-07-07 20:33:25 -0400] s1_: might be coincidence, but it seems to the going trend
[2012-07-07 20:33:28 -0400] s1_: less and less centos, more and more ubuntu
[2012-07-07 20:33:30 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, glad to hear it
[2012-07-07 20:33:44 -0400] Mithrandir: s1_: you happy with Varnish?  What can we do better?
[2012-07-07 20:34:03 -0400] s1_: i'd ask to have our eng group that one
[2012-07-07 20:34:06 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, I don't think Varnish itself can do much better
[2012-07-07 20:34:19 -0400] s1_: we use a lot a mix of varnish / memcache for a lot of internet content stuff we manage
[2012-07-07 20:34:21 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, Varnish is insanely awesome and having worked with clients integrating Varnish into their world
[2012-07-07 20:34:29 -0400] Mithrandir: s1_: if you could, please do.  Have them mail me at tfheen@varnish-software.com, please.
[2012-07-07 20:34:30 -0400] s1_: drupal sites, news sites, etc. that we do MH for
[2012-07-07 20:34:53 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, it's more fixing up the site to be varnishable tbh
[2012-07-07 20:35:04 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, alot of frameworks still try to make it hard to cache
[2012-07-07 20:35:10 -0400] hoover_damm: (not rails)
[2012-07-07 20:35:11 -0400] Mithrandir: hoover_damm: one can always do better.  Even if the software is beyond awesome, there's still the whole business side.
[2012-07-07 20:35:32 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, Thankfully I get to not worry about that :)
[2012-07-07 20:35:38 -0400] s1_: i take it varnish software operates as open source model company?
[2012-07-07 20:35:41 -0400] Mithrandir: hoover_damm: and yeah, you're pointing out a sore spot; can we reasonably do anything to make those sites more cacheable out of the box?
[2012-07-07 20:35:46 -0400] s1_: you provide support & consulting on top of varnish?
[2012-07-07 20:36:25 -0400] Mithrandir: s1_: yes.  Varnish as it is is what you get, there's no enterprise version or anything.  We give you support & bug fixes and a administration console.
[2012-07-07 20:36:35 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, *twitch* the only way I can see making the rough spots easier is to have something in front of varnish and shove it into varnish if it can, if it can't pass it out the other side
[2012-07-07 20:36:40 -0400] Mithrandir: shiny web ui with graphs, deployment, etc.
[2012-07-07 20:36:52 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, and really those rough spots can be fixed with proper engineering faster
[2012-07-07 20:36:58 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, then you could engineer a solution
[2012-07-07 20:37:04 -0400] hoover_damm: 100fold
[2012-07-07 20:37:17 -0400] Mithrandir: hoover_damm: mhm, solving the problem in the right spot's always better.
[2012-07-07 20:37:24 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, nope it's not
[2012-07-07 20:37:26 -0400] Mithrandir: sometimes, you can't though
[2012-07-07 20:37:41 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, but this is one of those where Varnish can contact vendors/etc who have issues
[2012-07-07 20:37:49 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, and prod them to fix them so varnish can work
[2012-07-07 20:37:58 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, and then upsell them on varnish on their product once they fix it
[2012-07-07 20:38:40 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, create more relationships where you can change indirectly
[2012-07-07 20:38:45 -0400] Mithrandir: true, we have a bit of integration with various vendors going over having plugins for, say, eZ publish, where it'll do more of the varnish management for you.
[2012-07-07 20:40:37 -0400] hoover_damm: Mithrandir, fastly helps as you can have 'varnish' as a serice
[2012-07-07 20:41:26 -0400] s1_: have you tested fastly at all?
[2012-07-07 20:41:29 -0400] hoover_damm: just something I learned at Engine Yard.  You cannot change from outside
[2012-07-07 20:41:32 -0400] s1_: via their service CDN
[2012-07-07 20:41:37 -0400] hoover_damm: but you can change a lot better from within
[2012-07-07 20:41:45 -0400] hoover_damm: s1_, I was going to have Engine Yard use Fastly as SSL Termination + CDN
[2012-07-07 20:41:48 -0400] hoover_damm: s1_, so yes
[2012-07-07 20:41:58 -0400] s1_: cool, i know artur, etc.
[2012-07-07 20:41:59 -0400] hoover_damm: really sad
[2012-07-07 20:42:07 -0400] hoover_damm: because it was worth it
[2012-07-07 20:42:11 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah Artur really was into it
[2012-07-07 20:42:15 -0400] s1_: i'm sure
[2012-07-07 20:42:20 -0400] hoover_damm: just solving the stupid problem of SSL Termination
[2012-07-07 20:42:41 -0400] hoover_damm: AWS tried to help solve the problem by offering multiple ips in VPC now
[2012-07-07 20:42:51 -0400] Mithrandir: I'm very sad about SSL and how you have to choose between fast and secure.
[2012-07-07 20:43:56 -0400] hoover_damm: I don't really see SSL changing anymore then HTTP
[2012-07-07 20:44:06 -0400] hoover_damm: I admit I don't care for SPDY
[2012-07-07 21:25:43 -0400] yfeldblum: Mithrandir, how is that?
[2012-07-07 21:30:26 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, what would be a better solution?
[2012-07-07 22:08:22 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, the problems that SPDY solves could be solved by agressively tuning your browser.
[2012-07-07 22:09:47 -0400] hoover_damm: the SSL tidbit just makes me feel that the SSL CA's care
[2012-07-07 22:09:51 -0400] hoover_damm: which makes me not care
[2012-07-07 22:10:42 -0400] hoover_damm: not someone who googled me and clicked approved
[2012-07-07 22:10:43 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-07-07 23:03:00 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, what about http://convergence.io/ & other types of distributed, p2p, & probabilistic trust networks?
[2012-07-07 23:36:41 -0400] jhayden: anyone know what causes this error : LoadError: no such file to load -- right_aws
[2012-07-07 23:36:56 -0400] jhayden: using knife to create a server in aws
[2012-07-07 23:37:26 -0400] jhayden: and then uild and attach a volume using was cookbok
[2012-07-07 23:37:32 -0400] jhayden: build
[2012-07-07 23:37:37 -0400] jhayden: aws
[2012-07-07 23:54:53 -0400] jan0232: jhayde: mayben you're missing the right_aws gem
[2012-07-07 23:56:06 -0400] jhayden: no its there, I double checked
[2012-07-07 23:56:57 -0400] coderanger: How did you install it?
[2012-07-07 23:57:55 -0400] jhayden: I've tried both a yum install and a gem install from within a recipe
[2012-07-07 23:58:28 -0400] jhayden: bootstarpping an ec2 server
