[2012-07-15 01:16:45 -0400] ttilley: i need to reboot a node after a complete successful run, but only if a specific command was executed during the run. what's a sane way of doing that?
[2012-07-15 01:21:54 -0400] hoover_damm: an immediate notification to a resource that specifies to reboot?
[2012-07-15 01:27:42 -0400] ttilley: hoover_damm: and make sure it's the absolute last thing that happens?
[2012-07-15 01:28:22 -0400] realityforge: an immediate notification that specifies a "reboot" handler and during the handler a reboot is forced
[2012-07-15 01:28:47 -0400] hoover_damm: ttilley, the only way to ensure that is to have an immediate notification
[2012-07-15 01:28:48 -0400] hoover_damm: to reboot
[2012-07-15 01:30:10 -0400] hoover_damm: Chef will do whatever you instruct it to even if it's silly (such as rebooting)
[2012-07-15 01:30:29 -0400] hoover_damm: I use delayed alot so i'd totally screw myself
[2012-07-15 01:30:30 -0400] hoover_damm: in many ways
[2012-07-15 01:31:15 -0400] hoover_damm: ttilley, truthfully no it wouldn't ensure it's the last thing that happened
[2012-07-15 01:31:24 -0400] hoover_damm: ttilley, likely you want a ruby_block to start the reboot and stop chef
[2012-07-15 01:31:42 -0400] hoover_damm: ttilley, reboots are not immediate always... starts the shutdown process so could be 30s until it reboots, or 0s
[2012-07-15 01:32:11 -0400] hoover_damm: ruby_block "reboot" do block do system(`reboot`) raise "I need to die here" end end
[2012-07-15 01:32:14 -0400] hoover_damm: or so
[2012-07-15 01:32:15 -0400] ttilley: hoover_damm: hmm. i need to run the 'rename' action as the first thing i do if 'rename' hasn't been run on that node, but only reboot after other configuration commands have been run. -_-
[2012-07-15 01:32:20 -0400] s1: hoover_damm: you use nflx?
[2012-07-15 01:32:27 -0400] hoover_damm: s1, yep
[2012-07-15 01:32:34 -0400] s1: what i find amazing is that so many people pay $10/mo (including me) but the movie selection is god awful
[2012-07-15 01:32:35 -0400] hoover_damm: s1, amazon prime/netflix
[2012-07-15 01:32:56 -0400] s1: finding a movie for me is like pulling teeth.  my girlfriend doesn't mind watching the crap though
[2012-07-15 01:33:01 -0400] hoover_damm: s1, also do remember I won a tivo and cabletv
[2012-07-15 01:33:10 -0400] s1: you won it?
[2012-07-15 01:33:14 -0400] hoover_damm: s1, so it's like amazon prime, netflix, old shows, blueray, etc
[2012-07-15 01:33:23 -0400] hoover_damm: to try and keep something to watch
[2012-07-15 01:33:27 -0400] s1: we download a lot of stuff.  nflx for convenience though via apple tv
[2012-07-15 01:33:31 -0400] hoover_damm: s/won/own
[2012-07-15 01:33:37 -0400] hoover_damm: s1, no I own... lol good typo :)
[2012-07-15 01:33:38 -0400] s1: hah .. I was like why the hell would they give you one for free
[2012-07-15 01:33:44 -0400] hoover_damm: well they did originally
[2012-07-15 01:33:46 -0400] hoover_damm: 5 years ago
[2012-07-15 01:33:57 -0400] s1: we never subscribed for cable, i am tempted to sign up for a month to see the olympics
[2012-07-15 01:33:59 -0400] hoover_damm: got a series 2 dual duner
[2012-07-15 01:34:03 -0400] hoover_damm: s/duner/tuner
[2012-07-15 01:34:14 -0400] hoover_damm: basically tv rott's your brain
[2012-07-15 01:34:23 -0400] hoover_damm: i like netflix when I want something different
[2012-07-15 01:34:53 -0400] hoover_damm: the apple tv experience always confused me because it felt too small of a experience unless you hack your apple tv and xbox and bridge them
[2012-07-15 01:34:56 -0400] hoover_damm: and other crud
[2012-07-15 01:35:20 -0400] s1: hoover_damm: agreed
[2012-07-15 01:35:26 -0400] s1: MP4 only support sort of screwed me
[2012-07-15 01:35:33 -0400] s1: in terms of leveraging existing movie base (1000+)
[2012-07-15 01:35:43 -0400] hoover_damm: mpeg?
[2012-07-15 01:35:49 -0400] hoover_damm: tivo supports streaming mpeg videos
[2012-07-15 01:35:49 -0400] s1: AVI, unfortunately
[2012-07-15 01:35:53 -0400] s1: a lot of it is old classics
[2012-07-15 01:35:56 -0400] hoover_damm: should be easy enough to transcode
[2012-07-15 01:35:57 -0400] hoover_damm: ;)
[2012-07-15 01:35:58 -0400] s1: AVI was lowest disk space for decent quality
[2012-07-15 01:36:05 -0400] s1: transcode on an E5-2620
[2012-07-15 01:36:09 -0400] s1: or better yet, an E3-1230!
[2012-07-15 01:36:11 -0400] hoover_damm: I do that sometimes on my tivo
[2012-07-15 01:36:23 -0400] s1: and then have one of my tech brings me the hard drive
[2012-07-15 01:36:24 -0400] hoover_damm: take some content I downloaded and transcode it and stream it to my tivo
[2012-07-15 01:36:29 -0400] hoover_damm: so i can watch it on the big screen
[2012-07-15 01:36:35 -0400] s1: that's actually a decent plan ..
[2012-07-15 01:36:51 -0400] s1: run a transcode job on a server, let it do them all, over whatever period of time (probably a while), and have them drop off the hard drive for me
[2012-07-15 01:36:51 -0400] s1: hmm
[2012-07-15 01:37:01 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-07-15 01:37:10 -0400] hoover_damm: and it actually supports external hard drives too just not sure how you'd get it on there
[2012-07-15 01:37:13 -0400] hoover_damm: cleanly
[2012-07-15 06:31:58 -0400] ranjibd__: ttilley, use report handler and  iterate through the updated resources, check if the execute resource is present in that and then invoke a reboot. this will atleast ensure that reboot is invoked after the convergence
[2012-07-15 06:41:09 -0400] ttilley: ranjibd__: ohai! i'm only awake at the moment (2:40AM here) because my 10-day-old son is hungry. glad i caught the advice. thanks =]
[2012-07-15 07:47:53 -0400] tjadmin: #thai
[2012-07-15 10:33:37 -0400] bip: *dumb question* How do I update chef-clien/ohai on a node? I get INFO: *** Chef 0.10.8 *** for an old node a newly added node gets INFO: *** Chef 10.12.0 *** in the log
[2012-07-15 10:59:43 -0400] robwilkerson: u5
[2012-07-15 11:01:40 -0400] robwilkerson: i've been having a lot of trouble using the opscode cookbooks to provision a vagrant box. i'm using the apt & wordpress recipes at the moment (in that order).
[2012-07-15 11:02:24 -0400] robwilkerson: i get as far as mysql attempting to start, but then it fails with dmesg telling me "init: mysql respawning too fast, stopped
[2012-07-15 11:02:51 -0400] robwilkerson: any idea what I might be missing? tried on ubuntu 10.04 and 12.04.
[2012-07-15 11:03:26 -0400] robwilkerson: i also tried throwing in the apparmor cookbook, but that didn't seem to make a difference.
[2012-07-15 11:35:34 -0400] tightwork: robwilkerson: how much ram you have?
[2012-07-15 11:35:38 -0400] tightwork: out?
[2012-07-15 11:35:51 -0400] robwilkerson: tightwork: 4GB on the host
[2012-07-15 11:36:51 -0400] tightwork: hmm
[2012-07-15 11:37:02 -0400] tightwork: should be enough
[2012-07-15 11:37:29 -0400] robwilkerson: seems to be a pretty common problem, but none of the fixes i've found have worked.
[2012-07-15 11:38:38 -0400] robwilkerson: ultimately, this is what I see in `dmesg` or /var/log/syslog:
[2012-07-15 11:38:39 -0400] robwilkerson: Jul 15 11:27:50 precise64 kernel: [  220.310890] init: mysql post-start process (7787) terminated with status 1

[2012-07-15 11:40:01 -0400] robwilkerson: and that is with the apparmor recipe that is supposed to disable apparmor (if i read it correctly)
[2012-07-15 11:40:17 -0400] tightwork: Is vagrant modifying my.cnf ?
[2012-07-15 11:41:08 -0400] tightwork: I found https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mysql-5.5/+bug/958120
[2012-07-15 11:41:59 -0400] tightwork: How can I specify multiple roles? I do this but only the one is used knife rackspace server create -f 3 -I 125 -d ubuntu12.04-gems -r role['base'] -r role['web-server'] -r role['wordpress']
[2012-07-15 11:42:10 -0400] tightwork: last one*
[2012-07-15 11:46:30 -0400] robwilkerson: tightwork: vagrant doesn't modify anything, i don't think.
[2012-07-15 11:46:38 -0400] robwilkerson: it would only be what the cookbook is doing.
[2012-07-15 11:47:03 -0400] tightwork: yea, I believe that is what I ment
[2012-07-15 11:47:13 -0400] robwilkerson: and the my.cnf looks fine against every issue i've seen related to that. i'll check your link though
[2012-07-15 11:47:36 -0400] tightwork: I'm about to launch a new vm with mysql, i'll let you know how it goes
[2012-07-15 11:47:41 -0400] tightwork: no vagrant though
[2012-07-15 11:48:17 -0400] robwilkerson: ok. stepping away for a few, but will look when i get back. thanks for your help
[2012-07-15 11:48:27 -0400] tightwork: yw
[2012-07-15 12:23:04 -0400] bip: Anyone know how I can upgrade the chef client on a node? chef-client -version shows "Chef: 0.10.8" on one node and "Chef: 10.12.0" on a freshly added node
[2012-07-15 12:23:24 -0400] bip: just running chef-client doesn't seem to take care of it
[2012-07-15 12:59:25 -0400] robwilkerson: tightwork: that bug is one that i've seen. the cookbook's my.cnf file doesn't specify any charset options. oh well.
[2012-07-15 13:13:09 -0400] tightwork: robwilkerson: i get the ever famous, no mysql gem with the mysql cookbook
[2012-07-15 13:13:55 -0400] robwilkerson: tightwork: ha. well, damn. i guess i'll keep digging. i was hoping it was something others had seen/fixed. :-)
[2012-07-15 13:16:47 -0400] tightwork: oh yeah... idiot boostrap script didn't apt-get update again
[2012-07-15 13:17:08 -0400] tightwork: provisioning virtual machines from cmdb is overrated anyway
[2012-07-15 13:19:04 -0400] robwilkerson: yeah, that's why i'm explicitly including the apt recipe. that's the only way i found to get the updates.
[2012-07-15 13:19:25 -0400] tightwork: I did :-|
[2012-07-15 13:19:55 -0400] robwilkerson: looks like there may be some mysql 5.1 stuff laying around on a new 12.04 install.
[2012-07-15 13:20:23 -0400] robwilkerson: if i purge 5.1 and mysql-common, then reinstall mysql, i can start the machine manually.
[2012-07-15 13:20:35 -0400] robwilkerson: oy.
[2012-07-15 13:21:32 -0400] tightwork: kinda defeats the purpose of the whole thing :-/
[2012-07-15 13:21:51 -0400] tightwork: trying to get away from tedious installations of the progs I need to do work
[2012-07-15 13:23:36 -0400] robwilkerson: that it does.
[2012-07-15 13:24:00 -0400] robwilkerson: i was hoping i could do all of this with vetted, "standard" cookbooks.
[2012-07-15 13:24:44 -0400] tightwork: ah, my runlist was wrong. Some rec came before mysql trying to do something with mysql before installed
[2012-07-15 13:25:45 -0400] tightwork: overall I'm almost there, i can spin up vms into a role with knife. I even created a cookbook to build apache virtualhosts from a databag
[2012-07-15 13:27:37 -0400] robwilkerson: well, you're way ahead of me. :-)
[2012-07-15 13:31:47 -0400] tightwork: does the mysql_database action come from mysql cookbook?
[2012-07-15 13:32:05 -0400] tightwork: I have a cookbook that is attempting to create a database using mysql_database action
[2012-07-15 13:32:28 -0400] tightwork: err.. method might be better term
[2012-07-15 13:32:38 -0400] tightwork: mysql_database "create db" do ..
[2012-07-15 13:33:37 -0400] tightwork: "The mysql cookbook includes a LWRP for interacting with mysql database provided by ruby gem"
[2012-07-15 13:34:08 -0400] tightwork: well thats nice, I can cut out some of the raw commands using mysqladmin, though need it to work
[2012-07-15 13:34:26 -0400] robwilkerson: i'm using the "standard" opscode cookbook. https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql
[2012-07-15 13:36:13 -0400] robwilkerson: ok, so i have something isolated. if i ssh into the provisioned machine, `apt-get purge mysql-common` and then `apt-get install mysql-server`, the server starts nicely.
[2012-07-15 13:36:24 -0400] robwilkerson: now i just need to learn enough about chef to fix it. :-)
[2012-07-15 13:36:45 -0400] robwilkerson: still strikes me as strange given that it's a new 12.04 install (not an upgrade)
[2012-07-15 13:38:49 -0400] tightwork: oh cool, COOK-684 remove mysql_database LWRP
[2012-07-15 13:40:06 -0400] tightwork: prolly should update docs http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Opscode+LWRP+Resources
[2012-07-15 13:42:44 -0400] robwilkerson: not sure what i'm looking at here, but checking out the ticket first...
[2012-07-15 13:58:14 -0400] robwilkerson: tightwork: so how does this lwrp work with the mysql cookbook? trying to figure out how to glue it all together in my vagrant file and my 2 1 day of experience w/ chef isn't serving me well. :-)
[2012-07-15 14:00:48 -0400] tightwork: its been deprecated
[2012-07-15 14:00:55 -0400] tightwork: for whatever reason
[2012-07-15 14:01:07 -0400] robwilkerson: which one? mysql or database?
[2012-07-15 14:01:15 -0400] tightwork: mysql_database
[2012-07-15 14:01:35 -0400] robwilkerson: is that a cookbook or a method? i think i'm just confused now.
[2012-07-15 14:01:44 -0400] tightwork: its a method in the mysql cookbook
[2012-07-15 14:02:13 -0400] robwilkerson: what file is that in?
[2012-07-15 14:02:40 -0400] robwilkerson: or maybe it _was_ in one. I don't see it at all.
[2012-07-15 14:02:43 -0400] tightwork: providers/database.rb
[2012-07-15 14:02:50 -0400] tightwork: yeah its been removed
[2012-07-15 14:03:01 -0400] robwilkerson: ok, got it.
[2012-07-15 14:03:54 -0400] robwilkerson: any thoughts on next steps? i'm happy to do the legwork, just not sure where to begin.
[2012-07-15 14:04:05 -0400] tightwork: .. forced into the database cookbook eh
[2012-07-15 14:04:16 -0400] tightwork: there is a full cookbook to do this now ...
[2012-07-15 14:05:31 -0400] robwilkerson: so you're thinking i should just try to use the database cookbook?
[2012-07-15 14:06:22 -0400] robwilkerson: actually, that doesn't sound right. this looks like a cookbook for performing actions _on_ a database
[2012-07-15 14:06:35 -0400] robwilkerson: i just need to get the server running.
[2012-07-15 14:07:02 -0400] robwilkerson: sheesh. i didn't expect to burn my whole weekend doing this. :-)
[2012-07-15 14:13:03 -0400] tightwork: yep
[2012-07-15 14:13:27 -0400] tightwork: I wonder if any of this is actually making anything easier
[2012-07-15 14:13:54 -0400] tightwork: configs for the configs
[2012-07-15 14:13:56 -0400] robwilkerson: LOL if I'm any indication thenno.
[2012-07-15 14:14:28 -0400] robwilkerson: i really thought this would be pretty straightforward since the packages I need are already packaged into cookbooks.
[2012-07-15 14:15:45 -0400] tightwork: recently a sledge hammer just went through all the cookbooks afais, on top of ubuntu'isms in 12.04 and package name change
[2012-07-15 14:16:18 -0400] tightwork: the sledge hammer is each cookbook is now a repo, which is understandable
[2012-07-15 14:16:22 -0400] robwilkerson: i think that if, before chef ran apt-get install mysql-server, it ran apt-get remove mysql-common, my problem (for one) would be solved.
[2012-07-15 14:16:59 -0400] robwilkerson: i agree, but not if the mysql cookbook isn't self-contained to get a working mysql server up and running.
[2012-07-15 14:17:26 -0400] leifmadsen: you could run that in a custom cookbook first to use the package resource
[2012-07-15 14:17:35 -0400] leifmadsen: then you could action :remove the mysql-common
[2012-07-15 14:17:39 -0400] leifmadsen: before using mysql::server
[2012-07-15 14:18:14 -0400] robwilkerson: @leifmadsen: :-)
[2012-07-15 14:18:53 -0400] robwilkerson: i've been working through the chef+vagrant learning curve trying to get mysql installed and running. now you're caught up.
[2012-07-15 14:19:00 -0400] leifmadsen: is the main problem that mysql::server doesn't install for you?
[2012-07-15 14:19:03 -0400] leifmadsen: on ubuntu?
[2012-07-15 14:19:12 -0400] robwilkerson: y. 12.04
[2012-07-15 14:19:22 -0400] leifmadsen: huh, because I've installed it on 12.04....
[2012-07-15 14:19:26 -0400] leifmadsen: as of yesterday
[2012-07-15 14:19:30 -0400] robwilkerson: hmmm...
[2012-07-15 14:19:32 -0400] leifmadsen: chef 10.12.0
[2012-07-15 14:19:48 -0400] leifmadsen: mysql cookbook 1.2.6
[2012-07-15 14:19:50 -0400] robwilkerson: how do i get the chef version?
[2012-07-15 14:20:01 -0400] leifmadsen: probably something like chef-client -V
[2012-07-15 14:20:04 -0400] leifmadsen: or -v
[2012-07-15 14:20:16 -0400] leifmadsen: lowercase
[2012-07-15 14:20:24 -0400] robwilkerson: hmmm.
[2012-07-15 14:20:29 -0400] leifmadsen: -V is debug :)
[2012-07-15 14:20:54 -0400] robwilkerson: i don't see it at all, but it's working as part of my vagrantfile
[2012-07-15 14:21:05 -0400] leifmadsen: this is the order I have in my role for a provisioning server that uses mysql::server:
[2012-07-15 14:21:21 -0400] leifmadsen: apt, build-essential::default, database, mysql::client, mysql::server
[2012-07-15 14:21:26 -0400] leifmadsen: (then others
[2012-07-15 14:21:31 -0400] robwilkerson: i cloned the latest cookbook from github
[2012-07-15 14:21:47 -0400] robwilkerson: ok, so database before mysql.
[2012-07-15 14:21:59 -0400] leifmadsen: :q
[2012-07-15 14:22:11 -0400] leifmadsen: bah, stupid mouse-window focus
[2012-07-15 14:22:13 -0400] robwilkerson: technically, i was just installing wordpress (and it was packaging the includes), but I can change that part easily enough
[2012-07-15 14:22:51 -0400] leifmadsen: database cookbook is for interacting with mysql, so it's not really necessary to get mysql installed
[2012-07-15 14:23:07 -0400] leifmadsen: I use it for mysql_database resource
[2012-07-15 14:23:11 -0400] robwilkerson: yeah, in my case, mysql installs, but the service won't start.
[2012-07-15 14:23:17 -0400] leifmadsen: :q
[2012-07-15 14:23:24 -0400] leifmadsen: ... fuu
[2012-07-15 14:23:56 -0400] robwilkerson: yeah. spawning too many processes. it's been fun.
[2012-07-15 14:24:25 -0400] leifmadsen: sorry, gotta run, but that order seems to work for me. I'm using chef server, and installing cookbooks via knife from 'knife cookbook site install'
[2012-07-15 14:24:34 -0400] leifmadsen: hth even a little
[2012-07-15 14:24:41 -0400] robwilkerson: thanks,
[2012-07-15 16:33:07 -0400] z: where is mattray when you need him ;(
[2012-07-15 17:18:17 -0400] Bonkers: is there a way to log all commands being run? I seen nginx being sent reload and it processing it, but it's not working, and I can't tell what reload is really doing
[2012-07-15 17:33:17 -0400] z: Bonkers: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Configuration+Settings#ChefConfigurationSettings-logoutput
[2012-07-15 17:33:31 -0400] z: Bonkers: Adjusting that to :debug should give you all the information you require.
[2012-07-15 17:34:15 -0400] Bonkers: already in debug mode
[2012-07-15 17:34:23 -0400] Bonkers: does that mean it's not running anything?
[2012-07-15 17:35:05 -0400] z: Possibly. If it's taking any action, it should show up with :debug enabled
[2012-07-15 17:39:37 -0400] Bonkers: ok, thanks
[2012-07-15 17:39:43 -0400] Bonkers: time for more ruby spelunking
[2012-07-15 18:22:41 -0400] esad: hi guys - I'm not sure what is the relation of the chef repository and the hosted chef
[2012-07-15 18:22:53 -0400] esad: how do I propagate a change done in the hosted chef to my repo and vice-versa?
[2012-07-15 18:31:20 -0400] hoover_damm: esad, there's some rake tasks built into the chef-repo such as rake roles, rake upload_cookbooks
[2012-07-15 18:31:26 -0400] hoover_damm: esad, rake databag:upload_all
[2012-07-15 18:31:51 -0400] esad: I see. So if you're using hosted chef, are you supposed to forget the repo
[2012-07-15 18:31:52 -0400] hoover_damm: esad, the pattern suggested is to fork it and make your copy private and then customize it
[2012-07-15 18:31:58 -0400] hoover_damm: esad, nope
[2012-07-15 18:32:30 -0400] esad: but repo is then merely a mirror of state saved in the chef server
[2012-07-15 18:32:31 -0400] hoover_damm: esad, one part of Chef is the ability to control everything pretty much in git.  That means you make your roles locally and then upload them.
[2012-07-15 18:32:46 -0400] hoover_damm: right, the state isn't always what is what the repo is
[2012-07-15 18:32:48 -0400] esad: why isn't a chef server simply a wrapper around the repo?
[2012-07-15 18:32:53 -0400] hoover_damm: and sometimes you need to move your repo
[2012-07-15 18:32:54 -0400] hoover_damm: to another server
[2012-07-15 18:33:04 -0400] hoover_damm: so it makes the chore of moving from 1 chef server to another
[2012-07-15 18:33:06 -0400] hoover_damm: easy
[2012-07-15 18:33:21 -0400] hoover_damm: basically I said the same thing 2+years ago
[2012-07-15 18:33:23 -0400] hoover_damm: I was wrong
[2012-07-15 18:33:43 -0400] esad: I still don't see enough justification to grow this overly complex thing with indexer (!)
[2012-07-15 18:33:47 -0400] hoover_damm: what I got from chef-repo was the ability to code / update / know what is flat and what is round based off of what is locally
[2012-07-15 18:33:53 -0400] esad: I mean even you have thousands of nodes, a simple sqlite database can do the trick
[2012-07-15 18:33:58 -0400] esad: it's just node information
[2012-07-15 18:33:59 -0400] hoover_damm: nah
[2012-07-15 18:34:01 -0400] hoover_damm: sqlite is stupid
[2012-07-15 18:34:16 -0400] hoover_damm: it's great and easy low end, but the high end is scalability
[2012-07-15 18:34:27 -0400] hoover_damm: maybe sqlite4 will handle the scalability better
[2012-07-15 18:34:32 -0400] esad: so chef is optimized for use cases of 10,000 nodes?
[2012-07-15 18:34:44 -0400] hoover_damm: you can have > 10k nodes
[2012-07-15 18:35:19 -0400] esad: I'm just trying to understand why is it all made so complex
[2012-07-15 18:35:24 -0400] hoover_damm: most people don't see the benefits of search out of the box.  A lot of things will come to you over time
[2012-07-15 18:35:38 -0400] esad: ok, I'll keep an open mind :)
[2012-07-15 18:35:44 -0400] hoover_damm: shooting yourself in the foot prematurely by ignoring chef-server or other patterns
[2012-07-15 18:35:54 -0400] hoover_damm: is just another form of premature optimization
[2012-07-15 18:35:57 -0400] esad: so for now, I should first do stuff in the repo
[2012-07-15 18:36:01 -0400] esad: then upload to hosted chef server?
[2012-07-15 18:36:06 -0400] hoover_damm: correct
[2012-07-15 18:36:16 -0400] esad: ok, I'll try :)
[2012-07-15 18:36:43 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/riotgames/berkshelf is one option wo work with chef-repo
[2012-07-15 18:36:54 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian is another
[2012-07-15 18:37:00 -0400] hoover_damm: s/wo/to
[2012-07-15 18:37:37 -0400] hoover_damm: esad, there's a lot to take in so basically my suggestion is to keep an open mind, try most things a few times and get knife-essentials
[2012-07-15 18:38:22 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/jkeiser/knife-essentials
[2012-07-15 18:38:43 -0400] hoover_damm: it's a great addon to knife that helps you see a lot
[2012-07-15 18:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: sometimes my coworkers will update a role on the chef server without updating the git repo
[2012-07-15 18:39:14 -0400] hoover_damm: so i can do knife diff somerole.json and knife-essentials will diff the local vs remote
[2012-07-15 18:39:20 -0400] hoover_damm: and then you can determine the next steps to take
[2012-07-15 18:40:46 -0400] esad: thanks for the pointers
[2012-07-15 18:42:42 -0400] z: esad: may require a bit of twiddling but http://github.com/adamhjk/chef-jenkins
[2012-07-15 18:43:13 -0400] z: esad: its definitely possible to drive chef-server using Git and *mostly* avoid things like `knife node edit`
[2012-07-15 19:09:32 -0400] countdigi: i like the pattern where when you commit the hooks do the knife upload auto
[2012-07-15 19:22:45 -0400] knuckolls_: i made policies around knife with knife-santoku. all of the edit statements basically have a before callback that outputs "don't use these" and System.exit
[2012-07-15 19:31:52 -0400] esad: imho hosted chef should also host your git repo that has this post-commit hook of auto-syncing everything
[2012-07-15 19:32:11 -0400] esad: that's only logical solution :) everything else is patchwork
[2012-07-15 19:38:17 -0400] countdigi: esad: cool
[2012-07-15 19:39:28 -0400] countdigi: i love the idea of a central server for publishing and collecting but for god sakes dont let it be at the behest of when an admin wants to push and then forgets to commit
[2012-07-15 19:40:41 -0400] esad: the whole "code as documentation" promise is bit broken then :)
[2012-07-15 19:41:03 -0400] hoover_damm: esad, git hook to a CI system that pushes your code live if your tests pass
[2012-07-15 19:41:20 -0400] hoover_damm: esad, that's the proper setup you want... so you really don't want to push directly
[2012-07-15 19:41:29 -0400] hoover_damm: failure is normal
[2012-07-15 19:41:38 -0400] hoover_damm: so you want to be able to test failure / protect against it
[2012-07-15 19:41:38 -0400] esad: hoover_damm: that's patchwork :) I could also write a bash script that replaces chef :) I'm just ranting about what should the ideal setup be
[2012-07-15 20:02:08 -0400] hoover_damm: esad, ideal setups often require a lot of sado mashocist tendancies
[2012-07-15 20:02:23 -0400] esad: :)
[2012-07-15 20:02:25 -0400] hoover_damm: esad, because they are often not ideal setups and usually require a lot of painful work to get there
[2012-07-15 20:02:33 -0400] esad: I'd say it's more OCD than SM
[2012-07-15 20:02:49 -0400] hoover_damm: OCD and SM are easy to get confused about
[2012-07-15 20:02:56 -0400] hoover_damm: most Sysadmins have some level of OCD
[2012-07-15 20:03:18 -0400] hoover_damm: but there's a difference between putting together a system and maintaining it... then trying to reinvent the wheel by creating a new way to maintain your systems
[2012-07-15 20:14:31 -0400] geekbri: Within a provider, if I'm calling a resource, how would I pass on to my provider if that resource used "updated_by_last_action" ?
[2012-07-15 22:21:21 -0400] esad: guys, please help. I've created a new client, downloaded the "api key", saved it in ~/.chef/me.pem
[2012-07-15 22:21:45 -0400] esad: and referenced it in client_key in the knife config
[2012-07-15 22:21:55 -0400] esad: yet knife reports Failed to authenticate
[2012-07-15 22:24:36 -0400] masterkorp: http://i.imgur.com/uv20x.gif
[2012-07-15 22:24:43 -0400] masterkorp: oh sorry
[2012-07-15 22:24:51 -0400] esad: hahahahahha
[2012-07-15 22:24:52 -0400] esad: There is an open Hosted Chef bug that user names and client names cannot be the same
[2012-07-15 22:33:41 -0400] esad: this can't be, really?
[2012-07-15 22:33:54 -0400] esad: you cannot chose a nodename that is same as any of the hosted chef usernames?
[2012-07-15 22:35:08 -0400] ashb: no idea - first question is why do you want to?
[2012-07-15 22:36:04 -0400] ashb: second: have you searched on tickets.opscode.com for a bug about it?
[2012-07-15 22:38:27 -0400] esad: yes but this is craziest bug I've ever seen
[2012-07-15 22:38:44 -0400] esad: I cannot have a client with same name of any user on the hosted chef?
[2012-07-15 22:38:53 -0400] esad: not only _mine_ users, but _all_ usernames from all organizations
[2012-07-15 22:39:07 -0400] esad: did they write this in qbasic or what
[2012-07-15 22:39:36 -0400] ashb: client, node or user?
[2012-07-15 22:39:42 -0400] ashb: they are three different things
[2012-07-15 22:39:59 -0400] esad: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2240
[2012-07-15 22:40:13 -0400] esad: references from http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Common+Errors
[2012-07-15 22:41:19 -0400] ashb: and the PL tickets can't be viewed. fun
[2012-07-15 23:11:31 -0400] hoover_damm: hrm, anyone automated setting bios setting in chef?
[2012-07-15 23:11:55 -0400] hoover_damm: I really loathe ssh'ing into to the serial console to tune my bios's ... I guess I could do this with IPMI i bet
[2012-07-15 23:12:24 -0400] Babar: most manufacturers will have bios setting tools which are console based
[2012-07-15 23:12:39 -0400] Babar: but often they're heavy. So running them on each run might be a huge waste
[2012-07-15 23:13:27 -0400] hoover_damm: it's kind of annoying but it's a huge deal to disable HT and such
[2012-07-15 23:15:20 -0400] hoover_damm: really? can you point me to where AMI hides theirs?
[2012-07-15 23:20:39 -0400] esad: where do you usually store your aws credentials necessary for automating aws stuff (attaching volumes etc.)
[2012-07-15 23:20:44 -0400] esad: in a data bag?
[2012-07-15 23:20:53 -0400] esad: how would I load a data bag item in knife.rb config?
[2012-07-15 23:21:24 -0400] hoover_damm: environment
[2012-07-15 23:23:05 -0400] hoover_damm: esad, https://www.refheap.com/paste/3625
[2012-07-15 23:23:12 -0400] hoover_damm: esad, that's how we do our knife.rb
[2012-07-15 23:23:31 -0400] esad: I thought that's what databags are for
[2012-07-15 23:23:43 -0400] hoover_damm: esad, we have multiple aws accounts that tie to multiple environments
[2012-07-15 23:24:03 -0400] hoover_damm: so it's just more flexible to tie it to the env vars... and ec2 tools expect this anyway
[2012-07-15 23:24:06 -0400] hoover_damm: so I kinda use both
[2012-07-15 23:24:20 -0400] hoover_damm: ec2 api / elb / .. and knife
[2012-07-15 23:24:33 -0400] hoover_damm: knife is just handy for some stuff but it's just too light for what we do
[2012-07-15 23:24:53 -0400] esad: I see
[2012-07-15 23:25:01 -0400] esad: I'm just wondering why at the bottom of knife.rb
[2012-07-15 23:25:02 -0400] hoover_damm: csshx to 30 instances works ... but what happens when you need to run chef-client on 350 instances?
[2012-07-15 23:25:04 -0400] esad: one cannot do data_bag_item
[2012-07-15 23:25:17 -0400] hoover_damm: it could
[2012-07-15 23:25:27 -0400] esad: it just doesn't return anything sane
[2012-07-15 23:25:29 -0400] hoover_damm: it might not be smart enough to use the right credentials
[2012-07-15 23:25:41 -0400] hoover_damm: so you might have to use ruby code to load it and not alias's
[2012-07-15 23:26:26 -0400] joekinsella: knife ec2 server create is failing for me with: Unable to locate package libruby-extras
[2012-07-15 23:26:38 -0400] hoover_damm: Chef::REST.new(Chef::Config[:chef_server_url]).get_rest("data/#{data_bag}/#{name}")
[2012-07-15 23:26:39 -0400] esad: it's also weird that you can put anything as a line in knife.rb and not get syntax error
[2012-07-15 23:26:44 -0400] hoover_damm: ^^ esad
[2012-07-15 23:26:45 -0400] esad: try foobarbaz
[2012-07-15 23:27:14 -0400] hoover_damm: esad, maybe that alone could work... but i doubt it's that easy
[2012-07-15 23:29:40 -0400] hoover_damm: because that's basically what it's doing and provided the right api key is set when that runs
[2012-07-15 23:29:43 -0400] hoover_damm: should work
[2012-07-15 23:29:50 -0400] hoover_damm: Chef::REST.new(Chef::Config[:chef_server_url]).get_rest("data/sensu/config")
[2012-07-15 23:30:14 -0400] hoover_damm: when in doubt the source can give you interesting answers to solve your problems that may not be right
[2012-07-15 23:30:17 -0400] hoover_damm: but they're fun
[2012-07-15 23:30:54 -0400] esad: Chef::DataBagItem.load('aws','main') works
[2012-07-15 23:31:20 -0400] hoover_damm: not as neat
[2012-07-15 23:31:31 -0400] joekinsella: ah, found my issue. had to add -d ubuntu12.04-gems.
[2012-07-15 23:31:34 -0400] esad: Chef::REST.new is totally intransparent
[2012-07-15 23:31:35 -0400] hoover_damm: basically you'll end up using api tools from time to time, or elb
[2012-07-15 23:31:46 -0400] esad: I shouldn't know details of the api to get a databag item
[2012-07-15 23:31:49 -0400] hoover_damm: so having all that stuf setup where you deal with it
[2012-07-15 23:31:49 -0400] esad: it's wrong level of abstraction
[2012-07-15 23:31:50 -0400] hoover_damm: is nice
[2012-07-15 23:32:12 -0400] hoover_damm: to some
[2012-07-15 23:32:22 -0400] esad: that is an objective observation
[2012-07-15 23:32:28 -0400] esad: not a matter of personal taste
[2012-07-15 23:32:43 -0400] hoover_damm: everything is a matter of taste
[2012-07-15 23:32:53 -0400] esad: imagine if they exposed paths on their filesystems where databags were kept
[2012-07-15 23:33:00 -0400] esad: that's breaking of abstraction -> client should care about that
[2012-07-15 23:33:07 -0400] hoover_damm: gem install knife-essentials
[2012-07-15 23:33:09 -0400] hoover_damm: knife show
[2012-07-15 23:33:11 -0400] Bonkers: huh? aws creds definitey belong in a data bag
[2012-07-15 23:33:20 -0400] esad: I just realized something
[2012-07-15 23:33:36 -0400] Bonkers: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/aws
[2012-07-15 23:33:43 -0400] esad: whole chef server could be replaced by a nfs share or something similar :)
[2012-07-15 23:34:11 -0400] hoover_damm: perhaps
[2012-07-15 23:34:17 -0400] hoover_damm: you should explore that
[2012-07-15 23:35:10 -0400] hoover_damm: i've always wanted to replace chef-server with a box of swizzel sticks
[2012-07-15 23:35:21 -0400] hoover_damm: ... it just never worked that way
[2012-07-15 23:36:09 -0400] Bonkers: what's wrong with chef-server as it is?
[2012-07-15 23:37:07 -0400] esad: the disparity between your git repo and the server state
[2012-07-15 23:38:15 -0400] esad: everyone coming to chef with sane viewpoint is confused by that
[2012-07-15 23:38:16 -0400] esad: see http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2012-07/msg00043.html
[2012-07-15 23:43:12 -0400] esad: what is the difference between databags and role attributes?
[2012-07-15 23:43:32 -0400] esad: some people are even scoping data bags by role
[2012-07-15 23:44:10 -0400] PRK_nz: If I have a template file for a specific host, e.g. in /templates/host-somehost/somefile, does there have to be a default version? Or if it's missing will that mean that only that host will get the file?
[2012-07-15 23:48:54 -0400] ashb: template?
[2012-07-15 23:48:54 -0400] bawt: template is in templates
[2012-07-15 23:48:57 -0400] ashb: templates?
[2012-07-15 23:48:57 -0400] bawt: templates is http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Templates
[2012-07-15 23:49:17 -0400] ashb: PRK_nz: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Templates#Templates-TemplateLocationSpecificity
[2012-07-15 23:56:07 -0400] PRK_nz: yep, I'm ok with that, but I only want a file to be templated on a specific host, with no default, is that ok? Reading the wiki didn't seem to answer my question :)
[2012-07-15 23:57:02 -0400] PRK_nz: so if my recipe tries to template a file with no matching folder, e.g. host-example, and no file in default, will it fail?
[2012-07-15 23:57:58 -0400] Babar: yes
[2012-07-15 23:58:12 -0400] Babar: hum, I mean. It failed last time I tried :)
[2012-07-15 23:58:44 -0400] PRK_nz: ok, I'll let you know what I find ;)
[2012-07-15 23:59:45 -0400] PRK_nz: also, does anyone have any recommended IDE's for Chef on Linux? I'm trying RubyMine atm and just wondered if there are any other good ones?
