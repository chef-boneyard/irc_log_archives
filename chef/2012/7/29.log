[2012-07-29 03:11:49 -0400] tigris_: is it possible to use custom definitions and libraries inside of deploy callbacks such as before_migrate?
[2012-07-29 03:12:33 -0400] tigris_: i have moved all my before_migrate code into a library so more than before_migrate can use it, it works fine in other recipes, but inside a before_migrate block it just says undefined method
[2012-07-29 03:21:39 -0400] ssd7: hrmm
[2012-07-29 03:24:42 -0400] tigris_: actually, i used to have an rbenv_script definition call in there that worked fine, so custom definitions must work, it must be specific to libraries
[2012-07-29 03:25:53 -0400] ssd7: tigris_: Can you show me a small example?
[2012-07-29 03:26:26 -0400] tigris_: ssd7: i will try and isolate it to confirm, will let you know
[2012-07-29 04:00:11 -0400] tigris_: ssd7: https://github.com/tigris/chef-deploy-test
[2012-07-29 04:00:44 -0400] tigris_: oops, i forgot to git add the recipes... 1 minute
[2012-07-29 04:02:24 -0400] tigris_: ssd7: ready to go
[2012-07-29 04:16:54 -0400] coredump|br: Sooo am I doing something wrong or are some node attributes that aren't accessible from a template? I am trying to send node[:chef_environment] as a template variable but it is empty
[2012-07-29 04:17:32 -0400] retr0h: coredump|br: node.chef_environment
[2012-07-29 04:17:54 -0400] coredump|br: why not the other form?
[2012-07-29 04:19:48 -0400] retr0h: coredump|br: I believe b/c it is a method vs an attribute like other things... but I am sure someone with more knowledge can correct me
[2012-07-29 04:20:19 -0400] coredump|br: oh.. it works...
[2012-07-29 04:20:28 -0400] coredump|br: well, that will change the way I use chef from now on
[2012-07-29 04:22:22 -0400] coredump|br: I have this sensation that I lost some memo about that :P
[2012-07-29 04:22:37 -0400] retr0h: coredump|br: :)
[2012-07-29 06:06:05 -0400] Gurpartap: How is this cookbook of any use? https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-client
[2012-07-29 06:06:22 -0400] Gurpartap: Since it's already going to be run by a chef installation
[2012-07-29 06:19:29 -0400] tigris_: Gurpartap: run it with chef-solo?
[2012-07-29 06:19:56 -0400] Gurpartap: tigris_: won't gem install chef give me chef-solo as well as chef-client already?
[2012-07-29 06:20:09 -0400] Gurpartap: there is probably a proper use of this cookbook, that i want to realize
[2012-07-29 06:50:42 -0400] tigris_: ssd7: had any thoughts on that library in deploy callback issue?
[2012-07-29 07:32:07 -0400] ssd7: tigris_: If your still around, sorry I missed some scroll back because of some scrollback. Happy to look at whatever you found though
[2012-07-29 07:38:15 -0400] tigris_: ssd7: no worries, i made a simple repo showing my issue https://github.com/tigris/chef-deploy-test
[2012-07-29 08:01:50 -0400] Gurpartap: Is manage.opscode.com portal being very slow, a known issue with the opscode team?
[2012-07-29 08:09:55 -0400] tigris_: can you create services inside a definition? i can only get it semi-working, e.g. it enables the service in /etc/rc*.d but later in the recipe i can't reload that service
[2012-07-29 08:10:53 -0400] tigris_: service[test-service] does not support :reload.... even though it clearly has `supports :reload => true`
[2012-07-29 08:25:22 -0400] BryanWB_: ohai chefs!
[2012-07-29 09:09:22 -0400] ssd7: tigris_: Sorry I dropped out again.  Crappy comcast unforutnately.  However, you might want to try fully referencing the function here: https://github.com/tigris/chef-deploy-test/blob/master/chef/main/recipes/default.rb#L18
[2012-07-29 09:09:33 -0400] ssd7: That is, try Helpers::library_test
[2012-07-29 09:10:24 -0400] ssd7: BryanWB_: Ohai!
[2012-07-29 09:10:42 -0400] BryanWB_: ssd7: hey dude!
[2012-07-29 09:11:31 -0400] ssd7: How goes it?
[2012-07-29 09:18:50 -0400] BryanWB_: busy, working on the tomcat & jboss ckbks again
[2012-07-29 09:19:42 -0400] ssd7: Ahh, cool
[2012-07-29 11:23:35 -0400] tigris_: i don't suppose anyone can follow up on ssd7's solution attempt for https://github.com/tigris/chef-deploy-test ? he suggested i try and use the fully qualified library method Helpers::library_test, but that didn't work
[2012-07-29 13:14:11 -0400] railsraider_: hi, i wanna add some node attributes that i can override on nodes node just in recipe and attributes file, not sure exactly how to do it, for example i need the firewall ports attributes to be node attributes that i can change on the node level from the webui
[2012-07-29 13:21:48 -0400] railsraider_: i have this in a template as variable (it is set to default on the attributes of the firewall cookbook)     :open_tcp_ports     => node['arno-iptables-firewall'][:open_tcp_ports]
[2012-07-29 13:21:57 -0400] railsraider_: how do i get this t o be a node attribute
[2012-07-29 13:23:03 -0400] railsraider_: do i just do node.set instead of the default in the attributes file?
[2012-07-29 13:27:56 -0400] rayrod2030: what is the current best practice for running a rails application using the omnibus installer?
[2012-07-29 13:28:25 -0400] rayrod2030: in particular I'm trying to use the graylog2 cookbook with ubuntu 10.04 and ominbus.
[2012-07-29 13:32:17 -0400] BryanWB_: rayrod2030: why u like graylog2?
[2012-07-29 13:32:34 -0400] BryanWB_: am curious as i have been very happy w/ kibana + logstash
[2012-07-29 13:32:38 -0400] rayrod2030: I've used it before. thought about switching to log stash though
[2012-07-29 13:32:40 -0400] BryanWB_: never tried graylog2
[2012-07-29 13:32:50 -0400] rayrod2030: yeah I hear people are loving log stash and kibana.
[2012-07-29 13:32:54 -0400] BryanWB_: i m
[2012-07-29 13:33:09 -0400] rayrod2030: I still need to know the best practice for getting rails apps working with omnibus embedded ruby.
[2012-07-29 13:33:19 -0400] rayrod2030: kibana is php?
[2012-07-29 13:33:27 -0400] BryanWB_: yeah, but not much
[2012-07-29 13:33:34 -0400] BryanWB_: it is mostly twitter bootstrap
[2012-07-29 13:33:46 -0400] rayrod2030: does log stash accept gelf format?
[2012-07-29 13:33:51 -0400] BryanWB_: i believe so
[2012-07-29 13:33:53 -0400] rayrod2030: because I'm using gelf4j from tomcat.
[2012-07-29 13:38:59 -0400] railsraider_: i don't get how to set a node attributes, i tried to do this on the attributes default.rb  set['arno-iptables-firewall'][:open_tcp_ports= "" but when i upload the cookbook and refresh the node i don't see the attribute in the chef-webui edit node
[2012-07-29 13:40:16 -0400] BryanWB_: whoah, gelf4j? what is the advantage of using that over log4j or slf4j?
[2012-07-29 13:40:23 -0400] BryanWB_: rayrod2030: ^^
[2012-07-29 13:40:35 -0400] BryanWB_: i m just about to start managing my tomcat logs w/ logstash
[2012-07-29 13:43:59 -0400] rayrod2030: I just use gelf4j to send messages pre formatted to gray log in it's native format.
[2012-07-29 13:44:17 -0400] rayrod2030: but I guess that's the beauty of log stash is that you format however you want using their DSL
[2012-07-29 13:44:32 -0400] rayrod2030: just a gelf log4j appender
[2012-07-29 13:50:23 -0400] rayrod2030: BryanWB_: http://logstash.net/docs/1.1.1/inputs/gelf
[2012-07-29 14:06:16 -0400] BryanWB_: is there any way to get foodcritic to ignore one rule?
[2012-07-29 14:10:17 -0400] tigris_: anyone know how to action services inside deploy callbacks? e.g. https://gist.github.com/d896f0a4a9edaab36c0d
[2012-07-29 14:10:50 -0400] tigris_: i am having terrible times trying to get normal chef code to work inside the deploy callbacks, third different issue i've found with it now
[2012-07-29 14:11:23 -0400] BryanWB_: tigris_: have u tried notifies?
[2012-07-29 14:11:37 -0400] BryanWB_: tigris_: how is your friend Euphrates these days btw?
[2012-07-29 14:25:43 -0400] tigris_: negative on that BryanWB_... gives "NameError: Cannot find a resource for notifies"
[2012-07-29 14:26:10 -0400] tigris_: it almost seems like you can access very little of your current chef run inside the deploy callbacks
[2012-07-29 14:37:11 -0400] Gurpartap: using the chef-client cookbook, my server_url override never really works, while other overrides work. i saw that the template that uses it, prefers Chef::Config[:chef_server_url] if it exists.
[2012-07-29 14:37:23 -0400] Gurpartap:  anyone knows a fix?
[2012-07-29 14:44:35 -0400] railsraider_: can i do this in override attributes? "users::admin" => { "ssh_key" => "dfkjhdfkjhdk"}
[2012-07-29 18:18:55 -0400] ranjibd: anybody using the nagios cookbook against centos6?
[2012-07-29 19:02:22 -0400] ssd7: Ohai Chefs
[2012-07-29 19:37:54 -0400] ranjibd_: ssd7, ohai
[2012-07-29 19:39:06 -0400] ssd7: Heya ranjibd_
[2012-07-29 19:45:50 -0400] ranjibd_: facing loads of ssl_connect errors from a centos 6 box against hosted chef..
[2012-07-29 19:46:27 -0400] ssd7: ranjibd_: Can you post an example?
[2012-07-29 19:48:12 -0400] ranjibd_: ssd7,  http://pastebin.com/N9K8iUy6
[2012-07-29 19:52:35 -0400] ssd7: What if you try something like: openssl s_client -connect api.opscode.com:443
[2012-07-29 19:54:27 -0400] ssd7: Not seeing anything in our monitoring that would indicate any sort of widespread problem.
[2012-07-29 19:54:52 -0400] ranjibd_: tried that earlier.. its saying connected
[2012-07-29 19:55:29 -0400] ranjibd_: chef-client runs happening only after 5/6 attempts.. otherwise its giving the ssl error
[2012-07-29 20:00:11 -0400] hoover_damm: ranjibd_, what os?
[2012-07-29 20:00:13 -0400] hoover_damm: distro?
[2012-07-29 20:00:22 -0400] hoover_damm: ranjibd_, seems more like an ssl error
[2012-07-29 20:00:25 -0400] hoover_damm: then an hosted error
[2012-07-29 20:00:49 -0400] hoover_damm: ranjibd_, 12.04?
[2012-07-29 20:00:56 -0400] hoover_damm: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/+bug/965371
[2012-07-29 20:01:45 -0400] hoover_damm: ahh centos heh
[2012-07-29 20:01:55 -0400] hoover_damm: does it not support tls 1.1?
[2012-07-29 20:02:35 -0400] hoover_damm: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=820686
[2012-07-29 20:02:38 -0400] hoover_damm: interesting
[2012-07-29 20:03:01 -0400] hoover_damm: that actually maybe more relevent ranjibd_
[2012-07-29 20:16:32 -0400] ranjibd_: hoover_damm, centos 6
[2012-07-29 20:16:51 -0400] hoover_damm: ranjibd_, well that last bug maybe relevent...
[2012-07-29 20:17:05 -0400] hoover_damm: ranjibd_, looks like openssl isn't falling back properly and it affected all distros
[2012-07-29 20:17:39 -0400] ranjibd_: hoover_damm, im pretty sure its the something to do with the box itself..
[2012-07-29 20:17:41 -0400] ranjibd_: yes
[2012-07-29 20:18:02 -0400] hoover_damm: so you can connect but it doesn't always fall back
[2012-07-29 20:18:07 -0400] ranjibd_: wondering why its not happening consistently
[2012-07-29 20:18:32 -0400] hoover_damm: i don't have any boxes affected aparently so I can't say
[2012-07-29 20:21:37 -0400] ranjibd_: yes.. we have a CI to test the community cookbooks against Centos, ubuntu.. trying to fix a bunch of issues ..
[2012-07-29 20:22:24 -0400] ranjibd_: the init.d script for nagios-nrpe-server that comes with nagios cookbook, should pass -p pidfile in the status call... it failing in our CI
[2012-07-29 20:23:13 -0400] ranjibd_: anyway.. time to drink some irish whiskey.. and call it a day.. its sunday night after all :-)
[2012-07-29 22:31:24 -0400] Gurpartap: anyone uses chef-client cookbook?
[2012-07-29 22:32:01 -0400] Gurpartap: it is not accepting my server_url override from the json. can someone help troubleshoot this?
[2012-07-29 23:00:55 -0400] ssd7: Gurpartap: I can try to help if you are still around
[2012-07-29 23:02:52 -0400] Gurpartap: ssd7: thanks. i'm still on it without success
[2012-07-29 23:04:25 -0400] Gurpartap: let me gist
[2012-07-29 23:04:28 -0400] ssd7: Gurpartap: So when you say "the json" what are you refering to?  Some role json?  The json representation for the node itself?  If you can post a small example of what you have tried somewhere that would be most helpful
[2012-07-29 23:04:34 -0400] ssd7: Gurpartap: Great, thanks :)
[2012-07-29 23:12:06 -0400] Gurpartap: ssd7: https://gist.github.com/3202464
[2012-07-29 23:12:27 -0400] Gurpartap: ssd7: those are the steps i followed on a fresh ec2 instance
[2012-07-29 23:14:02 -0400] Gurpartap: ssd7: also: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-client/blob/master/templates/default/client.rb.erb#L14
[2012-07-29 23:15:17 -0400] ssd7: Gurpartap: Yes, I think your chef-solo.json is a bit off
[2012-07-29 23:15:20 -0400] ssd7: one sec
[2012-07-29 23:17:09 -0400] ssd7: Try something like this: https://gist.github.com/3202505
[2012-07-29 23:18:33 -0400] ssd7: Note however, that knife-bootstrap/knife-ec2 should generally take care of all of this initial bootstrap for you.  And that you should generally avoid setting attribute on the node itself and rather use a role.
[2012-07-29 23:18:46 -0400] ssd7: But, I don't know the details of your use case, that is just general advice.
[2012-07-29 23:21:49 -0400] Gurpartap: ssd7: i'm operating this programmatically (i tried Knife programmatically; it worked well, but felt hackish)
[2012-07-29 23:22:39 -0400] Gurpartap: ok, I'll use a role
[2012-07-29 23:23:20 -0400] ssd7: Yeah, using a role is really the key advice there, setting attributes on node's directly is a path to many lost debugging hours
[2012-07-29 23:25:14 -0400] Gurpartap: i also tried it with a role (https://gist.github.com/3202537)
[2012-07-29 23:26:19 -0400] Gurpartap: ssd7: the json with normal doesn't work either
[2012-07-29 23:27:58 -0400] Gurpartap: this time, even validation_client_name did not get set
[2012-07-29 23:28:02 -0400] Gurpartap: which earlier did work
[2012-07-29 23:28:32 -0400] Gurpartap: i guess the problem is with the template at <% if Chef::Config.has_key?(:chef_server_url) -%>
[2012-07-29 23:28:38 -0400] Gurpartap: i wonder how one sets that value
[2012-07-29 23:28:59 -0400] Gurpartap: which chef-client has already set a default for (!)
[2012-07-29 23:29:06 -0400] Gurpartap: chef-client cookbook*
[2012-07-29 23:29:17 -0400] ssd7: sigh
[2012-07-29 23:29:21 -0400] ssd7: yeah, I think you're right
[2012-07-29 23:30:54 -0400] Gurpartap: is there a way around it? or is it a bug?
[2012-07-29 23:31:14 -0400] ssd7: I think you can give chef-solo a config file with the -c argument.  The config file should have "chef_server_url 'http://blahblab'"
[2012-07-29 23:31:17 -0400] ssd7: or
[2012-07-29 23:31:37 -0400] ssd7: "chef_server_url nil" and then your attr should take effect
[2012-07-29 23:32:09 -0400] ssd7: However, that does seem like a bug in the cookbook since it would make it hard to ever CHANGE the server using the cookbook since the config value will always be set
[2012-07-29 23:37:43 -0400] Gurpartap: ssd7: that worked. phew
[2012-07-29 23:39:13 -0400] ssd7: Gurpartap: cool
[2012-07-29 23:51:14 -0400] Gurpartap: ssd7: setting it to nil won't help though. since it's checking for existing of key, and not value
[2012-07-29 23:51:19 -0400] Gurpartap: dang
[2012-07-29 23:51:42 -0400] Gurpartap: it would have to set the server url in the solo config, unless this bug is fixed. i'll report it on github
[2012-07-29 23:51:50 -0400] ssd7: Gurpartap: Already done: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1506
[2012-07-29 23:51:56 -0400] Gurpartap: XD
[2012-07-29 23:52:15 -0400] Gurpartap: cool
[2012-07-29 23:53:40 -0400] Gurpartap: ssd7: when is s3.amazonaws.com/chef-solo/bootstrap-latest.tar.gz repackaged, if you know?
[2012-07-29 23:55:11 -0400] Gurpartap: got to leave until a few minutes
[2012-07-29 23:55:13 -0400] Gurpartap: bbl
[2012-07-29 23:55:16 -0400] ssd7: Gurpartap: Unfortunately I don't have anything more than "we do it occasionally"
[2012-07-29 23:55:19 -0400] Gurpartap: thanks again ssd7 !
[2012-07-29 23:55:22 -0400] ssd7: np
[2012-07-29 23:55:26 -0400] Gurpartap: ah
[2012-07-29 23:55:30 -0400] Gurpartap: cheers
