[2012-07-01 00:05:48 -0400] gmcinnes1: hi all.  I'm following the instructions here: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installing+Chef+Server+on+Debian+or+Ubuntu+using+Packages  but the merb services aren't starting.  They're complaining about  Gem::UserInteraction
[2012-07-01 00:09:02 -0400] gmcinnes1: Looks like it's this bug: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2138
[2012-07-01 00:09:54 -0400] gmcinnes1: but Debian squeeze comes with rubygems 1.6.2, so it will be a bit of a pain to change
[2012-07-01 00:16:03 -0400] z: gmcinnes1: Have you thought about Omnibus?
[2012-07-01 00:16:06 -0400] z: gmcinnes1: http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/
[2012-07-01 00:16:54 -0400] gmcinnes1: ah. unfortunately its le chef server I'm talking about.   I use omnibus for the client already, and it's rad. AFAIK the omnibus installer for server isn't out yet.
[2012-07-01 00:17:31 -0400] z: I think I saw holoway saying it was in Beta, but I'm not sure if that is 'Public Beta' or 'Private Beta'.
[2012-07-01 00:18:19 -0400] gmcinnes1: I asked a few days ago and someone told me it wasn't released. I didn't investigate further.  I'll go look in the repo
[2012-07-01 00:18:56 -0400] z: I would <3 very much if it was in the repo
[2012-07-01 00:19:06 -0400] z: as I could really use it myself :)
[2012-07-01 00:25:25 -0400] jelder_: anyone from opscode's ops team around?
[2012-07-01 00:25:40 -0400] karwash: yeah, i'm having issues with hosted chef
[2012-07-01 00:26:14 -0400] karwash: getting Response:  Merb::ControllerExceptions::Forbidden
[2012-07-01 00:26:31 -0400] karwash: when trying to remove clients or node objects with knife
[2012-07-01 00:26:44 -0400] karwash: was working fine up until about 10 minutes ago
[2012-07-01 00:26:53 -0400] jelder_: i'm getting timeouts, connection reset errors, likely due to the massive aws us-east-1 power outage yesterday
[2012-07-01 00:27:07 -0400] jelder_: which is great timing since apparently tonight's leap second is going to cause problems
[2012-07-01 00:27:10 -0400] karwash: yeah, i'm living through that too ;)
[2012-07-01 00:30:41 -0400] jelder_: if anyone should be able to spin up new infrastructure in a new datacenter, it's opscode
[2012-07-01 00:33:13 -0400] jtimberman: jelder_: we do not run any production infrastructure for Hosted Chef in Amazon EC2.
[2012-07-01 00:33:47 -0400] jelder_: jtimberman: good to know. i'm getting lots of timeouts, from different locations
[2012-07-01 00:34:07 -0400] renchap: there is a but with the leap second
[2012-07-01 00:34:14 -0400] renchap: it seems that all our java apps are down
[2012-07-01 00:34:18 -0400] renchap: + mcollective
[2012-07-01 00:35:17 -0400] renchap: cf ##infra-talk
[2012-07-01 00:36:56 -0400] jelder_: jtimberman: so are you guys in an unrelated outage then?
[2012-07-01 00:37:54 -0400] jtimberman: jelder_: I don't know.
[2012-07-01 00:38:17 -0400] renchap: leap second bug ?
[2012-07-01 00:38:18 -0400] renchap: as i said
[2012-07-01 00:38:23 -0400] renchap: all our java stuff is currently down
[2012-07-01 00:38:28 -0400] renchap: as well as for a lot of people
[2012-07-01 00:38:38 -0400] jessicab: jelder_: someone in ops is already looking into it, but i dont know whats going on or anything
[2012-07-01 00:39:28 -0400] renchap: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second this just occured
[2012-07-01 00:39:38 -0400] renchap: and made a lot of things crash
[2012-07-01 00:39:51 -0400] renchap: like, some linux kernels, jvms, and others
[2012-07-01 00:40:29 -0400] Randm: yay
[2012-07-01 00:53:53 -0400] doomviking: mmm. timeouts and 500's.
[2012-07-01 00:54:40 -0400] dcampano: chef-client is pegging a few of my systems since the leap second
[2012-07-01 00:54:46 -0400] dcampano: restarting doesn't help
[2012-07-01 00:55:16 -0400] bdha: dcampano: Evidently you have to reboot the host to clear the leapsec bug.
[2012-07-01 00:55:33 -0400] doomviking: what is this, Windows?
[2012-07-01 00:55:40 -0400] doomviking: ;)
[2012-07-01 00:55:41 -0400] bdha: More like, what is this, Y2k?
[2012-07-01 00:56:36 -0400] Randm: mmm, consumer hardware
[2012-07-01 00:57:10 -0400] bdha: ?
[2012-07-01 00:57:24 -0400] Randm: the rebooting because of the leap secondthing
[2012-07-01 00:57:37 -0400] dcampano: bdha: k, ill give that a try in a bit
[2012-07-01 00:58:00 -0400] renchap: i confirm that the reboot fixes things
[2012-07-01 01:01:24 -0400] silk1: also
[2012-07-01 01:01:37 -0400] silk1: the issue seems more pronounced with java apps
[2012-07-01 01:01:48 -0400] Randm: they have their own timezone database that you might've never updated
[2012-07-01 01:01:58 -0400] silk1: but most of our vms running ntp are getting reboots
[2012-07-01 01:02:16 -0400] Randm: being on 1.6.0_<32?
[2012-07-01 01:02:28 -0400] Randm: or openjdk with the os
[2012-07-01 01:03:00 -0400] doomviking: if only that would fix timeouts to the api...
[2012-07-01 01:04:06 -0400] bdha: EC2 API?
[2012-07-01 01:04:30 -0400] doomviking: opscode
[2012-07-01 01:04:31 -0400] bdha: aha
[2012-07-01 01:04:59 -0400] hoover_damm: sorry
[2012-07-01 01:05:03 -0400] hoover_damm: :(
[2012-07-01 01:05:04 -0400] hoover_damm: it's prolly my fault
[2012-07-01 01:05:13 -0400] hoover_damm: at once
[2012-07-01 01:05:30 -0400] doomviking: cool
[2012-07-01 01:05:44 -0400] hoover_damm: so i'm guessing it's like a lot of client registrations at once
[2012-07-01 01:05:46 -0400] doomviking: I'll live
[2012-07-01 01:13:39 -0400] hoover_damm: [Sun, 01 Jul 2012 01:13:11 +0000] INFO: HTTP Request Returned 500 Internal Server Error: Failed to update groups in client creation
[2012-07-01 01:13:42 -0400] hoover_damm: spookey
[2012-07-01 01:19:32 -0400] silk: opscode api responses for us are at the moment ~32 seconds
[2012-07-01 01:20:36 -0400] doomviking: yeah. its bork.
[2012-07-01 01:20:45 -0400] jtimberman: http://status.opscode.com/
[2012-07-01 01:20:51 -0400] jtimberman: specifically: http://status.opscode.com/post/26243863163/intermittent-500-errors-from-api-opscode-com
[2012-07-01 01:20:51 -0400] hoover_damm: yep yep they're looking into it
[2012-07-01 01:26:05 -0400] doomviking: fix it fix it fix it
[2012-07-01 01:26:10 -0400] jelder_: getting connection reset from those urls, too
[2012-07-01 01:35:29 -0400] hoover_damm: everyone is
[2012-07-01 01:35:35 -0400] hoover_damm: getting server errors left and right
[2012-07-01 01:36:09 -0400] doomviking: its a party
[2012-07-01 01:48:30 -0400] apeshimam: Hi how's it going
[2012-07-01 01:48:55 -0400] apeshimam: I've an encrypted databag file that I want to decrypt. How can I go about doing that
[2012-07-01 01:50:12 -0400] bemu: That is definitely in the wiki
[2012-07-01 01:50:35 -0400] doomviking: yep
[2012-07-01 01:50:43 -0400] gmcinnes1: same thing
[2012-07-01 01:51:14 -0400] hcastro: apeshimam: example: http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2011/08/06/encrypted-data-bag-for-postfix-sasl-authentication/
[2012-07-01 02:15:06 -0400] bemu: Any updates guys?
[2012-07-01 02:15:27 -0400] bemu: I don't mean to badger, but this is a pretty big deal for us.
[2012-07-01 02:15:42 -0400] hoover_damm: bueller?
[2012-07-01 02:16:39 -0400] geekbri: If the leap second had a beanbag i'd wanna kick it in it
[2012-07-01 02:17:09 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-07-01 02:17:13 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm just gonna go make dinner
[2012-07-01 02:17:20 -0400] hoover_damm: and call this a omg weekend
[2012-07-01 02:19:35 -0400] jessicab: bemu - theyre working on it and roped in some more ops guys, but i dont see a resolution posted yet
[2012-07-01 02:19:51 -0400] bemu: Okay, thank you.
[2012-07-01 02:20:01 -0400] bemu: Just trying to recover from the same thing
[2012-07-01 02:20:06 -0400] bemu: and difficult to do without Chef :/
[2012-07-01 02:20:13 -0400] geekbri: rolling reboots are every bodies favorite saturday night activity
[2012-07-01 02:20:31 -0400] bemu: Especially following data center loss the night before.
[2012-07-01 02:20:48 -0400] Randm: this is a great weekend
[2012-07-01 02:20:49 -0400] bemu: We weren't even done cleaning up from that disaster.
[2012-07-01 02:20:54 -0400] bemu: before this one hit.
[2012-07-01 02:20:55 -0400] Randm: get all your downtime done in one night
[2012-07-01 02:24:09 -0400] geekbri: We need a group therapy session
[2012-07-01 02:24:50 -0400] Randm: there is one
[2012-07-01 02:24:52 -0400] Randm: we meet at the bar
[2012-07-01 02:24:56 -0400] Randm: all your friends are there too
[2012-07-01 02:25:14 -0400] geekbri: issue rolling reboots from the bar?  I like that idea.
[2012-07-01 02:26:25 -0400] Randm: hmm
[2012-07-01 02:26:33 -0400] Randm: I wonder if my centos 5 boxes are crying
[2012-07-01 02:27:16 -0400] elijah-mbp: "sometimes you wanna go - where everybody knows your naaaa-aaame"
[2012-07-01 02:28:01 -0400] elijah-mbp: i hear that our linux-on-kvm-on-solaris customers at joyent are getting kinda stabby too.
[2012-07-01 02:29:18 -0400] elijah-mbp: (mostly from it burning cpu, if the folks in #joyent are telling true...)
[2012-07-01 02:35:57 -0400] geekbri: Randm: I thin i read that RHEL6 was affected by that RHEL5 wasnt
[2012-07-01 02:36:03 -0400] Randm: hmm
[2012-07-01 02:36:05 -0400] Randm: ok
[2012-07-01 02:36:10 -0400] Randm: I wonder how my centos6 boxes are doing
[2012-07-01 02:38:26 -0400] Randm: ;)
[2012-07-01 02:39:38 -0400] geekbri: hehe
[2012-07-01 02:39:50 -0400] geekbri: probably poorly, especially if they are running any java apps :-
[2012-07-01 02:39:52 -0400] geekbri: :-P
[2012-07-01 02:40:30 -0400] Randm: I don't do that anymore
[2012-07-01 02:40:51 -0400] geekbri: Some of us aren't as fortunate.
[2012-07-01 02:41:10 -0400] Randm: I've only been seperated out by a month from it
[2012-07-01 02:41:19 -0400] Randm: I'm still feeling your pain
[2012-07-01 02:45:26 -0400] geekbri: I'm still feeling my pain too
[2012-07-01 02:45:36 -0400] jessicab: updated status btw - "Were currently experiencing an API outage which we believe to be related to a recent leap-second event. Our engineers are investigating the issue."
[2012-07-01 02:46:03 -0400] geekbri: AKA opscodes boned by the same stuff I am :-P
[2012-07-01 02:48:20 -0400] hoover_damm: rebooting rackspace jessicab? :)
[2012-07-01 02:48:47 -0400] paulmooring: hoover_damm: working on leap second problems, so yes
[2012-07-01 02:48:47 -0400] JasonF: jessicab: Are you a Racker?
[2012-07-01 02:48:51 -0400] jessicab: oh, im not.. im just updating status :P
[2012-07-01 02:49:00 -0400] hoover_damm: JasonF, no jessicab is an opcosder
[2012-07-01 02:49:03 -0400] JasonF: ah
[2012-07-01 02:49:10 -0400] hoover_damm: jessicab, I know I was giving you a hard time sorry.
[2012-07-01 02:49:26 -0400] hoover_damm: jessicab, everyone's been hit by the leapsecond bug... thank you 5pm pst
[2012-07-01 02:49:39 -0400] hoover_damm: my graphite servers are not impacted
[2012-07-01 02:49:42 -0400] hoover_damm: because they run 3.4.x
[2012-07-01 02:49:51 -0400] jessicab: heh its cool
[2012-07-01 02:50:34 -0400] paulmooring: hoover_damm: what distro?
[2012-07-01 02:52:29 -0400] geekbri: Whats awesome is, I switched my oncall shift with another engineer for my birthday today , but that didn't help me all that much now did it :-P
[2012-07-01 03:01:49 -0400] hoover_damm: paulmooring, Ubuntu
[2012-07-01 03:02:06 -0400] hoover_damm: paulmooring, basically it appears the offset of how leapseconds was handled before 3.4.x causes confusion
[2012-07-01 03:02:11 -0400] hoover_damm: to the kernel
[2012-07-01 03:02:45 -0400] hoover_damm: a lot of folks are suggesting weird date setting tricks to get the load back to normal
[2012-07-01 03:02:57 -0400] hoover_damm: which just feels weird, rebooting should fix it
[2012-07-01 03:03:25 -0400] paulmooring: probably faster than trying a bunch of date hacks too
[2012-07-01 03:06:21 -0400] Randm: hoover_damm: it would if you're not on ec2..
[2012-07-01 03:06:26 -0400] Randm: (maybe)
[2012-07-01 03:07:43 -0400] hoover_damm: Randm, Zing!
[2012-07-01 03:07:51 -0400] hoover_damm: good one
[2012-07-01 03:08:43 -0400] tightwork: why would chef-client be eating 35% mem?
[2012-07-01 03:10:03 -0400] jelder_: 35% of what?
[2012-07-01 03:13:56 -0400] tightwork: mem .. memory
[2012-07-01 03:14:48 -0400] jtimberman: tightwork: because memory is delicious!
[2012-07-01 03:14:55 -0400] jtimberman: tightwork: how much is 35%?
[2012-07-01 03:15:11 -0400] jtimberman: depending on the total size of the memory in the machine, that can be a lot or hardly any :)
[2012-07-01 03:15:50 -0400] tightwork: 89MB.. 256MB vm :-/
[2012-07-01 03:17:03 -0400] hoover_damm: that's not that big
[2012-07-01 03:17:09 -0400] hoover_damm: tight to get a bigger instance?
[2012-07-01 03:19:43 -0400] tightwork: guess ill have to, been trying to run it on the cheap.. made a swap file, keeps it from crashing but its really slow
[2012-07-01 03:21:16 -0400] Randm: hoover_damm: in that if your host is having issues
[2012-07-01 03:21:28 -0400] Randm: does amazon do vmotion style migrations internally?
[2012-07-01 03:22:57 -0400] hoover_damm: Randm, that's a good joke (re: vmotion on aws)
[2012-07-01 03:23:16 -0400] hoover_damm: Randm, No AWS uses Xen.  It's all about commodity hardware and commoddity hosting.
[2012-07-01 03:23:36 -0400] silk: Has anyone from opscode got an ETA?
[2012-07-01 03:23:47 -0400] tightwork: manage.opscode.com down?
[2012-07-01 03:23:58 -0400] silk: its been about 2 hours from an update on status.opscode.com
[2012-07-01 03:24:01 -0400] s1_: haha
[2012-07-01 03:24:04 -0400] s1_: AWS?  live migration?
[2012-07-01 03:24:09 -0400] tightwork: awesome
[2012-07-01 03:24:30 -0400] tightwork: idiot leap second bs
[2012-07-01 03:24:50 -0400] flaccid_: has some weird quarrel with a dude in ##aws on the leap second thing
[2012-07-01 03:24:53 -0400] Randm: hoover_damm: I said "style"
[2012-07-01 03:25:03 -0400] Randm: I don't know what xen calls it
[2012-07-01 03:25:07 -0400] Randm: other than live migrations
[2012-07-01 03:25:08 -0400] tightwork: active active ha cloud infrastructures and a single second crashes the whole thing
[2012-07-01 03:25:13 -0400] tightwork: how depressing
[2012-07-01 03:25:22 -0400] s1_: xen live migrations on public cloud is unheard of
[2012-07-01 03:26:08 -0400] hoover_damm: Randm, live migrations are really an enterprise thing
[2012-07-01 03:26:16 -0400] hoover_damm: Randm, there is nothing about AWS and Enterprise
[2012-07-01 03:26:24 -0400] hoover_damm: those two words do not connect
[2012-07-01 03:26:55 -0400] flaccid_: guess we'll see what features gcompute comes out with
[2012-07-01 03:27:49 -0400] hoover_damm: i've used enterprise clouds
[2012-07-01 03:28:03 -0400] hoover_damm: I won't speak about how horrible the Terrormark dashboard is (Terramark)
[2012-07-01 03:28:11 -0400] hoover_damm: try loading it over 3G
[2012-07-01 03:28:15 -0400] hoover_damm: takes up to 5minutes
[2012-07-01 03:29:13 -0400] Randm: ah
[2012-07-01 03:29:17 -0400] Randm: yeah
[2012-07-01 03:29:22 -0400] Randm: looked up live migration and xen
[2012-07-01 03:29:27 -0400] Randm: involved shared storage
[2012-07-01 03:29:39 -0400] hoover_damm: well that won't work for AWS
[2012-07-01 03:29:43 -0400] hoover_damm: aws uses DRBD + GNDB

[2012-07-01 03:30:09 -0400] Randm: for the ephemeral disks?
[2012-07-01 03:30:52 -0400] hoover_damm: no or EBS
[2012-07-01 03:30:59 -0400] hoover_damm: Ephemeral is local disks still
[2012-07-01 03:31:14 -0400] Randm: yeah, that's the difficult bit to do the migration with
[2012-07-01 03:31:18 -0400] Randm: ebs would be "easy"
[2012-07-01 03:31:36 -0400] Randm: apart from the cpu issues

[2012-07-01 03:48:41 -0400] bdha: I wish I were joking. But I'm not.
[2012-07-01 03:51:56 -0400] hoover_damm: bdha, right you need to just set the clock to remove the field
[2012-07-01 03:53:40 -0400] bdha: I think you mean the scumbag hat.

[2012-07-01 07:10:09 -0400] kesor: gem_package installs a gem using the vagrant ruby instead of the system /usr/bin/ruby, how do I fix that?
[2012-07-01 08:00:03 -0400] kesor: anyone else having problems using nginx::source recipe to compile nginx with specified version?
[2012-07-01 08:40:02 -0400] tightwork: seems the gem does not have latest bootstrap?
[2012-07-01 09:23:29 -0400] tightwork: Finally got 10.13.0 with latest bootstrap scripts, try to bootstrap ubuntu 12.04 LTS node on rackspace, fails trying to get http://s3.amazonaws.com/opscode-full-stack/ubuntu-11.04-x86_64/chef-full_10.13.0_amd64.deb with 404.
[2012-07-01 09:35:06 -0400] coderanger: tightwork: I think there may have been some issues after the last AWS kaboom, we'll investigate on Monday
[2012-07-01 09:35:37 -0400] coderanger: tightwork: For now you can just use the 10.12 deb, that seems to be happy
[2012-07-01 09:37:32 -0400] tightwork: 10.12 deb on 12.04?
[2012-07-01 09:38:13 -0400] coderanger: Yeah
[2012-07-01 09:42:01 -0400] tightwork: prob is im trying to use rackspace-knife and turn up vms instantly with chef.. all this breaks that from happening
[2012-07-01 09:44:07 -0400] coderanger: tightwork: You can write your own bootstrap template
[2012-07-01 10:02:30 -0400] martha: hi.  anyone around who is using chef on solaris?
[2012-07-01 10:45:06 -0400] upgrayedd: i'm trying to write recipes that base configuration on the results of node searches
[2012-07-01 10:45:55 -0400] upgrayedd: for instance, the recipe to install our GUI app looks up the location of its mysql server by checking which node has the recipe that installs and configures the mysql server
[2012-07-01 10:47:20 -0400] upgrayedd: but i am having troubles where, even though all the recipes are on the runlists, its failing to find the nodes in a search
[2012-07-01 11:04:37 -0400] tightwork: The boot strap script appears to be working if I run it just on the machine. It appears bootstrapping from knife-rackspace is my problem, but more so how it formulates filename="chef-full_${version}_amd64.deb.  My client is running chef 10.13.0 and whatever the bootstrap builds is 10.12.  The variables for the boostrap are taken from my client and used on the vm where 10.13 is not installed an no omni deb exists
[2012-07-01 11:12:34 -0400] forestbird: so why could chef solr be running for hours and consume lots of cpu (about 70%)? there aren't even any nodes on the chef server
[2012-07-01 11:24:29 -0400] forestbird: hmm, no clue what's going on: 22640 chef      20   0  159m  54m 4888 S   57  1.3  33:34.27 chef-server
[2012-07-01 11:24:47 -0400] forestbird: using around 60% cpu with nothing going on
[2012-07-01 11:24:52 -0400] asg: forestbird: how long has this been happening
[2012-07-01 11:25:08 -0400] forestbird: i noticed today
[2012-07-01 11:25:43 -0400] forestbird: i stopped everything except chef-server and it's still on 60%
[2012-07-01 11:26:34 -0400] asg: since there's some java involved, it might be related to the leapsecond issue that's been biting people today/overnight.
[2012-07-01 11:27:26 -0400] forestbird: heh, no java left now... stopped solr
[2012-07-01 11:28:39 -0400] forestbird: the longer i work as a sysadmin, the more I see java misbehaving in all kinds of places
[2012-07-01 11:30:08 -0400] forestbird: i wonder if this is a debian related problem (we run almost just debian).... or if java is just a general nightmare for servers
[2012-07-01 11:31:33 -0400] forestbird: maybe it's better on windows? :)
[2012-07-01 11:55:54 -0400] forestbird: not sure if it has something to do with the update or if it was like that before:  chef  10.12.0-1 , now chef-server constantly uses 60% cpu with nothing going on and no nodes. this is on debian squeeze fully upgraded
[2012-07-01 11:56:19 -0400] forestbird: and chef is from the opscode repo
[2012-07-01 13:17:16 -0400] _aeris_: forestbird > cpu load only since this day ?
[2012-07-01 13:18:02 -0400] _aeris_: if yes, must be additionnal second, which break a lot of server this night
[2012-07-01 13:19:16 -0400] _aeris_: on one of my chef server, unable to have a clean state without reboot
[2012-07-01 13:25:12 -0400] forestbird: i can't imagine that it would cause such trouble... but it's easy to find out :)
[2012-07-01 13:42:10 -0400] forestbird: was no use to restart it...
[2012-07-01 13:42:22 -0400] forestbird: it's still hogging
[2012-07-01 13:42:39 -0400] forestbird: and not just chef-server, but also solr and webui if they are started
[2012-07-01 13:44:05 -0400] forestbird: thank god this is not a production system...
[2012-07-01 13:44:33 -0400] _aeris_: forestbird > this is solr which force me to reboot
[2012-07-01 13:44:45 -0400] _aeris_: unable to restart it after stopping
[2012-07-01 13:45:23 -0400] forestbird: i might disable solr and see if it changes anything

[2012-07-01 13:52:04 -0400] _aeris_: yes

[2012-07-01 14:19:30 -0400] forestbird: amazing... that bug
[2012-07-01 14:31:13 -0400] forestbird: _aeris_: many thanks... would have spent even more hours on this probably :)
[2012-07-01 14:31:35 -0400] _aeris_: no problem
[2012-07-01 14:31:46 -0400] _aeris_: i spent 11h on this problem :
[2012-07-01 14:31:57 -0400] _aeris_: with production server ><
[2012-07-01 14:33:30 -0400] forestbird: yeah, our prod servers were also affected... but no serious  trouble there...
[2012-07-01 14:33:50 -0400] forestbird: they're usually not highly loaded anyway
[2012-07-01 16:14:25 -0400] MKC: how do you download cookbooks to existing repo? It keeps adding a new branch instead of just adding itself to my branch. (knife cookbook site install mysql)
[2012-07-01 19:41:44 -0400] scrr: hm.. what attribute stores the current node-name? node["name"]?
[2012-07-01 19:42:13 -0400] scrr: id like to switch templates based on that..
[2012-07-01 19:52:34 -0400] hoover_damm: node[:hostname]
[2012-07-01 19:52:48 -0400] hoover_damm: node["name"] is a engine yard specific to their chef 0.6
[2012-07-01 19:52:57 -0400] hoover_damm: or node["hostname"]
[2012-07-01 19:54:47 -0400] scrr: hoover_damm: thank you!

[2012-07-01 21:53:20 -0400] upgrayedd: i'm having a problem where attributes i set in one recipe are available to that recipe but not others or in the node data
[2012-07-01 21:54:54 -0400] flaccid_: upgrayedd: i assume you are using include_recipe ?
[2012-07-01 21:55:14 -0400] upgrayedd: no
[2012-07-01 21:55:55 -0400] upgrayedd: at the top of a one recipe called 'mwm' : node.set_unless['mcs']['mwm']['sched_port'] = '42559'
[2012-07-01 21:56:52 -0400] upgrayedd: then in a recipe called 'mws', in the same chef-client session, i search(:node,'role:mwm-headnode') and find that node successfully
[2012-07-01 21:56:56 -0400] upgrayedd: but the attributes aren't set
[2012-07-01 21:57:26 -0400] flaccid_: you don't set attributes in recipes
[2012-07-01 21:57:42 -0400] flaccid_: you set them in attributes and metadata
[2012-07-01 21:57:52 -0400] flaccid_: see the wiki docs
[2012-07-01 21:58:27 -0400] upgrayedd: i learned how to set them from recipes in the wiki dodcs
[2012-07-01 21:58:31 -0400] upgrayedd: s/dodcs/docs/
[2012-07-01 21:58:57 -0400] flaccid_: URL?
[2012-07-01 21:59:02 -0400] upgrayedd: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Attributes#Attributes-RoleAttributes
[2012-07-01 21:59:05 -0400] upgrayedd: precedence #6
[2012-07-01 21:59:20 -0400] upgrayedd: normal or set attributes applied on a node directly in a recipe
[2012-07-01 22:00:52 -0400] upgrayedd: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Setting+Attributes+%28Examples%29
[2012-07-01 22:01:01 -0400] flaccid_: well i'm not sure, but i'd be using include_recipe
[2012-07-01 22:01:31 -0400] flaccid_: i found default[] in attributes works great, but i don't know what your issue is sorry, maybe someone does
[2012-07-01 22:01:43 -0400] upgrayedd: it seems like maybe attributes are posted back to the node only after a successful run or something
[2012-07-01 22:02:16 -0400] upgrayedd: this weekend i'm a magnet for creating races that have to do with that
[2012-07-01 22:03:44 -0400] upgrayedd: my troubles started when i watched a chef video that said it was a good idea to write recipes that do lookups to cross-configure things like hostnames of machines, based on their roles or the recipes in their runlists
[2012-07-01 22:04:24 -0400] upgrayedd: i couldn't find any examples so i started trying to piece it together, and i've run into several weird issues
[2012-07-01 22:07:07 -0400] upgrayedd: if you use the attribute files method does this type of thing work?:
[2012-07-01 22:07:14 -0400] upgrayedd: ::Chef::Recipe.send(:include, Opscode::OpenSSL::Password)
[2012-07-01 22:07:14 -0400] upgrayedd: node.set_unless['mcs']['mwm']['secret_key'] = secure_password
[2012-07-01 22:24:55 -0400] msf: upgrayedd: newly set attributes are not searchable unless you save the node first
[2012-07-01 22:25:11 -0400] msf: so if you are setting something from the recipe
[2012-07-01 22:25:22 -0400] msf: and you want it to show up in search results later in the run
[2012-07-01 22:25:33 -0400] msf: you must call node.save! first
[2012-07-01 22:25:57 -0400] msf: otherwise the new node data is only saved at the end of a successful chef rn
[2012-07-01 22:26:01 -0400] msf: chef run
[2012-07-01 22:26:15 -0400] upgrayedd: ah
[2012-07-01 22:27:12 -0400] flaccid_: ah yeah make sense, but is that missing from the docs ..
[2012-07-01 22:27:14 -0400] msf: search only works against the indexed version of the serialized node data in couch, which isn't updated in real time
[2012-07-01 22:27:45 -0400] msf: there's lots of stuff missing from the docs :-P
[2012-07-01 22:27:52 -0400] upgrayedd: i've had to search based on roles too
[2012-07-01 22:28:03 -0400] upgrayedd: the expanded run_list has the same problem
[2012-07-01 22:28:38 -0400] msf: yes, it won't be indexed until after the first time you successfully make it through a run
[2012-07-01 22:28:40 -0400] flaccid_: is there a procedure to get missing things in the docs heh
[2012-07-01 22:28:48 -0400] flaccid_: or is the wiki public editable, i have not checked
[2012-07-01 22:28:53 -0400] upgrayedd: confluence is open for edits if you register yeah
[2012-07-01 22:28:58 -0400] upgrayedd: seemingly
[2012-07-01 22:29:06 -0400] msf: which is one of the reasons that makes using include_recipe kind of a smell
[2012-07-01 22:29:18 -0400] flaccid_: if one of you guys could do that edit.. :)
[2012-07-01 22:29:21 -0400] msf: the wiki is editable for registered users
[2012-07-01 22:30:23 -0400] upgrayedd: i will once i figure out the sane way to accomplish what i'm after
[2012-07-01 22:34:44 -0400] upgrayedd: ahh 100% better
[2012-07-01 22:34:46 -0400] upgrayedd: ty msf
[2012-07-01 22:38:09 -0400] msf: np :-)
