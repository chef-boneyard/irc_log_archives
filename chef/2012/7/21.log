[2012-07-21 00:09:17 -0400] timsmith: Has anyone out there used chef to install nsclient on a Windows box?
[2012-07-21 00:20:06 -0400] Majost: erratic: no -- I am writing a cookbook for an application; I need to issue a setup command but there is a bug in the unattended setup in the current version resulting in a single prompt which I need to handle
[2012-07-21 00:30:12 -0400] flaccid: you could try expect or stdin/redirection if lucky but you are better fixing the bug
[2012-07-21 00:33:42 -0400] Majost: yeah, I already talked to the developer
[2012-07-21 00:34:38 -0400] Majost: Its unlikely I will be able to get him to push an update for this small bug until the next major release.
[2012-07-21 00:34:55 -0400] Majost: even if I provide a patch, it wont get integrated into the current version
[2012-07-21 00:36:51 -0400] Majost: hrm, I found a gem which might handle it for now
[2012-07-21 00:43:46 -0400] timsmith: Anyone having problems with chef 10.12 and CentOS 6.3?
[2012-07-21 00:44:07 -0400] timsmith: DEBUG: NameError: Cannot find a resource for nodes on centos version 6.3
[2012-07-21 01:24:58 -0400] Majost: what is the provider name for installing gems?
[2012-07-21 01:25:05 -0400] Majost: I thought it was gem or gempackage
[2012-07-21 01:25:11 -0400] Majost: but I am not having any luck
[2012-07-21 01:25:12 -0400] Majost: heh
[2012-07-21 01:32:29 -0400] flaccid: Majost: see the wiki resources page
[2012-07-21 02:19:44 -0400] Twirrim: Aloha.  Trying to figure out something with templating.  Ruby isn't my forte by any stretch of the imagination.  What I'd like to do is something like : "unless node[:platform]"  and then specify a number of platforms, but I'm clearly getting the syntax wrong somehow :D
[2012-07-21 02:20:27 -0400] Twirrim: it'll work with: unless node[:platform]=="redhat", for example, but I'd like to specify multiple platforms in that single statement instead of chaining OR together..
[2012-07-21 02:23:48 -0400] hoover_damm: you dislike value_for_platform
[2012-07-21 02:23:49 -0400] hoover_damm: ?
[2012-07-21 02:29:07 -0400] Majost: is it possible embed regular ruby within an execute statement?
[2012-07-21 02:30:14 -0400] justsee: Majost: there's the script resource: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Script
[2012-07-21 02:31:37 -0400] Majost: is this valid: http://pastie.org/4293240
[2012-07-21 02:33:43 -0400] justsee: Majost: no. Look at the script resource example. Specify the interpreter as ruby, and put your code within a heredoc like code <<-EOH
[2012-07-21 02:33:52 -0400] justsee: then close with EOH
[2012-07-21 02:33:55 -0400] justsee: as in the example
[2012-07-21 02:33:58 -0400] Majost: justsee: I could probably use the script resource if I set the interpreter to be expect... but I was hoping for a ruby solution.
[2012-07-21 02:34:08 -0400] Majost: ah
[2012-07-21 02:34:09 -0400] Majost: I see
[2012-07-21 02:34:36 -0400] Majost: I didn't think of that for whatever reason. heh
[2012-07-21 02:38:13 -0400] justsee: Majost: there's also the ruby block resource: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-RubyBlock
[2012-07-21 02:57:20 -0400] Twirrim: hoover_damm: value_for_platform ?
[2012-07-21 02:58:22 -0400] Twirrim: ahh interesting
[2012-07-21 03:11:21 -0400] Twirrim: hoover_damm: value_for_platform doesn't work inside a template :(
[2012-07-21 03:12:50 -0400] Bonkers: well, with pure ruby, you can do: ['ubuntu', 'redhat'].include? node.platform
[2012-07-21 03:13:14 -0400] Bonkers: however, chef provides a helper: platform?('ubuntu', 'redhat')
[2012-07-21 03:13:38 -0400] Bonkers: probably won't work inside a template though, you want to pass in a variable with variables and figure it out inside the recipe or wherever
[2012-07-21 03:23:07 -0400] hoover_damm: Twirrim, i don't put logic in the templates
[2012-07-21 03:23:09 -0400] hoover_damm: it sucks
[2012-07-21 03:23:35 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, we agree on something!
[2012-07-21 03:23:51 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, oh I'm sure we'd agree on a lot
[2012-07-21 03:23:51 -0400] yfeldblum: Twirrim, stick the logic in the recipe
[2012-07-21 03:23:55 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, :P
[2012-07-21 03:24:18 -0400] yfeldblum: Twirrim, `variables :xyz => value_for_platform(...)`
[2012-07-21 03:30:16 -0400] Twirrim: I was hoping for a quick and simple patch on the opscode cookbook.  If that's the necessary route, oh well.
[2012-07-21 03:31:06 -0400] Twirrim: ahh.. okay, figured out a way:  'unless ["centos", "redhat" ].include?(node[:platform])' works
[2012-07-21 03:31:46 -0400] Twirrim: I'm debating the value of chef pushing out its own MySQL config files as cross-platform.  You're really asking for trouble unless you install specific versions.
[2012-07-21 03:32:18 -0400] Twirrim: either that or go with the absolute bare minimum of config values.
[2012-07-21 03:32:31 -0400] Twirrim: or separate templates per distribution (fun fun fun!)
[2012-07-21 04:23:27 -0400] Twirrim: jeepers I need to learn git better :D
[2012-07-21 04:27:55 -0400] countdigi: Twirrim: i am no expert but i forced myself by signing up to give an intro talk on it :-)
[2012-07-21 04:28:03 -0400] countdigi: nothing like that to motivate u
[2012-07-21 04:30:28 -0400] Twirrim: yeah, I can see how that would be the case :D
[2012-07-21 04:30:58 -0400] countdigi: the whole apress book is online for free
[2012-07-21 04:31:37 -0400] countdigi: http://git-scm.com/book/ - i actually bought it and then figured that one out ;-)
[2012-07-21 04:44:03 -0400] Majost: anyone know if chef has a uuid generator which is accessible via a template?
[2012-07-21 04:44:33 -0400] Majost: or uses a uuid gem which I can tap into?
[2012-07-21 15:13:50 -0400] jtimberman: Majost: chef depends on the uuidtools gem
[2012-07-21 15:13:57 -0400] jtimberman: so that one will be installed with any chef installation
[2012-07-21 17:58:50 -0400] newb: hi chefs
[2012-07-21 17:59:25 -0400] newb: what's the diff between knife bootstrap script vs template
[2012-07-21 18:07:39 -0400] newb: if I type in "knife bootstrap 10.1.1.112 -x root -i ~/.ssh/root_id_rsa -r 'role[webserver]' ", will it try and install ruby, chef etc on 10.1.1.112, even if 10.1.1.112 already has that?
[2012-07-21 18:11:39 -0400] cheeseplus: newb: I was pretty sure there are checks to prevent double installs
[2012-07-21 18:11:53 -0400] cheeseplus: also if you're using a package (like a .deb) it won't install anything
[2012-07-21 18:12:15 -0400] newb: yes, but I am confused on diff between knife bootstrap script vs template
[2012-07-21 18:12:38 -0400] newb: the bootstrap scripts seem to install ruby, chef etc through gem or apt
[2012-07-21 18:13:39 -0400] newb: assume I have all that already done - how do I make knife bootstrap not do those things and jump drectly to client registration and run the runlist?
[2012-07-21 18:14:12 -0400] newb: write a custom knife bootstrap script that does nothing or a template?
[2012-07-21 18:14:54 -0400] CaptSpify: are you able to run the chef-client?
[2012-07-21 18:15:56 -0400] newb: yes, but I don't want to ssh in and run it. want to use knife
[2012-07-21 18:16:43 -0400] newb: also - what does this do "awk NF /tmp/validation.pem > /etc/chef/validation.pem " should it not just output number of fields into the .pem?
[2012-07-21 18:17:43 -0400] cheeseplus: newb: you could use a custom template but you won't be able to use knife to do anything until the clients themselves are registered
[2012-07-21 18:18:18 -0400] newb: CaptSpify, hmm, if I able to run the chef-client already, I don't really need to do "knife bootstrap", but I can just do a "knife ssh "chef client runlist"" even if that node is not registered yet?
[2012-07-21 18:18:26 -0400] CaptSpify: well, someone correct me if I'm wrong but... I think if the chef-client is running, then any knife command you use will take effect the next time it checks-in. I don't think there's a way to force the client to check-in and run a runlist via knife. Is that what you mean
[2012-07-21 18:19:21 -0400] cheeseplus: CaptSpify: he wants the bootstrap like action but only the registration part, not the installation of ruby and such
[2012-07-21 18:19:27 -0400] newb: yes
[2012-07-21 18:19:49 -0400] newb: it is because my VM already have all ruby and chef stuff
[2012-07-21 18:19:58 -0400] newb: actually custom ruby and chef
[2012-07-21 18:20:04 -0400] newb: not ones on gem or apt
[2012-07-21 18:20:12 -0400] CaptSpify: If everything is set up, doesn't chef register the node the first time you run chef-client?
[2012-07-21 18:20:52 -0400] newb: CaptSpify, but to register node must have key and stuff
[2012-07-21 18:20:55 -0400] cheeseplus: newb: there are a few ways to attack the problem but nothing offcial since you seem to only want one feature that knife bootstrap has to offer
[2012-07-21 18:21:23 -0400] cheeseplus: if you are dead set on using knife, then a custom template seems to be the way to go
[2012-07-21 18:21:28 -0400] newb: cheeseplus, can you first explain diff between knife bootstrap script vs template pls
[2012-07-21 18:21:34 -0400] CaptSpify: ah, gotcha. I was assuming you had that. Nevermind
[2012-07-21 18:21:57 -0400] cheeseplus: newb: I'm not sure what exactly you mean
[2012-07-21 18:22:14 -0400] newb: what is a knife bootstrap script
[2012-07-21 18:22:35 -0400] newb: and why also there another cmdline arg for template
[2012-07-21 18:23:03 -0400] cheeseplus: knife bootstrap is knife subcommand, not sure what script you are referring to
[2012-07-21 18:23:33 -0400] newb: ok, I confused between
[2012-07-21 18:23:33 -0400] newb: --template-file TEMPLATE:
[2012-07-21 18:23:41 -0400] newb: -d, --distro DISTRO:
[2012-07-21 18:23:47 -0400] newb: why two different
[2012-07-21 18:24:19 -0400] cheeseplus: distro uses supplied templates, template file is a full path to a custom template
[2012-07-21 18:24:47 -0400] newb: ok, so distro actually another template but it ships ready with knife?
[2012-07-21 18:25:12 -0400] cheeseplus: newb: If the distro is not specified (via -d or --distro option), an Ubuntu 10.04 with RubyGems is assumed. The DISTRO value corresponds to the base filename of the template, in other words DISTRO.erb. A template file can be specified with the --template-file option in which case the DISTRO is not used.
[2012-07-21 18:25:18 -0400] cheeseplus: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Knife+Bootstrap
[2012-07-21 18:25:48 -0400] newb: so distro option redundant if I explicitly pass DISTRO.erb as --template-file?
[2012-07-21 18:25:49 -0400] cheeseplus: it's just a matter of where it's defined but they essentially perform a similar function
[2012-07-21 18:26:28 -0400] cheeseplus: distro won't even be used if you pass it a template option
[2012-07-21 18:26:51 -0400] newb: nono, I mean are these two commands exactly same:
[2012-07-21 18:27:34 -0400] newb: 1. knife boot.. --distro DISTRO: ubuntu10.04-gems
[2012-07-21 18:28:01 -0400] cheeseplus: yes
[2012-07-21 18:28:08 -0400] cheeseplus: it's in "knife help bootstrap"
[2012-07-21 18:28:12 -0400] newb: 2. knife boot.. --template-file TEMPLATE: <path to ubuntu10.04-gems.erb>
[2012-07-21 18:28:36 -0400] cheeseplus: knife bootstrap mynode.example.com --distro debian5.0-apt == knife bootstrap mynode.example.com --template-file ~/.chef/bootstrap/debian5.0-apt.erb
[2012-07-21 18:28:48 -0400] newb: yes yes!
[2012-07-21 18:29:00 -0400] newb: thnx cheeseplus
[2012-07-21 18:29:22 -0400] newb: ok also - what does this do "awk NF /tmp/validation.pem > /etc/chef/validation.pem " should it not just output number of fields into the .pem?
[2012-07-21 18:29:46 -0400] newb: https://gist.github.com/1730158
[2012-07-21 18:31:16 -0400] jtimberman: newb: it atomically copies the file into place.
[2012-07-21 18:31:29 -0400] cheeseplus: ^
[2012-07-21 18:31:48 -0400] newb: @jtimberman, yes I had feeling, but I don't understand how it works
[2012-07-21 18:32:00 -0400] newb: NF : number of fields
[2012-07-21 18:32:29 -0400] newb: awk NF /tmp/validation.pem output 1 if only one string without spcaes
[2012-07-21 18:32:46 -0400] newb: 2 if string with 1 spaces
[2012-07-21 18:32:52 -0400] newb: 3 if string with 2 spaces
[2012-07-21 18:32:53 -0400] newb: etc
[2012-07-21 18:33:33 -0400] cheeseplus: newb: does it actually output 1 for you?
[2012-07-21 18:34:05 -0400] cheeseplus: awk NF .chef/validation.pem prints the file on my machine
[2012-07-21 18:34:12 -0400] jtimberman: ditto for me
[2012-07-21 18:34:53 -0400] newb: oh, what difference between "awk NF .chef/validation.pem" and "awk '{print NF}' .chef/validation.pem"
[2012-07-21 18:35:07 -0400] newb: and why it atomically copies but not cat
[2012-07-21 18:35:33 -0400] cheeseplus: man awk
[2012-07-21 18:35:40 -0400] cheeseplus: ;)
[2012-07-21 18:35:52 -0400] newb: he he
[2012-07-21 18:36:30 -0400] cheeseplus: I can't speak to why that particular option was chosen for atomically copying, but I'm sure someone had a good reason
[2012-07-21 18:37:23 -0400] newb: yes, but that someone here on channel I know, so he save me time from reading so many pages on Saturday
[2012-07-21 18:37:29 -0400] newb: :-D
[2012-07-21 18:39:15 -0400] cheeseplus: I wouldn't be too worried about the why, as you know it's just a copy :)
[2012-07-21 18:40:28 -0400] newb: he he
[2012-07-21 18:41:12 -0400] CaptSpify: I'm trying to use the "users"cookbook with an encrypted data bag, the "providers/manage.rb" searches the data bag for the groups, but can't find them because the bag is encrypted
[2012-07-21 18:41:36 -0400] newb: chef so cool but rabbit always creating problems. is there be new chef without rabbit ?
[2012-07-21 18:42:04 -0400] CaptSpify: so is it possible for me to supply the secret-key for the search so it can un-encrypt the data bag?
[2012-07-21 18:42:39 -0400] cheeseplus: newb: the best explanation I have seen for awk NF vs cat - awk NF will not grab empty lines, cat will
[2012-07-21 18:43:48 -0400] newb: oh! you see why it happen - I think NF return 0  for empty line and so now it not proceed but skip for non zero
[2012-07-21 18:43:49 -0400] newb: aha
[2012-07-21 18:43:55 -0400] cheeseplus: yep
[2012-07-21 18:44:04 -0400] newb: cheeseplus, chef so cool but rabbit always creating problems. is there be new chef without rabbit ?
[2012-07-21 18:45:23 -0400] cheeseplus: no idea if rabbitMQ is looking at being replaced
[2012-07-21 18:46:04 -0400] newb: I rearing erlang rewite? what it all affects?
[2012-07-21 18:47:04 -0400] newb: cheeseplus, one tip for you awk 1 == cat, but now atomic copy I not know
[2012-07-21 18:51:10 -0400] cheeseplus: newb: the erlang rewrite is already (partially?) running with Hosted Chef
[2012-07-21 18:51:31 -0400] newb: oh! but wht components it changes?
[2012-07-21 18:51:34 -0400] cheeseplus: it's mostly to lower memory usage and increase the REST API changes
[2012-07-21 18:51:58 -0400] newb: also: rabbitMQ I think is used for AMQP - how does chef use it?
[2012-07-21 18:52:13 -0400] newb: what info it tracks via AMQP ?
[2012-07-21 18:52:28 -0400] cheeseplus: not sure if that much detail can be found anywhere
[2012-07-21 18:52:43 -0400] cheeseplus: but related: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRFekZrLNas
[2012-07-21 18:53:00 -0400] cheeseplus: adn http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBukmNdM-n8
[2012-07-21 18:53:29 -0400] cheeseplus: it's primarily a Ruby/CouchDB -> Erlang/MySQL transition
[2012-07-21 18:53:51 -0400] cheeseplus: but not sure what, if any, other components are being changed out
[2012-07-21 18:54:43 -0400] newb: aha, nice patio conversation if we were all in same place
[2012-07-21 18:55:14 -0400] newb: what info chef tracks via AMQP
[2012-07-21 18:55:15 -0400] newb: ?
[2012-07-21 18:57:28 -0400] cheeseplus: that I don't know, and I'll leave for someone more knowledgable while I go to get coffee
[2012-07-21 19:00:23 -0400] newb: oh cheeseplus, I see you mention multiple solutions exist for my initial problem
[2012-07-21 19:00:51 -0400] newb: I thinking of knife bootstrap only bcos it already exist, but I would have to write custom template
[2012-07-21 19:00:55 -0400] newb: what other ways(s)
[2012-07-21 19:00:57 -0400] newb: ?
[2012-07-21 19:08:04 -0400] cheeseplus: newb: the custom template, manually, moving to a solution where you let knife-bootstrap manage the installation of both chef and ruby (perhaps via a custom temaplate), or just rsyncing the client.rb to all the nodes
[2012-07-21 19:08:46 -0400] newb: ok, one by one
[2012-07-21 19:09:25 -0400] newb: custom template - ready in https://gist.github.com/1730158
[2012-07-21 19:09:40 -0400] newb: manually - use knife ssh?
[2012-07-21 19:11:35 -0400] cheeseplus: knife ssh won't work until chef if configured on the client iirc
[2012-07-21 19:12:59 -0400] cheeseplus: well I should say you can use it and provide it all the details but then you are just using it a replacement for the standard SSH comamnd
[2012-07-21 19:13:20 -0400] anthroprose: anyone know why chef-client would be arbitrarily dieing with no debug output when writing files (templates, user /home/ stuff)
[2012-07-21 19:13:42 -0400] anthroprose: ive got debug turned on &  verbose_logging          true
[2012-07-21 19:14:11 -0400] cheeseplus: anything in syslog / dmesg?
