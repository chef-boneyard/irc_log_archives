[2012-07-14 00:08:26 -0400] jtimberman: is there a typo in the readme? :/

[2012-07-14 00:09:18 -0400] jan0232: ehm...
[2012-07-14 00:09:24 -0400] jan0232: okay :D

[2012-07-14 00:09:31 -0400] jtimberman: fuck
[2012-07-14 00:09:43 -0400] jtimberman: sorry about that.
[2012-07-14 00:10:29 -0400] jtimberman: pushed the fixed example :0
[2012-07-14 00:11:12 -0400] jan0232: jtimberman: wow that was quick, cool :)
[2012-07-14 00:11:44 -0400] jan0232: why is the comiletime flag false as a default??
[2012-07-14 00:11:50 -0400] jtimberman: well, its nothing you have to update to make use of :)
[2012-07-14 00:11:53 -0400] jtimberman: but, np
[2012-07-14 00:12:07 -0400] jtimberman: because that was the default from before the changes in COOK-1296.
[2012-07-14 00:12:25 -0400] Blackavar: Is this buffer for notes you don't want to save? Heh.
[2012-07-14 00:12:49 -0400] jtimberman: Blackavar: clearly
[2012-07-14 00:19:15 -0400] jan0232: jtimberman: so to understand this correctly compile time means build essential will be available during the chef run itself for chef to compile native extensions for chef_gem for example. so if i don't set compile time to true, then i can't install gems that require native extensions for the embedded chefright?
[2012-07-14 00:20:35 -0400] jan0232: i wonder why anyone would set "compiletime" to false then??? it doesn't have any disadvantages does it?
[2012-07-14 00:22:50 -0400] hoover_damm: jtimberman, you emacs user you!
[2012-07-14 00:23:30 -0400] jan0232: http://edinuniinformatics.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/emacs_learning_curve.jpg
[2012-07-14 00:24:10 -0400] hoover_damm: jan0232, I'm an emacs user myself
[2012-07-14 00:24:18 -0400] hoover_damm: I never leave emacs
[2012-07-14 00:24:46 -0400] hoover_damm: if you have less then 10 buffers or files open... your doing it wrong
[2012-07-14 00:24:52 -0400] hoover_damm: and don't forget a good dash of org-mode
[2012-07-14 00:24:59 -0400] hoover_damm: i've been using org-mode for publishing html lately
[2012-07-14 00:25:16 -0400] jan0232: :)
[2012-07-14 00:25:16 -0400] hoover_damm: all I can say is FEELS GOOD
[2012-07-14 00:30:01 -0400] Majost: heh
[2012-07-14 00:30:26 -0400] Majost: I think I may have identified my zen-null-ism
[2012-07-14 00:31:26 -0400] Majost: the question I now have is, how do I properly access a provider from an external cookbook. eg: database -- the default.rb is empty, but it has three providers which have shortcuts
[2012-07-14 00:31:47 -0400] Majost: so do I need to do Chef::Provider::Database::Postgresql
[2012-07-14 00:31:55 -0400] Majost: instead of using the shortcut resource
[2012-07-14 00:32:05 -0400] Majost: or is there something I can do to make the shortcut available?
[2012-07-14 00:43:53 -0400] Majost: huh
[2012-07-14 03:19:23 -0400] Majost: hoover_damm: you around?
[2012-07-14 03:55:58 -0400] Majost: If anyone is around on a Friday night
[2012-07-14 03:56:28 -0400] Majost: who happens to have used both the database cookbook and postgresql -- I got a question
[2012-07-14 04:03:15 -0400] coderanger: Strawpoll, - vs _ in cookbook names
[2012-07-14 04:07:31 -0400] hoover_damm: Majost, I don't do ruby and pg adapter
[2012-07-14 04:08:05 -0400] Majost: ah, I forgot.
[2012-07-14 04:08:41 -0400] Majost: the database cookbook has a library: resource_postgresql_database_user.rb
[2012-07-14 04:09:01 -0400] Majost: but when I try to use the database cookbook to create postgres users -- it tries to create a database instead
[2012-07-14 04:09:02 -0400] Majost: heh
[2012-07-14 04:12:06 -0400] hoover_damm: I can pull parts of an old definition out of a cookbook that creates users via the command line
[2012-07-14 04:12:20 -0400] hoover_damm: but it should just be create user :)
[2012-07-14 04:13:07 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/database/blob/master/libraries/provider_database_postgresql_user.rb#L39
[2012-07-14 04:13:28 -0400] hoover_damm: that looks pretty straight forward
[2012-07-14 04:14:28 -0400] hoover_damm: I twitch that they do this in template1 vs postgres
[2012-07-14 04:14:39 -0400] Majost: heh
[2012-07-14 04:14:39 -0400] hoover_damm: but that's my own personal thing, it really shouldn't break it
[2012-07-14 04:15:06 -0400] Majost: this is what it does instead
[2012-07-14 04:15:24 -0400] Majost: src1.osdc [2012-07-13T21:13:58-07:00] FATAL: PG::Error: database_user[rhodecode] (rhodecode::default line 67) had an error: PG::Error: ERROR:  syntax error at or near "="
[2012-07-14 04:15:24 -0400] Majost: src1.osdc
[2012-07-14 04:15:24 -0400] Majost: src1.osdc LINE 1: CREATE DATABASE  TEMPLATE = DEFAULT ENCODING = DEFAULT TABLE...
[2012-07-14 04:16:08 -0400] hoover_damm: let's do that with --debug and use a proper paste site... if you wanna be weird use refheap.com
[2012-07-14 04:19:24 -0400] Majost: http://pastie.org/4253717
[2012-07-14 04:22:04 -0400] hoover_damm: hrm, reviewing the code I don't see how that's possible with the postgresql user
[2012-07-14 04:22:21 -0400] hoover_damm: I see where it grants the priviledge on the database
[2012-07-14 04:23:07 -0400] Majost: yeah -- its really weird
[2012-07-14 04:23:09 -0400] Majost: heh
[2012-07-14 04:24:42 -0400] Majost: im invoking it via the database cookbook though
[2012-07-14 04:26:43 -0400] hoover_damm: the database cookbook is kinda weird to me... dunno how to explain it
[2012-07-14 04:27:11 -0400] hoover_damm: I use Opscode's cookbooks when they suit me or I reinvent the wheel when I want to punish myself
[2012-07-14 04:27:15 -0400] hoover_damm: or use someone elses
[2012-07-14 04:27:33 -0400] hoover_damm: eventually you end up taking on some kind of maintainer role at least locally
[2012-07-14 04:28:10 -0400] hoover_damm: problem with database patterns for me is I typically setup the database and then restore a dump or something on it
[2012-07-14 04:28:18 -0400] hoover_damm: so I really could care 2 hoots about that kinda functionality
[2012-07-14 04:28:25 -0400] hoover_damm: which is actually why I don't :)
[2012-07-14 04:28:48 -0400] hoover_damm: i'll always drop it, or reinit, or something.
[2012-07-14 04:29:09 -0400] hoover_damm: different pattern
[2012-07-14 04:29:23 -0400] hoover_damm: the pattern of chef cookbook from scratch to live where it populates your skeleton structure is appealing to some
[2012-07-14 04:30:08 -0400] Majost: yeah, I am also working on creating a new cookbook that I want to be able to give back to the community.
[2012-07-14 04:30:53 -0400] Majost: so I am trying to make it as generic as possible so it can be easily consumed by many
[2012-07-14 04:42:51 -0400] hoover_damm: it would also be nice if you could fix the bug and submit a pull ;) so other users can win
[2012-07-14 06:29:26 -0400] Bonkers: how does chef decide what the system ruby is? I'm using an rbenv cookbook and setting a global ruby version, and when I ssh into the server and run ruby, I get it, but gem_package still installs to /opt/chef/....
[2012-07-14 07:57:28 -0400] ranjibd: Bonkers, are you using omnibus installer ?
[2012-07-14 07:58:31 -0400] ranjibd: Bonkers, where your .rbenv/shims/gem points to?
[2012-07-14 15:36:36 -0400] jondot`: hi all, im using the chef-rbenv cookbook, and wondering how do i define within a role the rubies i'd like to be installed. must I create a cookbook for that?
[2012-07-14 16:40:17 -0400] Bonkers: jondot_, yes, there's a ruby_build cookbook
[2012-07-14 16:40:50 -0400] jondot_: Bonkers: thanks. I was able to override the attributes in the role file.
[2012-07-14 16:53:00 -0400] ianneub: Howdy all. I'm trying to bootstrap a Linode node running Ubuntu 12.04 but I keep getting an HTTP 401 error: http://pastie.org/4256226
[2012-07-14 16:53:03 -0400] ianneub: Any thoughts?
[2012-07-14 17:04:06 -0400] ianneub: The bootstrap works fine with Amazon EC2 and Ubuntu 12.04, but not on the lInode. Does EC2 have a district bootstraping script?
[2012-07-14 17:04:22 -0400] ianneub: distinct*
[2012-07-14 17:13:58 -0400] jtimberman: Bonkers: I use fletcher nicol's rbenv cookbook when I want to use rbenv and Chef. It provides a resource for installing gems under rbenv. https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rbenv
[2012-07-14 17:14:38 -0400] jtimberman: ianneub: are you using knife-linode, or knife bootstrap?
[2012-07-14 17:15:02 -0400] ianneub: jtimberman: knife bootstrap
[2012-07-14 17:15:13 -0400] ianneub: jtimberman: does knife-linode call a different bootstrap?
[2012-07-14 17:15:29 -0400] jtimberman: 401 from chef means there was a problem authenticating to the chef server API, either the time is incorrect, or the validation key is incorrect.
[2012-07-14 17:15:32 -0400] ianneub: jtimberman: i've already got the server running
[2012-07-14 17:15:52 -0400] jtimberman: i don't use knife linode, so i'm not sure what its capabilities are without looking at the code.
[2012-07-14 17:17:30 -0400] ianneub: jtimberman: thanks, i'll look into it further, i'm reasonably certain that it doesn't do bootstrapping on its own. i think the issue probable has to do with creating the validation key and maybe hostnames or something along those lines
[2012-07-14 17:18:09 -0400] Bonkers: jtimberman, but as I'm finding out, it's awful for system ruby, you can't use bluepill through rbenv, and chef's gem_package won't install to rbenv rubies
[2012-07-14 17:19:50 -0400] jtimberman: Bonkers: do you mean you can't use Opscode's bluepill cookbook to manage bluepill through rbenv?
[2012-07-14 17:20:08 -0400] jtimberman: ianneub: knife bootstrap in 10.12 will use 'chef-full' as the bootstrap template.
[2012-07-14 17:20:14 -0400] Bonkers: jtimberman, I mean bluepill just doesn't work through rbenv really, not considering chef
[2012-07-14 17:20:39 -0400] jtimberman: Bonkers: ah. i don't actually use bluepill for anything. i much prefer runit.
[2012-07-14 17:20:45 -0400] Bonkers: jtimberman, system services are installed by linking to bluepill, but if you link /etc/init.d/foo to /usr/local/rbenv/shims/bluepill, $ARGV gets lost
[2012-07-14 17:23:17 -0400] Bonkers: not the biggest deal though, I can just install the distro's ruby for system
[2012-07-14 17:23:25 -0400] Bonkers: still using rbenv for app deployment
[2012-07-14 17:23:39 -0400] Bonkers: bluepill and runit seem to be extremely similar from what I can tell
[2012-07-14 17:23:40 -0400] ianneub: jtimberman: thanks for your help! it was due to the hostname being set to 'localhost' by default, once i gave it a unique name it works fine.
[2012-07-14 17:23:46 -0400] Bonkers: apart from implementation of course
[2012-07-14 17:25:37 -0400] jtimberman: ianneub: ah :)
[2012-07-14 17:27:01 -0400] jtimberman: Bonkers: sure. they have similar functionality.
[2012-07-14 17:31:06 -0400] jtimberman: i've used bluepill just enough to have worked on our cookbook :)
[2012-07-14 17:43:27 -0400] Mithrandir: _aeris_: please turn off public away
[2012-07-14 17:43:42 -0400] _aeris_: this is why i try to do ><
[2012-07-14 17:43:46 -0400] _aeris_: failed test
[2012-07-14 17:50:38 -0400] countdigi: anyone running chef-solo and using a different method for search?
[2012-07-14 20:37:33 -0400] ranjibd__: we need a chef aware orchestrator..
[2012-07-14 20:38:02 -0400] ranjibd__: im so frustrated with the other elaborate alternatives...
[2012-07-14 21:12:22 -0400] RJ2: anyone know why spork is looking in the wrong place for my git repo? "Opening git repo /home/rj/-chef/" <-- dunno where it gets that path from
[2012-07-14 21:12:28 -0400] RJ2: knife works fine in general
[2012-07-14 21:53:39 -0400] red5: hi! i'd like to know how to active my virtualenv using chef?
[2012-07-14 21:54:29 -0400] red5: i've tried to command "source /env/bin/activate" but it doesn't work.
[2012-07-14 22:15:44 -0400] c_t: sorry, I meant *just* for ~/ and ~/.chef
[2012-07-14 22:15:45 -0400] c_t: gah
[2012-07-14 22:15:54 -0400] c_t: sorry, all
[2012-07-14 22:19:21 -0400] dwhsix: anyone run into the deploy resource failing to link from the cached-copy to the release dir?
[2012-07-14 22:28:23 -0400] dwhsix: ah, everybody's off having fun I'll just poke at it myself and see where I can get
