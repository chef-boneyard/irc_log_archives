[2012-07-08 00:02:24 -0400] erikh: are you using rvm at lal?
[2012-07-08 00:02:27 -0400] erikh: all?
[2012-07-08 00:02:27 -0400] bawt_: all is correct except for enabled. I set it to true, it remains false
[2012-07-08 00:02:29 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, I find the whole subject matter of a trusted CA to be monopoly style
[2012-07-08 00:02:46 -0400] coderanger: jhayden: You need to install it in the chef ruby install, presuming you are using omnibus
[2012-07-08 00:02:53 -0400] coderanger: jhayden: Use the chef_gem resource
[2012-07-08 00:03:54 -0400] jhayden: pardon my ignorance but what is the omnibus installer?
[2012-07-08 00:04:48 -0400] coderanger: The (current) normal way to install chef onto servers is our omnibus debs or rpms, which drop an isolated ruby+etc install in /opt/chef
[2012-07-08 00:05:32 -0400] jhayden: coderanger: can this be done via a knife ec2 server install?
[2012-07-08 00:05:42 -0400] coderanger: It is the default when you do that, yes
[2012-07-08 00:06:12 -0400] coderanger: you just need a 'chef_gem "right_aws"' in your recipes
[2012-07-08 00:07:56 -0400] jhayden: coderanger: as opposed to a gem_install?
[2012-07-08 00:08:18 -0400] coderanger: Yes, the normal gem package resource installs to the _system_ ruby
[2012-07-08 00:08:20 -0400] coderanger: not to chef's
[2012-07-08 00:08:56 -0400] erikh: they changed that?
[2012-07-08 00:09:06 -0400] jhayden: I'll give that a try, thanks
[2012-07-08 00:09:11 -0400] erikh: it used to install to the chef ruby, but you needed to Gem.refresh to get it to pick up the changes during the run
[2012-07-08 00:09:17 -0400] erikh: (by default)
[2012-07-08 00:09:17 -0400] jan0232: heh, this really needs to get more attention :)
[2012-07-08 00:09:34 -0400] erikh: it's really a rubygems issue, sort of
[2012-07-08 00:09:37 -0400] erikh: it's not an easy problem.
[2012-07-08 00:09:56 -0400] hoover_damm: yfeldblum, I've always believed in the expectation of the end user to verify the RSA key they see is who they say it is.  Once you put someone in charge of verifying for you and doing the due diligence for you (it stops working for your advantage)
[2012-07-08 00:10:35 -0400] hoover_damm: like for knife ec2 there's nothing stopping it from booting an instance waiting for the console output to get the rsa key, add that to known_hosts and then ssh in and bootstrap
[2012-07-08 00:10:51 -0400] hoover_damm: most end users wouldn't want to wait up to 5 minutes to know what their rsa/dsa key is
[2012-07-08 00:14:51 -0400] coderanger: erikh: Yes, the defaults have changed
[2012-07-08 00:14:57 -0400] coderanger: And chef_gem handles the refresh too
[2012-07-08 00:15:15 -0400] red5: opa chef!
[2012-07-08 00:15:42 -0400] red5: i would like to know how to use the cookbook for python ?
[2012-07-08 00:15:50 -0400] coderanger: Which one?
[2012-07-08 00:15:55 -0400] coderanger: python or application_python?
[2012-07-08 00:17:41 -0400] red5: coderanger: python
[2012-07-08 00:18:11 -0400] coderanger: Just grab the cookbook via knife (or librarian) and thats kind of it
[2012-07-08 00:18:29 -0400] coderanger: What issues are you running in to?
[2012-07-08 00:18:48 -0400] hoover_damm: depend on python and go
[2012-07-08 00:18:50 -0400] hoover_damm: pretty much
[2012-07-08 00:18:59 -0400] hoover_damm: include it if you need to :)
[2012-07-08 00:19:08 -0400] red5: coderanger: i need to change the instalation dir for python
[2012-07-08 00:19:35 -0400] red5: coderanger: and override default attributes.
[2012-07-08 00:19:49 -0400] hoover_damm: red5, https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/python/blob/master/attributes/default.rb
[2012-07-08 00:19:52 -0400] hoover_damm: override it
[2012-07-08 00:20:24 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, same way as always, override it in a role or another cookbook
[2012-07-08 00:21:43 -0400] red5: hoover_damm: can i override this attributes using json?
[2012-07-08 00:25:42 -0400] hoover_damm: red5, perhaps? try it?
[2012-07-08 00:33:54 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, hah, well, end users verifying keys is unlikely to become commonplace anytime soon
[2012-07-08 00:34:24 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, given how much effort it took getting people too look for the browser's padlock icon
[2012-07-08 00:35:45 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, trusted CA isn't really monopoly at all, since there are hundreds of CAs trusted by the major OS distributions and browser distributions, and given the price wars and quality wars between them
[2012-07-08 00:37:23 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damm, problem with the trusted CA is, as i recently read somewhere, that in the current situation the incentives CAs have are drastically mis-aligned compared to the incentives normal users would want them to have
[2012-07-08 00:59:03 -0400] erikh: coderanger: ah! good to know, thank you!
[2012-07-08 06:01:45 -0400] Mithrandir: yfeldblum: SSL has a couple of extra roundtrips in the TCP setup phase.
[2012-07-08 08:17:50 -0400] kesor: using vagrant to test chef is waay too slow, isn't there a better way?
[2012-07-08 09:38:38 -0400] mithun: does the opensource version of chef has a web client?
[2012-07-08 09:39:46 -0400] Babar: what do you mean by web client?
[2012-07-08 09:43:08 -0400] mithun: Babar, i mean the web management console
[2012-07-08 09:43:26 -0400] Babar: sure
[2012-07-08 09:43:37 -0400] mithun: Babar, i would like to know how chef is better when compared to puppet or cfengine
[2012-07-08 09:43:51 -0400] Babar: for me, it's different
[2012-07-08 09:43:56 -0400] mithun: integrating is puppet with puppet-dashboard is really a hell
[2012-07-08 09:44:01 -0400] Babar: especially compared to puppet
[2012-07-08 09:44:10 -0400] mithun: Babar, is it easy?
[2012-07-08 09:44:49 -0400] Babar: puppet's philosophy is that you have a tree of dependencies, which you have to build, and if a node fails, all its leaf fail, but not the rest of the tree. In chef, it's linear. At least that's the principal difference which make me pick one of the other depending on the situation
[2012-07-08 09:47:03 -0400] Babar: I'd say chef is ideal for cloud usage, whereas puppet / cfengine are more suitable for local on. That said, I run one of my cluster on chef :)
[2012-07-08 09:47:36 -0400] mithun: Babar, my requirement is to manage around 300 Linux Desktops. just like the windows group policy i tried puppet and used the gconf layer to lockdown various stuffs, but still not successfull in integrating the dashboard
[2012-07-08 09:48:10 -0400] Babar: dashboard? Have you tried... what's its name again... foreman?
[2012-07-08 09:48:59 -0400] mithun: Babar, yes, just started with foreman, but thought of searching alternatives like chef if there is a better integrated management console
[2012-07-08 09:49:52 -0400] Babar: never tried chef on windows, to be honest
[2012-07-08 09:50:07 -0400] mithun: Babar, why all these configuration management tools are build on ruby and RoR? its really a pain to deploy
[2012-07-08 09:50:26 -0400] Babar: I wish I knew :)
[2012-07-08 09:50:44 -0400] mithun: Babar, if it was PHP or python i think it could have been much easy.
[2012-07-08 09:51:32 -0400] mithun: Babar, as far as my experience the softwares build on ruby is also just like ruby, many ways to attain a single goal
[2012-07-08 09:51:47 -0400] Babar: LOL
[2012-07-08 09:52:06 -0400] Babar: you just lost all the credibility I had in you by picking the other languages
[2012-07-08 09:52:09 -0400] mithun: Babar, and when it comes to integrating two products (for example puppet and its dashboard) there are thousand ways, and only 10 of them works
[2012-07-08 09:52:58 -0400] Babar: which would be exactly the same in PHP (except none of them would work properly), or python (except you'd have no idea why one works and the other doesn't)
[2012-07-08 09:53:02 -0400] mithun: Babar, i agree that ruby is might be way better than the languages i picked.
[2012-07-08 09:53:03 -0400] Babar: but hey, that's trolling
[2012-07-08 09:53:21 -0400] mithun: Babar, ROFL
[2012-07-08 09:54:38 -0400] mithun: Babar, yesterday i had a problem like i used passenger to run puppet, and also used passenger to run puppet-dashboard. and puppet-dashboard was not working complaining that another version of rake is already loaded
[2012-07-08 09:54:57 -0400] Babar: yeah, heard that one before :)
[2012-07-08 09:55:34 -0400] mithun: Babar, i admit that its my lack of knowledge in ruby world that i might be finding it difficult to setup the whole stuff
[2012-07-08 09:55:41 -0400] Babar: anyway, have to go, sorry. And I honestly think chef is a great product, but I'd say that its development is now more geared towards the cloud, where it totally rocks. To manage desktops, especially windows desktops, I'd stick with puppet.
[2012-07-08 09:56:09 -0400] Babar: mithun: been there. done that. Now happy that it's working, and that my ruby knowledge has increased a little
[2012-07-08 09:56:14 -0400] mithun: Babar, i am not managing windows desktops using puppet.
[2012-07-08 09:56:29 -0400] mithun: Babar, anyway thank you for your time :)
[2012-07-08 09:56:36 -0400] Babar: oh right, you said Linux. me bad
[2012-07-08 09:56:50 -0400] mithun: Babar, let me stick on puppet for time being.
[2012-07-08 09:56:53 -0400] Babar: then that's pretty much what I do with chef.
[2012-07-08 09:57:10 -0400] mithun: Babar, i am working on hadoop clustering and will check chef for that
[2012-07-08 09:57:45 -0400] Babar: but, as I never use the web interface, I can't tell you anything about its usage. Used to be great, but I'm a sysadmin, so knife is so much better for me
[2012-07-08 09:58:13 -0400] Babar: I tried to configure hadoop through chef, but has hadoop was killing the desktops, I gave up. Stupid java.
[2012-07-08 09:58:20 -0400] Babar: (now really have to go)
[2012-07-08 10:16:34 -0400] withnale: if I want to make use of a personal gem library in my cookbooks but don't want it to get installed on the target client, is there a way to do this cleanly?
[2012-07-08 10:37:16 -0400] kesor: gem_package accepts a gem_binary argument you can use.
[2012-07-08 11:40:53 -0400] hippiehacker: https://gist.github.com/3070610 # anyone seen behavior like this?
[2012-07-08 12:25:23 -0400] jacobat: I'm seeing chef-client daemons that hog resources and never terminate. Any ideas what might be causing this?
[2012-07-08 12:42:06 -0400] erikh: hippiehacker: sounds like an ohai issue
[2012-07-08 12:42:18 -0400] erikh: anyhow, i'm way past my bedtime. night
[2012-07-08 14:38:25 -0400] hippiehacker: anyone having issues downloading cookbooks with hosted chef?
[2012-07-08 14:40:56 -0400] _aeris_: hello #chef
[2012-07-08 14:41:22 -0400] _aeris_: is there any way to create new client when configuring knife on a workstation ?
[2012-07-08 14:41:50 -0400] _aeris_: even if we have validation.pem, knife expect client-name.pem too
[2012-07-08 14:42:16 -0400] _aeris_: and we must create this client from webui to fetch this key
[2012-07-08 14:42:35 -0400] hippiehacker: opscode-staff: https://gist.github.com/3071238 # hosted-chef issue?
[2012-07-08 14:42:49 -0400] _aeris_: chef-client can do it, why not knife ?
[2012-07-08 14:51:43 -0400] hippiehacker: _aeris_: I don't think the validator.pem can create admin clients
[2012-07-08 14:51:52 -0400] hippiehacker: it just allows nodes to be created
[2012-07-08 14:53:16 -0400] hippiehacker: you have to use the webui.pem (the client authentication used by the webserver in opensource-chef) to create other admin clients that can upload cookbooks etc with knife
[2012-07-08 14:57:27 -0400] hippiehacker: _aeris_: basically validator.pem authenticates as an api-client that does not have admin privs, so it can't create new admin users (necessary for use in knife) only new client+node
[2012-07-08 19:39:05 -0400] dwhsix: any tips on why I'm getting "LoadError: no such file to load -- mysql" with the database cookbook?
[2012-07-08 19:39:14 -0400] dwhsix: full stacktrace here:
[2012-07-08 19:39:17 -0400] dwhsix: https://gist.github.com/3072492
[2012-07-08 19:39:37 -0400] dwhsix: seems like this is a common problem, but I'm baffed how to fix
[2012-07-08 19:39:40 -0400] dwhsix: *baffled
[2012-07-08 19:41:52 -0400] dwhsix: hmm, probably because when I do "/opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem list", mysql isn't in the list?
[2012-07-08 19:42:39 -0400] jan0232: dwhsix: maybe because on omnibus installs gem_package installed mysql in the wrong rubygems??
[2012-07-08 19:44:31 -0400] dwhsix: jan0232: thx but not sure I understand.  any suggested fix?
[2012-07-08 19:44:53 -0400] jan0232: dwhsix: not sure. maybe try chef_gem "mysql"
[2012-07-08 19:45:57 -0400] dwhsix: thx I guess in one of my recipes?
[2012-07-08 19:46:09 -0400] jan0232: whats the cookbook you're using?
[2012-07-08 19:59:25 -0400] dwhsix: sorry didn't see your Q
[2012-07-08 19:59:37 -0400] dwhsix: application cookbook
[2012-07-08 20:00:09 -0400] dwhsix: has been working fine, but I suspect new chef version may be causing issues
[2012-07-08 20:01:20 -0400] jan0232: well i'm also desperately trying to get application_ruby cookbook working :D
[2012-07-08 20:02:33 -0400] dwhsix: ;-) first time around was a pain & very confusin
[2012-07-08 20:02:52 -0400] dwhsix: so I'm happy to help
[2012-07-08 20:03:06 -0400] dwhsix: I think I'm running into http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1009 and all its related tickets
[2012-07-08 20:03:47 -0400] jan0232: ok it seems they have fixed this with chef gem ??
[2012-07-08 20:03:55 -0400] jan0232: chef_gem
[2012-07-08 20:04:25 -0400] dwhsix: and https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql/pull/1 , which seems to have gone into limbo
[2012-07-08 20:04:58 -0400] dwhsix: maybe yes, but I confess I'm not fully grokking the chef_gem stuff
[2012-07-08 20:05:35 -0400] jan0232: seems like an easy fix.
[2012-07-08 20:05:54 -0400] jan0232: edit the client.rb to look like this
[2012-07-08 20:05:54 -0400] jan0232: https://github.com/RiotGames/mysql-cookbook/blob/0328e821f09742192df4da643daf3d4077b2a06c/recipes/client.rb
[2012-07-08 20:06:16 -0400] jan0232: try if that works...
[2012-07-08 20:07:00 -0400] dwhsix: I'm actually using the RiotGames fork ;-) at least I think I am
[2012-07-08 20:07:03 -0400] dwhsix: I'll double-check
[2012-07-08 20:08:40 -0400] dwhsix: son of a gun, maybe I'm not...
[2012-07-08 20:09:08 -0400] jan0232: i am going crazy myself ;)
[2012-07-08 20:10:02 -0400] jan0232: if it continues like that i might smash some vas and throw them out of the windowoh wait..
[2012-07-08 20:10:11 -0400] jan0232: s/vas/vms
[2012-07-08 20:14:44 -0400] hoover_damm: jan0232, throwing vax's or vms out of the window usually requires a lot of strength
[2012-07-08 20:14:55 -0400] hoover_damm: jan0232, it's been awhile since I moved a piece of one personally
[2012-07-08 20:16:36 -0400] hoover_damm: my high school was using an IBM Mainframe and it was dogging us (1992) and we were looking at upgrading and DU (Denver University) was nice enough to offer us a VAX server... only condition was you haul it
[2012-07-08 20:16:47 -0400] hoover_damm: that's your first and last warning sign when it comes to computer hardware
[2012-07-08 20:16:55 -0400] hoover_damm: you haul it = run!
[2012-07-08 20:20:55 -0400] dwhsix: sorry, was away for a moment
[2012-07-08 20:21:14 -0400] hoover_damm: dwhsix, use chef_gem "mysql"
[2012-07-08 20:21:27 -0400] dwhsix: hoover_damm: thanks, but where?
[2012-07-08 20:21:30 -0400] hoover_damm: dwhsix, the regular gem resource doesn't work with the embedded / omnibus
[2012-07-08 20:21:40 -0400] hoover_damm: dwhsix, search and replace the gem "mysql" bit with that
[2012-07-08 20:21:40 -0400] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-07-08 20:21:52 -0400] dwhsix: k, lemme look
[2012-07-08 20:22:21 -0400] dwhsix: part of the problem may also be that I'm not using the form/version of mysql cookbook I thought I was :-(
[2012-07-08 20:22:25 -0400] dwhsix: gah: fork
[2012-07-08 20:22:36 -0400] hoover_damm: using RiotGames's fork or someone elses?
[2012-07-08 20:22:47 -0400] hoover_damm: that bug your running into there is really more of a design change
[2012-07-08 20:23:28 -0400] hoover_damm: with a regular non-omnibus chef install it likely would work
[2012-07-08 20:25:36 -0400] dwhsix: yeah, part of what's going on is that I'm testing changes on a new ec2 server, and my local chef is also updated so I think I'm using omnibus for the first time
[2012-07-08 20:25:42 -0400] dwhsix: with existing cookbooks
[2012-07-08 20:25:58 -0400] dwhsix: hoover_damm: yes, I *thought* I was using RiotGames fork, checking again
[2012-07-08 20:30:32 -0400] dwhsix: so I'm confused chef_gem isn't used at all in master of RiotGames fork of mysql cookbook
[2012-07-08 20:30:38 -0400] dwhsix: or am I being braindead?
[2012-07-08 20:31:27 -0400] dwhsix: Uses gem_package: https://github.com/RiotGames/mysql-cookbook/blob/master/recipes/client.rb#L70
[2012-07-08 20:31:39 -0400] hoover_damm: dwhsix, most people don't use chef_gem likely
[2012-07-08 20:31:49 -0400] dwhsix: ah
[2012-07-08 20:31:56 -0400] hoover_damm: dwhsix, it's somewhat new so perhaps just more shoving it around? :)
[2012-07-08 20:33:39 -0400] dwhsix: yah
[2012-07-08 20:34:01 -0400] dwhsix: I think I need to back up a couple of steps changing too much & starting to thrash
[2012-07-08 20:34:15 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-07-08 20:34:20 -0400] hoover_damm: step back and try again :)
[2012-07-08 20:34:37 -0400] hoover_damm: honestly I think that is the hardest part of chef is stepping back a few steps and trying it again
[2012-07-08 20:34:47 -0400] dwhsix: and rap myself on the knuckles for not being more disciplined about commits and stashes ;-)
[2012-07-08 20:34:49 -0400] hoover_damm: it shouldn't be
[2012-07-08 20:34:51 -0400] dwhsix: yeah
[2012-07-08 20:34:55 -0400] hoover_damm: but a lot of people seem to have a lot of issues with it
[2012-07-08 20:34:59 -0400] hoover_damm: they really don't want to let go of code
[2012-07-08 20:35:27 -0400] hoover_damm: I had that problem once... asked my boss for permission to take what I had learned and try again... he +1'd it and it was 500x better
[2012-07-08 20:35:33 -0400] dwhsix: well, on another project we've had a lot of difficulty with keeping git, chef server, etc in synch
[2012-07-08 20:35:36 -0400] hoover_damm: now I routinely do that just to produce a better product
[2012-07-08 20:36:12 -0400] dwhsix: someone had put together a presentation on their multi-developer chef workflow need to go find it again
[2012-07-08 20:36:37 -0400] dwhsix: but on this other project the only one screwing stuff up is me ;-)
[2012-07-08 20:36:37 -0400] hoover_damm: there's so many presentations I could have done
[2012-07-08 20:36:47 -0400] hoover_damm: and so much learning unshared
[2012-07-08 20:36:48 -0400] hoover_damm: :(
[2012-07-08 20:37:17 -0400] dwhsix: yup it takes time & effort to share the learning
[2012-07-08 20:37:41 -0400] hoover_damm: I ended up starting my own worg last night (wiki in org-mode)
[2012-07-08 20:38:04 -0400] hoover_damm: just because I realized I had some really awesome ideas years ago I wish I had written down because now i'm going back the same path
[2012-07-08 20:38:18 -0400] hoover_damm: and stubbing my toes because I have to re-learn things that were a pain enough to learn the first time
[2012-07-08 20:38:28 -0400] hoover_damm: redocument the same crud
[2012-07-08 20:38:30 -0400] dwhsix: hear ya
[2012-07-08 20:38:30 -0400] hoover_damm: so worg it
[2012-07-08 20:38:45 -0400] hoover_damm: dunno how it'll be, but should be fun
[2012-07-08 21:10:34 -0400] jan0232: dwhsix: would you have an idea why with the application cookbook my runit service won't work? at least it appears it's not working because under /etc/sv/appname/log/current  i always get error messagesevery second...
[2012-07-08 21:11:21 -0400] dwhsix: unfortunately, I'm not using runit service
[2012-07-08 21:11:36 -0400] jan0232: dwhsix: didn't you say you use the application cookbook?
[2012-07-08 21:11:39 -0400] dwhsix: actually, duh - yes I am
[2012-07-08 21:11:52 -0400] dwhsix: what are the error messages?
[2012-07-08 21:12:15 -0400] jan0232: chpst: fatal: unable to run: bundle: file does not exist
[2012-07-08 21:12:53 -0400] jan0232: i looked at the /etc/sv/appname/run script it looks like this
[2012-07-08 21:13:03 -0400] jan0232: exec chpst -u app:app bundle exec unicorn -E production -c /etc/unicorn/app.rb
[2012-07-08 21:13:45 -0400] jan0232: it does cd into the app/current directory before that the directory is there so is bundler in my ruby version the app is using
[2012-07-08 21:13:57 -0400] jan0232: if i ssh into the machine and do the exact same command.it works
[2012-07-08 21:15:24 -0400] dwhsix: sorry, you're beyond me
[2012-07-08 21:15:29 -0400] dwhsix: that's not ringing any bells
[2012-07-08 21:16:19 -0400] jan0232: i get stopped by so many problems :( i may need to rethink the way i do this whole thing
[2012-07-08 21:16:59 -0400] dwhsix: I found the application cookbook pretty confusing
[2012-07-08 21:17:12 -0400] dwhsix: altho did finally get it to work
[2012-07-08 21:17:25 -0400] jan0232: well it seems pretty straight forward to me but it just doesn't work for me :D
[2012-07-08 21:17:29 -0400] dwhsix: I'm not running my app w/ runit, though trying to remember if there was a reason why
[2012-07-08 21:17:30 -0400] dwhsix: ha
[2012-07-08 21:17:48 -0400] jan0232: not sure how i would disable using runit
[2012-07-08 21:17:54 -0400] jan0232: unless i change the cookbook itself
[2012-07-08 21:18:49 -0400] jan0232: maybe i should do my own application cookbook in the end you could customize everything and use deploy_revision directly, right!?
[2012-07-08 21:19:25 -0400] dwhsix: sure part of what I found confusing about app cookbook is that because it tries to handle lots of different kinds of apps
[2012-07-08 21:19:34 -0400] dwhsix: (java, php, django, etc)
[2012-07-08 21:19:46 -0400] dwhsix: was confusing what was really needed for rails vs. other stuff
[2012-07-08 21:20:06 -0400] dwhsix: I'm trying to refresh my memory how I'm running my app ;-) and why
[2012-07-08 21:20:30 -0400] jan0232: dwhsix: well yea even more confusing all the recipes are deprecated. should use application cookbook as a dependency for your own cookbookat least thats what I'm doing
[2012-07-08 21:20:33 -0400] dwhsix: I migrated it from rubber and I may have carried some of that cruft along
[2012-07-08 21:21:53 -0400] jan0232: are you hosting on ec2?
[2012-07-08 21:21:58 -0400] dwhsix: yu
[2012-07-08 21:21:59 -0400] dwhsix: yup
[2012-07-08 21:22:05 -0400] jan0232: mysql?
[2012-07-08 21:22:05 -0400] bawt_: mysql is fail.
[2012-07-08 21:22:10 -0400] dwhsix: actually, right, I'm running rails via passenger
[2012-07-08 21:22:16 -0400] dwhsix: yes, mysql
[2012-07-08 21:22:37 -0400] dwhsix: that's what I'm banging my head against maybe I should just run an RDS instance and be done with it
[2012-07-08 21:23:01 -0400] dwhsix: but that's more $$
[2012-07-08 21:23:02 -0400] jan0232: ok that'll be my next thing too once this crap is running :)
[2012-07-08 21:23:43 -0400] jan0232: dwhsix: rails via passengerso are you using application_ruby with passenger_apache2?
[2012-07-08 21:24:18 -0400] jan0232: dwhsix: or what cookbooks?
[2012-07-08 21:24:54 -0400] jan0232: bawt_: postgresql?
[2012-07-08 21:24:54 -0400] bawt_: postgresql is a defined role
[2012-07-08 21:24:59 -0400] jan0232: :D
[2012-07-08 21:25:12 -0400] jan0232: bawt_: mysql?
[2012-07-08 21:25:12 -0400] bawt_: mysql is fail.
[2012-07-08 21:25:17 -0400] jan0232: damn :D
[2012-07-08 21:25:55 -0400] jan0232: bawt_: nginx?
[2012-07-08 21:25:55 -0400] bawt_: nginx is pretty darn fast truthfully
[2012-07-08 21:26:41 -0400] jan0232: bawt_: unicorn?
[2012-07-08 21:27:39 -0400] dwhsix: jan0232: I'd need to look and unf at the moment have to go
[2012-07-08 21:27:43 -0400] dwhsix: may be back later
[2012-07-08 21:27:51 -0400] jan0232: dwhsix: ok no problem
[2012-07-08 21:56:36 -0400] Mithrandir: bawt_: forget mysql
[2012-07-08 21:56:36 -0400] bawt_: okay then :)
[2012-07-08 21:56:42 -0400] Mithrandir: bawt_: forget postgresql
[2012-07-08 21:56:42 -0400] bawt_: sure
[2012-07-08 21:56:46 -0400] Mithrandir: bawt_: forget nginx
[2012-07-08 21:56:46 -0400] bawt_: fine
[2012-07-08 22:01:16 -0400] hoover_damm: damn bawt is funny
[2012-07-08 22:02:29 -0400] Mithrandir: yeah, sometimes is. :-)
[2012-07-08 22:02:42 -0400] jan0232: bawt_: mysql?
[2012-07-08 22:02:47 -0400] Mithrandir: confuses people a lot when it happens and they don't realise it's a bot, though.
[2012-07-08 22:02:48 -0400] jan0232: ah  ok :)
[2012-07-08 22:03:13 -0400] Mithrandir: jan0232: sorry to be a killjoy, just trying to make it not contain too much random  garbage.
[2012-07-08 22:03:17 -0400] jan0232: how does "he" get fed?
[2012-07-08 22:03:36 -0400] jan0232: no wait..bah my english is bad..
[2012-07-08 22:03:39 -0400] Mithrandir: somebody says "foo is bar" and then you can query for foo.
[2012-07-08 22:03:53 -0400] jan0232: bawt_: foo?
[2012-07-08 22:03:53 -0400] bawt_: foo is just an example ...
[2012-07-08 22:03:56 -0400] jan0232: i see
[2012-07-08 22:03:58 -0400] jan0232: :D
[2012-07-08 22:04:07 -0400] Mithrandir: please don't fill it with crap, though
[2012-07-08 22:04:35 -0400] jan0232: i thought the bot listens to everything and fills it whenever it sees that "something" is "something"...
[2012-07-08 22:04:42 -0400] jan0232: i don't want to fill it :D
[2012-07-08 22:05:29 -0400] jan0232: you probably have to explicitly tell it i guess :)
[2012-07-08 22:40:27 -0400] hoover_damm: bawt_, forget about foo
[2012-07-08 22:40:28 -0400] bawt_: couldn't find keyword about foo
[2012-07-08 22:40:31 -0400] hoover_damm: bawt_, forget about foo?
[2012-07-08 22:40:31 -0400] bawt_: couldn't find keyword about foo?
[2012-07-08 22:40:38 -0400] hoover_damm: fah
[2012-07-08 22:57:37 -0400] jan0232: bawt_: rails?
[2012-07-08 22:57:37 -0400] bawt_: rails is cool man
[2012-07-08 23:06:58 -0400] jan0232: does anybody know how i can use a different template file when i depend on another cookbook that uses it...
[2012-07-08 23:08:26 -0400] jan0232: say for example cookbook foo would create a file with a template under templates/default/file.erb  now i create another cookbook bar that uses the foo cookbook. could i somehow tell the foo template to use the one i have in bar?
[2012-07-08 23:08:27 -0400] jan0232: :D
[2012-07-08 23:08:40 -0400] hoover_damm: ah yes org-publish works
[2012-07-08 23:44:04 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, yes
[2012-07-08 23:44:35 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, in your second recipe, which includes the first recipe via `include_recipe`, reopen the template declared in the first recipe and change its attributes
[2012-07-08 23:45:36 -0400] yfeldblum: jan0232, `include_recipe "first-cookbook::recipe-name" ; t = resources("template[/path/to/file.conf]") ; t.cookbook("second-cookbook")`
[2012-07-08 23:46:44 -0400] jan0232: ohh ok..i think i get it...
[2012-07-08 23:46:57 -0400] jan0232: yfeldblum: thanks will try that out
