[2012-10-07 00:00:21 -0400] ekristen: oh cb == cookbook
[2012-10-07 00:03:21 -0400] josephholsten: ekristen: if you're using chef server, yes via search('node', 'role:redis_master') or similar. if chef solo, not so much.
[2012-10-07 00:03:36 -0400] ekristen: josephholsten: definitely chef server ;-)
[2012-10-07 00:03:59 -0400] josephholsten: though you'll want to do the search with *roles* attribute not merely role
[2012-10-07 00:04:00 -0400] ekristen: josephholsten: I just recently fixed the mongodb cb to be able to do replication, so now redis is next for me ;-)
[2012-10-07 00:04:20 -0400] ekristen: roles* so that it will catch any sub children or embedded ;-)
[2012-10-07 00:05:38 -0400] josephholsten: ekristen: did you make those changes to https://github.com/edelight/chef-mongodb ?
[2012-10-07 00:06:12 -0400] ekristen: josephholsten: I've made them to my fork, but I'm still testing before I do a pull request
[2012-10-07 00:06:19 -0400] josephholsten: awesome!
[2012-10-07 00:08:46 -0400] ekristen: ;-) -- if you know anyone who is looking to test, that'd be great --- the current replica set recipe had no chance of working (I'm assuming it work once upon a time, maybe several mongodb versions ago or something)
[2012-10-07 00:09:27 -0400] josephholsten: I am, we're currently running without replication and it makes me nervous
[2012-10-07 00:10:09 -0400] josephholsten: esp as I just started getting warnings from nagios about low disk space...
[2012-10-07 00:11:10 -0400] ekristen: josephholsten: so if mongo is already installed, all you should have to do is add my replica set recipe, it should detect that there is no replica set created yet and initialize it
[2012-10-07 00:11:46 -0400] ekristen: and then for each additional node you add the recipe to it will reconfigure the replica set to include any servers in chef in the proper chef env that has the replica set recipe and same cluster name
[2012-10-07 00:13:17 -0400] josephholsten: yeah, so I think I need to read the docs a bit to know what you just said
[2012-10-07 00:26:56 -0400] hoover_damm: and mms
[2012-10-07 00:26:58 -0400] hoover_damm: to help alert
[2012-10-07 00:29:37 -0400] ekristen: ?
[2012-10-07 00:30:11 -0400] josephholsten: hoover_damm: I was just looking at that github issue
[2012-10-07 00:30:17 -0400] josephholsten: https://github.com/edelight/chef-mongodb/pull/12
[2012-10-07 00:30:29 -0400] hoover_damm: 10gen mms
[2012-10-07 00:41:47 -0400] z: last time I played with MMS it was fairly severely lacking
[2012-10-07 00:43:38 -0400] hoover_damm: z, I'm no mongodb expert but I found the tooling to be lacking in general
[2012-10-07 00:44:07 -0400] z: https://mms.10gen.com/help/usage.html
[2012-10-07 00:44:08 -0400] hoover_damm: z, running munin and storing it in rrd's that get shoved up to 10gen's service is unideal
[2012-10-07 00:44:13 -0400] z: Yeah so that hasn't improved. Alerting is a total joke.
[2012-10-07 00:44:47 -0400] hoover_damm: +1 to that
[2012-10-07 00:45:13 -0400] hoover_damm: I'm going to take a look at Diamond and how it fares with just the regular db stats calls going into graphite
[2012-10-07 00:45:22 -0400] hoover_damm: doubt that'll make my client cancel their 10gen contract
[2012-10-07 00:45:31 -0400] hoover_damm: but we are moving to postgres longterm
[2012-10-07 00:45:38 -0400] z: ++
[2012-10-07 00:45:42 -0400] hoover_damm: and my 9.2 cookbook is working ++ great
[2012-10-07 00:45:52 -0400] hoover_damm: I need to spend more time loving it up, but it works
[2012-10-07 00:46:14 -0400] z: the developers I last worked with who used MongoDB regretted it ~9 months into the project, by which time it was all but too late to reverse out
[2012-10-07 00:46:39 -0400] hoover_damm: Yeah I was going to ask how that worked out
[2012-10-07 00:46:44 -0400] hoover_damm: but I guess that's the answer :)
[2012-10-07 00:46:45 -0400] z: we had 10gen in to do tech overviews + training to get people more clued up
[2012-10-07 00:47:05 -0400] z: and the general response to DBA-esque questions like, "How does that actually work?" was "Its magic, trust us"
[2012-10-07 00:47:22 -0400] hoover_damm: what burned me honestly was when 10gen contacted my client's CEO and suggested that we get training
[2012-10-07 00:47:24 -0400] z: there's some good shit in their stack, for sure :-)
[2012-10-07 00:47:47 -0400] hoover_damm: they had been trying to resolve scaling problems, and that was basically the response from the tickets
[2012-10-07 00:48:08 -0400] hoover_damm: It's unfortunately why we don't pay Boundary
[2012-10-07 00:48:26 -0400] hoover_damm: they annoy the crap out of my team with 'Would you like to do an Interview? emails'...
[2012-10-07 00:48:29 -0400] z: problem is the documentation could be significantly better, community and tooling are non-existent, and things like MMS (itself a 10gen thing) are *not* a good story which IMHO lets the whole thin down
[2012-10-07 00:48:37 -0400] hoover_damm: which every time we find value in the servie we go... but wait, don't they annoy the crap out of us?
[2012-10-07 00:49:04 -0400] hoover_damm: I just let our accountant deal with it, as we should be paying for it.
[2012-10-07 00:49:24 -0400] z: <3 Boundary
[2012-10-07 00:49:36 -0400] hoover_damm: indeed
[2012-10-07 00:49:46 -0400] siezer: trying to build a bento box... anyone know how to disable the "scp the vboxguestadditions" thing?
[2012-10-07 00:49:56 -0400] siezer: (veewee question)
[2012-10-07 00:50:04 -0400] hoover_damm: z, sounds like the rhertoric I spun out when we shotdown mongodb support when I worked for an old paas
[2012-10-07 00:50:27 -0400] hoover_damm: z, you basically have to be a rocket science dedicated soley to mongodb
[2012-10-07 00:50:40 -0400] z: I would say, "Stop adding new features and fix that shit"
[2012-10-07 00:50:58 -0400] z: But truth is we pushed hard for SSL and other things. Its not feature complete either.
[2012-10-07 00:51:02 -0400] hoover_damm: I would say that 10gen is in a reactive position trying to grow mongodb feature wise
[2012-10-07 00:51:06 -0400] hoover_damm: and stability wise
[2012-10-07 00:51:31 -0400] hoover_damm: toss in NUMA and their whole threading choice is an extra splash of salt
[2012-10-07 00:51:33 -0400] hoover_damm: on the wound
[2012-10-07 00:51:34 -0400] z: I'm back to MySQL for persistent storage now. That works.
[2012-10-07 00:51:48 -0400] z: I'll let 10gen actually finish their product and look again in a year or two
[2012-10-07 00:52:31 -0400] hoover_damm: by then the nature of nosql will change again
[2012-10-07 00:52:36 -0400] z: Most of the time when I've thought "Hey I could totally [ab]use Mongo for that"
[2012-10-07 00:52:53 -0400] z: then about 15 minutes later I realised it'd be 5% hard to use MySQL and 3x safer
[2012-10-07 00:53:13 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-10-07 00:53:23 -0400] hoover_damm: but i'll deploy mongodb just to check out swordfish
[2012-10-07 00:53:34 -0400] z: For what I'm doing I honestly don't see what NoSQL buys me, other than "Its new. Its unproven. It may eat my fucking data".
[2012-10-07 00:53:42 -0400] hoover_damm: if it's useful enough in it's current state, maybe deploy it actually
[2012-10-07 00:54:48 -0400] z: AFAICS porting Swordfish to MySQL is going to be very, very trivial
[2012-10-07 00:56:00 -0400] z: is this getting much news coverage in the US now?  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19857517
[2012-10-07 01:01:05 -0400] josephholsten: wow this cookbook is Not The Right Way (TM)
[2012-10-07 01:03:50 -0400] hoover_damm: edelight?
[2012-10-07 01:04:08 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah my client ended up writing their own cookbook because we just had hacks on top of hacks
[2012-10-07 01:04:26 -0400] hoover_damm: and eventually you just had to pop your head outa your behind and just make your own
[2012-10-07 01:05:05 -0400] josephholsten: oh, I'm specifically referring to my import of the mms-agent cb into it https://github.com/edelight/chef-mongodb/pull/64
[2012-10-07 01:05:26 -0400] josephholsten: bad bad no: https://github.com/josephholsten/mongodb-cookbook/commit/bfed5b827f2c101e5a2fd705eb82190b6dd3bb12#L3R18
[2012-10-07 01:05:37 -0400] josephholsten: wtfbbq? https://github.com/josephholsten/mongodb-cookbook/commit/bfed5b827f2c101e5a2fd705eb82190b6dd3bb12#L3R37
[2012-10-07 01:05:54 -0400] josephholsten: shouldn't this thing ship with an init script? https://github.com/josephholsten/mongodb-cookbook/commit/bfed5b827f2c101e5a2fd705eb82190b6dd3bb12#L3R56
[2012-10-07 01:05:58 -0400] josephholsten: etc
[2012-10-07 01:07:08 -0400] hoover_damm: you poor thing
[2012-10-07 01:07:20 -0400] hoover_damm: Unfortunately I've given up on mongodb
[2012-10-07 01:07:31 -0400] josephholsten: well I'm dumb enough to put my name on the patch
[2012-10-07 01:07:35 -0400] hoover_damm: I just know people have written their own cookbook to get around it
[2012-10-07 01:07:59 -0400] josephholsten: oh, we're in month ~10 of GTFOM
[2012-10-07 01:08:26 -0400] hoover_damm: doesn't 9.2 of postgresql pretty much give you enough to escape on?
[2012-10-07 01:08:33 -0400] hoover_damm: 9.1 was more then enough for us
[2012-10-07 01:08:43 -0400] hoover_damm: when I dropped 9.2 on them they decided to redo the schema for the new features
[2012-10-07 01:08:58 -0400] josephholsten: that's a good point.
[2012-10-07 01:09:19 -0400] hoover_damm: basically mongo locks too much
[2012-10-07 01:09:34 -0400] hoover_damm: it takes a lot to scale
[2012-10-07 01:10:16 -0400] josephholsten: are you all using ltree?
[2012-10-07 01:10:44 -0400] hoover_damm: i have no clue what that is thankfully
[2012-10-07 01:54:27 -0400] schuckles: hi
[2012-10-07 01:54:51 -0400] schuckles: can anyone recommend a means of getting node info and exporting which as an RSS feed?
[2012-10-07 05:18:52 -0400] zts: schuckles: that's a pretty broad goal, the solution probably involves building something.  Some things to think about: when should a new item appear in the RSS feed?  What information should it contain?
[2012-10-07 05:19:31 -0400] tolland: If I want to leave the attributes/default.rb pristine to the sites cookbook, is there a idiom to have another attributes file loaded after default.rb?
[2012-10-07 05:23:53 -0400] coderanger: tolland: Put it in another cookbook?
[2012-10-07 09:21:35 -0400] gyre008: I have an interesting problemI have installed omnibus chef on my chef-serveri.e. removed the chef gem which was there originally and installed the omnibus..now chef-sole can't start because of some paths issues - I think its referencing old paths i.e. when chef was installed via gemarrgh
[2012-10-07 09:21:41 -0400] gyre008: anyone knows how to fix this ?
[2012-10-07 09:22:44 -0400] josephholsten: is your path correct? maybe log out and log back in?
[2012-10-07 09:33:50 -0400] gyre008: josephholsten, well thats the questionwhat should it be
[2012-10-07 09:34:51 -0400] gyre008: chef-client runs without any problems
[2012-10-07 09:38:53 -0400] gyre008: I guess rather than the PATH the problem is GEMPATHchef-sole can't seem to load the required gems
[2012-10-07 10:12:00 -0400] gyre008: I know what the problem isrequire statements in chef-solr...
[2012-10-07 10:16:25 -0400] gyre008: chef-solr can't load omnibus gems.it's loading system gemsand that's where the problem liesanyone experienced this ?
[2012-10-07 10:18:09 -0400] welly: Hi all - having problems with the mysql recipe - Error executing action `restart` on resource 'service[mysql]'
[2012-10-07 10:31:07 -0400] gyre008: welly, mind providing more information ?

[2012-10-07 10:39:00 -0400] gyre008: ok first things firstwhat OS ?
[2012-10-07 10:40:16 -0400] welly: gyre008, ok - running vagrant on OSX and using a ubuntu 12.04 guest OS
[2012-10-07 10:41:18 -0400] gyre008: also check syslog for mysql messages or some mysql-server log where you should find useful info on why the server is not startingthis is very often related to app armor messremove /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysql or something like thatrestart apparmor and you should be fine imho
[2012-10-07 10:41:32 -0400] gyre008: or correct the apparmor nonsense Ubuntu are sticking in
[2012-10-07 10:41:46 -0400] gyre008: but start looking into /var/log/syslog for mysql errors
[2012-10-07 10:43:15 -0400] welly: hmm - http://pastie.org/4926872

[2012-10-07 10:44:29 -0400] gyre008: its apparmor nonsense
[2012-10-07 10:44:35 -0400] welly: ok.. that doesn't mean a lot to me unfortunately :)
[2012-10-07 10:44:44 -0400] welly: i'll do some googling though
[2012-10-07 10:45:02 -0400] gyre008: as I said remove any enteries related to mysql from /etc/apparmor.d/
[2012-10-07 10:45:23 -0400] gyre008: and restart apparmor . ie /etc/init.d/apparmo rrestart
[2012-10-07 10:46:07 -0400] welly: will give that a go, thanks very much for your help
[2012-10-07 10:52:36 -0400] gyre008: it looks like omnibus chef doesn't ship sold stuff..
[2012-10-07 10:52:44 -0400] gyre008: arrgh this is so annoying.
[2012-10-07 13:44:57 -0400] conatus: Hi all - I am experiencing the effects of this problem - http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2903
[2012-10-07 13:45:27 -0400] conatus: when I try and run chef solo on my node I get "uninitialized constant Chef::Resource::ApplicationBase"
[2012-10-07 13:46:25 -0400] conatus: The node is Ubuntu 11.04
[2012-10-07 13:46:38 -0400] conatus: ruby is version 1.8.7
[2012-10-07 14:53:45 -0400] ekristen: can you get the chef environment name in a role file?
[2012-10-07 15:44:55 -0400] gyre008: ekristen, you mean like retrieve it in the role file ? You should be able to do that..roles files are basically ruby files, but I'm not really sure where you're aiming with this...
[2012-10-07 15:45:55 -0400] ekristen: gyre008: wanted to find nodes with another role in the same env to set some default attributes up
[2012-10-07 15:46:34 -0400] gyre008: do that in the recipe/attributes files.but calling search() is probably better to do in the recipe. Not in the roles
[2012-10-07 17:07:59 -0400] gyre008: I'm seeing really bizzare stuff happening in hosted chef...
[2012-10-07 17:09:57 -0400] gyre008: basicallyI can authenticate via knife (i.e. by running knife client list I'm getting list of clients), however when using the EXACT same validation_client_name and exact same validation key  I'm getting UNAUTHORIZED errors when attempting registering the node against Hosted Chef
[2012-10-07 17:10:00 -0400] gyre008: really weird
[2012-10-07 17:10:33 -0400] gyre008: nowthis is the first time I'm using hosted chef so i might be missing something.
[2012-10-07 17:11:02 -0400] gyre008: not really sure whatit should be simpleclient.rb should reference validation client name and validation.pem should be validation clients key...
[2012-10-07 17:12:03 -0400] yann2: Hello! I am looking for good git workflows tu use with chef for groups of sysadmins - how could I ensure for example that all cookbook edits are committed to a git repo, and not edited directly using knife cookbook edit?
[2012-10-07 17:12:30 -0400] gyre008: yann2, by telling your sysadmins to commit the changes :)
[2012-10-07 17:12:45 -0400] Mithrandir: yann2: do cookbook uploads when tagging in a git hook
[2012-10-07 17:12:57 -0400] Mithrandir: and tell people to not upload directly/don't give them keys
[2012-10-07 17:16:08 -0400] yann2: Mithrandir, so do cookbooks uploads via git postcommit hooks? that's pretty much what I was thinking of
[2012-10-07 17:17:10 -0400] yann2: did you publish your hooks somewhere? I'd be interested
[2012-10-07 17:17:25 -0400] Mithrandir: I don't do that, so no.
[2012-10-07 17:17:34 -0400] Mithrandir: but it should be easy enough to write some
[2012-10-07 17:17:57 -0400] yann2: what I don't get is why it seems noone is doing that...
[2012-10-07 17:18:27 -0400] yann2: people must have a magic way to keep their git repo synchronised with the server...
[2012-10-07 17:20:34 -0400] gyre008: this is just retarded...
[2012-10-07 17:21:22 -0400] gyre008: i don't get it
[2012-10-07 17:28:44 -0400] yann2: gyre007, you basically have two "points of truth", the git repo, and the chef database, and no way to sync them
[2012-10-07 17:29:36 -0400] gyre008: yann2, pretty much
[2012-10-07 17:29:48 -0400] mamu: yaan2: if you have a lot of people contributing you could even have a local chef server where you do the development  then you commit to git which triggers off your CI , which in turn uploads cookbooks onto your chef server and then runs them on a node in  CI .
[2012-10-07 17:30:14 -0400] gyre008: oh man this thing is giving me headache
[2012-10-07 17:31:02 -0400] gyre008: regenerating validators key helptotal retardation i swear
[2012-10-07 17:31:03 -0400] yann2: mamu,  yes, and then give my admins accounts but maybe non admin
[2012-10-07 17:31:27 -0400] yann2: the only admin being the account running the git commit hooks
[2012-10-07 17:31:59 -0400] yann2: I guess I'd need something similar for data bags, roles, and so on though
[2012-10-07 17:32:41 -0400] yann2: but then I'd need to handle roles deletions, creation and updates as special cases... mmmmhh..
[2012-10-07 17:32:49 -0400] yann2: surely someone has done this in the past...
[2012-10-07 17:35:18 -0400] mamu: yann2: all changes could happen from the checkins with CI depends on the flow you want to have
[2012-10-07 17:35:36 -0400] drrk: I was thinking of writing pre-commit hooks to make sure git was in sync with chef
[2012-10-07 17:35:45 -0400] drrk: but not actually change anything
[2012-10-07 17:38:39 -0400] yann2: what kind of workflow are you using to keep track of your changes? you never run "knife [...] edit" and always use knife from_file ?
[2012-10-07 17:38:52 -0400] yann2: or knife cookbook upload?
[2012-10-07 17:41:04 -0400] binbasti: hi
[2012-10-07 17:41:32 -0400] binbasti: i was wondering if there's a best practice of how to abort a deployment with the new application cookbook
[2012-10-07 17:42:08 -0400] binbasti: we want to set up continuous deployment, i.e. check travis if the new revision was built successfully, and if not, abort the process
[2012-10-07 18:30:55 -0400] Houdini: knfe data bag edit users returns "You must supply the data bag and an item to edit!" why? How to edit it?
[2012-10-07 18:36:35 -0400] mamu: yann2:  We try not to use knife edit  we have separate folders for roles/cookbooks/data bags etc
[2012-10-07 18:39:12 -0400] gyre008: Houdini, what r u trying to do ?
[2012-10-07 18:40:08 -0400] hoover_damm: Houdini, users is the main bag... you can only edit items
[2012-10-07 18:40:16 -0400] hoover_damm: Houdini, knife data bag edit users bob
[2012-10-07 18:48:40 -0400] Houdini: gyre008: I am trying to edit data bag
[2012-10-07 18:49:45 -0400] Houdini: hoover_damm: if I use "knife data bag edit users admin" than "ERROR: The object you are looking for could not be found"
[2012-10-07 18:49:52 -0400] gyre008: Houdini, like hoover_damm saysyou can onoy edit itemsso you must specify the item name
[2012-10-07 18:50:07 -0400] gyre008: Houdini, then it's probably not in chef then
[2012-10-07 18:50:39 -0400] gyre008: what happens if you run knife data bag list ?
[2012-10-07 18:50:55 -0400] Houdini: gyre008: here it is http://pastie.org/4928653
[2012-10-07 18:51:44 -0400] gyre008: do knife data bag show users
[2012-10-07 18:52:31 -0400] Houdini: gyre008: it's empty
[2012-10-07 18:53:02 -0400] gyre008: Houdini, well there you go thenno items are stored on the Chef SERVER
[2012-10-07 18:54:14 -0400] Houdini: gyre008: Ough, I understand my mistake
[2012-10-07 18:54:27 -0400] gyre008: cool
[2012-10-07 18:54:30 -0400] Houdini: Thanks a lot!
[2012-10-07 22:54:26 -0400] gen0cide_: Anyone know what happens when rsyslog on ubuntu tries to send its syslog *.* to a server but can't resolve the DNS name of the log server? I'm trying it now, but can't see anything in the local logs to indicate that failure had happened.
[2012-10-07 23:34:15 -0400] ekristen: gen0cide_: syslog is udp by default
[2012-10-07 23:34:23 -0400] ekristen: so it just sends data
[2012-10-07 23:34:40 -0400] ekristen: if it gets there it gets there, otherwise it is lost
[2012-10-07 23:34:56 -0400] gen0cide_: right but in the config you have to give it a host to send UDP too
[2012-10-07 23:35:15 -0400] gen0cide_: and it has to know about that host somehow whether DNS or /etc/hosts or what not
[2012-10-07 23:35:45 -0400] gen0cide_: I'm using DNS - say the FQDN of the host it should be sending the UDP traffic to can't resolve
[2012-10-07 23:36:16 -0400] gen0cide_: I'm trying to figure out how that failure happens - the man page for rsyslog says it should have 10 retries then complain, can't seem to find any complaint
