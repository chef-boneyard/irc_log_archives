[2012-10-21 00:05:53 -0400] c_t: you in Seattle now, fujin?
[2012-10-21 00:06:04 -0400] fujin: Yup yup
[2012-10-21 00:06:19 -0400] fujin: Staying at Westin on 5th
[2012-10-21 00:06:28 -0400] fujin: Wasssssup
[2012-10-21 00:06:33 -0400] c_t: I was just up there a short time ago
[2012-10-21 00:08:51 -0400] miah: ya. we were in EMP when the rain hit. it had stopped by time we left.
[2012-10-21 00:10:35 -0400] fujin: http://www.cyber-dogs.com/index.php/menu/food
[2012-10-21 00:11:04 -0400] fujin: Vege dog time nao plz
[2012-10-21 00:13:22 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: hai
[2012-10-21 00:13:37 -0400] fujin: Hey buddy
[2012-10-21 00:13:45 -0400] fujin: What's the word?
[2012-10-21 00:13:46 -0400] miah: fujin: those look tastey
[2012-10-21 00:13:54 -0400] jtimberman: that is the word
[2012-10-21 00:14:15 -0400] fujin: Dude you are a test-kitchen maniac
[2012-10-21 00:15:16 -0400] miah: hot
[2012-10-21 00:15:49 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: https://gist.github.com/26ae44d590939fe72f5f
[2012-10-21 00:16:34 -0400] jtimberman: i'm kind of on the fence about putting the minitests in the files of the cookbook or the files of the _test cookbook
[2012-10-21 00:16:53 -0400] fujin: Very cool. I look forward to seeing the nginx one. That cookbook source install method is pretty broken
[2012-10-21 00:17:00 -0400] miah: i rewrote it
[2012-10-21 00:17:12 -0400] fujin: Oh, good then.
[2012-10-21 00:17:20 -0400] miah: https://github.com/miah/nginx/commit/d823cf92c9dfb576c160d4b81acf329ada228fd7
[2012-10-21 00:17:23 -0400] fujin: :-D
[2012-10-21 00:17:29 -0400] jtimberman: test_0001_doesnt_configure_postfix_because_solo_is_unsupported(postfix::client) [/var/chef/minitest/postfix/client_test.rb:22]:
[2012-10-21 00:17:32 -0400] jtimberman: Postfix may be set up by default on the system, but not configured by Chef because this test assumes it is run under Chef Solo
[2012-10-21 00:17:50 -0400] fujin: Ah Ark style, cool
[2012-10-21 00:17:56 -0400] jtimberman: nice.
[2012-10-21 00:17:58 -0400] jtimberman: yeah like
[2012-10-21 00:18:01 -0400] miah: i need to fix some things in ark
[2012-10-21 00:18:01 -0400] jtimberman: i hate nginx
[2012-10-21 00:18:06 -0400] miah: but overall i <3 it
[2012-10-21 00:18:07 -0400] jtimberman: because itdoesn't have dynamic modules
[2012-10-21 00:18:09 -0400] jtimberman: i love nginx
[2012-10-21 00:18:18 -0400] jtimberman: because it's fast (because it doesn't have dynamic modules?)
[2012-10-21 00:18:26 -0400] fujin: Dynamic shmynamic
[2012-10-21 00:18:44 -0400] fujin: Build once distributed package
[2012-10-21 00:18:49 -0400] miah: no need for dynamic modules =)
[2012-10-21 00:18:53 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: totally
[2012-10-21 00:19:05 -0400] jtimberman: fujin: build the package with the modules you need, use the default recipe, doneburger.
[2012-10-21 00:19:18 -0400] jtimberman: like, thats the *right* way to do it. :)
[2012-10-21 00:20:12 -0400] miah: somewhat
[2012-10-21 00:20:23 -0400] miah: i think in general the 'default.rb' does too much for most cookbooks
[2012-10-21 00:21:21 -0400] jtimberman: maybe!
[2012-10-21 00:21:25 -0400] jtimberman: like, it depends.
[2012-10-21 00:22:00 -0400] miah: eg, it bothers me that the nagios cookbook disabled the default website in apache/nginx
[2012-10-21 00:22:15 -0400] jtimberman: like, the default vhost?
[2012-10-21 00:22:19 -0400] miah: there are just lots of things that don't belong
[2012-10-21 00:22:22 -0400] jtimberman: that's because cnames are hard
[2012-10-21 00:25:49 -0400] miah: =)
[2012-10-21 00:31:24 -0400] jtimberman: miah: but thats one of the nice things about using the debian configuration, the default site can be reenabled easily :)
[2012-10-21 00:46:56 -0400] fujin: Zomg
[2012-10-21 00:47:12 -0400] fujin: I found cyberdogs
[2012-10-21 02:27:04 -0400] schuckles: hi, stupid question
[2012-10-21 02:27:28 -0400] schuckles: but how do i get passenger to compile in nginx with https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nginx cookbook?
[2012-10-21 02:27:35 -0400] schuckles: i've been trying all day to do so
[2012-10-21 02:29:42 -0400] hoover_damm: it's prolly time to make that a provider in the nginx cookbook
[2012-10-21 02:31:01 -0400] schuckles: ?
[2012-10-21 02:31:16 -0400] hoover_damm: what your trying to do isn't hard
[2012-10-21 02:31:30 -0400] schuckles: how do i go about doing so?
[2012-10-21 02:32:50 -0400] hoover_damm: an really old copy of the nginx cookbok that I hacked this into
[2012-10-21 02:32:51 -0400] hoover_damm: https://gist.github.com/f16f17de13fee1224221
[2012-10-21 02:32:59 -0400] hoover_damm: for the default recipe...
[2012-10-21 02:33:17 -0400] hoover_damm: line 91-103 basically
[2012-10-21 03:56:54 -0400] Houdini: why cookbook file is not created second time? I delete that file and second time is not created
[2012-10-21 06:03:23 -0400] jumbo: hello
[2012-10-21 06:04:45 -0400] jumbo: I'm trying to set a config param that will include something I set in the role, and also from the node itself (name)
[2012-10-21 06:04:58 -0400] jumbo: How can I concatenate both variables?
[2012-10-21 06:05:56 -0400] jumbo: NAME=<%= node["name"]; node['newrelic']['app_name'] %>
[2012-10-21 06:09:06 -0400] jumbo: or do I use node.name?
[2012-10-21 06:09:45 -0400] juliancdunn: why not just NAME=<%= node["name"] %><%= node["newrelic"]["app_name"] %>
[2012-10-21 06:10:22 -0400] jtimberman: node.name
[2012-10-21 06:10:25 -0400] jtimberman: not node['name']
[2012-10-21 06:10:47 -0400] jtimberman: jumbo: ^
[2012-10-21 16:31:24 -0400] gchristensen: when I run knife client list, I get output, but when I run knife bootstrap against a server, it says "Failed to authenticate as 'gc-vagrant'. Ensure that your node_name and client key are correct." - but they all seem to be. the node name is unique, the client doesn't exist, anything else I should check? this organization is new (last hour or two,) do I need to wait a while or something?
[2012-10-21 19:17:28 -0400] xdissent: I created a ticket, sent a PR and linked to each appropriately - do I *really* set the ticket as resolved now?
[2012-10-21 19:20:51 -0400] fujin: Contributing?
[2012-10-21 19:21:04 -0400] fujin: Ohh bot
[2012-10-21 19:21:27 -0400] fujin: xdissent: there's a wiki page detailing the whole process
[2012-10-21 19:21:54 -0400] fujin: xdissent: file CLA, open ticket, supply patch + resolve
[2012-10-21 19:22:11 -0400] xdissent: yeah I've done this before I just don't remember the resolve part
[2012-10-21 19:22:12 -0400] xdissent: thanks
[2012-10-21 19:22:13 -0400] fujin: Tickets will be closed on merge iirc
[2012-10-21 19:22:47 -0400] fujin: Np
[2012-10-21 20:12:44 -0400] Houdini: How to get private_ip from search method?
[2012-10-21 20:13:41 -0400] fujin: Houdini: take a look at the discovery cookbook, had helpers for that
[2012-10-21 20:13:43 -0400] fujin: Has*
[2012-10-21 20:14:11 -0400] Houdini: fujin: thanks
[2012-10-21 20:15:19 -0400] ssd7: Ohai Chefs!
[2012-10-21 20:16:00 -0400] Houdini: fujin: However I feel that search method is enough for me, I just can't find method I need
[2012-10-21 20:17:54 -0400] fujin: Discovery cookbook implements discovery_ipaddress recipe helper which resolved any type of address, and will prioritize local addressing when available
[2012-10-21 20:18:41 -0400] fujin: host = discovery_search("foo")
[2012-10-21 20:18:41 -0400] fujin: ip = discovery_ipaddress(host)
[2012-10-21 20:19:04 -0400] fujin: Doesn't really get much easier than that.
[2012-10-21 20:19:25 -0400] fujin: Maybe you'll eventually be able to find the method.
[2012-10-21 20:22:06 -0400] fujin: Houdini: the response from the Search method (standard chef)  is node objects
[2012-10-21 20:22:45 -0400] fujin: Houdini: you can just access the attributes from another node that way
[2012-10-21 20:24:55 -0400] Houdini: fujin: search(:node, 'role:some_role')[0][:ipaddress] is that I need
[2012-10-21 20:24:59 -0400] Houdini: Thanks a lot
[2012-10-21 20:25:22 -0400] Houdini: fujin: don't want to install another recipe
[2012-10-21 20:26:55 -0400] fujin: Cool story bro
[2012-10-21 21:19:01 -0400] fujin: Just in case there is anyone in here: I'm at Pike brewing co, chillin
[2012-10-21 21:19:09 -0400] fujin: Welcome to join me.
[2012-10-21 22:21:42 -0400] cwj: <3 discovery
[2012-10-21 22:47:57 -0400] rayrod2030: how do you include variables inside a bash resource block?
[2012-10-21 22:53:35 -0400] yfeldblum: rayrod2030, what do you mean by "variables"?
[2012-10-21 22:53:54 -0400] rayrod2030: ruby code
[2012-10-21 22:57:07 -0400] yfeldblum: rayrod2030, not following ... what is it that you're trying to achieve?
[2012-10-21 23:00:24 -0400] cwj: i think the question is "how do i interpolate variable values in a string"
[2012-10-21 23:00:39 -0400] cwj: #{variable_goes_here}
[2012-10-21 23:05:39 -0400] rayrod2030: yup that's it
[2012-10-21 23:05:40 -0400] rayrod2030: thanks
[2012-10-21 23:06:03 -0400] rayrod2030: but will that interpolate properly inside the EOH bash block?
[2012-10-21 23:10:21 -0400] yfeldblum: rayrod2030, yes it will - that's not a block: that's just ruby's multiline strings, and ruby's multiline strings with <<- let you do interpolation
[2012-10-21 23:13:37 -0400] rayrod2030: great thanks
[2012-10-21 23:57:42 -0400] julien: Hello, I'm looking for an application_nodejs on the same model as application_rails. Has anyone built that?
[2012-10-21 23:58:31 -0400] coderanger: julien: Don't know of one, but would love to see it if you give it a shot :)
[2012-10-21 23:59:04 -0400] coderanger: julien: If you look at the existing strategy code it should be clear how to add new ones
[2012-10-21 23:59:12 -0400] coderanger: They are just LWRPs setup with some special actions
[2012-10-21 23:59:22 -0400] julien: coderanger: well, I have actually ben trying to create one for the last hour or so but I have trouble :/ Which is why I am trying to find one!
[2012-10-21 23:59:48 -0400] coderanger: I wrote most of the core code of that cookbook, so I can probably answer some questions at least :)
