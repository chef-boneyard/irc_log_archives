[2012-10-27 00:00:01 -0400] erikh: heh, it appears that ubuntu's standard redis package has a startup script that uses start-stop-daemon wrong
[2012-10-27 00:00:18 -0400] erikh: it tells it to start with a pidfile but doesn't tell it to actually put the PID in the pidfile
[2012-10-27 00:00:45 -0400] erikh: so 'service redis-server restart' effectively does nothing because start-stop-daemon consults the pidfile (which is literally an empty file) on stop
[2012-10-27 00:00:55 -0400] KarlHungus: hoover_damm: i prefer my recipes to be very simple. all of the casing for distros should be done through attributes and the provided distro specific files/templates dirs
[2012-10-27 00:03:30 -0400] hoover_damm: KarlHungus, move the complex crap out of the recipe then
[2012-10-27 00:03:54 -0400] hoover_damm: erikh, bonzai!
[2012-10-27 00:03:58 -0400] KarlHungus: this covers 95+% of distro specifics. the other 5% can be handled through LWRPs that abstract the differences in init systems, etc
[2012-10-27 00:04:04 -0400] hoover_damm: erikh, hope you file a ticket on it.
[2012-10-27 00:04:27 -0400] hoover_damm: KarlHungus, the problem is problem is more the subtle opinions applied to apache and other subsystems
[2012-10-27 00:04:36 -0400] hoover_damm: that turn into a 'support this os' creep
[2012-10-27 00:04:52 -0400] timsmith: KarlHungus: I agree.  You can avoid a lot of complexity with platform support in the attributes rather than the recipes
[2012-10-27 00:05:04 -0400] KarlHungus: hoover_damm: exactly. recipes should be easy to read and deal with fundamental resources or abstractions of them
[2012-10-27 00:06:04 -0400] KarlHungus: hoover_damm: imho, those opinions are just a result of how immature many cookbooks are. it will get better over time.
[2012-10-27 00:06:47 -0400] KarlHungus: good enough to ship vs. good enough for everyone ;)
[2012-10-27 00:08:03 -0400] hoover_damm: opinions exist everywhere however
[2012-10-27 00:08:12 -0400] hoover_damm: so that same opinion can be applied to distributions
[2012-10-27 00:08:18 -0400] hoover_damm: and how they allow us to automtate them
[2012-10-27 00:09:34 -0400] KarlHungus: yes. absolutely. but hiding these complexities should be the primary objective of a recipe. leave the heavy lifting to other aspects of the cookbook, and make it easy to parameterize them
[2012-10-27 00:09:57 -0400] hoover_damm: I do hope that Opscode and other companies are working with Redhat and Ubuntu to help the problem
[2012-10-27 00:10:06 -0400] hoover_damm: as it's quite a complex issue
[2012-10-27 00:10:11 -0400] hoover_damm: that cannot be solved by end users alone
[2012-10-27 00:10:15 -0400] KarlHungus: the database and application cookbooks are great examples of creating common interfaces between cookbooks
[2012-10-27 00:10:25 -0400] hoover_damm: can't expect Opscode to do it all themselves imo
[2012-10-27 00:10:34 -0400] hoover_damm: right
[2012-10-27 00:11:20 -0400] jtimberman: speaking of this topic... http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cookbook+Curation+and+Contribution
[2012-10-27 00:11:28 -0400] KarlHungus: there is a lot of work to be done still, but as these meta-cookbooks mature and more cookbooks reuse those interfaces, i expect the opinionated design in older cookbooks to decrease
[2012-10-27 00:12:03 -0400] KarlHungus: jtimberman: /hug's. love you for your work =)
[2012-10-27 00:12:14 -0400] KarlHungus: you make my life better. i owe you beer.
[2012-10-27 00:12:55 -0400] jtimberman: KarlHungus: thanks man.
[2012-10-27 00:13:18 -0400] KarlHungus: who are yall sending to devopsdays? will you be there so i can make good on it? i wasn't able to do the west coast for chef summit :(
[2012-10-27 00:14:29 -0400] KarlHungus: hoover_damm: opscode influencing redhat/canonical sounds like cloudstack influencing AWS to me :P read into that however you like
[2012-10-27 00:15:34 -0400] hoover_damm: KarlHungus, then Chef will be just like Ruby
[2012-10-27 00:15:38 -0400] hoover_damm: and so will puppet
[2012-10-27 00:16:22 -0400] jtimberman: KarlHungus: I don't remember who from Opscode will be at the DevOpsDays event. I won't.
[2012-10-27 00:16:46 -0400] hoover_damm: getting a good line of communication and foothold with the engineers who develop the distros that you want to support is required (imo)
[2012-10-27 00:17:13 -0400] KarlHungus: jtimberman: i was able to get seth a beer at surge and still owe him some omnibus freebsd patches because of it. haha
[2012-10-27 00:17:20 -0400] hoover_damm: and I know mattray has helped me push a ticket up
[2012-10-27 00:17:26 -0400] hoover_damm: in the ubuntu arena
[2012-10-27 00:18:07 -0400] hoover_damm: basically if you expect distributions to do your job for you while you whine in the corner that it's hurting... your only doing yourself a disservice and a disservice to the community
[2012-10-27 00:18:22 -0400] jtimberman: KarlHungus: Andrea Campi just sent ap ull request for a Bento FreeBSD box btw.
[2012-10-27 00:18:24 -0400] hoover_damm: they need help
[2012-10-27 00:18:29 -0400] hoover_damm: just as much as Opscode needs help
[2012-10-27 00:18:43 -0400] KarlHungus: jtimberman: i think i have a pull req in for that also
[2012-10-27 00:18:51 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-10-27 00:18:52 -0400] KarlHungus: jtimberman: but its missing the omnibus software bits.
[2012-10-27 00:18:56 -0400] jtimberman: gotta run, plane is boarding in 5 minutes
[2012-10-27 00:19:01 -0400] KarlHungus: jtimberman: later. cheers.
[2012-10-27 00:19:27 -0400] KarlHungus: hoover_damm: i'm a bsd/unix junkie. i prefer the distro out of my way and the ability to control everything outside of their decisions
[2012-10-27 00:19:52 -0400] hoover_damm: KarlHungus, right and as a BSD user myself I totally get that
[2012-10-27 00:20:42 -0400] hoover_damm: KarlHungus, however the linux user in me (and unfortunately person who worked for engine yard and got this beat into me) you cannot expect best practices and languages to grow up without helping them grow up
[2012-10-27 00:21:31 -0400] hoover_damm: as we are the users, we know how we use them... we can nudge ubuntu to make it easier to setup postfix with chef... or x y or z
[2012-10-27 00:21:47 -0400] hoover_damm: a lot of people would see it as supporting chef, but that win should apply to juju, puppet, etc
[2012-10-27 00:22:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and make the overall experience better
[2012-10-27 00:22:28 -0400] hoover_damm: BSD has a very hands off approach
[2012-10-27 00:22:32 -0400] hoover_damm: Linux has a very in your face approach
[2012-10-27 00:22:35 -0400] KarlHungus: hoover_damm: there are valid perspectives for any direction a project takes, though. even if they aren't obiouvs to all the stakeholders involved
[2012-10-27 00:23:05 -0400] hoover_damm: and that relates to the cost of tea how?
[2012-10-27 00:23:10 -0400] hoover_damm: ;)
[2012-10-27 00:23:36 -0400] KarlHungus: it means that the direction you and I might like linux or ruby to grow, isn't necessarily the right direction
[2012-10-27 00:23:53 -0400] KarlHungus: and it takes a lot of effort and empathy to appease all stakeholders.
[2012-10-27 00:25:03 -0400] KarlHungus: what we, as web ops folks, want isn't necessarily aligned with the path the an omptimal outcome
[2012-10-27 00:26:10 -0400] hoover_damm: KarlHungus, the problem that ruby has is currently it's not always up to date... and people end up using rvm or rbenv to cop out
[2012-10-27 00:26:55 -0400] hoover_damm: KarlHungus, I have a insane dream of configuration files being more like an api for end users to use... and not have to do <%= 20x over in a 350 line config file
[2012-10-27 00:27:10 -0400] KarlHungus: as a ruby ops guy, i know that i have to support projects that run on multiple ruby versions. relying on the system ruby for business services isn't viable.
[2012-10-27 00:27:12 -0400] hoover_damm: let alone configuration files that technically the distro owns
[2012-10-27 00:27:38 -0400] KarlHungus: but if system tools need a specific ruby, then i let that be decided by the OS and resulting package set that is built for that server profile
[2012-10-27 00:27:40 -0400] hoover_damm: KarlHungus, it's okay if you don't accept my viewpoint.
[2012-10-27 00:28:08 -0400] hoover_damm: right your getting off topic now
[2012-10-27 00:28:16 -0400] KarlHungus: i'm not disagreeing. i've chatted with you enough to know that your opnion is both valid and well reasoned.
[2012-10-27 00:29:47 -0400] KarlHungus: just reiterating jtimberman's point that dicussing and bikeshedding aren't likely to change a projects direction
[2012-10-27 00:31:12 -0400] hoover_damm: KarlHungus, nah we cannot change Ubuntu's direction... but we can help them help us
[2012-10-27 00:31:16 -0400] KarlHungus: but, building tools and defining practices to overcome a distro or projects shortcomings will. you expose problems, propose solutions, and validate the projects usefulness without ever disagreeing
[2012-10-27 00:31:28 -0400] hoover_damm: KarlHungus, I've talked with some of the Debian developers and they're a little put off by the suggestion
[2012-10-27 00:31:56 -0400] hoover_damm: KarlHungus, and I think it's mainly because they are not a configuration management user... so the concept of preseeding and having more done... or less, or even logic
[2012-10-27 00:31:59 -0400] hoover_damm: i think scares them
[2012-10-27 00:32:36 -0400] KarlHungus: i've had some heated discussions with freebsd devs about why something like kickstart isn't around too ;)
[2012-10-27 00:33:17 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah they have a problem with reality
[2012-10-27 00:33:50 -0400] KarlHungus: theyd rather design a more friendly cd-based installer. which sort of backs up your point about who is doing the work and what they're goals are
[2012-10-27 00:34:02 -0400] KarlHungus: their*
[2012-10-27 00:35:12 -0400] KarlHungus: we could start ##distro-failure-talk ;) there's enough content waiting to be tapped we could fill a library. haha
[2012-10-27 00:36:38 -0400] hoover_damm: indeed
[2012-10-27 00:38:33 -0400] hoover_damm: and with the way adam was talking about metarepo, i'd just love to drive building images and configuration into a healthier spot
[2012-10-27 00:39:09 -0400] hoover_damm: because for ubuntu/debian it owns stuff in /etc and users end up updating it always... and when they apt-get upgrade it gets cranky
[2012-10-27 00:39:59 -0400] KarlHungus: yeah. mergemaster is even uglier. i can't even let chef define custom things in /etc/services without an os update nuking them
[2012-10-27 00:40:22 -0400] hoover_damm: right, with gentoo it's a little rcs love
[2012-10-27 00:40:31 -0400] hoover_damm: so it accepts the changes as yours
[2012-10-27 01:14:18 -0400] Majost: If I have a cookbook which depends on apache2 and I want to configure apache to listen on more than one port via my cookbook's attributes file, would I use the syntax: default['apache']['listen_ports'] = ['80', '443']
[2012-10-27 01:14:38 -0400] Majost: or is "default" the wrong thing for my use case?
[2012-10-27 01:27:52 -0400] matschaffer: any known problems with cookbook uploading atm? Seems like it's a no-op for me
[2012-10-27 01:27:57 -0400] matschaffer: to chef platform that is
[2012-10-27 02:06:06 -0400] davidmz: Hello, how much memory do I need for chef-server managing upto 10 nodes
[2012-10-27 02:06:12 -0400] davidmz: I wonder what VPS to buy
[2012-10-27 02:09:39 -0400] davidmz: anyone?
[2012-10-27 02:16:11 -0400] greenmoss: davidmz: managing a chef server is not for the faint of heart
[2012-10-27 02:16:21 -0400] greenmoss: if you're not sure about memory, I'd go with hosted chef
[2012-10-27 02:16:44 -0400] davidmz: I don't want to do that, I can manage it
[2012-10-27 02:16:49 -0400] greenmoss: heh, ok
[2012-10-27 02:17:00 -0400] greenmoss: I did for a while, then gave up and was glad of it :)
[2012-10-27 02:17:23 -0400] davidmz: I already got it installed, I am not worried just want to know what is the minimum
[2012-10-27 02:24:54 -0400] hoover_damm: davidmz, 2gigs of ram
[2012-10-27 02:24:59 -0400] hoover_damm: sould be more then enough
[2012-10-27 03:37:00 -0400] monokrome: Hello. I am trying to write a configuration script to help me with user configuration, as well as setting up my workstations. I am doing this as an academic exercise in understanding chef. Does anyone know how I can do system and user-specific configurations in the same script? When I try to install files into my home directory, they are owned by root because I need to use sudo to run some of the rules given to
[2012-10-27 03:37:02 -0400] monokrome: shef. However, when I specific the owner option to a File it is still owned by root. Any ideas?
[2012-10-27 03:37:07 -0400] monokrome: s/shef/chef/
[2012-10-27 05:39:58 -0400] fleish: hi all, I get the FATAL: Cannot find sub command for: error for ec2 & openstack, suggesting that I gem install knife-ec2 & openstack ... the problem is that I've already done that and they show up in a gem list command so I'm puzzled what's wrong
[2012-10-27 07:00:25 -0400] hoover_damm: fleish, -VV
[2012-10-27 07:00:50 -0400] hoover_damm: basically get more information, debug it and gist the information if you can't understand it
[2012-10-27 07:02:45 -0400] hoover_damm: it's not perfect, but hopefully it should help.
[2012-10-27 07:03:00 -0400] fleish: hoover_damm: where do I stick the -VV ?
[2012-10-27 07:03:09 -0400] fleish: at the end I get the same thing (only with -VV) on the end
[2012-10-27 07:03:14 -0400] hoover_damm: fleish, knife ec2 server create -VV
[2012-10-27 07:03:16 -0400] fleish: after knife I get the list of available cmds
[2012-10-27 07:03:29 -0400] fleish: it's like it doesn't think the gems are  installed when they are
[2012-10-27 07:03:51 -0400] hoover_damm: depends on your ruby setup... gem env and look in the gem path
[2012-10-27 07:05:18 -0400] fleish: yeah, I see /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/doc/knife-openstack-0.6.2 and gem env says one of my gem paths is /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8
[2012-10-27 07:05:36 -0400] hoover_damm: basically what knife does is it looks in your $LOAD_PATH and searches for any gems with the appropriate namespace
[2012-10-27 07:05:56 -0400] hoover_damm: so if it finds knife- it tries to load it and loads the right namespace for it
[2012-10-27 07:06:19 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/opscode/knife-openstack/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/openstack_server_create.rb
[2012-10-27 07:06:23 -0400] hoover_damm: which is why you see that the way it is
[2012-10-27 07:06:36 -0400] hoover_damm: command is based off the class
[2012-10-27 07:07:10 -0400] hoover_damm: ahh ruby 1.8
[2012-10-27 07:07:12 -0400] hoover_damm: wow
[2012-10-27 07:07:14 -0400] fleish: oops, bad paste /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/knife-openstack-0.6.2
[2012-10-27 07:07:15 -0400] hoover_damm: people still use that?
[2012-10-27 07:07:39 -0400] hoover_damm: gosh after seeing the 2.0 feature freeze that feels weird
[2012-10-27 07:08:14 -0400] fleish: (dull) yeah, though I switched ruby to 1.9 but forgot about switching gem
[2012-10-27 07:08:26 -0400] fleish: yeah dude, it's like IE6
[2012-10-27 07:08:41 -0400] hoover_damm: fleish, seems right
[2012-10-27 07:09:29 -0400] hoover_damm: well if your good with rdb... https://github.com/pry/debugger-pry
[2012-10-27 07:09:30 -0400] hoover_damm: perhaps
[2012-10-27 07:09:53 -0400] hoover_damm: slap pry and debug knife and check out your load path and try and load the knife-openstack gem
[2012-10-27 07:10:02 -0400] fleish: that's super-annoying since I already uninstalled the gems and reinstalled them thinking ruby1.9 was in teh house
[2012-10-27 07:10:03 -0400] hoover_damm: and figure out what your not seeing
[2012-10-27 07:10:18 -0400] fleish: I am most definitely *not* "good" with rdb
[2012-10-27 07:10:34 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah I got some blank looks when I mentioned i've done rdb with chef-client
[2012-10-27 07:10:39 -0400] hoover_damm: almost like I called hades down
[2012-10-27 07:11:30 -0400] hoover_damm: I get the feeling your getting some weird loaderror
[2012-10-27 07:11:34 -0400] hoover_damm: that's being silently rescued
[2012-10-27 07:11:41 -0400] hoover_damm: or not displayed
[2012-10-27 07:12:12 -0400] hoover_damm: what version of chef?
[2012-10-27 07:12:36 -0400] fleish: yeah, I took to the google first and found a bug report with some dude bitching about an error message that was being thrown and how "we should really make this a friendlier message telling people to install the plugin" ... his 'friendlier message' is the error I get now
[2012-10-27 07:12:46 -0400] fleish: latest version of chef 10.16.2 I think
[2012-10-27 07:13:00 -0400] fleish: tits
[2012-10-27 07:13:17 -0400] fleish: FATAL: Cannot find sub command for: 'openstack'
[2012-10-27 07:13:17 -0400] fleish: Available openstack subcommands: (for details, knife SUB-COMMAND --help)
[2012-10-27 07:13:28 -0400] fleish: mutherfuckin mismatch of ruby vs gem
[2012-10-27 07:14:00 -0400] hoover_damm: ruby 1.9 / 1.8 mixture?
[2012-10-27 07:14:56 -0400] fleish: yeah, switched gem to 1.9.1 - reinstalled the knife-openstack gem and kablamo
[2012-10-27 07:16:00 -0400] hoover_damm: you know you can just install the full chef installer now
[2012-10-27 07:16:04 -0400] hoover_damm: and giveup on ruby
[2012-10-27 07:16:29 -0400] hoover_damm: I did :)
[2012-10-27 07:18:19 -0400] fleish: not sure what that means, we've got a full cheff server on this box, but we need knife for the tools that will manage stuff
[2012-10-27 07:19:43 -0400] hoover_damm: fleish, omnibus installers
[2012-10-27 07:20:13 -0400] hoover_damm: curl -L http://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh | sudo bash
[2012-10-27 07:20:29 -0400] hoover_damm: fleish, http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/
[2012-10-27 07:20:42 -0400] hoover_damm: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installation
[2012-10-27 07:21:54 -0400] hoover_damm: fleish, managing ruby is hard... Opscode is trying to make that job easier... with Chef 11 there will be an omnibus installer for the server as well... so you really won't need to worry about a darned thing.
[2012-10-27 07:22:08 -0400] hoover_damm: http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/08/31/test-drive-the-chef-11-server-preview/
[2012-10-27 07:22:30 -0400] fleish: ah, yeah I Think I used that omnibus thing on a test server once
[2012-10-27 07:22:53 -0400] fleish: it set it all up but it didn't end well - it would hang up in the cpu and spin it forever
[2012-10-27 07:23:33 -0400] hoover_damm: try it again :) i'm sure something happened weird
[2012-10-27 07:23:35 -0400] fleish: plus I'm migrating an environment out of rackspace that already uses knife and I don't have time to change anything non-essential until after we're all done
[2012-10-27 07:23:58 -0400] fleish: I'll add it to my mental list of things to check out in my copious free time ;)
[2012-10-27 07:24:06 -0400] hoover_damm: I greatly enjoy building 250 servers and only having to deal with a simple wget
[2012-10-27 07:24:18 -0400] hoover_damm: and your already using it anyway with the current chef unless you specify your own bootstrap template
[2012-10-27 07:24:21 -0400] hoover_damm: ;)
[2012-10-27 07:25:11 -0400] fleish: heh
[2012-10-27 07:25:58 -0400] fleish: I think they are, but I'll keep it in mind if things continue to suck
[2012-10-27 07:31:16 -0400] fleish: thanks for the info and helping me realize my issue
[2012-10-27 07:52:01 -0400] tolland: how do i tell if the remote cookbook has been edited, before i clobber it by uploading?
[2012-10-27 07:52:10 -0400] tolland: other than to download and diff it
[2012-10-27 07:56:00 -0400] erikh: I have a tool for this I unfortunately cannot share, but you might be able to find something on github.
[2012-10-27 07:56:24 -0400] erikh: the short of it is that each cookbook is md5 summed, and if you write a little code to retrieve that value from the server, you can calculate the md5sum locally and compare.
[2012-10-27 08:03:45 -0400] tolland: erikh: ah cool. as long as I wasn't missing something obvious
[2012-10-27 08:03:48 -0400] tolland: thnks!
[2012-10-27 08:10:22 -0400] erikh: tolland: np. I believe there are two classes for resolving this if my memory serves correct; one for the local case and another for the remote. You'll have to code dive though, I don't remember what the names are at this point
[2012-10-27 08:20:57 -0400] tolland: erikh: so i am thinking of a knife plugin
[2012-10-27 08:21:33 -0400] tolland: are you meaning that there are 2 classes that are available to query the cookbooks and get the hash from the remote?
[2012-10-27 08:23:08 -0400] erikh: basically there are two classes that deal with cookbooks somewhat similarly, just in a remote and local context
[2012-10-27 08:26:24 -0400] tolland: ok, source code is open
[2012-10-27 08:26:26 -0400] tolland: lol
[2012-10-27 08:26:30 -0400] tolland: weekend is probably lost
[2012-10-27 08:26:59 -0400] intinig: hello all
[2012-10-27 08:27:06 -0400] masterkorp: hello
[2012-10-27 08:27:30 -0400] intinig: I am using tips found on this page "http://wiki.opscode.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=15728818" to be sure that a recipe tries to push data on a webservice only on first run.
[2012-10-27 08:27:33 -0400] intinig: Is is the correct approach
[2012-10-27 08:27:46 -0400] intinig: or should I think of a better idempotent way to do it?
[2012-10-27 08:27:57 -0400] intinig: in this case I push to github a ssh key generated on the server
[2012-10-27 08:28:42 -0400] masterkorp: I think you should check if github has the key and the push if not
[2012-10-27 08:28:56 -0400] intinig: masterkorp: yes that's the best way I think :-/ I am just so lazy
[2012-10-27 08:28:59 -0400] intinig: but I'll do it
[2012-10-27 08:29:18 -0400] masterkorp: ahaha, SLACKERS UNITE
[2012-10-27 08:29:24 -0400] masterkorp: maybe tomorrow
[2012-10-27 08:29:31 -0400] intinig: today is already tomorrow
[2012-10-27 08:29:36 -0400] intinig: I did that just before going to sleep :)
[2012-10-27 08:29:50 -0400] intinig: I even had to publish a gem to do it so twice the work :)
[2012-10-27 08:30:02 -0400] masterkorp: ahaha
[2012-10-27 08:30:21 -0400] intinig: github-key-upload.gem
[2012-10-27 08:30:22 -0400] intinig: :)
[2012-10-27 10:37:50 -0400] intinig: here I am again :) - so: I have this execute block
[2012-10-27 10:38:02 -0400] intinig: can I have another execute block inside it, in the not_if claus
[2012-10-27 10:38:21 -0400] intinig: so that it executes that only if the result of the other execute block is positive
[2012-10-27 10:38:21 -0400] intinig: ?
[2012-10-27 10:38:24 -0400] intinig: or better, negative
[2012-10-27 10:59:26 -0400] intinig: I want an execute resource to notify another only if the return value of the command was 1 and not 0. How do I do that?
[2012-10-27 11:42:25 -0400] yfeldblum: intinig, not_if "/path/to/some command --that returns zero"
[2012-10-27 16:19:52 -0400] ssd7: Ohai Chefs
[2012-10-27 17:47:21 -0400] JasonBox: hrm, if I wanted to temporarily replace the package resource so it is essentially a noop and always succeeds, what might I do?
[2012-10-27 17:48:54 -0400] yfeldblum: JasonBox, reopen the provider class and redefine its methods to your liking
[2012-10-27 17:53:42 -0400] JasonBox: The yum provider makes my head hurt
[2012-10-27 17:59:37 -0400] ShawnMcCool: i have an apache2 cookbook that i got from the repo, I have a recipe that adds a module that's not currently in the cookbook. should i add it to that cookbook or create a new one for my own recipes?
[2012-10-27 18:01:02 -0400] timsmith: Ideally you add that to the community cookbook and contribute it back
[2012-10-27 18:05:40 -0400] ShawnMcCool: k
[2012-10-27 18:13:39 -0400] timsmith: JasonBox:  Are you doing action install or upgrade?
[2012-10-27 18:29:42 -0400] JasonBox: timsmith: It's just the default install action
[2012-10-27 18:30:14 -0400] timsmith: nm then.  I was wondering if you had update which would logically need the repo to be functional
[2012-10-27 19:15:31 -0400] auduny_: Hmpf.
[2012-10-27 19:16:18 -0400] auduny_: After a rabbitmq crash of some kind where rabbitmq used up all diskspace i rebootet the chef server.
[2012-10-27 19:16:39 -0400] auduny_: And now everything seems to be running _except_ chef-server on port 4000 which is the most essential part.
[2012-10-27 19:17:00 -0400] Mithrandir: what happens when you try to start it?
[2012-10-27 19:17:11 -0400] auduny_: chef-server is running has stuff on 4001 ,4002 ,4003 etc.
[2012-10-27 19:17:22 -0400] Mithrandir: anything else listening on 4000?
[2012-10-27 19:17:35 -0400] auduny_: And the log just don't mention anything wrong at all.
[2012-10-27 19:17:38 -0400] auduny_: Mithrandir: Nope.
[2012-10-27 19:18:25 -0400] Mithrandir: strace -e trace=network give you anything useful?
[2012-10-27 19:22:59 -0400] auduny_: Mithrandir: *cough* for some reason the /etc/sysconfig/chef-server says that it should listen to 4001 ...
[2012-10-27 19:24:01 -0400] Mithrandir: auduny_: "oops".
[2012-10-27 19:24:06 -0400] Mithrandir: that sounds like a bug, yeah.
[2012-10-27 19:24:47 -0400] auduny_: /etc/chef/server.rb says chef_server_url    "http://localhost:4000"
[2012-10-27 19:24:56 -0400] auduny_: While /etc/sysconfig says something else.
[2012-10-27 19:27:12 -0400] auduny_: Mithrandir: Thanks for making me look harder :-)
[2012-10-27 19:27:28 -0400] Mithrandir: :-)
[2012-10-27 20:40:06 -0400] dschultz_: Anyone at the Summit that saw the session on "Everything in Git"? It's not on the commmunity wiki, and unfortuantely I missed it as I was in another session...
[2012-10-27 20:40:13 -0400] frk131: hi, i installed chef using gem and knife is not found: http://pastebin.com/JzAKWBej any ideas?
[2012-10-27 20:42:03 -0400] frk131: ah think i found
[2012-10-27 20:42:27 -0400] frk131:  /home/*/.gem/ruby/1.9.1/bin isnt in my path
[2012-10-27 20:46:53 -0400] erikh: it shouldn't need to be
[2012-10-27 20:51:13 -0400] dschultz_: Are you using RVM? What version of Chef do you have installed? I personally have been using omnibus chef installer...
[2012-10-27 20:54:18 -0400] dschultz_: knife should be packaged as part of the Chef gem, correct? So something is wrong on your end. Or perhaps I misunderstood.
[2012-10-27 20:55:40 -0400] erikh: ah, I see now
[2012-10-27 20:55:47 -0400] erikh: frk131: any reason you're not installing the chef gem as root?
[2012-10-27 20:59:11 -0400] dschultz_: Right, try sudo gem install chef
[2012-10-27 21:04:15 -0400] frk131: <erikh>: no, but why should i?
[2012-10-27 21:14:48 -0400] dschultz_: Because the chef install needs root privileges to write to /etc?
[2012-10-27 21:14:58 -0400] erikh: let's back up
[2012-10-27 21:15:07 -0400] erikh: frk131: is this on a server or on your local workstation?
[2012-10-27 21:15:29 -0400] frk131: local
[2012-10-27 21:15:29 -0400] jtimberman: frk131: "gem env" will show "executable directory" where the binaries are installed.
[2012-10-27 21:15:42 -0400] jtimberman: you'll need that directory added to your shell PATH variable to find the binaries.
[2012-10-27 21:15:53 -0400] frk131: yes i did, now works :)
[2012-10-27 21:16:27 -0400] erikh: as long as you're hitting the gem wrappers and not the bin's in the gems themselves, you're probably fine
[2012-10-27 21:16:37 -0400] erikh: I guess that's what I thought you were doing.
[2012-10-27 21:17:06 -0400] erikh: anyhow, back to making retarded tweets
[2012-10-27 21:17:42 -0400] jtimberman: erikh: lulz
[2012-10-27 21:20:19 -0400] fleish: does anyone here have experience using knife with openstack?
[2012-10-27 21:21:19 -0400] ssd7: yup
[2012-10-27 21:22:13 -0400] ssd7: fleish: Happy to help if you've got a questions :)
[2012-10-27 21:22:37 -0400] fleish: this may be a bit off topic, but I can't get it to interface correctly. looks like it's failing in keystone with a 500 error. knife openstack server list even gives me get_version() got an unexpected keyword argument 'auth'\", \"code\": 500
[2012-10-27 21:23:22 -0400] fleish: I've also tried using the knife ec2 api also, since I've already used keystone to generate ec2 credentials ... but it keeps trying to send them to the aws server for validation instead of to my openstack server (perhaps I don't understand how that part works)
[2012-10-27 21:24:36 -0400] ssd7: fleish: Hrmm.  I would probably check out the keystone logs related to the 500 first
[2012-10-27 21:25:10 -0400] fleish: http://pastebin.com/ZRKRJPYF
[2012-10-27 21:27:07 -0400] ssd7: fleish: hrmm.  What do you have for your knife[:openstack_auth_url] setting look like?
[2012-10-27 21:27:44 -0400] ssd7: wow, I shouldn't have forgone coffee this morning.
[2012-10-27 21:27:57 -0400] ssd7: s/look like//
[2012-10-27 21:28:06 -0400] fleish: export OS_AUTH_URL=http://10.102.10.1:35357/v2.0/
[2012-10-27 21:28:20 -0400] fleish: you should never forgo coffee in the morning (FTFY)
[2012-10-27 21:28:49 -0400] ssd7: fleish: try http://10.102.10.1:35357/v2.0/tokens
[2012-10-27 21:34:04 -0400] fleish: ssd7: go reward yourself with some coffee ...  that was the last piece of the puzzle!
[2012-10-27 21:36:09 -0400] ssd7: fleish: Great! Will do.
