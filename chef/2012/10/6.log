[2012-10-06 00:00:05 -0400] z: holoway: prove I'm nuts and I'll reconsider? ;)
[2012-10-06 00:00:22 -0400] paulmooring: holoway: When you get this ready minding hitting me up for some testing too?
[2012-10-06 00:00:24 -0400] holoway: z: sure, I'll show you this continuous delivery demo
[2012-10-06 00:00:30 -0400] z: that'd rock
[2012-10-06 00:00:41 -0400] holoway: z: and you'll be like "fuck, it would delete all my data bags"
[2012-10-06 00:00:49 -0400] holoway: and then you'll go
[2012-10-06 00:00:58 -0400] JasonF: oh man, I'd love that so much
[2012-10-06 00:01:00 -0400] holoway: "it turns out the chef server is the source of truth, and many things update it"
[2012-10-06 00:01:09 -0400] holoway: "but only one thing for each type of thing"
[2012-10-06 00:01:11 -0400] JasonF: holoway: you haven't felt pain until you've debugged a problem caused by a zombie data bag or cookbook :(
[2012-10-06 00:01:21 -0400] JasonF: i.e., not in repo but in chef-server
[2012-10-06 00:01:23 -0400] holoway: JasonF: I *invented* that pain :)
[2012-10-06 00:01:25 -0400] z: holoway: I have actually been wrestling that a bit later. I concede you are likely right.
[2012-10-06 00:01:32 -0400] z: s/later/lately/
[2012-10-06 00:01:44 -0400] JasonF: holoway: maybe that was a little dramatic :)
[2012-10-06 00:02:07 -0400] holoway: I'm all for one source of truth
[2012-10-06 00:02:15 -0400] holoway: I just don't think that source is git for every object
[2012-10-06 00:02:28 -0400] z: holoway: i'm wrangling with the concept of a 'pluggable' web interface (Dashboard) where you can include building blocks of code *alongside* a cookbook (like tests) which at a minimum allow the UI to render things like Data Bags and "shit the cookbook uses"
[2012-10-06 00:02:48 -0400] z: holoway: to allow nontechnical people to do things like add/delete users
[2012-10-06 00:02:58 -0400] JasonF: holoway: data_bags, nodes, cookbooks... those are awesome to be the source of truth from git
[2012-10-06 00:03:06 -0400] holoway: JasonF: some data bags
[2012-10-06 00:03:09 -0400] JasonF: holoway: I could understand the argument of not wanting to do that for chef users though
[2012-10-06 00:03:25 -0400] z: holoway: we're using Chef as the SOT (Source of Truth) for our bare-metal provisioning too, things like RAID card configs, where servers are racked, etc
[2012-10-06 00:03:27 -0400] holoway: JasonF: having your build system automatically create a data bag per release is awesome
[2012-10-06 00:03:43 -0400] holoway: JasonF: and the idea that you can only do that through a file commit is crazy :)
[2012-10-06 00:03:50 -0400] holoway: cause it doesn't buy you anything
[2012-10-06 00:03:52 -0400] z: so again having that rendered, like a Visio-esque "Rack View" (literally a view!) is neat
[2012-10-06 00:03:52 -0400] holoway: but more loops
[2012-10-06 00:04:08 -0400] holoway: but it doesn't matter, cause you don't have to roll my way
[2012-10-06 00:04:20 -0400] holoway: and I totally get the desire
[2012-10-06 00:04:28 -0400] JasonF: holoway: we do that.
[2012-10-06 00:04:45 -0400] JasonF: holoway: except the deploy tool (dreadnot, it's open source), actually updates + uploads the data bag into git itself
[2012-10-06 00:05:07 -0400] JasonF: data bag includes the values like sha1 hash of deployed version of code, things like that
[2012-10-06 00:05:14 -0400] holoway: JasonF: right
[2012-10-06 00:05:19 -0400] holoway: it's cool
[2012-10-06 00:05:25 -0400] JasonF: it sucks a lot that it's 5pm on a Friday, and I have plans, because I could have this conversation with you for hours.
[2012-10-06 00:05:32 -0400] holoway: heeheh
[2012-10-06 00:05:37 -0400] holoway: I'll be around, man
[2012-10-06 00:05:41 -0400] JasonF: I PM'd you my email, and am more than glad to give you more insight into how we do things if you want.
[2012-10-06 00:05:50 -0400] JasonF: ty for supporting this pattern though
[2012-10-06 00:05:52 -0400] JasonF: and have  anice weekend
[2012-10-06 00:05:53 -0400] holoway: all I'm doing is writing a github web hook
[2012-10-06 00:06:10 -0400] holoway: it's not going to be very complicated
[2012-10-06 00:06:14 -0400] holoway: but it will be very strict
[2012-10-06 00:06:16 -0400] holoway: :)
[2012-10-06 00:06:25 -0400] holoway: and I'm glad you'll love it
[2012-10-06 00:06:50 -0400] z: soon as it's done I'd be happy to test
[2012-10-06 00:07:02 -0400] z: I have a GH:E install I can inject the hook into
[2012-10-06 00:08:48 -0400] holoway: ok, I gotta go get my daughter from daycare
[2012-10-06 00:09:02 -0400] holoway: see you crazy cats later
[2012-10-06 00:12:29 -0400] hoover_damm: z, well do you have ci run every time you push?
[2012-10-06 00:12:36 -0400] hoover_damm: z, or was only I that crazy once upon a time?
[2012-10-06 00:15:06 -0400] z: hoover_damm: yes CI runs on every push, and against every branch
[2012-10-06 00:18:06 -0400] hoover_damm: yep
[2012-10-06 01:37:02 -0400] makerbreaker: https://gist.github.com/3521594
[2012-10-06 01:37:17 -0400] makerbreaker: anyone have a suggstion for that?
[2012-10-06 01:39:10 -0400] makerbreaker: nm got it
[2012-10-06 08:44:59 -0400] corp: gday
[2012-10-06 12:03:39 -0400] leifmadsen: morning all. I have a few blocks of execute resources that I could actually use in a couple different recipes. I'm trying to think of the best ways to utilize those so I can use them via notifies in my other cookbooks. All the execute resources are action  :nothing and get triggered when a file changes (reload an application).
[2012-10-06 12:07:01 -0400] siezer: Hi Leif. Maybe you could refactor them into libraries and ruby_block them instead?
[2012-10-06 12:10:51 -0400] siezer: yourcookbook/libraries/default.rb, make with the function definitions, and then write a depends in metadata.rb for any cookbook that needs them
[2012-10-06 12:22:31 -0400] leifmadsen: siezer: ya a library is kind of what I was thinking as well. I was looking to see if I could use existing resources in there, but a ruby block might work just as well.
[2012-10-06 12:22:49 -0400] leifmadsen: it's a simple one line 'app -x "reload module"'
[2012-10-06 12:23:17 -0400] siezer: the important part is that you can just refer to it by name from other cookbooks instead of having to duplicate the command definitions everywhere right?
[2012-10-06 12:23:21 -0400] siezer: yea
[2012-10-06 12:24:44 -0400] leifmadsen: siezer: indeed that is the idea
[2012-10-06 12:25:02 -0400] leifmadsen: I was writing a cookbook last night, and realized there was some execute blocks I could use again
[2012-10-06 12:25:21 -0400] leifmadsen: I copy/pasta'd them, but I need to go back and make them a single call from a single location
[2012-10-06 12:25:24 -0400] siezer: yep. that's what the libraries/ dir is for
[2012-10-06 12:25:40 -0400] leifmadsen: yep we did that with some IP lookup stuff before, I just wanted to make sure expanding that library was probably the right way
[2012-10-06 12:25:49 -0400] leifmadsen: siezer: thanks for the help! time for breakfast :)
[2012-10-06 12:25:53 -0400] siezer: later!
[2012-10-06 13:01:58 -0400] makerbreaker: ping danryan
[2012-10-06 13:02:14 -0400] makerbreaker: whats the patter for making a put request to a databag?
[2012-10-06 13:02:18 -0400] makerbreaker: pattern*
[2012-10-06 14:25:51 -0400] binbasti: hi
[2012-10-06 14:26:03 -0400] masterkorp: HALO
[2012-10-06 14:26:38 -0400] binbasti: i have a question regarding the application cookbook
[2012-10-06 14:26:47 -0400] masterkorp: go ahead
[2012-10-06 14:26:59 -0400] binbasti: the readme says i can use before_something callbacks for the application lwrp
[2012-10-06 14:27:05 -0400] binbasti: but mine don't fire
[2012-10-06 14:27:29 -0400] binbasti: maybe i'm using it wrong
[2012-10-06 14:27:36 -0400] binbasti: just a sec
[2012-10-06 14:28:37 -0400] binbasti: https://gist.github.com/83f4c15697fcd4b5f484
[2012-10-06 14:28:50 -0400] masterkorp: common mistake: You need to have the default recipe in the run list
[2012-10-06 14:29:15 -0400] binbasti: what do you mean?
[2012-10-06 14:29:24 -0400] binbasti: the deployment is working fine otherwise
[2012-10-06 14:29:33 -0400] binbasti: i just can't get the callback to work
[2012-10-06 14:30:01 -0400] binbasti: so, this one doesn't throw an error, but it also doesn't do anything. when i put a log statement there, it doesn't appear in the run output
[2012-10-06 14:30:14 -0400] masterkorp: Oh, try to use the only_if attribute to confirm
[2012-10-06 14:31:17 -0400] binbasti: isn't it run every time if i don't use a filter attribute at all?
[2012-10-06 14:31:32 -0400] binbasti: what means "confirm" in this context?
[2012-10-06 14:31:58 -0400] masterkorp: Can you show the exact recipe ?
[2012-10-06 14:33:03 -0400] binbasti: https://gist.github.com/04071bd808bb2cc14d32
[2012-10-06 14:33:31 -0400] masterkorp: oh its another resource inside
[2012-10-06 14:33:38 -0400] masterkorp: i have an idea
[2012-10-06 14:34:31 -0400] masterkorp: let me play the AC/DC first
[2012-10-06 14:34:41 -0400] binbasti: :D
[2012-10-06 14:35:31 -0400] binbasti: maybe there's also a better way to use custom config files...
[2012-10-06 14:35:37 -0400] masterkorp: Wait
[2012-10-06 14:35:44 -0400] binbasti: sure
[2012-10-06 14:36:50 -0400] masterkorp: can i push to your gist ?
[2012-10-06 14:36:58 -0400] binbasti: nope
[2012-10-06 14:37:04 -0400] masterkorp: oh man i love gist too brainstorm
[2012-10-06 14:37:07 -0400] masterkorp: *tp
[2012-10-06 14:37:09 -0400] binbasti: you can fork it and push to yours
[2012-10-06 14:37:17 -0400] masterkorp: and this this weed too
[2012-10-06 14:37:27 -0400] binbasti: what's the idea?
[2012-10-06 14:38:06 -0400] masterkorp: i am pretty sure that the before_deploy does not support resources
[2012-10-06 14:38:18 -0400] masterkorp: try with a notifies attribut
[2012-10-06 14:38:58 -0400] binbasti: you mean like `notifies :before_deploy`?
[2012-10-06 14:39:07 -0400] masterkorp: no
[2012-10-06 14:40:44 -0400] binbasti: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application#callback-attributes
[2012-10-06 14:40:50 -0400] binbasti: here's the documentation
[2012-10-06 14:41:57 -0400] masterkorp: https://gist.github.com/4856fbb300db8f225455
[2012-10-06 14:41:59 -0400] masterkorp: this
[2012-10-06 14:42:09 -0400] masterkorp: also, the obvious question
[2012-10-06 14:42:28 -0400] masterkorp: why isn't this template just before the application resource
[2012-10-06 14:42:46 -0400] masterkorp: ?
[2012-10-06 14:43:12 -0400] binbasti: because there's no app dir or shared dir before the first run
[2012-10-06 14:43:20 -0400] masterkorp: hmmm
[2012-10-06 14:43:22 -0400] binbasti: it's set up by the application provider
[2012-10-06 14:43:26 -0400] binbasti: as it should be
[2012-10-06 14:43:32 -0400] binbasti: thx, i'll try that
[2012-10-06 14:43:56 -0400] binbasti: can i use a block with notifies?
[2012-10-06 14:44:15 -0400] masterkorp: yeah notifies is common attribute
[2012-10-06 14:44:37 -0400] masterkorp: Its very handy when on templates that have config files
[2012-10-06 14:44:58 -0400] masterkorp: if the config changes, sends a restart to the application to read the modifications
[2012-10-06 14:45:11 -0400] masterkorp: only if the config changes, not every single chef run
[2012-10-06 14:46:06 -0400] binbasti: that's a different problem and situation, no?
[2012-10-06 14:46:38 -0400] binbasti: oh, i overlooked the bottom
[2012-10-06 14:47:44 -0400] masterkorp: It can be handy there too
[2012-10-06 14:51:15 -0400] binbasti: masterkorp: awesome! it works
[2012-10-06 14:51:19 -0400] binbasti: thanks so much!
[2012-10-06 14:51:32 -0400] binbasti: have to read up on notifies :)
[2012-10-06 14:51:45 -0400] masterkorp: They're handy indeed
[2012-10-06 14:52:15 -0400] masterkorp: i feel like doing some burnouts

[2012-10-06 19:06:18 -0400] tylerflint: I'm writing a provider that depends on a package... what's the best way to handle that?
[2012-10-06 19:07:19 -0400] tylerflint: are other providers available from within a provider?
[2012-10-06 19:08:08 -0400] tylerflint: or would I have to run a recipe to install a "package" before using my provider?
[2012-10-06 19:19:50 -0400] makerbreaker: how do i reference a node hostname in a recipe?
[2012-10-06 19:20:42 -0400] makerbreaker: i have a recipe that keeps throwing this error: https://gist.github.com/3845846
[2012-10-06 19:20:46 -0400] makerbreaker: not sure what im doing wrong
[2012-10-06 19:24:26 -0400] Pushnell: makerbreaker: are you familiar with shef?
[2012-10-06 19:24:44 -0400] Pushnell: makerbreaker: that's probably the best way to explore what nodes are available and how to cast them into the types that you need
[2012-10-06 19:24:54 -0400] makerbreaker: cool, thast what i needed
[2012-10-06 19:25:29 -0400] Pushnell: makerbreaker: there's a war going on over this, but the winning side says that you should use strings instead of symbols to index into node attributes
[2012-10-06 19:25:51 -0400] Pushnell: makerbreaker: which might help your cause in this case since it seems to be failing to cast from symbol
[2012-10-06 19:26:13 -0400] Pushnell: makerbreaker: also, log is your friend :)
[2012-10-06 19:31:03 -0400] makerbreaker: pushnell
[2012-10-06 19:31:16 -0400] makerbreaker: so shef lets me step through the recipe just like it was running?
[2012-10-06 19:31:29 -0400] Pushnell: if you set breakpoints, yeah
[2012-10-06 19:31:52 -0400] Pushnell: but for something fairly simple like this, I would execute each line of the recipe manually.
[2012-10-06 19:32:00 -0400] makerbreaker: k
[2012-10-06 19:32:06 -0400] Pushnell: get the databag item (in the 'recipe' context) and play with it
[2012-10-06 19:32:14 -0400] Pushnell: if you're not familiar with ruby, look up pp
[2012-10-06 19:32:29 -0400] Pushnell: pp var.to_hash is pretty useful in shef

[2012-10-06 21:40:02 -0400] makerbreaker: am i calling data_bag_item incorrectly?
[2012-10-06 22:09:33 -0400] masterkorp: makerbreaker: why do you use #{}
[2012-10-06 22:09:35 -0400] masterkorp: ?
[2012-10-06 22:09:43 -0400] masterkorp: just place the var there
[2012-10-06 22:09:50 -0400] makerbreaker: ya
[2012-10-06 22:09:55 -0400] makerbreaker: i was trying all kinds of stuff
[2012-10-06 22:10:00 -0400] makerbreaker: i keep getting type errors
[2012-10-06 22:10:19 -0400] masterkorp: (i think) the data_bag function is only acessible on recipes
[2012-10-06 22:10:38 -0400] masterkorp: makes sense to have it there
[2012-10-06 22:10:39 -0400] makerbreaker: i was able to .to_json
[2012-10-06 22:10:54 -0400] makerbreaker: and it kind fo worked, just not the correct values
[2012-10-06 22:20:51 -0400] masterkorp: why do you want it there ? will you use it on more than one recipe ?
[2012-10-06 22:22:46 -0400] makerbreaker: no
[2012-10-06 22:23:14 -0400] makerbreaker: im still going to have the same problem whne i move it to the recipe though
[2012-10-06 23:28:47 -0400] makerbreaker: is there an easy way to apply and run just one recipe
[2012-10-06 23:40:51 -0400] josephholsten: shef?
[2012-10-06 23:41:15 -0400] josephholsten: is this for testing or prod?
[2012-10-06 23:43:49 -0400] ssd7: makerbreaker: In the latest version of chef-client you can run a custom run-list that won't be saved back to the node
[2012-10-06 23:44:12 -0400] ssd7: See the -o options.
[2012-10-06 23:44:35 -0400] ekristen: anyone using the redis cookbook?
[2012-10-06 23:44:38 -0400] d2kagw: hi all - i'm trying to bundle a cookbook to upload to the community site (it's a new version of an existing one I maintain) but i'm running into this issue: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2920
[2012-10-06 23:45:05 -0400] d2kagw: does anyone know a work around? (i've tried creating my own tar file manually but I keep getting the same error)
[2012-10-06 23:48:24 -0400] josephholsten: ekristen: I prefer the redisio cookbook
[2012-10-06 23:49:30 -0400] ekristen: what is LWRP?
[2012-10-06 23:49:48 -0400] kallistec: lwrp?
[2012-10-06 23:49:59 -0400] kallistec: hrmph, no bot
[2012-10-06 23:50:03 -0400] josephholsten: bad bot
[2012-10-06 23:50:03 -0400] jcran: lightweight resource provider
[2012-10-06 23:50:13 -0400] jcran: doc'd on the opscode site
[2012-10-06 23:50:24 -0400] kallistec: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Lightweight+Resources+and+Providers+%28LWRP%29
[2012-10-06 23:50:40 -0400] josephholsten: d2kagw: I don't remember anything about the rake tasks, does it work with `knife cookbook site share`?
[2012-10-06 23:51:25 -0400] ekristen: kallistec: thanks
[2012-10-06 23:51:46 -0400] ekristen: josephholsten: can it do master/slave setups?
[2012-10-06 23:51:58 -0400] d2kagw: josephholsten: unfortunately that command only creates new cookbooks, it doesn't allow updates. (i.e. you get this message when it runs "ERROR: The same version of this cookbook already exists on the Opscode Cookbook Site.")
[2012-10-06 23:52:32 -0400] josephholsten: o, sorry
[2012-10-06 23:52:57 -0400] josephholsten: I guess I've only updated with the website then :-/
[2012-10-06 23:53:33 -0400] josephholsten: ekristen: I'm checking
[2012-10-06 23:53:38 -0400] d2kagw: josephholsten: no probs, I'll keep investigating
[2012-10-06 23:53:56 -0400] josephholsten: d2kagw: mind filing a bug for that?
[2012-10-06 23:54:28 -0400] d2kagw: josephholsten: there was one already in there, I added a comment though: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2920
[2012-10-06 23:54:32 -0400] ekristen: josephholsten: it looks like it does if you manually set it up in attributes or something,
[2012-10-06 23:54:32 -0400] josephholsten: rake tasks are theoretically going away, so making knife work for that is double plus good
[2012-10-06 23:55:44 -0400] josephholsten: ah, yes
[2012-10-06 23:56:21 -0400] josephholsten: redisio.default_settings.slaveof = master-host
[2012-10-06 23:56:40 -0400] leifmadsen: siezer: heh, so I ended up going all out, looking at the database cookbook and ended up building a resource and provider ;)
[2012-10-06 23:57:07 -0400] ekristen: josephholsten: so I have to manually set that up for the environment default settings?
[2012-10-06 23:57:07 -0400] leifmadsen: siezer: (this is in regards to my question about centralizing a reload of an application about 12+ hrs ago)
[2012-10-06 23:57:40 -0400] josephholsten: ekristen: on your slave nodes yes, presumably via a role.
[2012-10-06 23:58:26 -0400] josephholsten: unless you want to be awesome and update the cb to discover that from a role
[2012-10-06 23:58:29 -0400] ekristen: josephholsten: so if I create a redis master role and a redis slave role, can I dynamically get the IP/host from chef in the redis slave role for the master?
[2012-10-06 23:58:35 -0400] ekristen: cb?
