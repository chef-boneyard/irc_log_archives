[2012-10-18 19:40:40 -0400] hoover_damm: flagg0204, which dns server is timing out?
[2012-10-18 19:41:00 -0400] hoover_damm: flagg0204, they use dynect so I'm hoping (as i use dynect) that they are not having issues
[2012-10-18 19:47:55 -0400] nerdcore: The opscode-cookbooks repository on github [https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks] has no Issue Queue, so how would I report an issue with one of the cookbooks?
[2012-10-18 19:48:56 -0400] moos3: there should be a issue queue for the given cookbook
[2012-10-18 19:49:24 -0400] joonas: nerdcore: open the cookbook repository, click on "Issues"
[2012-10-18 19:49:25 -0400] joonas: :)
[2012-10-18 19:49:43 -0400] joonas: opscode-cookbooks is the 'organization' under which all the cookbooks are listed
[2012-10-18 19:50:05 -0400] nerdcore: I am not seeing the word "issue" anywhere on this page:
[2012-10-18 19:50:07 -0400] nerdcore: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/varnish
[2012-10-18 19:50:22 -0400] joonas: uh oh, looks like issues are disabled
[2012-10-18 19:50:27 -0400] joonas: on that/those repos
[2012-10-18 19:51:41 -0400] nerdcore: I'm trying to cook that cookbook using knife-solo against a CentOS box and it's bailing on line 30 "template node['varnish']['default'] do" with the error "can't convert nil into String"
[2012-10-18 19:52:08 -0400] nerdcore: line 30 of recipes/default.rb that is
[2012-10-18 19:52:09 -0400] wcmaier: nerdcore: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK/component/10187
[2012-10-18 19:52:55 -0400] joonas: nerdcore: I don't think it's compatible with centos
[2012-10-18 19:52:58 -0400] joonas: at least, the defaults aren't
[2012-10-18 19:53:01 -0400] joonas: you'd have to override them
[2012-10-18 19:53:06 -0400] joonas: nerdcore: looking at https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/varnish/blob/master/attributes/default.rb
[2012-10-18 19:53:23 -0400] joonas: see line #4
[2012-10-18 19:53:27 -0400] joonas: well, 2-5
[2012-10-18 19:53:57 -0400] nerdcore: joonas: excellent thank you :)
[2012-10-18 19:54:04 -0400] nerdcore: wcmaier: how did you find this page? :)
[2012-10-18 19:54:04 -0400] joonas: np
[2012-10-18 19:54:17 -0400] wcmaier: nerdcore: i knew that cookbooks were part of the COOK JIRA
[2012-10-18 19:55:33 -0400] nerdcore: hmmm, might be nice to have a link there on the github page(s)...
[2012-10-18 19:56:11 -0400] joonas: nerdcore: it would be
[2012-10-18 19:56:28 -0400] joonas: perhaps on the README :)
[2012-10-18 19:56:46 -0400] wcmaier: nerdcore: file a JIRA bug to that effect ;)
[2012-10-18 19:58:19 -0400] pwelch: has any one had issues with deep merging in 10.14.4?
[2012-10-18 20:06:20 -0400] Twirrim: hmmm.. service "nginx", action [ :reload ] doesn't seem to actually cause a reload.  Or it does something, but not enough to make nginx create necessary log files.
[2012-10-18 20:08:50 -0400] nerdcore: How would I go about adding a software repository for varnish in the recipe? I've got a 'case platform' and when statement for the RedHat type machines, and I could just execute a shell command which runs rpm to add the repo, but is there a chef syntax for managing software repositories in RedHat style systems?
[2012-10-18 20:09:20 -0400] miah: nerdcore: use the yum cookbook, which has a 'yum_repo' lwrp. just install the repo before running the varnish cookbook.
[2012-10-18 20:09:31 -0400] nerdcore: miah: thx
[2012-10-18 20:09:41 -0400] miah: executing shell commands tends to not be idempotent (if you're not careful)
[2012-10-18 20:10:18 -0400] nerdcore: agreed
[2012-10-18 20:17:26 -0400] Rohan_: when I run: knife node show foo, it shows me a bunch of recipes and roles (aside from the run_list)
[2012-10-18 20:17:39 -0400] Rohan_: anyone know how I can blow away those recipes? (and roles)?
[2012-10-18 20:17:47 -0400] moos3: anyone have a good way to store a id_rsa in a databag ?
[2012-10-18 20:19:53 -0400] JasonF: moos3: If you're storing a ssh private key, I'd def. use an encrypted data bag.
[2012-10-18 20:20:09 -0400] moos3: JasonF yea the private key
[2012-10-18 20:20:37 -0400] moos3: but it doesn't like "private_key":"---BEGIN RSA KEY--- ---END RSA KEY---"
[2012-10-18 20:40:45 -0400] gchristensen: hi, I'm getting undefined method `backend_http_servers' for Chef::Resource::Template in a template where I'm passing backend_http_servers as a variable, any ideas why? probably something silly... https://gist.github.com/b140d5d693bea41947ef complete log and section of the code
[2012-10-18 20:43:16 -0400] gchristensen: oy! found it
[2012-10-18 21:06:02 -0400] leifmadsen: am I perhaps using the 'depth' attribute in the git resource wrong? I set it to 1, with the thought that it might limit the amount of data I need to checkout, but it kind of freaked out with a permissions issue
[2012-10-18 21:08:55 -0400] nerdcore: I'm a bit stumped on using yum_repository to add a repo for Varnish RPMs, given that I added the repo info from aa separate RPM following the instructions here: http://www.how2centos.com/install-varnish-centos-6/
[2012-10-18 21:11:03 -0400] leifmadsen: from some testing, it almost seems like 'depth' applies to submodules....
[2012-10-18 21:11:14 -0400] leifmadsen: since it bombed out after 5 submodules when I changed from 1 to 5
[2012-10-18 21:11:18 -0400] leifmadsen: perhaps a coincidence
[2012-10-18 22:16:05 -0400] msch: hi, i had some cookbook_files in my recipe and in a newer iteration those files don't exist any more. how do i make chef detect that and delete those files from the server?
[2012-10-18 22:31:29 -0400] martinisoft: would there be any reason for a cookbook to only have part of its contents downloaded to a client?
[2012-10-18 22:33:48 -0400] miah: typically chef only downloads the changes in a cookbook if its already on the client. if the cookbook doesn't exist there at all then it will download all of it.
[2012-10-18 22:35:34 -0400] miah: nerdcore: look at what the repo rpm installed. its just a few txt files. just dig the info out of those files and give it to yum_repo.
[2012-10-18 22:35:51 -0400] miah: nerdcore: or create a recipe that installs the varnish repo package and call it done.
[2012-10-18 22:36:56 -0400] zsiddique: so for packages can you have mutiple actions?  Currently I have a package that does install but I also want to upgrade everytime a new version is available.  So something like action :install, upgrade
[2012-10-18 22:40:00 -0400] miah: upgrade will install if it isn't already installed.
[2012-10-18 22:40:07 -0400] miah: but yes, you can pass an array of actions
[2012-10-18 22:40:30 -0400] miah: just be prepared for chef runs to take forever if you're using upgrade
[2012-10-18 22:45:20 -0400] zsiddique: miah: yeah this one package i need to keep updated as its in active development
[2012-10-18 23:08:44 -0400] papertigers: does chef support nfsv4 acl's?
