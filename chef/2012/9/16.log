[2012-09-16 00:53:17 -0400] lhazlewood: Is it safe to have your organization's chef-repo in a publicly viewable repository on GitHub?
[2012-09-16 00:53:52 -0400] lhazlewood: (I'm asking w.r.t. security not policy).  Passwords, etc...
[2012-09-16 05:20:55 -0400] psykidellic: meineerde: Thanks. In my quest to learn things I got it working using package. But I believe it will be worth it just to try with the cookbook too as its more used and has bugs fixed.
[2012-09-16 05:31:14 -0400] fleish: anyone online?
[2012-09-16 05:32:35 -0400] Axsuul: sup
[2012-09-16 05:34:44 -0400] fleish: hey, so I'm having trouble figuring out why my apache chef recipe (1.1.4) keeps restarting apache every time it runs - seems to be part of installing mod_ssl but I can't figure out how to stop it from doing it every time once it's installed since it doesn't really change
[2012-09-16 05:36:09 -0400] Axsuul: Which recipe are you using
[2012-09-16 05:46:52 -0400] fleish: apache 1.1.4
[2012-09-16 05:47:03 -0400] Axsuul: which cookbook are you using
[2012-09-16 05:47:19 -0400] fleish: [2012-09-16T05:23:25+00:00] INFO: template[/etc/apache2/mods-available/ssl.conf] sending restart action to service[apache2] (delayed)
[2012-09-16 05:47:19 -0400] fleish: [2012-09-16T05:23:25+00:00] INFO: Processing service[apache2] action restart (apache2::default line 25)
[2012-09-16 05:49:10 -0400] flaccid_: tis by design
[2012-09-16 05:49:55 -0400] fleish: pray tell tis there a way to short circuit it?
[2012-09-16 05:50:07 -0400] fleish: unless there's been a change
[2012-09-16 05:50:31 -0400] flaccid_: its a delayed restart, whats the prob?
[2012-09-16 05:51:55 -0400] fleish: well I've fixed it to at least check the config is valid before trying (else it killed a running apache in the event of a bad config), but I don't want it to restart at all unless there's a need to restart
[2012-09-16 05:53:14 -0400] flaccid_: it probably does need a restart thus the action. if it doesn't you can lodge a bug
[2012-09-16 05:53:52 -0400] flaccid_: there probably is no point in the extra validation as you want it to error if the devop sets up a wrong run
[2012-09-16 05:54:15 -0400] flaccid_: in any case, try to not make your own version of it..
[2012-09-16 05:59:22 -0400] fleish: well I don't see any reason for a restart, it just stops the server from responding which is a bad thing IMO. as for extra validation, you would still get an error, it just keeps you from ending up with no apache running. as for devops ... don't even get me started
[2012-09-16 06:29:05 -0400] flaccid_: user gone, ah well
[2012-09-16 16:19:49 -0400] v1n3: After fighting with godrb all night, I've decided to try monit
[2012-09-16 16:20:12 -0400] v1n3: can someone point me to a gist or project implementing monit?
[2012-09-16 16:20:44 -0400] KarlHungus: monit is nice
[2012-09-16 16:20:58 -0400] KarlHungus: i'm making a monit cookbook right now actually =)
[2012-09-16 16:21:09 -0400] v1n3: I don't quite grok the setup.. ooh. I'd love to watch over your shoulder
[2012-09-16 16:21:31 -0400] KarlHungus: https://github.com/jssjr/chef-monit
[2012-09-16 16:22:06 -0400] KarlHungus: the lwrp lets you add 'monit_check "foo"' to a recipe
[2012-09-16 16:22:24 -0400] KarlHungus: then foo.conf.erb will be sourced from the cookbook as the monit conf for that app
[2012-09-16 16:23:10 -0400] v1n3: too be honest I don't fully grok chef's layout yet. foo.conf.erb would be under *my* cookbook templates?
[2012-09-16 16:23:17 -0400] KarlHungus: https://gist.github.com/b9b5bc0beb10aa595456
[2012-09-16 16:23:50 -0400] KarlHungus: yes. though you can manage where the template is sourced from in the monit_check resource
[2012-09-16 16:24:17 -0400] KarlHungus: that gist is 'ccp.conf.erb' from my ccp cookbook (ccp is an app i maintain at $dayjob)
[2012-09-16 16:24:42 -0400] v1n3: my goal here is to monitor a sinatra app under puma, so this is promising :)
[2012-09-16 16:26:10 -0400] KarlHungus: cool. we are migrating off passenger and to unicorn for some services and monit seemed to be appropriate
[2012-09-16 16:28:05 -0400] v1n3: are you using this cookbook in production yet?
[2012-09-16 16:28:44 -0400] KarlHungus: not yet
[2012-09-16 16:28:47 -0400] KarlHungus: still developing
[2012-09-16 16:29:03 -0400] KarlHungus: i won't use it in prod until i have written a more complete set of tests also
[2012-09-16 16:29:23 -0400] KarlHungus: travis is only doing a foodcritic lint right now =)
[2012-09-16 16:30:09 -0400] v1n3: what prompted you to roll your own? There are dozens of results for "chef-monit"
[2012-09-16 16:30:55 -0400] KarlHungus: none of them implemented managing checks with a lwrp
[2012-09-16 16:31:20 -0400] KarlHungus: or, none that i saw while researching. also, none of them had tests
[2012-09-16 16:32:17 -0400] KarlHungus: i manage a lot of freebsd hosts, so i've gotten pretty used to having to roll my own cookbooks ;)
[2012-09-16 17:28:35 -0400] jgerry: hi, I've recently moved to Chef (from Puppet) due to a new job. Trying to figure out the "right" way to pull information from files on the filesystem to use in my templates/recipes. Is the correct way to do this using Ohai? Write a plugin?
[2012-09-16 17:34:03 -0400] z: jgerry: can you be more specific about what you're trying to accomplish, by giving us an example?
[2012-09-16 17:36:16 -0400] jgerry: oh sure. i have server-specific info on each server in a .json file, this is used by EngineYard to define some things like application name, lots of other stuff too. I need to be able to read this file and parse out certain items to use when building template files used for log management (Logstash). The paths in the template files will vary based on some of this data, so it's needed to build my Logstash config files.
[2012-09-16 17:36:54 -0400] z: jgerry: It sounds like an Ohai plugin is just the ticket, then
[2012-09-16 17:39:54 -0400] jgerry: That seemed to be the case, excellent. Now I just need to get that plugin into the right place on the filesytem so its picked up
[2012-09-16 17:42:31 -0400] z: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Distributing+Ohai+Plugins
[2012-09-16 17:42:39 -0400] z: ^ That may be of assistance with that quest :-)
[2012-09-16 17:42:56 -0400] jgerry: i've been reading that page actually, thanks
[2012-09-16 17:43:56 -0400] jgerry: seems to be focused on chef-server which isn't used in my case, I'm kind of trapped in EngineYard's setup. is there a better or more elegant proper way to do this other than just having chef drop the file into place in the ohai plugins directory?
[2012-09-16 17:46:25 -0400] jgerry: my first instinct is just to use my default.rb recipe for Logstash to make sure the ohai plugin file exists
[2012-09-16 17:47:06 -0400] jgerry: but I'd prefer a more general approach that added the needed file(s) from a more upstream location, not tied to my logstash recipe
[2012-09-16 17:48:48 -0400] jgerry: actually I may have found the place, engine yard has its own et-cloud-recipes github that contains a "main" recipe requiring the others. that's probably the right place
[2012-09-16 17:51:54 -0400] jgerry: I'll work the rest out. thanks for the help!
[2012-09-16 17:53:18 -0400] jgerry: this is exactly what I'm looking for: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/ohai
[2012-09-16 19:27:50 -0400] j-v-e: good day gentlement
[2012-09-16 19:28:42 -0400] j-v-e: so, I created a firewall cookbook for linux https://github.com/jvehent/AFW and I'd like to make it available to the community
[2012-09-16 19:29:41 -0400] j-v-e: we've been using it heavily at work, and I will keep maintaining/improving it. question is: how to I link my github repos to opscode-cookbooks ?
[2012-09-16 20:34:02 -0400] hoover_damm: j-v-e, opscode-cookbooks primarily is cookbooks provided by opscode.
[2012-09-16 20:34:16 -0400] hoover_damm: j-v-e, if you want to make your cookbook available for others to see you would post it to community.opscode.com
[2012-09-16 20:35:10 -0400] hoover_damm: j-v-e, as far as getting it included i'm not sure of those steps... but i know that normally you just have it posted on the community site
[2012-09-16 20:35:47 -0400] j-v-e: hoover_damm: community.opscode.com  is what I meant :)
[2012-09-16 20:39:50 -0400] j-v-e: ' Cookbook folder must match cookbook name ' ?
[2012-09-16 20:40:18 -0400] j-v-e: so I need a 'cookbooks/<whatever>' layout in the tar ?
[2012-09-16 20:40:46 -0400] hoover_damm: j-v-e, it should match what's in github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nginx
[2012-09-16 20:40:47 -0400] hoover_damm: and such
[2012-09-16 20:41:31 -0400] hoover_damm: j-v-e, so your AFW repo should work as is
[2012-09-16 20:42:17 -0400] hoover_damm: j-v-e, you can delete the metadata.json as you should not need to upload that, but that's not a big deal.
[2012-09-16 20:42:18 -0400] j-v-e: The tar from github is wrong :) that's why
[2012-09-16 20:46:24 -0400] j-v-e: ' Cookbook must contain only a single directory ' ??
[2012-09-16 20:48:36 -0400] j-v-e: eh ' Cookbook must contain metadata.json ' :p
[2012-09-16 20:48:50 -0400] j-v-e: I wish all of that was written before uploading the archive :p
[2012-09-16 20:48:58 -0400] j-v-e: getting errors at each upload is annoying
[2012-09-16 20:50:55 -0400] j-v-e: yeah ! http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/afw
[2012-09-16 20:51:32 -0400] hoover_damm: yay
[2012-09-16 20:52:34 -0400] hoover_damm: and yes github gives you afw-#{sha} as the directory name
[2012-09-16 20:52:34 -0400] j-v-e: and, of course, the readme syntax isn't markdown :(
[2012-09-16 20:53:43 -0400] j-v-e: I wish I could just get community.opscode.com to track the git repo
[2012-09-16 21:01:17 -0400] hoover_damm: ditto
[2012-09-16 21:01:26 -0400] hoover_damm: or have github api ability
[2012-09-16 21:01:40 -0400] hoover_damm: so it can basically read and download and import and sync
[2012-09-16 21:01:42 -0400] hoover_damm: when you want
[2012-09-16 21:23:42 -0400] keves: hello
[2012-09-16 21:24:15 -0400] keves: i have a custom ohai plugin that register some attributes and i can't seem to access them from some recipe's default attributes
[2012-09-16 21:24:32 -0400] keves: unless i modif /etc/chef/client.rb and add Ohai::Config[:plugin_path] << '/etc/chef/ohai_plugins'
[2012-09-16 21:24:35 -0400] keves: what am i missing? :(
