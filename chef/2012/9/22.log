[2012-09-22 02:05:49 -0400] Axsuul: Anyone use littlechef here? DOes it ask for sudo password whenever you deploy?
[2012-09-22 02:16:42 -0400] cburyta: I have been, it only asks for my pass for the box i'm loggin into, but yes every time
[2012-09-22 02:17:20 -0400] cburyta: (it used the user / pass from auth file only for deploy_chef initial deployment call)
[2012-09-22 17:25:40 -0400] sascha_d: hi chefs, did someone change the default omnibus location from /opt/opscode to /opt/chef?
[2012-09-22 18:15:32 -0400] thedeeno: I'm getting "Invalid signature for user or client '<node_name>'" when running chef-client on a new node
[2012-09-22 18:15:46 -0400] thedeeno: I've regenerated my org's validation key
[2012-09-22 18:15:55 -0400] thedeeno: copied it to the node in /etc/chef/validation.pem
[2012-09-22 18:16:20 -0400] thedeeno: made user that the client is deleted via `knife client delete <node_name>
[2012-09-22 18:16:35 -0400] thedeeno: and made sure the node is deleted via 'knife node delete <node_name>
[2012-09-22 18:18:09 -0400] thedeeno: also, I've verified that the uname -n matches the 'relevant config settings - node_name' printed by chef-client
[2012-09-22 18:18:37 -0400] thedeeno: i've also deleted the client.pem, so that chef-client _should_ attempt to regenerate the client key with the validation key
[2012-09-22 18:18:54 -0400] thedeeno: but no matter what, i seem to get "Failed to authenticate to the chef server (http 401)."
[2012-09-22 18:19:10 -0400] thedeeno: Invalid signature for user or client 'node_name'
[2012-09-22 18:19:39 -0400] thedeeno: Thoughts? I can't get this node to work at all, and re-bootstrapping is a nuclear option that I shouldn't need to do.
[2012-09-22 18:32:31 -0400] Manuel__: Hi, I'm finding trouble making use of  --bootstrap-version "0.10.8", can somebody help?
[2012-09-22 18:32:59 -0400] Manuel__: it completely ignores me and keeps using 10.14.2 which breaks my recipes
[2012-09-22 18:36:51 -0400] Manuel__: nobody?
[2012-09-22 18:41:18 -0400] hoover_damm: Manuel__, default template picks chef-full now...
[2012-09-22 18:41:39 -0400] hoover_damm: Manuel__, and that will look for older versions of the full installer, so you'll need to specify like a template of ubuntu-gems with the --bootstrap-version
[2012-09-22 18:41:43 -0400] hoover_damm: Manuel__, for it to work
[2012-09-22 18:41:57 -0400] hoover_damm: or build your own omnibus with 0.10.8
[2012-09-22 18:42:08 -0400] Manuel__: ummmm
[2012-09-22 18:42:40 -0400] Manuel__: I don't really understand wht you mean with the template
[2012-09-22 18:42:46 -0400] Manuel__: this is the command I use
[2012-09-22 18:43:24 -0400] Manuel__: knife bootstrap XXXXXXXXX -r 'role[base]' -x root -P XXXXX -N "XXXXX.com" --environment "qa" --bootstrap-version "0.10.8"
[2012-09-22 18:43:59 -0400] hoover_damm: Manuel__, knife bootstrap --help
[2012-09-22 18:44:20 -0400] hoover_damm: Manuel__, http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Knife+Bootstrap
[2012-09-22 18:44:56 -0400] hoover_damm: Manuel__, so if your trying to do 12.04 you'd want -d ubuntu12.04-gems --bootstrap-version "0.10.8"
[2012-09-22 18:44:59 -0400] Manuel__: yep, that says --bootstrap-version VERSION: The version of Chef to install
[2012-09-22 18:45:09 -0400] hoover_damm: without specifying the -d for the template
[2012-09-22 18:45:15 -0400] hoover_damm: you will always get the latest version with chef-full
[2012-09-22 18:45:17 -0400] Manuel__: ummmmm
[2012-09-22 18:45:25 -0400] Manuel__: I'm using 10.4.4
[2012-09-22 18:45:33 -0400] hoover_damm: which is the whole point, you need to specify a template
[2012-09-22 18:46:44 -0400] Manuel__: so in my case should be -d ubuntu10.04-gems --bootstrap-version "0.10.8". right?
[2012-09-22 18:46:44 -0400] hoover_damm: read over the wiki page I linked, it should answer most of your questions
[2012-09-22 18:49:11 -0400] Manuel__: ok, thanks
[2012-09-22 19:36:59 -0400] ssd7: Ohai Chefs
[2012-09-22 19:46:19 -0400] thedeeno: hello
[2012-09-22 20:31:24 -0400] alephant: Hey all
[2012-09-22 20:31:34 -0400] alephant: I installed chef using the omnibus installer how do I uninstall it?
[2012-09-22 21:09:58 -0400] ssd7: alephant: What platform are you on?  The omnibus installer ultimately uses native packages
[2012-09-22 21:10:05 -0400] alephant: ubuntu
[2012-09-22 21:10:07 -0400] ssd7: you should be able to uninstall it with your package manager
[2012-09-22 21:10:15 -0400] alephant: and yes, I thought that was true
[2012-09-22 21:10:18 -0400] alephant: but wanted to make sure
[2012-09-22 21:10:19 -0400] alephant: thanks!
[2012-09-22 21:10:48 -0400] ssd7: alephant: No problem!  If you had problems that led you to need to uninstall, feel free to let us know :)
[2012-09-22 21:11:13 -0400] alephant: no, I was just trying to increase sophistication by bootstrapping via ``knife'' rather than manual omnibus install
[2012-09-22 21:11:50 -0400] ssd7: Ah, cool :)
[2012-09-22 21:35:44 -0400] alephant: ssd7: Easy question about security vs. convenience?
[2012-09-22 21:36:28 -0400] alephant: I'm testing with Hosted Chef, and I've got everything working - my user.pem and validator.pem  are in chef-repo/.chef, and everything's in git
[2012-09-22 21:36:56 -0400] alephant: but I don't want those privkeys in git for anybody with access to the repo to control all my nodes
[2012-09-22 21:37:16 -0400] rava: encrypted data bags
[2012-09-22 21:37:17 -0400] alephant: yet I need to keep copies of those for other team members and for backup
[2012-09-22 21:37:28 -0400] alephant: is there a howto or something for that config?
[2012-09-22 21:37:35 -0400] ranjibd__: alephant, u should not back up
[2012-09-22 21:37:41 -0400] rava: and i keep the passwords in an encrypted file
[2012-09-22 21:37:48 -0400] rava: admins have their own keys
[2012-09-22 21:37:53 -0400] ranjibd__: you should back up the ca crt. and a crl at most if need be..
[2012-09-22 21:38:17 -0400] ranjibd__: other wise always revoke old stuff generate new. if all gone. generate all
[2012-09-22 21:38:31 -0400] yfeldblum: alephant, you need to keep your user.pem private to yourself and you need to have another mechanism to distribute your validator.pem
[2012-09-22 21:38:39 -0400] yfeldblum: alephant, but they don't go in git
[2012-09-22 21:38:49 -0400] alephant: that's what I thought
[2012-09-22 21:39:00 -0400] alephant: should I be creating multiple users for everybody on my team?
[2012-09-22 21:39:08 -0400] alephant: s/multiple/discrete
[2012-09-22 21:39:14 -0400] yfeldblum: alephant, yes
[2012-09-22 21:39:30 -0400] ranjibd__: yfeldblum, in hosted chef no way we can upload a public cert for an api client ?
[2012-09-22 21:40:04 -0400] alephant: I don't see how to do that in the web interface the only way I can see to create a user is to create a new account do I just create multiple free accounts and invite them to the account with billing tied to it?
[2012-09-22 21:40:29 -0400] thedeeno: I'm totally scratching my head on the problem I messages earlier. Anyone just checking in have any ideas?
[2012-09-22 21:40:37 -0400] thedeeno: messaged*
[2012-09-22 21:41:33 -0400] yfeldblum: ranjibd__, not that i am aware of, although i agree it would be convenient
[2012-09-22 21:41:37 -0400] yfeldblum: ranjibd__, indeed: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2380
[2012-09-22 21:48:45 -0400] ranjibd__: i do it with the opensource chef .. by invoking cdb_save locally.. as couch is bound to 127.0.0.1
[2012-09-22 21:59:00 -0400] bdha: jtimberman: The openssl cookbook doesn't actually create certs. I am disappoint, son.
[2012-09-22 21:59:29 -0400] alephant: Is it legal to put Resources in a Role?
[2012-09-22 21:59:41 -0400] alephant: like I want to create a File, can I put that in a Role?
[2012-09-22 22:01:00 -0400] yfeldblum: alephant, no, all code, including all resource declarations, go in recipes or in the other pieces of a cookbook
[2012-09-22 22:01:30 -0400] alephant: OK, confused: so run_list(), default_attributes() and friends aren't code?
[2012-09-22 22:03:23 -0400] yfeldblum: alephant, yes and no
[2012-09-22 22:04:09 -0400] ranjibd__: alephant, dsl. and raw ruby
[2012-09-22 22:04:17 -0400] yfeldblum: alephant, the ruby DSL for roles is used in one very specific way, and in that one specific way only: to produce a pure JSON role ... and it is used in that way in one place only: on your workstation, not on the chef-server and not on the servers running chef-client
[2012-09-22 22:04:18 -0400] ranjibd__: dsl is also ruby.. but evaled
[2012-09-22 22:12:44 -0400] thedeeno: If you were getting "Failed to authenticate to the chef server (http 401)." how would you troubleshoot it
[2012-09-22 22:12:46 -0400] thedeeno: ?
