[2012-09-01 00:02:53 -0400] makerbreaker: how woudl you guys bootstrap a server from wtihin a rails app?
[2012-09-01 00:03:03 -0400] makerbreaker: a shell call to knife, or is there a better way?
[2012-09-01 00:03:14 -0400] makerbreaker: the server is up, running ssh, and i have u/p
[2012-09-01 00:11:04 -0400] amccloud: Is default in attributes/default.rb a tree or do I have to define each level of configuration as a hash?
[2012-09-01 00:30:33 -0400] julienphalip: Hello there. I'm running some Chef recipes with vagrant, including a bunch of 'bash' resources. I run them with the user 'vagrant', but then every 'sudo <command>' I run raises this error while provisioning the box: "sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified". Do you know what that could be?
[2012-09-01 01:03:03 -0400] juliancdunn: julienphalip: need to specify "-t" to ssh?
[2012-09-01 01:03:16 -0400] juliancdunn: (to allocate a tty)
[2012-09-01 01:03:37 -0400] julienphalip: julienphalip: How can that be done?
[2012-09-01 01:03:47 -0400] julienphalip: juliancdunn: ^
[2012-09-01 01:08:59 -0400] juliancdunn: good question... normally it shouldn't be needed
[2012-09-01 01:09:16 -0400] juliancdunn: are you bootstrapping with "knife bootstrap" ?
[2012-09-01 01:10:17 -0400] juliancdunn: amccloud: the hash structure is up to you
[2012-09-01 01:11:50 -0400] amccloud: juliancdunn: Do I explicitly have to define each level as a new hash? Looking through existing cookbooks they all do default[:level1][:level2] = 'something'
[2012-09-01 01:12:01 -0400] yfeldblum: amccloud, no
[2012-09-01 01:12:15 -0400] yfeldblum: amccloud, through the magic of some very tricky code :D
[2012-09-01 01:15:13 -0400] amccloud: yfeldblum: Ah okay :)
[2012-09-01 01:15:17 -0400] amccloud: not use to that
[2012-09-01 01:30:19 -0400] yfeldblum: amccloud, it's not a Hash
[2012-09-01 01:30:27 -0400] yfeldblum: amccloud, it's a Chef::Node::Attribute
[2012-09-01 01:48:24 -0400] makerbreaker: how would you guys bootstrap a server from within a rails app?

[2012-09-01 01:55:31 -0400] makerbreaker: anyone familiar with this error?
[2012-09-01 01:55:36 -0400] makerbreaker: thats from a bundle isntall
[2012-09-01 01:56:21 -0400] bdha: 0.8.10 is .. pretty old.
[2012-09-01 01:56:59 -0400] hoover_damm: bdha, lol that's the first thing you saw wrong?
[2012-09-01 01:57:07 -0400] hoover_damm: bdha, there was many things that bothered me in that stacktrace
[2012-09-01 01:57:15 -0400] hoover_damm: from /home/afresta/rails_projects/CLOUD_POKER_DB/config/application.rb:7:in `<top (required)>'
[2012-09-01 01:57:18 -0400] hoover_damm: amuses me
[2012-09-01 01:57:33 -0400] makerbreaker: why
[2012-09-01 01:57:48 -0400] bdha: hoover_damm: Heh.
[2012-09-01 01:58:22 -0400] hoover_damm: makerbreaker, if your doing bundle install and getting this.  I suggest to find a new job.
[2012-09-01 01:58:35 -0400] hoover_damm: makerbreaker, because your going to be digging to fix this
[2012-09-01 01:58:47 -0400] makerbreaker: this is a personal project
[2012-09-01 01:58:52 -0400] makerbreaker: im learning
[2012-09-01 01:59:19 -0400] hoover_damm: learning is good :)
[2012-09-01 02:00:42 -0400] makerbreaker: but ya, i didnt notice it was 8.10
[2012-09-01 02:01:34 -0400] z: what the world needs is another poker site, powered by Chef 0.8.10
[2012-09-01 02:02:06 -0400] z: "The Gist you were looking for has been deleted. Sorry about that!
[2012-09-01 02:02:53 -0400] hoover_damm: z, imagine the scaling power it could have!
[2012-09-01 02:03:22 -0400] makerbreaker: it doesnt really have anything to do with poker
[2012-09-01 02:03:28 -0400] makerbreaker: it just deploys postgres databases
[2012-09-01 02:03:29 -0400] z: hoover_damm: per my earlier rant, may I now engage <troll> and suggest it'd scale better than Puppet </rant></troll>
[2012-09-01 02:03:54 -0400] makerbreaker: but i guess im a fucking moron and should shoot myself in the head right?
[2012-09-01 02:03:55 -0400] makerbreaker: k
[2012-09-01 02:04:30 -0400] z: makerbreakr: Not at all =) Learning is good, as previously stated, and IRC fails to convey British sarcasm very well.
[2012-09-01 02:05:20 -0400] hoover_damm: z, not a very good troll.
[2012-09-01 02:05:28 -0400] z: In other shocking news, I think I just agreed with hoover_damm about something. I'm pretty sure a black hole is forming *right* *NOW* and we should all run.
[2012-09-01 02:05:40 -0400] hoover_damm: z, might have done better with java or ..
[2012-09-01 02:05:43 -0400] hoover_damm: but maybe not
[2012-09-01 02:06:04 -0400] z: hoover_damm: well at least Oracle grew a pair and patched that 0-day out of cycle. they get a hall pass for that this week,
[2012-09-01 02:06:42 -0400] hoover_damm: makerbreakr, I'm sorry poking fun at random parts of your stack trace.  We would like to help you but we need more information regarding the problem
[2012-09-01 02:06:51 -0400] z: I didn't even see the stack trace. :(
[2012-09-01 02:07:06 -0400] hoover_damm: you said this was in bundle install?
[2012-09-01 02:07:51 -0400] hoover_damm: z, https://www.refheap.com/paste/30cdfecd1df056295b9ee67a2
[2012-09-01 02:09:38 -0400] z: makerbreakr: I suggest going to Ruby 1.9.3 p194 instead of an RC build, and quite probably moving to Chef 10.12 too, since it'll be easier to fix up and supportable for the future
[2012-09-01 02:10:24 -0400] z: makerbreakr: If you got that whilst doing a 'bundle install' then IMHO the first set of changes to make will likely be your Gemfile, although how to fix the Ruby intepreter up will require knowing whether its your system intepreter, or you're using rvm/rbenv/something else
[2012-09-01 02:11:26 -0400] z: I would hazard a guess that 1.9.3-rc1 w/Chef 0.8.10 and Bundler 1.1.3 is essentially a combination *nobody* has tried before
[2012-09-01 02:13:14 -0400] z: gems/railties-3.2.3 also suggests your Rails application is quite modern, which really puts the -rc build of Ruby and Chef 0.8.10 'weirdly out of whack'.
[2012-09-01 02:13:49 -0400] z: did whoever put that Gemfile together maybe typo and mean to put Chef as 0.10.8?
[2012-09-01 02:14:36 -0400] KarlHungus: probably more of a vagrant question, but if i apply a role to a vagrant vm inside the chef_solo provisioner, how do i specify which of the env_run_lists it should use?
[2012-09-01 02:14:39 -0400] z: railties-3.2.3 + 1.9.3-rc1 + bundler 1.1.3 + chef 0.10.8 => a combination which I could kinda understand
[2012-09-01 02:17:53 -0400] KarlHungus: HALP. its friday night, i want to be productive instead of tracking down answers to my questions in the source ;)
[2012-09-01 02:24:09 -0400] KarlHungus: 1.9.3-rc1 + 0.8.10 is very funny
[2012-09-01 02:24:38 -0400] KarlHungus: i would hazard a guess that configuration mgmt is the least of their concerns ;)
[2012-09-01 02:24:53 -0400] miah: uh. 0.8.x is way old...
[2012-09-01 02:25:13 -0400] KarlHungus: hello miah, how are you this evening?
[2012-09-01 02:25:19 -0400] miah: im ok i suppose
[2012-09-01 02:25:56 -0400] KarlHungus: thats good =) at least i'm not the only one hacking on a friday
[2012-09-01 02:26:04 -0400] miah: i never stop hacking
[2012-09-01 02:26:27 -0400] KarlHungus: i dont believe that for a second
[2012-09-01 02:26:49 -0400] miah: my girlfriend will confirm that the laptop rarely leaves my hands
[2012-09-01 02:27:24 -0400] KarlHungus: haha, fair enough.
[2012-09-01 02:27:50 -0400] KarlHungus: what coolness are you building? did you try my zfs freebsd box?
[2012-09-01 02:28:02 -0400] miah: no i havent tried that. i am working on nagios cookbook
[2012-09-01 02:28:40 -0400] KarlHungus: oh, i can't wait for you to share it. i've been trying to figure out how to do the lwrp's for nagios for a while now and keep pushing it to the back burner
[2012-09-01 02:29:16 -0400] miah: its public
[2012-09-01 02:29:27 -0400] miah: https://github.com/miah/nagios/tree/refactor
[2012-09-01 02:29:32 -0400] miah: there is a lwrp
[2012-09-01 02:29:56 -0400] miah: still lots of things to work out
[2012-09-01 02:31:16 -0400] KarlHungus: ahh. object seems very low level for a resource
[2012-09-01 02:31:31 -0400] miah: howso
[2012-09-01 02:32:08 -0400] miah: nagios has various object types, you can get a lot wrong. i'd like to prevent that to an extent.
[2012-09-01 02:32:31 -0400] KarlHungus: its powerful, but i'd consider reusing it inside resources for the common object types
[2012-09-01 02:32:44 -0400] miah: elaborate?
[2012-09-01 02:33:00 -0400] KarlHungus: well, a contact resource, for example
[2012-09-01 02:33:07 -0400] KarlHungus: or host, service, etc.
[2012-09-01 02:33:11 -0400] miah: ok, so a resource type for each object type
[2012-09-01 02:33:20 -0400] KarlHungus: reusing the object resource, of course
[2012-09-01 02:33:34 -0400] miah: ok i see
[2012-09-01 02:33:52 -0400] miah: ya
[2012-09-01 02:33:53 -0400] miah: i could do that
[2012-09-01 02:34:07 -0400] miah: https://github.com/miah/nagios/blob/refactor/recipes/_nagios_config.rb#L73
[2012-09-01 02:34:11 -0400] miah: is kind of how im doing things
[2012-09-01 02:34:12 -0400] KarlHungus: i tend to use inheritance heavily in nagios as well, so i'd probably build off of that to create more complex resources in a wrapper cookbook
[2012-09-01 02:34:58 -0400] miah: we'll i'd love to work with you on this. if you want to hack on this with me that'd be great.
[2012-09-01 02:34:59 -0400] KarlHungus: for example, a host resource will use multiple object inheritance and set 'use env-prod, class-server, role-app-server'
[2012-09-01 02:35:51 -0400] KarlHungus: which sets (and overrides) custom object variables inside the env/class/role templates to build up a faily DRY configuration
[2012-09-01 02:35:52 -0400] miah: ya. i have several ideas for automatically building out servicegroups / depenencies
[2012-09-01 02:36:50 -0400] KarlHungus: let me put up a gist to explain
[2012-09-01 02:36:56 -0400] miah: awesome =)
[2012-09-01 02:38:44 -0400] martinisoft: does OHAI regenerate node information on the fly or can I force it to refresh somehow?
[2012-09-01 02:42:52 -0400] hoover_damm: martinisoft, the information ohai generates is populated when you run it...
[2012-09-01 02:43:08 -0400] hoover_damm: martinisoft, you shouldn't need to refresh ohai... it should be fresh on each run
[2012-09-01 02:43:11 -0400] martinisoft: is that per chef-client run?
[2012-09-01 02:43:15 -0400] martinisoft: ah okie
[2012-09-01 02:43:23 -0400] martinisoft: Ohai is having trouble detecting my linode
[2012-09-01 02:43:23 -0400] hoover_damm: I think there wasn an issue at one point with -i and it not running ohai each time
[2012-09-01 02:43:35 -0400] martinisoft: so its causing some issues with one of the cookbooks I'm trying to load
[2012-09-01 02:43:44 -0400] hoover_damm: node['cloud']?
[2012-09-01 02:43:48 -0400] martinisoft: yeah
[2012-09-01 02:43:57 -0400] hoover_damm: that should be fixed with modern knife tools
[2012-09-01 02:44:00 -0400] martinisoft: it thinks my Linode is a Rackspace instance
[2012-09-01 02:44:02 -0400] hoover_damm: should be 'hint' files now
[2012-09-01 02:44:10 -0400] martinisoft: hint? :x
[2012-09-01 02:44:22 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah i forget off hand where they go because I rarely use knife ec2... lol
[2012-09-01 02:44:40 -0400] martinisoft: yeah, OHAI thinks this is a backspace cloud node
[2012-09-01 02:44:57 -0400] martinisoft: but its not reading the ipv4 address correctly :(
[2012-09-01 02:45:07 -0400] martinisoft: rackspace*
[2012-09-01 02:47:55 -0400] martinisoft: guess there isn't an official linode plugin for ohai
[2012-09-01 02:48:22 -0400] KarlHungus: miah: https://gist.github.com/3563022
[2012-09-01 02:49:35 -0400] KarlHungus: it allows for a very small set of service objects to be created, reducing the number of cfg files to manage enormously
[2012-09-01 02:50:31 -0400] KarlHungus: then you just set the service hostgroup to the hostgroup corresponding to a class, role, env, or (rarely) a specific host
[2012-09-01 02:51:33 -0400] KarlHungus: the naming convention i'm using is close to how it should be, but there are certainly some improvements to be made there
[2012-09-01 02:53:48 -0400] miah: ya. the way that i've written things you can do this easily
[2012-09-01 02:54:20 -0400] miah: i tend to think servicegroups are more appropriate for roles
[2012-09-01 02:54:37 -0400] miah: because roles are generally a way to define a set of services on a node
[2012-09-01 02:55:00 -0400] KarlHungus: i haven't found service groups to very useful except for organizing things on the web ui
[2012-09-01 02:56:56 -0400] KarlHungus: but you're right, and thats where my naming conventions don't align 1:1 with chef and other tools
[2012-09-01 02:57:05 -0400] hoover_damm: hostgroups feel more roles
[2012-09-01 02:57:05 -0400] miah: they are useful for servicedependencies
[2012-09-01 02:57:07 -0400] hoover_damm: to me
[2012-09-01 02:57:15 -0400] hoover_damm: but the problem is with nagios
[2012-09-01 02:57:20 -0400] hoover_damm: how you implement it becomes opinionated
[2012-09-01 02:57:25 -0400] KarlHungus: i orginally developed this before i was using a true CM tool. the configs were generated with scripts/Makefiles
[2012-09-01 02:57:49 -0400] KarlHungus: miah: yes. super useful for service deps. i forgot about that. very good point
[2012-09-01 02:57:51 -0400] miah: true
[2012-09-01 02:58:04 -0400] miah: it can be very opinionated. but that goes for most things.
[2012-09-01 02:58:24 -0400] miah: i still think we can make it pretty easy to do a bunch of cool things
[2012-09-01 02:58:42 -0400] miah: and fwiw.. my opinion is the one that should matter to you most ;)
[2012-09-01 02:59:51 -0400] KarlHungus: i'm (slowly) moving pretty much all of our checks over to graphite and dumping nagios for everything but blackbox monitoring
[2012-09-01 03:00:48 -0400] KarlHungus: it just doesnt have the ability to check frequently enough for good whitebox metrics
[2012-09-01 03:01:47 -0400] KarlHungus: i can get mostly get that with graphite, then let nagios poll graphite for moving avgs/holt-winters, etc to do the alerting
[2012-09-01 03:02:13 -0400] KarlHungus: but its a boring task. and i got pulled off to rearchitect our app tier
[2012-09-01 03:02:20 -0400] miah: also, servicegroups help out a bunch with doing cluster_check and ondemand macros
[2012-09-01 03:02:38 -0400] miah: nice
[2012-09-01 03:03:26 -0400] miah: i want to dump nagios, but my coworkers greatly fear change
[2012-09-01 03:03:52 -0400] KarlHungus: icinga should be a drop-in replacement
[2012-09-01 03:03:59 -0400] miah: icinga is sitll awful
[2012-09-01 03:04:02 -0400] KarlHungus: (or so i hear) ;)
[2012-09-01 03:04:35 -0400] miah: what i really want is sensu
[2012-09-01 03:04:38 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, seek change when your the CTO
[2012-09-01 03:04:46 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, but there's nothing wrong with slipping in sensu
[2012-09-01 03:04:52 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, and trying to ease them in
[2012-09-01 03:05:16 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, but until your the actual creator or owner of the decisions, always remember you are asking for change... not forcing it
[2012-09-01 03:05:40 -0400] hoover_damm: miah, and riemann is :) too
[2012-09-01 03:06:08 -0400] miah: i havent looked at reimann yet
[2012-09-01 03:06:26 -0400] KarlHungus: have either of you had a chance to play with the assimilation monitoring thing?
[2012-09-01 03:06:38 -0400] miah: true, im not the cto. but im a tech lead..
[2012-09-01 03:06:57 -0400] KarlHungus: the discovery stuff sounds cool, but all the (TM) all over the docs terrify me.
[2012-09-01 03:07:36 -0400] KarlHungus: What is Stealth Discovery?
[2012-09-01 03:07:39 -0400] KarlHungus: WAT
[2012-09-01 03:11:58 -0400] hoover_damm: stealth discovery is via snmp?
[2012-09-01 03:11:59 -0400] hoover_damm: or ping?
[2012-09-01 03:12:34 -0400] KarlHungus: CDP/LLDP + netstat and init.d scanning + arp tables + fs mounts
[2012-09-01 03:12:38 -0400] KarlHungus: http://linux-ha.org/source-doc/assimilation/html/index.html
[2012-09-01 03:13:30 -0400] hoover_damm: you had me at linux-ha.org
[2012-09-01 03:13:43 -0400] miah: lol
[2012-09-01 03:14:04 -0400] KarlHungus: its an interesting read. the goals that are outlined are pretty good.
[2012-09-01 03:14:30 -0400] KarlHungus: i just can't take it seriously
[2012-09-01 03:15:15 -0400] hoover_damm: I can't take anything that linux-ha.org does seriously
[2012-09-01 03:15:42 -0400] hoover_damm: I did heartbeat for quite some time, and there's nothing really wrong with it
[2012-09-01 03:15:44 -0400] KarlHungus: haha
[2012-09-01 03:15:55 -0400] KarlHungus: oh, but CARP is so much nicer than heartbeat
[2012-09-01 03:16:29 -0400] KarlHungus: CARP+pfsync and a few udev rules make for a magical setup
[2012-09-01 03:16:58 -0400] KarlHungus: maybe work will let me polish and open up my load_balancer cookbook if i pressure them enough
[2012-09-01 03:17:44 -0400] jtimberman: KarlHungus: ooh, carp
[2012-09-01 03:17:49 -0400] hoover_damm: i know
[2012-09-01 03:18:18 -0400] KarlHungus: hi, jtimberman! nathen told me you guys hired him. congrats to both of you!
[2012-09-01 03:18:27 -0400] jtimberman: yeah :)
[2012-09-01 03:18:32 -0400] z: http://www.pureftpd.org/project/ucarp
[2012-09-01 03:18:34 -0400] KarlHungus: thats a very good fit
[2012-09-01 03:18:45 -0400] jtimberman: i'm looking forward to him putting me in my place about deployment ;)
[2012-09-01 03:18:57 -0400] z: <3 ucarp
[2012-09-01 03:19:32 -0400] z: jtimberman: I look forward to you apologising via blogpost and promising to use 'cap deploy' in future.
[2012-09-01 03:19:36 -0400] KarlHungus: jtimberman: careful, or he'll do it in a podcast for the world to hear :P
[2012-09-01 03:19:52 -0400] z: KarlHungus: for now Google indexes blogposts better than podcasts :D
[2012-09-01 03:21:34 -0400] julienphalip: juliancdunn: Sorry for the late reply. I'm not using knife, only some basic bash scripts. Bizarrely, I can use 'sudo' just fine on a lucid32 box, but it won't work on a precise32 box. Obviously there must be something I'm missing :)
[2012-09-01 03:27:52 -0400] KarlHungus: z: i'll let you add ucarp support to my cookbooks when i get them out the door ;)
[2012-09-01 03:30:37 -0400] jtimberman: z: unlikely, i am convinced that deployment == server state.
[2012-09-01 03:30:56 -0400] jtimberman: KarlHungus: i think a foodfightshow episode on the topic is a great topic :)
[2012-09-01 03:31:20 -0400] jtimberman: i did a that as a talk at a python user group talk :)
[2012-09-01 03:31:33 -0400] samkottler|afk: jtimberman: still want to talk to you about that :)
[2012-09-01 03:31:45 -0400] samkottler: I don't buy it ;)
[2012-09-01 03:31:46 -0400] KarlHungus: jtimberman: i can promise you i'll listen. we are using cap too. its a very common pattern still at rails shops
[2012-09-01 03:34:06 -0400] KarlHungus: jtimberman: how do you handle orchestrating app restarts if deploying is just changing the servers state? ruby_block "block-until-out-of-load-balancer"?
[2012-09-01 03:34:20 -0400] jtimberman: samkottler: ;)
[2012-09-01 03:35:08 -0400] samkottler: jtimberman: my number one reason is that application code is not eventual in the sense that it needs to be push *then*
[2012-09-01 03:35:18 -0400] martinisoft: I'm loading this linode ohai plugin
[2012-09-01 03:35:19 -0400] martinisoft: https://gist.github.com/1338655
[2012-09-01 03:35:19 -0400] samkottler: Config management doesn't provide that tenant
[2012-09-01 03:35:25 -0400] martinisoft: and its not detecting it for some reason
[2012-09-01 03:36:26 -0400] KarlHungus: samkottler: somewhat along those lines is also the problem of enventual consistency not providing rollbacks (that i'm aware of)
[2012-09-01 03:36:48 -0400] martinisoft: does one ohai plugin override another if you load it in via the ohai cookbook?
[2012-09-01 03:37:12 -0400] samkottler: KarlHungus: yeah the whole model breaks down unless the strategy is "git pull" on a timer, and there is this little thing called cron that can do that
[2012-09-01 03:37:15 -0400] samkottler: It's also a horrid idea
[2012-09-01 03:37:29 -0400] samkottler: re: cron
[2012-09-01 03:38:16 -0400] KarlHungus: i'm not quite that opionated about it =) but i'm all ears.
[2012-09-01 03:38:32 -0400] ssd7: jtimberman: WHERE IS MY ERCHEF COOKBOOK?
[2012-09-01 03:39:03 -0400] samkottler: Everyone yell at jtimberman at once!
[2012-09-01 03:39:39 -0400] ssd7: :)
[2012-09-01 03:40:51 -0400] martinisoft: also confused a ton by the ohai cookbook, specifically the plugin path
[2012-09-01 03:41:16 -0400] martinisoft: if I go with FHS compliant, does it tell ohai automatically during the run?
[2012-09-01 03:41:31 -0400] ssd7: martinisoft: When ohai loads a plugin it searches through the plugin_path array
[2012-09-01 03:41:37 -0400] ssd7: first file it finds with the right name wins
[2012-09-01 03:41:50 -0400] martinisoft: gotcha
[2012-09-01 03:42:07 -0400] martinisoft: when loading an uploaded plugin, does it get precedence over one included with ohai
[2012-09-01 03:42:08 -0400] martinisoft: ?
[2012-09-01 03:42:29 -0400] countdigi: jtimberman: what the heck? where is that cookbook? (no idea what ssd7 is talking about ;-)
[2012-09-01 03:43:38 -0400] ssd7: Actually, jtimberman should be off enjoying his weekend :)
[2012-09-01 03:44:41 -0400] countdigi: and what r u doing here? umm... i guess i have to be here to ask that
[2012-09-01 03:45:20 -0400] martinisoft: basically trying to get this linode plugin loaded and overriding the rackspace one https://gist.github.com/1338655
[2012-09-01 03:45:43 -0400] martinisoft: because it keeps falling back to rackspace
[2012-09-01 03:47:48 -0400] martinisoft: is there a page in the wiki that explains hints and how they work?
[2012-09-01 03:49:57 -0400] martinisoft: ah http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3337 so this isnt in the current knife yet :(
[2012-09-01 03:50:56 -0400] countdigi: hmm. i was just checking up on it and it says its in ohai 6.14.0
[2012-09-01 03:50:59 -0400] countdigi: http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/05/30/ohai-6-14-0-released/
[2012-09-01 03:52:20 -0400] ssd7: You could try just disabling the rackspace plugin
[2012-09-01 03:52:28 -0400] ssd7: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Disabling+Ohai+Plugins
[2012-09-01 03:52:42 -0400] martinisoft: yeah, maybe this hints thing is where I need to go
[2012-09-01 03:52:56 -0400] martinisoft: how can I yank it from a node via knife?
[2012-09-01 03:54:47 -0400] ssd7: Ahh. Ohai hints are rather new so we don't have a lot of documentation on them.
[2012-09-01 03:54:51 -0400] ssd7: What are you trying to do?
[2012-09-01 03:56:26 -0400] juliancdunn: julienphalip: it might be because that box doesn't allow passwordless sudo for the requested user
[2012-09-01 03:57:03 -0400] martinisoft: ssd7: tell ohai my node is a linode and not a rackspace one
[2012-09-01 03:59:48 -0400] ssd7: So the minimal thing you need to do is place a file called rackspace.json at /etc/chef/ohai/hints/
[2012-09-01 03:59:51 -0400] ssd7: err
[2012-09-01 04:00:00 -0400] ssd7: well, that would be the opposite of what you want
[2012-09-01 04:00:04 -0400] martinisoft: so I've tried loading the ohai cookbook too and adding that script I mentioned before
[2012-09-01 04:00:21 -0400] martinisoft: rackspace still takes precedence
[2012-09-01 04:00:35 -0400] ssd7: martinisoft: Have you tried disabling the rackspace plugin altogether?
[2012-09-01 04:05:00 -0400] martinisoft: have not gotten there yet
[2012-09-01 04:05:12 -0400] martinisoft: so would that be an attribute override for a node?
[2012-09-01 04:06:06 -0400] ssd7: No, see the page I linked above.  There is a config option to disable certain plugins
[2012-09-01 04:06:53 -0400] martinisoft: yeah where would I define that? :)
[2012-09-01 04:07:09 -0400] martinisoft: sorry, trying to learn where a lot of this stuff goes and some of these things come with several answers
[2012-09-01 04:07:36 -0400] martinisoft: also, going to each node and manually editing the /etc/chef/client.rb sounds wrong?
[2012-09-01 04:08:24 -0400] ssd7: martinisoft: Ahh sorry. So that would go in /etc/chef/client.rb.  I wouldn't manually edit, just manage the file with a chef-client cookbook.
[2012-09-01 04:08:34 -0400] martinisoft: oooooh gotcha
[2012-09-01 04:08:39 -0400] martinisoft: yeah thats what I was getting at :)
[2012-09-01 04:08:52 -0400] martinisoft: I have that cookbook loaded, just don't know where exactly to edit it
[2012-09-01 04:09:16 -0400] countdigi: ssd7: sounds cannabalistic ;-)
[2012-09-01 04:10:00 -0400] ssd7: :)
[2012-09-01 04:10:43 -0400] countdigi: im taking a break from sa stuff and going through growing oo sw w/ tests - cool book but bringing back java nightmares :-)
[2012-09-01 04:13:25 -0400] countdigi: plan to go back to the real world soon w/ inspiration and try out test kitchen :-)
[2012-09-01 04:17:03 -0400] martinisoft: ssd7: didn't work it seems
[2012-09-01 04:18:08 -0400] martinisoft: hmm wait I probably have it setup wrong
[2012-09-01 04:19:44 -0400] martinisoft: yeap I do, don't see an option in the chef-client cookbook to disable plugins
[2012-09-01 04:22:40 -0400] martinisoft: oh....
[2012-09-01 04:23:03 -0400] martinisoft: ssd7: there is a note on that wiki page saying that option has no effect on the ohai executable
[2012-09-01 04:23:11 -0400] martinisoft: off to the right
[2012-09-01 04:23:23 -0400] ssd7: So, by that it means it won't work when you run ohai alone
[2012-09-01 04:23:32 -0400] ssd7: but it should work for during a chef run
[2012-09-01 04:23:41 -0400] martinisoft: gotcha
[2012-09-01 04:23:52 -0400] martinisoft: oh right because it runs ohai as part of it
[2012-09-01 04:24:10 -0400] martinisoft: so im back to figuring where I put that option in my chef repo to disable this for all nodes
[2012-09-01 04:24:30 -0400] ssd7: martinisoft: So, you'll need to edit that cookbook to add the feature.  I would do two things
[2012-09-01 04:24:43 -0400] ssd7: first add an attribute that will be the array of disabled plugins
[2012-09-01 04:25:07 -0400] ssd7: then edit the client.rb template to take that array and make the necessary config change
[2012-09-01 04:26:26 -0400] martinisoft: then a pull request :)
[2012-09-01 04:27:00 -0400] martinisoft: *forks*
[2012-09-01 04:28:27 -0400] ssd7: Line 46 is an edit of the template that I think will work (untested, late night code, beware): https://gist.github.com/3563826
[2012-09-01 04:36:28 -0400] martinisoft: that probably won't work
[2012-09-01 04:36:55 -0400] martinisoft: or I'd at least have to override ohai as a node attribute
[2012-09-01 04:37:35 -0400] martinisoft: https://github.com/martinisoft/chef-client/tree/disable_ohai_plugins
[2012-09-01 04:37:48 -0400] martinisoft: well more like this commit https://github.com/martinisoft/chef-client/commit/a4d23931373ccfe13127d9a008712773e8445a0e
[2012-09-01 04:43:13 -0400] martinisoft: might be waaay offbase there
[2012-09-01 04:54:41 -0400] martinisoft: ssd7: https://github.com/martinisoft/chef-client/commit/a4d23931373ccfe13127d9a008712773e8445a0e
[2012-09-01 04:54:44 -0400] martinisoft: I did it that way
[2012-09-01 04:54:48 -0400] martinisoft: but yours is probably better
[2012-09-01 05:02:22 -0400] aruntomar: hi! can anyone suggest, how to migrate clients from one opensource chef server to another? i have migrated all the nodes,data bags,roles.
[2012-09-01 05:06:16 -0400] martinisoft: ssd7: there https://github.com/martinisoft/chef-client/commit/62b718eefa8ce5a42e8c8911b6cd8415b00ee4d2
[2012-09-01 06:15:16 -0400] ssd7: martinisoft: Cool, yeah the attribute name should matter to much.  The guard against non-existent attributes/nill is a good addition.
[2012-09-01 06:15:46 -0400] ssd7: s/should/shouldn't/
[2012-09-01 06:15:52 -0400] ssd7: s/to/too/
[2012-09-01 06:15:54 -0400] ssd7: le sigh.
[2012-09-01 06:16:37 -0400] martinisoft: :)
[2012-09-01 06:16:54 -0400] martinisoft: ssd7: so how can I get that to apply?
[2012-09-01 06:17:14 -0400] martinisoft: because ive uploaded the modified cookbook and run chef-client again, nothing :(
[2012-09-01 06:27:53 -0400] ssd7: martinisoft: So it didn't update your client.rb file?
[2012-09-01 06:28:23 -0400] martinisoft: doesnt look like it :(
[2012-09-01 06:28:28 -0400] martinisoft: looked at the file, no entry
[2012-09-01 06:33:52 -0400] ssd7: martinisoft: Is the chef-client cookbook in your run list somewhere and have you uploaded that cookbook to the Chef server?
[2012-09-01 06:34:04 -0400] martinisoft: yes and yes
[2012-09-01 06:34:14 -0400] martinisoft: and now hosted chef is having connection issues :(
[2012-09-01 06:36:02 -0400] ssd7: martinisoft: Mind running chef-client -l debug -L cheflog.out and then posting cheflog.out somewhere?
[2012-09-01 06:38:23 -0400] martinisoft: don't mind, will do in a sec
[2012-09-01 06:38:31 -0400] martinisoft: I'll gist it
[2012-09-01 08:18:42 -0400] myprasanna: I'm new to chef. I have an amazon AMI, which I want chef to use as base to automate stuff. I'm using hosted chef, and don't see anything about the AMI in manage.opscode.com; Any clue?
[2012-09-01 09:38:48 -0400] aruntomar: myprasanna: install the gem "knife-ec2"
[2012-09-01 09:40:08 -0400] aruntomar: myprasanna: https://github.com/opscode/knife-ec2
[2012-09-01 10:26:02 -0400] myprasanna: @aruntomar: Thanks! So I can't do much with the hosted management console. Still everything with command line?
[2012-09-01 17:31:01 -0400] forestbird: hi, what would be a good way to update the users cookbook to the github version?
[2012-09-01 17:32:42 -0400] martinisoft: forestbird: if you use librarian, can point it to the git repo
[2012-09-01 17:33:08 -0400] martinisoft: if you don't just grab the zip at the downloads link to the right on the github page
[2012-09-01 17:38:52 -0400] forestbird: hmm, yeah, maybe i'll just grab the tar... thanks
[2012-09-01 17:39:53 -0400] martinisoft: forestbird: tars are how they ship cookbooks on the opscode site :)
[2012-09-01 17:40:26 -0400] forestbird: i know... i'm just not sure how not to break the git workflow :)
[2012-09-01 17:47:54 -0400] xmltok: is librarian a commonly used tool for managing cookbooks that depend on external repositories?
[2012-09-01 17:54:01 -0400] martinisoft: xmltok: I've used it, sorta like bundler
[2012-09-01 17:54:10 -0400] martinisoft: takes some of the guesswork out of dependencies
[2012-09-01 17:54:34 -0400] xmltok: im also looking at spork from etsy
[2012-09-01 17:55:14 -0400] xmltok: basically, need to come up with some kind of work flow for storing home made cookbooks in some git repos and also managing externally developed cookbooks
[2012-09-01 18:00:19 -0400] martinisoft: ssd7: getting that cheflog posted now btw
[2012-09-01 18:00:29 -0400] martinisoft: crashed and burned last night still hammering away
[2012-09-01 18:11:00 -0400] xmltok: are environment json files normally managed and stored in a repo? If I try to use knife to promote a cookbook in my environment, it doesnt find the environment json, which is only on the chef server. I also dont see a way of downloading those from the server, so I assume it should be a repo I clone, edit, commit, and then publish the new version to the chef server?
[2012-09-01 18:19:48 -0400] martinisoft: I usually keep local json files so I can version control them
[2012-09-01 18:22:28 -0400] yfeldblum_: IMO it depends on whether you consider environments to be data, seed data, or code
[2012-09-01 18:22:39 -0400] yfeldblum_: if data, then not in git; if seed data or code, then yes in git
[2012-09-01 19:32:54 -0400] julienphalip: juliancdunn: You must be right. I'll see if using this recipe helps: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/sudo  Thanks a lot for the tip!
[2012-09-01 19:39:29 -0400] trkemis: I am learning chef here and I have silly question about the users cookbook
[2012-09-01 19:43:46 -0400] martinisoft: anyone know if I can put a node name in a cookbook default attribute?
[2012-09-01 20:21:49 -0400] Babar: a/w 200
[2012-09-01 20:21:52 -0400] Babar: right...
[2012-09-01 21:11:45 -0400] hajile: so am i missing something here? the steps to use chef-client/solo to install chef opensource server appear to be circular..
[2012-09-01 21:12:13 -0400] hajile: like you need to have server setup to have validation.pem, which is required by client
[2012-09-01 21:12:18 -0400] hajile: haha
[2012-09-01 21:18:30 -0400] masterkorp: hajile: ?
[2012-09-01 21:18:38 -0400] masterkorp: You make no sense
[2012-09-01 21:19:49 -0400] hajile: the instructions listed in the wiki are extremely confusing to me for an installation using the bootstrap cookbook
[2012-09-01 21:19:51 -0400] yfeldblum_: hajile, chef-solo does not require a validation.pem
[2012-09-01 21:19:59 -0400] hajile: ah ok
[2012-09-01 21:20:23 -0400] yfeldblum_: hajile, chef-solo is a very simple program, whose purpose is to run recipes without any interaction with any chef-server, without needing validation keys and client keys, and so on
[2012-09-01 21:20:36 -0400] hajile: right
[2012-09-01 21:21:00 -0400] hajile: ok so, i've gotten as far as creating /etc/chef/solo.rb
[2012-09-01 21:21:03 -0400] hajile: and chef.json
[2012-09-01 21:21:23 -0400] yfeldblum_: hajile, there are many ways to install the components of chef-server (there are many components since it turns out to be a complex bit of software) ... you can do it manually, for example; you can use packages when they're brought up to date, etc
[2012-09-01 21:21:41 -0400] hajile: ahhh, it might be working!
[2012-09-01 21:22:29 -0400] hajile: i had added "init_style": "init" to the chef.json
[2012-09-01 21:22:49 -0400] hajile: and it was giving me this:
[2012-09-01 21:23:00 -0400] hajile: [Sat, 01 Sep 2012 23:02:59 +0200] FATAL: Could not parse the provided JSON file (/home/vagrant/chef.json)!: 743: unexpected token at '
[2012-09-01 21:23:25 -0400] hajile: removing the init_style is allowing it to proceed
[2012-09-01 21:26:00 -0400] hajile: looks good so far
[2012-09-01 21:26:37 -0400] hajile: sorry for the rant, the docs are just daunting
[2012-09-01 21:26:39 -0400] hajile: easy to get lost
[2012-09-01 21:30:02 -0400] hajile: do you guys know if the chef solo boostrap cookbook expects the rbel repo to be installed?
[2012-09-01 21:32:28 -0400] rarenerd: hajile: you don't need rbel, I've had succes with just the epel repo on rhel5/centos5
[2012-09-01 21:32:36 -0400] hajile: ah ok
[2012-09-01 21:33:14 -0400] rarenerd: the erlang cookbook does add the epel erlang repository if it isn't there yet
[2012-09-01 21:40:26 -0400] hoover_damm: esl should work too
[2012-09-01 21:41:00 -0400] hoover_damm: https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp
[2012-09-01 21:41:32 -0400] hoover_damm: more up to date too
[2012-09-01 21:44:24 -0400] hajile: wow.. one command later and it's up and running on my vagrant box
[2012-09-01 21:44:30 -0400] hajile: hot
[2012-09-01 22:23:04 -0400] miah: brew install erlang :P
[2012-09-01 22:27:02 -0400] z: anyone tinkered with erchef yet and able to comment on whether it has Organizations?
[2012-09-01 22:27:15 -0400] z: and indeed the more fine-grained permissions system from OHC / OPC
[2012-09-01 23:23:35 -0400] jtimberman: z: I don't believe that it does.
[2012-09-01 23:42:04 -0400] ssd7: It does not
[2012-09-01 23:42:31 -0400] ssd7: Wow. should have read timestamps. :)
