[2012-09-09 02:33:30 -0400] timsmith: yep

[2012-09-09 02:33:47 -0400] loveshell_: when i use chef,i found a problem
[2012-09-09 02:33:51 -0400] loveshell_: can you help me
[2012-09-09 02:33:58 -0400] timsmith: perhaps

[2012-09-09 02:34:34 -0400] timsmith: kindle: if you do knife search node "node:test.foo.org" do you get anything back?
[2012-09-09 02:34:49 -0400] loveshell_: yeah
[2012-09-09 02:35:14 -0400] timsmith: what version are you on?

[2012-09-09 02:37:26 -0400] timsmith: your ssh and your search are a bit different
[2012-09-09 02:38:35 -0400] loveshell_: I don't know what you mean
[2012-09-09 02:38:49 -0400] loveshell_: oi see
[2012-09-09 02:38:58 -0400] timsmith: in your knife ssh you're using "node" not "name"
[2012-09-09 02:39:02 -0400] timsmith: that breaks the search
[2012-09-09 02:39:05 -0400] loveshell_: how What should I do

[2012-09-09 02:41:35 -0400] loveshell_: thxtimsmith
[2012-09-09 02:41:39 -0400] timsmith: no problem

[2012-09-09 02:44:31 -0400] timsmith: that looks like an issue connecting to the system
[2012-09-09 02:44:40 -0400] timsmith: firewall maybe
[2012-09-09 02:44:52 -0400] timsmith: can you ssh from the system you're on without knife ssh
[2012-09-09 02:44:55 -0400] timsmith: using the same ssh key
[2012-09-09 02:45:02 -0400] timsmith: ?
[2012-09-09 02:45:16 -0400] loveshell_: iptables is off
[2012-09-09 02:45:22 -0400] loveshell_: use password
[2012-09-09 02:46:04 -0400] hoover_damm: what is knife[:ssh_attribute] set to?
[2012-09-09 02:46:20 -0400] hoover_damm: it could be trying to get the ip via ec2.public_hostname or ipaddress
[2012-09-09 02:46:26 -0400] hoover_damm: and ipaddress looks blank in that (or redacted)
[2012-09-09 02:48:35 -0400] loveshell_: client need start chef-solr?
[2012-09-09 02:52:53 -0400] loveshell_: mayby because node is empty,let me have a try
[2012-09-09 02:54:36 -0400] hoover_damm: could be
[2012-09-09 03:00:30 -0400] loveshell_: i can't solve it
[2012-09-09 03:58:02 -0400] tightwork: Anyone try to knife into rackspace openstack?  I'm assuming the knife-rackspace plugin would be dead and to use knife-openstack directly I tried this but got: compute.rb:340:in `authenticate': uninitialized constant Fog::Compute::OpenStack::ServiceUnavailable (NameError)
[2012-09-09 04:53:35 -0400] tightwork: how many beans can I put into 7 clamshells?
[2012-09-09 05:10:31 -0400] timsmith: I'm going to guess that the openstack authentication is still a bit different than rackspace auth even though they run openstack
[2012-09-09 08:56:07 -0400] sawyer_: i'm using knife-solo and i want to send parameters on a deployment - how can i do that?
[2012-09-09 08:57:37 -0400] sawyer_: i need to make configurations on a server as if it's a different server (before transitioning floating IPs around) - sending a parameter will help me solve this
[2012-09-09 12:46:24 -0400] kimmipark: hello - appreciate this might be an odd request, but is it possible to get input from the keyboard during a chef run?  I'd like to have a recipe in which the user can enter a passphrase to decrypt some data. I tried just using gets() but without success.
[2012-09-09 12:51:25 -0400] kimmipark: oh sweet - highline/import works just fine
[2012-09-09 12:55:19 -0400] tigris_: hi guys... if anyone knows much about the deploy resource, i have an issue where my rails app "#{Rails.root}/tmp" directory has about 2,500,000 files in (yes, a lot), and the deploy resource tries to chown that entire folder, twice
[2012-09-09 12:56:15 -0400] tigris_: i wonder if anyone knows a work around? ... since tmp/ is a symlink, i can't really move it out of the way while deploying, without turning the website off since it needs access to those files obviously
[2012-09-09 12:57:29 -0400] Mithrandir: 2.5M files in a single directory sounds like a bad idea in the first place
[2012-09-09 12:57:44 -0400] tigris_: not in the root of that dir, they are all spread out
[2012-09-09 12:57:51 -0400] tigris_: but the chown is recursive
[2012-09-09 13:04:40 -0400] tigris_: i guess i'll create my own Chef::Provider that inherits from Chef::Provider::Deploy and just override enforce_ownership to be a noop
[2012-09-09 16:32:43 -0400] sascha_d: Can I ask what app/engine is powering this? http://community.opscode.com/questions

[2012-09-09 20:23:49 -0400] pranny: i keep getting the following error http://dpaste.com/798654/
[2012-09-09 20:23:57 -0400] pranny: while trying to install package "git"
[2012-09-09 20:25:10 -0400] bram_: what happens when you install the git package manually?
[2012-09-09 20:25:43 -0400] pranny: bram_: i got it. I was attepmting to run chef-solo by a non sudo user
[2012-09-09 20:25:47 -0400] pranny: thanks
[2012-09-09 22:54:41 -0400] Twirrim: oh wow... chef-client errors in 10.14 are so, so much better.
[2012-09-09 22:54:48 -0400] Twirrim: Thanks for your hard work opscode :)
[2012-09-09 22:54:57 -0400] Twirrim: (and whoever else was involved)
[2012-09-09 23:44:01 -0400] z: does Chef::Log.error raise an exception, or is that only Chef::Log.fatal?
[2012-09-09 23:50:56 -0400] flaccid: give it a try in shef would be quick test i guess
[2012-09-09 23:52:16 -0400] flaccid: actually im not sure you can see teh exit in shef, might need to test in a recipe
[2012-09-09 23:58:55 -0400] z: bah was hoping someone would know off hand ;)
[2012-09-09 23:59:07 -0400] z: I'll go test and see!
