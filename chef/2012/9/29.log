[2012-09-29 00:03:04 -0400] addisonj: hrm... random craziness happening here, my collectd recipe is suddendly causing my chef-client to fail, seems like it is when it sends a sigterm to restart?
[2012-09-29 00:19:08 -0400] hopson: spox: jessicab: a fresh rvm envinronment on a linux box seems to be working, I'll have to try and find the difference later; thanks for the help
[2012-09-29 00:21:29 -0400] erikh: hmm, did anything happen with the 10.14.2 bootstrap packages recently?
[2012-09-29 00:22:41 -0400] erikh: nevermind, seems to be intermittent
[2012-09-29 00:39:13 -0400] Axsuul: Is there any way to specify a version explicitly to the chef_gem resource
[2012-09-29 01:21:28 -0400] sunil__: I am reading docs on opscode and not sure why .first is being used when accessing data bag item like a hash..
[2012-09-29 01:21:29 -0400] sunil__: charlie = search(:admins, "id:charlie").first
[2012-09-29 01:23:59 -0400] Pushnell: data bag items are accessible as hashes
[2012-09-29 01:24:28 -0400] Pushnell: oh, nvm, didn't understand your Q
[2012-09-29 01:25:29 -0400] yfeldblum: sunil__, #search returns an Array of results (when you call the method without a block, as in this example)
[2012-09-29 01:25:44 -0400] Pushnell: I haven't used search myself but I believe search returns an array of results
[2012-09-29 01:26:22 -0400] yfeldblum: sunil__, the array may be empty, have one element, or have many elements, of course, and it's up to you to know what to expect
[2012-09-29 01:27:01 -0400] yfeldblum: sunil__, in this case, you're expecting there to be only one result in the array, so you're calling #first to get that first result
[2012-09-29 01:27:16 -0400] sunil__: got it!
[2012-09-29 01:28:30 -0400] sunil__: thats what I thought but wanted to confirmI was using that document to build a recipe to look up a single data bag item..
[2012-09-29 01:32:33 -0400] sunil__: I wanted to use one record from an item as a config value in a recipe..
[2012-09-29 01:37:47 -0400] erikh: hey folks, anyone know why a start action would not start a service where 'service <name> start' does work?
[2012-09-29 01:38:03 -0400] erikh: it says it started, it just doesn't actually start.
[2012-09-29 01:38:37 -0400] erikh: 10.14.2 and I can put the init script somewhere if there's anyone interested in that.
[2012-09-29 01:46:46 -0400] Axsuul: Anyone know of a good way to run a recipe at the very end no matter where you put it in the run list
[2012-09-29 01:50:07 -0400] Pushnell: Axsuul: you could create a resource/provider pair.  If you notify the provider, the handler will run after all recipes (but not necessarily after all other providers).  not sure if that gets you where you're going.
[2012-09-29 01:50:25 -0400] Pushnell: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/ChefCN/Anatomy+of+a+Chef+Run
[2012-09-29 01:53:23 -0400] Axsuul: Pushnell: i'm creating a dotfiles cookbook, and I want that to run very very last, in case any dotfiles get created by other cookbooks
[2012-09-29 01:56:42 -0400] Pushnell: Axsuul: yeah, I don't know whether the order that handlers get run is the same that they are called.  but I'm guessing if you created a "dotfiles" provider to do all the work and made the last recipe call that provider, that handler would run last.
[2012-09-29 01:56:53 -0400] Pushnell: Axsuul: seems ugly, but I don't know a better way.  I'm still fairly noob.
[2012-09-29 02:01:39 -0400] Pushnell: is there no standard interface for log output from an attributes file?
[2012-09-29 02:07:43 -0400] Axsuul: Pushnell: hmm what do you need to do? Chef::Log.info doesn't work?
[2012-09-29 02:11:15 -0400] juliancdunn: you can't Chef::Log.info from an attributes file
[2012-09-29 02:13:07 -0400] Pushnell: juliancdunn: so I've noticed.  Is there no way to create log output?
[2012-09-29 02:13:44 -0400] juliancdunn: Pushnell: only from the recipe
[2012-09-29 02:38:42 -0400] Axsuul: Hmm i suppose i could use delayed notifications
[2012-09-29 04:02:22 -0400] nmistry: is there a way to create a chef UI user from the command line?
[2012-09-29 05:56:20 -0400] juliancdunn: nmistry: well there is "knife client create"
[2012-09-29 08:05:55 -0400] coderanger: nmistry: I don't think that is exposed in knife, but the API is there https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef-server-api/app/controllers/users.rb#L56
[2012-09-29 08:06:04 -0400] coderanger: oh hey, that was asked 4 hours ago
[2012-09-29 08:06:11 -0400] coderanger: I'm bad at timestamps
[2012-09-29 08:56:33 -0400] nmistry: no worries coderanger
[2012-09-29 08:56:56 -0400] nmistry: thanks for the info
[2012-09-29 08:57:22 -0400] coderanger: nmistry: If it isn't exposed in core knife there is almost certainly a plugin for it somewhere
[2012-09-29 10:12:12 -0400] Loof: Anyone know why chef-client might be ignoring client.rb settings and trying to connect to localhost:4000?  (this is 10.14.2 on windows)
[2012-09-29 11:18:40 -0400] gyre008: this is confusing the shit out of me.https://gist.github.com/3803722
[2012-09-29 11:19:33 -0400] gyre008: on one wiki page it says that node attributes are set with normal priority using set method.on another one it says that node attributes are automatic and can't be overriddenWTH
[2012-09-29 11:19:54 -0400] gyre008: could anyone explain me whats what ? I'm lost :)
[2012-09-29 13:20:10 -0400] PapaSierra: morning, i'm using the opscode php cookbook. i can see how to install extensions using "package" and "php_pear". i'm just wondering how to "turn on" libraries like gd, mcrypt, etc
[2012-09-29 16:13:33 -0400] bergelmir: i want to setup chef-solo and followed the instructions at http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installing+Chef+Client+on+Ubuntu+or+Debian but i can't start chef-client because of a missing validation.pem
[2012-09-29 16:16:41 -0400] gyre007: bergelmir, you shouldnt need validation.pem....chef colo runs chef on localhost...
[2012-09-29 16:17:22 -0400] gyre007: bergelmir, http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo
[2012-09-29 16:19:59 -0400] bergelmir: gyre007: yeah, but don't i need a working chef-client?
[2012-09-29 16:24:06 -0400] gyre007: bergelmir, there is no chef-client in chef-solo mate...it's just chef-solo...SOLO :)
[2012-09-29 16:25:09 -0400] bergelmir: gyre007: hmm... the wiki told me to install chef-client
[2012-09-29 16:25:58 -0400] bergelmir: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installing+Chef+Client+and+Chef+Solo > "The following are Operating System-specifc guides to installing Chef Client (or chef-solo) on a host."
[2012-09-29 16:26:26 -0400] gyre007: These directions explain installing chef-client or chef-solo
[2012-09-29 16:26:31 -0400] gyre007: OR you missed the OR word :)
[2012-09-29 16:26:39 -0400] gyre007: right at the top of the page
[2012-09-29 16:26:47 -0400] gyre007: Chef Solo is a standalone version of Chef that runs locally on your node, detached from a Chef server.
[2012-09-29 16:28:34 -0400] bergelmir: okay, but where do i find information on how to install/setup chef-solo?
[2012-09-29 16:30:07 -0400] gyre007: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo
[2012-09-29 16:30:37 -0400] gyre007: install chef gem or chef via omnibus...chef-solo comes with it...its part of the package
[2012-09-29 16:31:45 -0400] bergelmir: gyre007: okay, will try :)
[2012-09-29 16:32:07 -0400] gyre007: cool
[2012-09-29 20:28:29 -0400] killfill: hi
[2012-09-29 20:28:52 -0400] killfill: im looking at https://github.com/mdxp/nodejs-cookbook/blob/master/recipes/install_from_package.rb
[2012-09-29 20:29:37 -0400] killfill: if i wanted to use that cookbook, for installing node on freebsd, i would have to explicit add support for it, i.e. adding a new 'when' case, right?
[2012-09-29 20:31:26 -0400] workmad3: killfill: you could just let the cookbook install from source instead of from package
[2012-09-29 20:31:49 -0400] workmad3: killfill: which is the default, looking at the attributes
[2012-09-29 20:32:00 -0400] killfill: workmad3: ah ok. but i mean installing from package
[2012-09-29 20:33:23 -0400] workmad3: killfill: right, in that case then yes, you would need to add explicit support
[2012-09-29 20:34:59 -0400] killfill: ok thanks.
[2012-09-29 20:41:40 -0400] killfill: when i use "knife cookbook site download <package>" it downloads a .tar.gz in the chef-repo directory... should it uncompress it and leav it in chef-repo/cookbooks?  or that is my job to do?
[2012-09-29 20:41:45 -0400] killfill: (sorry.. im new.. :)
[2012-09-29 20:42:01 -0400] workmad3: download just downloads it
[2012-09-29 20:42:15 -0400] workmad3: if you want to set it up completely, do 'knife cookbook site install <package>'
[2012-09-29 20:44:11 -0400] killfill: aah greate.
[2012-09-29 20:44:18 -0400] killfill: it does some git stuff..
[2012-09-29 20:44:36 -0400] workmad3: yeah, it assumes your chef repo is a git repo
[2012-09-29 20:44:43 -0400] workmad3: which is generally a good assumption to make ;)
[2012-09-29 20:47:56 -0400] killfill: workmad3: i dont get something.. that nodejs recipe, uses 'yum_package', and 'apt_repository. where is that dependency declared?..
[2012-09-29 20:48:23 -0400] killfill: or its in the core of chef?
[2012-09-29 21:24:24 -0400] masterkorp: alright getting ready for the first D try
[2012-09-29 21:24:50 -0400] masterkorp: vim setup, check, ctags, check, waf, check, beer, check
[2012-09-29 22:31:40 -0400] Loof: Anyone know why chef-client on windows might be ignoring the client.rb (even when specified with -c)?
[2012-09-29 23:24:53 -0400] gdurham_: Just out of curiousity, does anyone have a good way on reporting what occurred during a chef run, i.e. this service was started/stopped this file changed and notified, etc?
[2012-09-29 23:25:02 -0400] gdurham_: in a simple format
[2012-09-29 23:43:21 -0400] dman7: Has anyone had trouble with installing from source? I manage to download the file (with remote_file resource) and then run the un-tarring, but in the middle of un-tarring I get errors "Cannot open: No such file or directory". I'm running as non-root user on Chef 10.14.4
[2012-09-29 23:43:51 -0400] dman7: It seems that the resource re-tars at least 4 times...
