[2012-09-02 02:25:50 -0400] bullardo: can someone tell me what the diff is between chef and puppet?
[2012-09-02 02:39:58 -0400] hoover_damm: bullardo, i'd suggest to clone both repos and do a diff -urN chef/ puppet/
[2012-09-02 02:40:01 -0400] hoover_damm: and determine the difference
[2012-09-02 02:40:35 -0400] hoover_damm: bullardo, http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/FAQ#FAQ-HowisChefdifferentthanPuppet%3F is a less crappy answer
[2012-09-02 05:21:02 -0400] scottwb: anyone here have any experience with constant fails on the yum lock on Amazon EC2 AMIs?
[2012-09-02 05:22:01 -0400] scottwb: One of my first recipes stops and disables yum-updatesd, but i still constantly fail installing packages on a new instance because something has the yum lock. google around with no lock. any thoughts on how to avoid this yum lock crap?
[2012-09-02 06:40:40 -0400] scottwb: anyone have any experience beating down yum on Amazon Linux AMIs? I've disabled yum-updatesd but the default security update check is killing me with the yum lock.
[2012-09-02 08:39:54 -0400] williamherry: I can use ipaddress in attributes/default.rb like this default[ip] = ipaddress, is there any other attribute that are same like ipaddress, how to find them/
[2012-09-02 08:39:56 -0400] williamherry: ?
[2012-09-02 09:07:04 -0400] pprakash: Hi, Is it possible to transfer files using knife winrm?
[2012-09-02 09:07:19 -0400] pprakash: To a remote windows machine from a Linux Chef server
[2012-09-02 09:30:16 -0400] martinisoft: williamherry: if you're talking automatic attributes, you'd want to see http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Automatic+Attributes
[2012-09-02 09:34:05 -0400] williamherry: martinisoft, thanks, that's exact what I want

[2012-09-02 13:31:27 -0400] Liku: Hi guys, does anyone know how to modify community cookbook without cloning the whole code?Otherworlds I have a community cookbook and need to make some changes there. How can I do that without creating a new cookbook based on community one?Maybe something like 'require' or 'include_receipt'
[2012-09-02 13:59:22 -0400] Murali: Hi All, how do I run a recipe on multiple nodes. Current, my chef-client exists in one of the node. Looked at the documentation and understood run-list may be an option. But not sure how to use it. any help is highly appreciated.
[2012-09-02 14:03:19 -0400] Murali: May be its too early for most of you guys. I will be back and post the same question an hour later ...
[2012-09-02 14:15:54 -0400] yfeldblum_: Murali, run chef-client on each server that needs to be configured with chef
[2012-09-02 14:17:41 -0400] Murali: yfeldblum_: okay. Is it not possible to run the client only in one node and execute the chosen recipe on all the other nodes [In other words, do we really need a chef-client be configured in each node?]
[2012-09-02 14:20:04 -0400] _rc: Murali: it's the client that execures the recipes
[2012-09-02 14:20:21 -0400] _rc: so what you're asking doesn't really make sense
[2012-09-02 14:21:32 -0400] Murali: _rc: I am sure my understanding may be wrong. Apologize if I ask silly Q's.
[2012-09-02 14:23:22 -0400] Murali: _rc: Here is my understanding from the doc - In practice, there is usually a one-to-one mapping between a node and a physical device (a computer, a switch, a router, etc.), but in special cases a system may execute the recipes for multiple nodes.
[2012-09-02 14:23:53 -0400] Murali: I am trying to understand "but in special cases a system may execute the recipes for multiple nodes"
[2012-09-02 14:24:24 -0400] _rc: what\s the documentation reference for that?
[2012-09-02 14:24:38 -0400] Murali: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Nodes
[2012-09-02 14:25:50 -0400] _rc: well I guess the special cases would be using chef to configure network devices; but it's just a special case
[2012-09-02 14:26:11 -0400] Murali: okay, got it. Thanks
[2012-09-02 14:26:26 -0400] Murali: Could you help me understand the doc in this url - http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Client
[2012-09-02 14:27:02 -0400] Murali: the statement I am looking at it is - A single Chef Client can run recipes for multiple Nodes.
[2012-09-02 14:27:28 -0400] _rc: again, ignore it
[2012-09-02 14:29:16 -0400] Murali: okay - thanks _rc. I am now clear. So, the conclusion I am making here is, a Chef-Client need to be there on each server/node where I want to have the recipe executed. Please correct me if needed.
[2012-09-02 14:31:25 -0400] _rc: I'm afraid my mind-reading skills aren't up to the task, sorry
[2012-09-02 14:33:10 -0400] Murali: Sorry to trouble you. Would you recommend me more reading of the documentation before asking questions.
[2012-09-02 14:34:37 -0400] _rc: no, ask as many questions as you need, but I can't tell what your mental medel is to know if it's correct or not, so it's a hard question to answer
[2012-09-02 14:49:39 -0400] yfeldblum_: Murali, you can have a node that you designate as a special node (chef doesn't know it's special) and which will run recipes with the purpose of configuring other devices, such as routers and switches, via their public APIs
[2012-09-02 14:55:43 -0400] Murali: yfeldblum_: Thank you for clearing that. Could you please suggest me an approach, using chef, if I would like to deploy the web application in more than one node without I executing chef client on each of the node. Is there a way if I run chef c;oent in one node it gets executed in all the nodes (thus the webapp gets deployed on all nodes)
[2012-09-02 14:56:02 -0400] yfeldblum_: Murali, no
[2012-09-02 14:57:22 -0400] yfeldblum_: Murali, you can certainly do that with other tools, but you cannot do it with chef
[2012-09-02 14:57:27 -0400] yfeldblum_: Murali, that's just not how chef works
[2012-09-02 14:58:05 -0400] Murali: okay, thanks yfeldblum_.
[2012-09-02 15:13:57 -0400] Ramana_: Hi All, I beginner to chef server, I have couple of questions
[2012-09-02 15:14:42 -0400] Ramana_: How to import a shell script in a  recipe
[2012-09-02 15:17:30 -0400] ashb: Ramana_: typically you'd convert the shell script to use Chef's resources
[2012-09-02 15:17:38 -0400] ashb: but it depends exactly what the shell script does
[2012-09-02 15:19:00 -0400] Ramana_: thanks ashb, shell script contains tomcat service start|stop|restart commands , I would like to call this script in recipe
[2012-09-02 15:19:21 -0400] ashb: Ramana_: can you paste the script?
[2012-09-02 15:20:17 -0400] Ramana_: sure, let me copy the file from other system
[2012-09-02 15:22:31 -0400] Ramana_: ashb here is the script file
[2012-09-02 15:22:33 -0400] Ramana_: #!/bin/sh # # /etc/init.d/tomcat # # This is the init script for starting up the #  Jakarta Tomcat server # # description: Starts and stops the Tomcat daemon. #  tomcat=/opt/apache-tomcat-6.0.18 startup=$tomcat/bin/startup.sh shutdown=$tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh  start() {   echo -n $"Starting Tomcat service: "   sh $startup   echo $? }  stop() {   echo -n $"Stopping Tomcat service: "   sh $shutdown   echo $? }  restart() {   stop   start 
[2012-09-02 15:23:42 -0400] ashb: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Service
[2012-09-02 15:25:21 -0400] Ramana_: Yes Iam on that link ,Could you please guide me how to import the file in chef recipe
[2012-09-02 15:33:55 -0400] z: Ramana_: I think his point was more that you *probably* look at https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/tomcat and then use the Service resource
[2012-09-02 15:34:24 -0400] z: Ramana_: as otherwise you're not really deriving a great deal of value from Chef. If all you want is shell scripts, you're wasting your time.
[2012-09-02 15:38:14 -0400] Ramana_: Thanks ashb, it helps
[2012-09-02 15:42:14 -0400] ashb: yeah what z said
[2012-09-02 16:12:38 -0400] martinisoft: ssd7: are you about?
[2012-09-02 16:47:18 -0400] hashpuppy: is a chef server really that hard to setup?  every video and tutorial suggest using the hosted version because chef server is so hard to setup.
[2012-09-02 16:48:00 -0400] hashpuppy: or is the hard part making it highly available?
[2012-09-02 16:48:14 -0400] ashb: hashpuppy: no its not hard at all
[2012-09-02 16:48:19 -0400] ashb: scaling and making it HA might be harder
[2012-09-02 16:48:24 -0400] ashb: but a simple setup is trivial
[2012-09-02 16:48:35 -0400] hashpuppy: ashb: thanks.  looks easy from the docs.
[2012-09-02 16:48:39 -0400] hashpuppy: just wanted to verify
[2012-09-02 16:48:46 -0400] Mithrandir: indeed, it's quite easy to set up, but most tutorials want to show off chef itself.
[2012-09-02 16:48:58 -0400] hashpuppy: any tutorials on how to make it highly available?
[2012-09-02 16:50:06 -0400] ashb: hashpuppy: wouldn't know as its not something I've looked for
[2012-09-02 16:52:13 -0400] hashpuppy: ok.  thanks.  also, i'm not using any cloud services.  we have like 12 physical servers.  you guys know of any virtualization tools that allow you to easily spin up a vm from the command line and configure w/ chef, similar to vagrant, but for production (e.g., no virtualbox)
[2012-09-02 16:52:22 -0400] hashpuppy: not too chef specific, but just thought i'd ask
[2012-09-02 17:07:06 -0400] Mithrandir: hashpuppy: we are happy with ganeti
[2012-09-02 17:07:37 -0400] hashpuppy: Mithrandir: thanks.  i'll check it out
[2012-09-02 17:24:07 -0400] martinisoft: ssd7: guess when you get back, wanted to let you know I figured out the issue with the client file
[2012-09-02 17:27:06 -0400] ssd7: martinisoft: Good to hear
[2012-09-02 17:28:08 -0400] martinisoft: ssd7: it helps that I include the client::config recipe in the run list
[2012-09-02 17:32:36 -0400] hashpuppy: Mithrandir: do you use ganeti for provisioning new VMs?  Or for replication of chef server for HA?
[2012-09-02 18:40:40 -0400] dcrosta: I'm having trouble loading encrypted data bag items. i have this in my recipe:
[2012-09-02 18:40:54 -0400] dcrosta: secret = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load_secret(Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem::DEFAULT_SECRET_FILE)
[2012-09-02 18:40:55 -0400] dcrosta: credentials = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("credentials", "aws", secret)
[2012-09-02 18:41:11 -0400] dcrosta: but when i access elements of credentials, they are still the encrypted versions.
[2012-09-02 18:42:22 -0400] dcrosta: hm, nope, i'm wrong. something else must be going on. apologies.
[2012-09-02 21:51:53 -0400] tarnfeld: Hey, does anyone know if you can use a node's name/ipaddress in a role option? I'd really like to do that but can't work out how? :)
[2012-09-02 21:52:12 -0400] yfeldblum_: tarnfeld, you cannot do that
[2012-09-02 21:52:27 -0400] yfeldblum_: tarnfeld, because roles are static json data, and not code
[2012-09-02 21:52:29 -0400] tarnfeld: yfeldblum_: :( Hmmm, bah, ok, any way I can automatically set an attribute to the name of the node
[2012-09-02 21:52:48 -0400] tarnfeld: yfeldblum_: Yes, they are ruby if they're ruby role files, but I assume they have to be consistent between json and ruby
[2012-09-02 21:53:01 -0400] yfeldblum_: tarnfeld, if you want to run code, you put the code in a recipe
[2012-09-02 21:53:16 -0400] yfeldblum_: tarnfeld, the ruby role dsl is just a very thin layer over json
[2012-09-02 21:53:20 -0400] tarnfeld: yfeldblum_: yes, but if the recipe requires you set a hostname, and I'd like to use the node's ipaddress
[2012-09-02 21:53:33 -0400] tarnfeld: but meh i guess I can't :(
[2012-09-02 21:53:53 -0400] yfeldblum_: tarnfeld, it's not that you can't, it's that you're thinking about the problem from the wrong angle
[2012-09-02 21:54:09 -0400] tarnfeld: yfeldblum_: So you think I should put the logic for adjusting the attribute in a recipe?
[2012-09-02 21:54:42 -0400] yfeldblum_: tarnfeld, i don't think you should be adjusting either the hostname or ipaddress attributes at all
[2012-09-02 21:55:04 -0400] tarnfeld: yfeldblum_: sorry I think you're misunderstanding, I want to use the hostname/ipaddress for the value of another attribue
[2012-09-02 21:55:10 -0400] tarnfeld: attribute* that a 3rd party recipe uses
[2012-09-02 21:55:52 -0400] yfeldblum_: tarnfeld, yes then you can set that third attribute in a recipe based on the hostname and ipaddress attributes
[2012-09-02 21:56:05 -0400] tarnfeld: ah ok, but no in the role, gotcha, thanks!! :)
[2012-09-02 21:56:24 -0400] yfeldblum_: tarnfeld, if you're computing a third attribute based purely on static data or on data that comes from ohai, you can also compute that third attribute in an attributes file
[2012-09-02 21:56:38 -0400] tarnfeld: oh?
[2012-09-02 21:57:54 -0400] tarnfeld: oh I see, in the attributes file of a recipe I make?
[2012-09-02 21:58:00 -0400] tarnfeld: not recipe sorry, cookbook*
[2012-09-02 22:03:45 -0400] yfeldblum_: tarnfeld, cookbooks have attributes files and recipe files, in addition to the other types of files that they hae
[2012-09-02 22:03:58 -0400] tarnfeld: yfeldblum_: yeah, i just wasn't sure what you were referring to.
[2012-09-02 22:04:04 -0400] tarnfeld: nvm, I got it anyway :) thanks
[2012-09-02 22:04:06 -0400] yfeldblum_: tarnfeld, but yes that's the idea
[2012-09-02 22:11:20 -0400] PRK_nz: Hi, I've found that the IIS cookbook on community.opscode.com is different than the one on github.com/opscode-cookbooks/iis/, even though they claim to be the same version. Who do I notify?
[2012-09-02 22:19:44 -0400] ssd7: PRK_nz: How different?  Typically we bump the version number in git right before the release
[2012-09-02 22:20:02 -0400] ssd7: so what is in github typically has new code that isn't released yet
[2012-09-02 22:20:36 -0400] PRK_nz: ssd7: there's a typo that stops it from working properly
[2012-09-02 22:20:38 -0400] PRK_nz: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/iis/commit/0baa467699b52f6b5a8f1e37e1e4b4f5316c2c70
[2012-09-02 22:21:41 -0400] PRK_nz: Problem is I'm using librarian-chef, so it's not very convenient to change the source for the cookbook for a one off
[2012-09-02 22:27:10 -0400] flaccid: PRK_nz: works quite well for me
[2012-09-02 22:27:15 -0400] ssd7: PRK_nz: It does look like that one is probably due for a release soon.  I'll make a note to mention it at the next code review.
[2012-09-02 22:27:58 -0400] PRK_nz: flaccid: Changing the source?
[2012-09-02 22:28:09 -0400] flaccid: PRK_nz: i use librarian to depict my sources; https://github.com/rightscale-blueprints/linux_server
[2012-09-02 22:30:39 -0400] PRK_nz: flaccid: yea, I'm just trying to get away from having to manage little tid bits like this. I'm the only Chef guy at my work, just trying to get the project moving along
[2012-09-02 22:32:29 -0400] PRK_nz: ssd7: thanks for that :)
[2012-09-02 22:42:08 -0400] hashpuppy: does anyone in here happen to use chef and ganeti?  just curious how you setup high availability of your chef server.  can it be done w/ just ganeti and it's replication via DRBD?
[2012-09-02 23:20:21 -0400] flaccid: PRK_nz: thats why doing this blueprint concept saved my life, it manages that crap
[2012-09-02 23:44:44 -0400] flaccid: i am wondering what people are using tool/cookbook wise these days with chef for cloud back/backup restore including ebs/block device? seems there is a few different paths - aws,fog,boto cookboks, deltacloud ..
