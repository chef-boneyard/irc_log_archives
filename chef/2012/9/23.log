[2012-09-23 00:33:56 -0400] Axsuul: Any way to explicitly set a default provider for a light-weight resource?
[2012-09-23 00:49:52 -0400] Axsuul: screw it
[2012-09-23 05:36:17 -0400] Kouno: hi!
[2012-09-23 05:37:17 -0400] Axsuul: hihi
[2012-09-23 05:37:41 -0400] Kouno: I want to have a command executed as a user in chef, and I read the doc on the execute block on chef documentation page But it doesn't work. I still use root environment. :(
[2012-09-23 05:38:10 -0400] Kouno: Is there a way to work around it, or am I doing something wrong ?
[2012-09-23 05:39:26 -0400] Kouno: I just want to run `bundle install` as vagrant :/
[2012-09-23 05:44:13 -0400] Axsuul: Kouno: what's your code
[2012-09-23 05:50:57 -0400] Kouno: Axsuul: Just a second, I'm getting the error message too.
[2012-09-23 05:52:34 -0400] Kouno: Axsuul:  https://gist.github.com/3769022
[2012-09-23 05:54:02 -0400] Kouno: I nailed it down to a problem with environment variables. (USER is still root and PATH didn't change)
[2012-09-23 05:55:14 -0400] Kouno: I tried using su - vagrant -c 'bundle install' instead but it didn't fix my problem
[2012-09-23 06:45:04 -0400] zts: Kouno: you may want to try using a script resource (instead of execute) http://baldowl.github.com/2010/11/08/using-chef-and-bundler-together.html
[2012-09-23 06:45:30 -0400] Kouno: still doesn't work
[2012-09-23 06:45:31 -0400] Kouno: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2288?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#issue-tabs
[2012-09-23 06:45:38 -0400] Kouno: I think this is the issue here
[2012-09-23 06:47:30 -0400] zts: sounds like it
[2012-09-23 06:50:42 -0400] Kouno: damn finally made it work
[2012-09-23 06:51:00 -0400] Kouno: even cwd didn't work in the end
[2012-09-23 13:35:28 -0400] countdigi: one thing i dislike about chef's name... not great for google searches - although i found a new ramsey gordon episode
[2012-09-23 14:54:57 -0400] hashpuppy: any of you use berkshelf?  reading this article and the author mentions it.
[2012-09-23 14:55:06 -0400] hashpuppy: was just wondering if it was something most people use
[2012-09-23 14:57:12 -0400] cheeseplus: it's either berkshelf or librarian if you need something like that
[2012-09-23 14:57:47 -0400] cheeseplus: I don't use either personally
[2012-09-23 14:59:29 -0400] hashpuppy: thanks
[2012-09-23 15:31:57 -0400] alephant: stupid question
[2012-09-23 15:32:16 -0400] alephant: Node "foo" has  a role that adds my "base" recipe
[2012-09-23 15:32:28 -0400] alephant: My base recipe sets some attributes for the postfix recipe
[2012-09-23 15:32:41 -0400] alephant: I want to override one of those attributes just for node foo
[2012-09-23 15:33:16 -0400] alephant: I edited the node's attribute in my hosted chef panel, but the postfix config file option didn't change to reflect the change in attribute
[2012-09-23 15:33:38 -0400] alephant: I created a different role and set that attribute inside, and added the "overriding" role to the node, but that also didn't cause the config file to change
[2012-09-23 15:33:56 -0400] alephant: what am I missing?  What's the best way to override a role's attributes on a single (or possibly multiple) nodes?
[2012-09-23 15:35:17 -0400] cheeseplus: alephant: are you setting the attributes in override_attributes on the node?
[2012-09-23 15:35:28 -0400] alephant: 'nope
[2012-09-23 15:35:31 -0400] alephant: just found that in the docs :-)
[2012-09-23 15:35:39 -0400] alephant: I set override_attributes in the secondary role
[2012-09-23 15:35:43 -0400] alephant: but that didn't' have effect
[2012-09-23 15:35:46 -0400] alephant: trying now on the node itself
[2012-09-23 15:37:23 -0400] cheeseplus: override attributes in a role should take precedence over default or normal attributes set in another role
[2012-09-23 15:37:34 -0400] alephant: that's what I expected
[2012-09-23 15:37:49 -0400] alephant: I have hosts onsite that get relayhost=foo, and offsite that get relayhost=bar
[2012-09-23 15:38:03 -0400] alephant: I assume that all hosts get role default, and offsite hosts get additional role bar
[2012-09-23 15:38:30 -0400] alephant: and that override_attributes in role "offsite" would override the default relayhost
[2012-09-23 15:38:42 -0400] alephant: but it doesn't' seem to work like that lemme re-run, possible cache?
[2012-09-23 15:39:03 -0400] alephant: nope
[2012-09-23 15:39:09 -0400] cheeseplus: chef-client will reset all the attrs except normal ones every run
[2012-09-23 15:39:17 -0400] cheeseplus: so caching should not be an issue
[2012-09-23 15:39:36 -0400] alephant: role syntax: override_attributes("postfix"=>{"relayhost"=>"relayhost.example"})
[2012-09-23 15:40:26 -0400] alephant: !
[2012-09-23 15:40:44 -0400] alephant: ``knife edit node node name'' doesn't show the role I tried to add in the web ui
[2012-09-23 15:41:00 -0400] alephant: prejudice_against_gui++
[2012-09-23 15:41:27 -0400] alephant: yay, it worked!
[2012-09-23 15:41:32 -0400] alephant: cheeseplus: thanks!
[2012-09-23 15:41:51 -0400] yfeldblum: alephant, you can set default-level and override-level attributes on roles, and you can set normal-level attributes on nodes, but that's it
[2012-09-23 15:42:15 -0400] cheeseplus: alephant: sure thing, I was about to ask you to gist that up ;)
[2012-09-23 15:42:35 -0400] alephant: yfeldblum: i think I understood that from the docs, and it felt more-correct to set the overriding attrs in a role anyway
[2012-09-23 15:44:26 -0400] hashpuppy: lusis: you there?
[2012-09-23 18:26:11 -0400] hashpuppy: when i run chef-client, does it re-run everything in my run list or only stuff that's been changed?
[2012-09-23 18:26:56 -0400] hashpuppy: i'm guessing it has no way of knowing what has changed
[2012-09-23 18:27:13 -0400] josephholsten: hashpuppy: that's a subtle question
[2012-09-23 18:27:14 -0400] josephholsten: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Anatomy+of+a+Chef+Run
[2012-09-23 18:27:29 -0400] hashpuppy: josephholsten: thanks
[2012-09-23 18:28:15 -0400] yfeldblum: hashpuppy, it reruns everything, for a certain definition of "rerun"
[2012-09-23 18:28:19 -0400] josephholsten: then there is why run mode, which exists only to see which resources would be updated
[2012-09-23 18:30:56 -0400] jmartin: yfeldblum: you always seem to be in the know, does much development occur with chef-webserver-ui or is it more of an afterthought since the main workflow is to use command line tools/client check-ins etc?
[2012-09-23 18:36:41 -0400] yfeldblum: jmartin, in my case, i don't really use the chef-server-webui
[2012-09-23 18:38:42 -0400] hashpuppy: any ideas how to resolve this?  pastie.org/private/ssufezresbaaneg49qpzw
[2012-09-23 18:38:51 -0400] hashpuppy: http://pastie.org/private/ssufezresbaaneg49qpzw
[2012-09-23 18:38:59 -0400] hashpuppy: i hate how firefox thinks the protocol is unimportant now
[2012-09-23 18:39:22 -0400] yfeldblum: jmartin, i don't know what most people use, but i can say that i don't think using the chef-server-webui as a critical part of your workflow is a good idea
[2012-09-23 18:39:41 -0400] yfeldblum: jmartin, chef is too low-level for that to work out well
[2012-09-23 18:39:42 -0400] hashpuppy: scheme
[2012-09-23 18:40:34 -0400] jmartin: yfeldblum: i would certainly agree, but for ease of visibility of things like a node not checking in or whatever, it may be useful
[2012-09-23 18:40:41 -0400] yfeldblum: jmartin, i mean maybe a little bit for browsing around, viewing the status page, etc., but not for most critical work, and not for most updates
[2012-09-23 18:40:53 -0400] yfeldblum: jmartin, `knife status`
[2012-09-23 18:41:02 -0400] hashpuppy: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1416
[2012-09-23 18:43:22 -0400] yfeldblum: hashpuppy, not sure ... what triggered it?
[2012-09-23 18:43:40 -0400] hashpuppy: just installing the rabbitmq opscode cookbook
[2012-09-23 18:43:49 -0400] hashpuppy: on precise64
[2012-09-23 18:45:44 -0400] hashpuppy: i'm actually just trying to install some chef-logstash cookbook
[2012-09-23 18:47:20 -0400] hashpuppy: and have a recipe that includes include_recipe "rabbitmq".  so i downloaded the rabbitmq chef cookbook from github
[2012-09-23 18:47:29 -0400] hashpuppy: apt is called first in the run list
[2012-09-23 18:48:42 -0400] hashpuppy: all i did was download this:  https://github.com/bryanwb/chef-logstash .  install the cookbooks via berkshelf into my chef-repos.  opened up the Vagrant file.  replaced lucid64 with precise64.  vagrant up.  got the error
[2012-09-23 18:50:47 -0400] hashpuppy: so basically, i'm experiencing the same thing as rafael:  http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1416
[2012-09-23 18:50:54 -0400] jmartin: hrm for some reason im unable to locate the milestones/roadmap for chef/erchef, anyone know where they might be located?
[2012-09-23 19:01:44 -0400] jtimberman: jmartin: we generally use the "version" feature of Jira to collect that kind of thing, rather than having a specific page. especially as features aren't set in stone.
[2012-09-23 19:03:48 -0400] jmartin: jtimberman: right, thats probably the page im looking for, it just had general outlines
[2012-09-23 19:30:58 -0400] hashpuppy: jtimberman: you know what this means:  http://pastie.org/private/p4oswpz545rgurcduitchq
[2012-09-23 19:31:04 -0400] hashpuppy: bento related
[2012-09-23 19:31:26 -0400] hashpuppy: maybe it wasn't powered off fast enough.  i'll try again
[2012-09-23 19:31:31 -0400] hashpuppy: same thing
[2012-09-23 19:33:38 -0400] jtimberman: hashpuppy: not sure offhand.
[2012-09-23 19:35:19 -0400] jmartin: jtimberman: i assume its probably not a good idea to install chef-server 10.x on a server that is currently a chef 9.x client?
[2012-09-23 19:36:55 -0400] jtimberman: i believe chef 9 clients can talk to a chef 10 server
[2012-09-23 19:37:05 -0400] jtimberman: but chef 10 clients can't talk to a chef 9 server, iirc.
[2012-09-23 19:37:28 -0400] jmartin: right, well im considering installing 10 server on a box that is a chef9 client
[2012-09-23 19:37:43 -0400] jtimberman: well, you can install the chef 10 client gem :)
[2012-09-23 19:37:51 -0400] jmartin: gotcha
[2012-09-23 19:38:27 -0400] jmartin: also, am i crazy or did you mention a chef-server omnibus in the future of some kind?
[2012-09-23 19:38:41 -0400] jtimberman: soon.
[2012-09-23 19:38:46 -0400] yfeldblum: jtimberman, that is correct
[2012-09-23 19:38:49 -0400] jtimberman: we have a preview of that for chef 11.
[2012-09-23 19:39:04 -0400] jtimberman: you could use the build tools to make one for yourself too.
[2012-09-23 19:39:23 -0400] jtimberman: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef
[2012-09-23 19:41:25 -0400] jmartin: jtimberman: ah indeed, i am quite interested in erchef, but i think time constraints are going to force me into 10.x. hopefully the transition is somewhat smooth when 11 becomes stable
[2012-09-23 19:48:09 -0400] hashpuppy: jtimberman: that error was caused by Virtual Box putting the VM in an aborted state on halt
[2012-09-23 19:48:50 -0400] hashpuppy: after a few more manual attempts to shut it down, it finally went to Power Off
[2012-09-23 19:58:24 -0400] gyre008: guys I want to use knife for two Chef servers we haveobviously2 servers = 2 different clients => 2 different private keys...
[2012-09-23 19:58:25 -0400] yfeldblum: hashpuppy, in such cases you can possibly use the vbox cli directly to poweroff the vm
[2012-09-23 19:59:09 -0400] yfeldblum: hashpuppy, http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch08.html#vboxmanage-controlvm
[2012-09-23 19:59:23 -0400] hashpuppy: thanks
[2012-09-23 19:59:25 -0400] yfeldblum: hashpuppy, VBoxManage controlvm <vm-name-or-id> poweroff
[2012-09-23 19:59:36 -0400] gyre008: I thought Id set some alias commands in bash profile but that seems to have been impossible to do as -c switch is not passed at the beginning of the knife command but after the subcommands i.e. knife subcomm -c path_to_knife_rb
[2012-09-23 19:59:54 -0400] gyre008: is there any way how to achieve something like this without hacking too much in bash :)
[2012-09-23 20:00:09 -0400] gyre008: or what do you do in this kind of situation ?
[2012-09-23 20:03:02 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre007, just use the normal knife.rb?
[2012-09-23 20:03:27 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre007, i.e. keep one in the chef-repo?
[2012-09-23 20:04:55 -0400] gyre008: yfeldblum, we have a weird setupone chef repomultiple branches.two chef servers :)
[2012-09-23 20:05:06 -0400] gyre008: so Id like to have one .chef in my home dir
[2012-09-23 20:05:14 -0400] gyre008: by default I have it set to staging env...
[2012-09-23 20:05:43 -0400] gyre008: but id like to have knifeprod and knifestag alias command which would be referring to prod/dev config/keys
[2012-09-23 20:06:07 -0400] gyre008: likeid like to run knifeprod node list
[2012-09-23 20:06:45 -0400] gyre008: or knifestag node list.and knifestag would automatically load the staging chef knife conf/client private key
[2012-09-23 20:06:59 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre007, i've set up the knife.rb in my chef-repo to watch out for the envvar KNIFE_ENV and to set up the individual config items based on KNIFE_ENV
[2012-09-23 20:07:03 -0400] gyre008: I'm hacking on shell functions nowbut surely there must be better way :)
[2012-09-23 20:07:32 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre007, so if i run `KNIFE_ENV=staging knife status` that runs against the staging chef-server, or against the staging org in hosted-chef
[2012-09-23 20:07:54 -0400] gyre008: yfeldblum, but that would mean setting the env var every time you want to switch between environments...
[2012-09-23 20:08:01 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre007, if i want to work against one chef-server for a while, i just need to start off the shell session with `export KNIFE_ENV=staging`
[2012-09-23 20:08:05 -0400] hashpuppy: is there a way to just run the minitests again?  using chef-solo and vagrant
[2012-09-23 20:08:09 -0400] hashpuppy: something failed and i didn't see what
[2012-09-23 20:08:29 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre007, and if i want to work with two chef-servers at once, i can just have two shell sessions at once, one for each
[2012-09-23 20:09:19 -0400] gyre008: yfeldblum, i see
[2012-09-23 20:09:30 -0400] gyre008: not a bad idea
[2012-09-23 20:10:47 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre007, so that's the basic level; at a more advanced level, you can have a knife.rb checked into your chef-repo which sets up the basic configs and then listens for the env var and just loads another "sub" knife.rb based on the env var, and these "sub" knife.rb's don't have to be checked in
[2012-09-23 20:12:23 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre007, so the top-level chef-repo/.chef/knife.rb sets the cookbook_path and others, then, if ENV['KNIFE_ENV'] is 'staging', will call `from_file(File.expand_path("../environments/staging/knife.rb", __FILE__))`
[2012-09-23 20:13:30 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre007, and the staging knife.rb goes into .chef/environments/staging/knife.rb, but is not added to version control ... the key is to keep this file real simple so that it can easily be reproduced if necessary (you can also back it up)
[2012-09-23 20:16:55 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre007, `from_file` is a magical helper method that ships with chef that will load up a "helper" knife.rb file if you just give the path to that helper file
[2012-09-23 20:17:35 -0400] gyre008: uh need to think about this stuff
[2012-09-23 20:17:38 -0400] gyre008: but thanks yfeldblum
[2012-09-23 20:17:52 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre007, no probs
[2012-09-23 20:18:57 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre007, i'd suggest trying it out and seeing what it's like to use it - you don't have to stick with it if it's too difficult or cumbersome, but it's a technique that may help you solve your problem
[2012-09-23 20:21:30 -0400] gyre008: yfeldblum, if you set the path to cookbooks in the main knife.rb i.e. in .chef/knife.rb then you don't have to set the path to cookbooks in the "help"knives right
[2012-09-23 20:21:44 -0400] cap10morgan: is it a bug or a feature that the directory resource rejects 4775 as an invalid mode?
[2012-09-23 20:22:57 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre007, no you don't, since the "helper" knife.rb file just needs to set the config items that are specific to that knife-env (e.g. specific to staging)
[2012-09-23 20:23:06 -0400] cap10morgan: er, 6775 (setgid)
[2012-09-23 20:23:15 -0400] gyre008: yfeldblum, coolwill try it out :)
[2012-09-23 20:27:25 -0400] hoover_damm: uh/w11
[2012-09-23 20:27:39 -0400] hashpuppy: i get an error in the elasticsearch minitest:  service("elasticsearch").must_be_running.  ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
[2012-09-23 20:27:47 -0400] cap10morgan: ah HA! It has to start w/ 0 b/c it's octal. I are learning.
[2012-09-23 20:28:02 -0400] hoover_damm: woops lol
[2012-09-23 20:29:04 -0400] yfeldblum: cap10morgan, indeed
[2012-09-23 20:29:15 -0400] yfeldblum: cap10morgan, or make it a string: "4775" (with the quotes)
[2012-09-23 20:29:48 -0400] cap10morgan: yfeldblum: oh, heh. I did both. I.e. "06775". I should probably just do the string thing.
[2012-09-23 20:32:03 -0400] hashpuppy: any ideas?
[2012-09-23 20:46:51 -0400] gyre008: yfeldblum, starting to play with this but I'm getting errors arrghmust be missing something
[2012-09-23 20:47:16 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, what errors are these?
[2012-09-23 20:47:30 -0400] gyre008: that the directory doesn't exist.but i think i know why
[2012-09-23 20:47:32 -0400] gyre008: second...
[2012-09-23 20:48:25 -0400] gyre008: Errno::ENOTDIR: Not a directory
[2012-09-23 20:48:27 -0400] gyre008: :)
[2012-09-23 20:48:31 -0400] gyre008: but IT IS a directory
[2012-09-23 20:48:33 -0400] gyre008: arrrgh :)
[2012-09-23 20:49:34 -0400] gyre008: huh something is weird in that from_file code :)
[2012-09-23 20:49:46 -0400] gyre008: it's thinking that knife.rb is supposed t be a directory
[2012-09-23 20:52:54 -0400] gyre008: lolERROR: You have an error in your config file ..SystemStackError: stack level too deep
[2012-09-23 20:52:56 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre007, what's the line of code look like?
[2012-09-23 20:53:08 -0400] gyre008: might need to read up on from-file function...
[2012-09-23 20:53:46 -0400] gyre008: actually maybe even expand path
[2012-09-23 20:54:05 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, you need to get a full path to pass to from_file
[2012-09-23 20:54:59 -0400] gyre008: yfeldblum, i did something like this https://gist.github.com/3773017
[2012-09-23 20:55:01 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, you can get a full path from any path Y relative to file X with File.expand_path(Y, X)
[2012-09-23 20:55:31 -0400] gyre008: which should do production/knife.rb or staging/knife.rb
[2012-09-23 20:55:45 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, you don't need to do: "#{ENV['KNIFE_ENV']}"
[2012-09-23 20:56:08 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, you can just do this instead: ENV['KNIFE_ENV]
[2012-09-23 20:56:14 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, without interpolation
[2012-09-23 20:56:22 -0400] gyre008: i see
[2012-09-23 20:56:58 -0400] hashpuppy: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1661
[2012-09-23 20:57:05 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, you have the arguments to File.from_file backwards
[2012-09-23 20:57:06 -0400] gyre008: but thats not the problem anyway :)
[2012-09-23 20:57:28 -0400] gyre008: if I swap them ilike you suggested its trying to find knife.rb/production
[2012-09-23 20:57:29 -0400] gyre008: uhh
[2012-09-23 20:58:09 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, if the staging knife helper is in ".chef/environments/staging/knife.rb" then you want File.expand_path("../environments/staging/knife.rb", __FILE__)
[2012-09-23 20:58:29 -0400] gyre008: yfeldblum, its in .chef/staging/knife.rb
[2012-09-23 20:58:35 -0400] gyre008: why do I have to put .. there
[2012-09-23 20:58:50 -0400] gyre008: staging directory is in .chef just like the main knife.rb file
[2012-09-23 20:59:07 -0400] gyre008: but let me see
[2012-09-23 20:59:23 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, just gotta read the docs on File.expand_path i guess :P
[2012-09-23 21:00:19 -0400] gyre008: yfeldblum, wowthat worked!
[2012-09-23 21:00:25 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, ^-^
[2012-09-23 21:00:36 -0400] gyre008: yfeldblum, brilliantcheers
[2012-09-23 21:00:42 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, no probs
[2012-09-23 21:00:52 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, also you don't need to limit yourself to staging and production
[2012-09-23 21:01:12 -0400] gyre008: yfeldblum, well so far we only have these to ENVs...
[2012-09-23 21:02:02 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, all you gotta do is, instead of hardcoding the list of envs, just use string interpolation to get the path to the env-specific helper
[2012-09-23 21:02:26 -0400] gyre008: yfeldblum, wowthat sounds pretty cool actually...
[2012-09-23 21:02:48 -0400] yfeldblum: so you can use "../environments/#{ENV["KNIFE_ENV"]}/knife.rb" (plus some handling for the case where the env var isn't passed in, etc)
[2012-09-23 21:04:10 -0400] gyre008: yup
[2012-09-23 21:05:03 -0400] Axsuul: How are you guys passing a rails environment into chef?
[2012-09-23 21:05:59 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, with a set of env vars, including RACK_ENV, set per-application, possibly in a data-bag
[2012-09-23 21:06:22 -0400] Axsuul: yfeldblum: how do you pass in env vars, is that node.run_state?
[2012-09-23 21:06:37 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, no, why would it be that?
[2012-09-23 21:06:53 -0400] Axsuul: yfeldblum: I saw it being used in this opscode cookbook: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application/blob/master/recipes/rails.rb#L26
[2012-09-23 21:07:03 -0400] Axsuul: but I can't find any docuemntation on it
[2012-09-23 21:07:07 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, cool ... i don't use that cookbook though
[2012-09-23 21:07:34 -0400] Axsuul: yfeldblum: ya I'm not gonna use that either. How would you pass in env vars?
[2012-09-23 21:08:44 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, so one way is: have a script that starts by setting env vars and finishes off with exec'ing the app process
[2012-09-23 21:09:15 -0400] Axsuul: yfeldblum: gotcha, so a simple execute resource
[2012-09-23 21:09:25 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, no
[2012-09-23 21:09:50 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, i mean: an actual script file that you drop on the filesystem, give it the execute bit, etc
[2012-09-23 21:10:31 -0400] Axsuul: yfeldblum: gotcha, and probably put that in a /tmp directory? So in the script will be a bunch of "export" ?
[2012-09-23 21:10:32 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, and then you might have some process manager (runit, init, upstart, god, monit, bluepill, etc) run that script to start the app
[2012-09-23 21:10:48 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, no the script will be permanent
[2012-09-23 21:11:13 -0400] Axsuul: yfeldblum: ahi see waht you're saying
[2012-09-23 21:11:17 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, like you drop the script off at: /srv/apps/app-name/start
[2012-09-23 21:11:45 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, and then if you want to run the app non-daemonized you just type into the ssh session: /srv/apps/app-name/start
[2012-09-23 21:12:05 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, and if you want to daemonize it, you make a runit service which just runs that script, and then you start the runit service
[2012-09-23 21:12:16 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, or substitute runit with your favorite process manager
[2012-09-23 21:12:34 -0400] Axsuul: yfeldblum: also, it's not just exclusive to my app, the env also needs to be passed into stuff like sidekiq
[2012-09-23 21:12:51 -0400] Axsuul: yfeldblum: so I was thinking... /srv/apps/app-name/env && /srv/apps/app-name/current/bin/sidekiq  ?
[2012-09-23 21:13:05 -0400] Axsuul: where env will pass in the env variables?
[2012-09-23 21:13:11 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, it's more complicated now of course :P
[2012-09-23 21:14:06 -0400] Axsuul: yfeldblum: I suppose I could create startup scripts for each
[2012-09-23 21:14:18 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, but you can write a start script that sets the env vars and then execs whatever args you passed into it
[2012-09-23 21:14:44 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, so you would run it like this: /srv/apps/app-name/start script/rails console
[2012-09-23 21:14:47 -0400] Axsuul: yfeldblum: ah i see
[2012-09-23 21:15:14 -0400] ranjibd_: Axsuul, i am using an attribute
[2012-09-23 21:15:18 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, this start script should probably also cd and switch users or whatever you need to do
[2012-09-23 21:16:15 -0400] Axsuul: ranjibd_: so you're referencing that attribute from within a monit config template for example?
[2012-09-23 21:16:23 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, and if you're using RVM to pick the right ruby, you can even use that start script to run the rvm commands
[2012-09-23 21:17:15 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, this start script is, in general, responsible for setting up the whole environment and then execing the real app process, whatever "the whole environment" means
[2012-09-23 21:17:53 -0400] ranjibd_: yeah
[2012-09-23 21:19:02 -0400] Axsuul: yfeldblum: cool thanks
[2012-09-23 21:19:03 -0400] ranjibd_: Axsuul, the attributes are a first class chef dsl elements.. you can override them  at role, per environments..
[2012-09-23 21:21:46 -0400] Axsuul: ranjibd_: are you using the node.chef_environment attribute at all?
[2012-09-23 21:22:08 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, the start-script method is especially useful when you have a policy that all aspects of app config are required to be done via env vars that the app reads, and that whatever runs the app (the start script) is responsible for setting so that the app can read them
[2012-09-23 21:23:12 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, a la http://www.12factor.net/config
[2012-09-23 21:25:29 -0400] Axsuul: yfeldblum: awsome, thanks
[2012-09-23 21:25:51 -0400] ranjibd_: yeah.. but they are cross project entity ..we have tomcat , rails, etc..so for the app what may be prod, for chef, it might be preprod. at least you can configure it such way
[2012-09-23 21:27:09 -0400] ranjibd_: Axsuul, RAILS_ENV is a sub part of node.chef_environment , e.g. production -- zone-a-prod
[2012-09-23 21:41:36 -0400] Axsuul: ranjibd_: gotcha, thanks
[2012-09-23 22:04:20 -0400] gyre008: is there any easy way how to download all cookbooks from the Chef server ?
[2012-09-23 22:07:24 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, why do you want to download them?
[2012-09-23 22:07:51 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, chef-server is where you put them so that the chef-clients can use them, but it should probably not be where you manage them from
[2012-09-23 22:08:02 -0400] gyre008: yfeldblum, don't even askneed to investigate some inconsistencies between our repo and whats actually on the server...
[2012-09-23 22:08:12 -0400] gyre008: some of our guys have been messing things up...arrgh
[2012-09-23 22:08:37 -0400] gyre008: yfeldblum, i need to download them and run some diffs.messy..trust me
[2012-09-23 22:08:40 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, `knife cookbook` should list the subcommands
[2012-09-23 22:08:51 -0400] gyre008: yeah I could do it in for loop
[2012-09-23 22:08:58 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, and the knife-essentials plugin may be able to help you diff them
[2012-09-23 22:09:19 -0400] gyre008: just thought there would be handier way to do thingslikeknife upload -a uploads all cookbooks
[2012-09-23 22:09:56 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, well, since no-one in his right mind would need such a thing, i can't see why anybody in his right mind would go and build such a thing :D
[2012-09-23 22:10:13 -0400] gyre008: :) wellthings happenlike this
[2012-09-23 22:10:31 -0400] gyre008: i never thought some morons would be uploading cookbooks without committing changes into repos...
[2012-09-23 22:10:34 -0400] gyre008: as I saidmessy
[2012-09-23 22:10:39 -0400] gyre008: but it can happen
[2012-09-23 22:11:53 -0400] hoover_damm: very easy
[2012-09-23 22:12:03 -0400] hoover_damm: that's why knife-essentials becomes a part of your life
[2012-09-23 22:12:06 -0400] hoover_damm: and knife-spork
[2012-09-23 22:13:27 -0400] gyre008: hoover_damm, yeahjust installing the gemlet's see what it can do :)
[2012-09-23 22:17:31 -0400] gyre008: wowlooks impressive...
[2012-09-23 22:17:39 -0400] gyre008: onlynoe thing i noticed
[2012-09-23 22:18:18 -0400] gyre008: when i do knife list cookbooks doesn't print cookbook versions.but thats just a minor thing
[2012-09-23 22:29:22 -0400] gyre008: ok so my excitement was a bit premature
[2012-09-23 22:30:16 -0400] gyre008: i tried downloading all cookbooks by running knife download cookbooks/* but nothinghappened
[2012-09-23 22:36:56 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, what about using knife-essentials to diff on-the-fly?
[2012-09-23 22:37:11 -0400] gyre008: yeah thats what I ended up doing
[2012-09-23 22:37:24 -0400] gyre008: there seems to be a bug though...
[2012-09-23 22:37:39 -0400] gyre008: when I run knife list cookbooks it works fine and prints all cookbooks
[2012-09-23 22:38:33 -0400] gyre008: then I ran knife download cookbooks/* nothing happenedand subsequent knife list cookbooks didn't print ANYTHING :) scared the shit out of me as I thought I deleted those cookbooks from the serverbut no.theres gotta be some bug in knife-essentials plugin
[2012-09-23 22:39:57 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, what about https://github.com/jkeiser/knife-essentials#knife-diff
[2012-09-23 22:40:39 -0400] gyre008: diff works ok
[2012-09-23 22:40:58 -0400] yfeldblum: gyre008, well then
[2012-09-23 22:41:16 -0400] gyre008: I saidthats what I ended up doing
[2012-09-23 23:12:26 -0400] hoover_damm: knife spork check is good too
[2012-09-23 23:12:39 -0400] hoover_damm: it's another blanket check to make sure someone's not about to shoot you in the face
[2012-09-23 23:13:02 -0400] hoover_damm: I actually prefer using spork just because then I know it notifies for me so I don't always have to do the deed.
[2012-09-23 23:22:55 -0400] hashpuppy: i'm using vagrant and chef-solo.  how do i test out the changes to cookbook1::recipe1?  w/ chef client i'd just upload and run chef-client.  same thing?
[2012-09-23 23:23:02 -0400] hashpuppy: just not sure what the commands are
[2012-09-23 23:23:14 -0400] hashpuppy: this recipe is not currently in the run list
[2012-09-23 23:23:20 -0400] hashpuppy: of the vagrant vm that is up
[2012-09-23 23:26:52 -0400] hashpuppy: the cookbook path is on my workstation
[2012-09-23 23:30:48 -0400] flaccid: hashpuppy: #vagrant. its all in the vagrant docs though, vagrant reload
[2012-09-23 23:31:15 -0400] hashpuppy: ahh ok.  thanks.  didn't realize this was vagrant specific.  makes sense
[2012-09-23 23:38:39 -0400] flaccid: without it, per the wiki, to run chef-solo, its just chef-solo command
