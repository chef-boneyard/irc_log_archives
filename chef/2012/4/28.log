[2012-04-28 00:50:47 -0400] yfeldblum: know what we need? an Aptfile/Aptfile.lock & a couple other config files for constructing VMs with every package & every dependency locked and the locked version in source control
[2012-04-28 01:12:42 -0400] miah: that could be tricky
[2012-04-28 01:17:22 -0400] coderanger: Why do all load balancers suck?
[2012-04-28 01:17:46 -0400] flaccid: haproxy is good, so is hardware
[2012-04-28 01:17:55 -0400] coderanger: haproxy doesn't do SSL
[2012-04-28 01:18:02 -0400] coderanger: nginx doesn't do health checks
[2012-04-28 01:18:04 -0400] flaccid: its not mean to
[2012-04-28 01:18:06 -0400] coderanger: hardware is $$$
[2012-04-28 01:18:16 -0400] coderanger: Sure, but it is more than a minor operational problem
[2012-04-28 01:18:26 -0400] flaccid: tcp mode haproxy, terminate ssl on servers in the pool or just put a web server in front of haproxy, done
[2012-04-28 01:18:30 -0400] coderanger: And "build a patched stunnel" is a terrible solution
[2012-04-28 01:18:47 -0400] flaccid: we've been doing apache/haproxy with ssl for years at rightscale..
[2012-04-28 01:18:58 -0400] flaccid: certainly hasn't been an operational problem but a success
[2012-04-28 01:19:15 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, that seems the be the only option, why is there not a single solution to this already?
[2012-04-28 01:19:41 -0400] coderanger: Every link in the chain means more latency
[2012-04-28 01:19:56 -0400] flaccid: personally i'd do nginx + haproxy
[2012-04-28 01:20:15 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, that seems like the best option
[2012-04-28 01:20:17 -0400] flaccid: and there is heaps solutions, e.g. http://www.rightscale.com/library/server_templates/Load-Balancer/34868
[2012-04-28 01:20:30 -0400] flaccid: runs on 7 clouds
[2012-04-28 01:20:31 -0400] coderanger: Hah, touche
[2012-04-28 01:21:03 -0400] miah: coderanger: stud + haproxy
[2012-04-28 01:21:11 -0400] miah: i have cookbooks for both :P
[2012-04-28 01:21:28 -0400] coderanger: miah: stud > nginx?
[2012-04-28 01:21:37 -0400] miah: stud _only_ does ssl termination
[2012-04-28 01:21:48 -0400] miah: https://github.com/bumptech/stud
[2012-04-28 01:22:21 -0400] coderanger: Ahh, it links to the haproxy client IP dealy
[2012-04-28 01:22:24 -0400] coderanger: didn't know that :)
[2012-04-28 01:22:41 -0400] flaccid: so anyways, there is lots of options as you can see that work and don't cost a lot of money
[2012-04-28 01:22:51 -0400] miah: coderanger: yup
[2012-04-28 01:22:59 -0400] coderanger: flaccid: Still doesn't seem as simple as it could be :-)
[2012-04-28 01:23:02 -0400] miah: it uses haproxy 1.5's PROXY protocol
[2012-04-28 01:23:09 -0400] coderanger: but stud+haproxy looks tempting
[2012-04-28 01:25:25 -0400] flaccid: coderanger: well our template makes it simple. also all the premium cookbooks are going public very soon so you won't have to pay us to get it ..
[2012-04-28 01:25:58 -0400] flaccid: though haproxy in tcp mode is easy and fast with only a few caveats
[2012-04-28 01:26:10 -0400] coderanger: flaccid: I'm not on a public cloud, so your stuff is less likely to work :-)
[2012-04-28 01:26:15 -0400] flaccid: nginx+haproxy is the same, but can terminate on the frontend
[2012-04-28 01:26:20 -0400] miah: premium cookbooks?
[2012-04-28 01:26:32 -0400] coderanger: flaccid: and haproxy in passthrough doesn't help if the backend is gunicorn or unicorn
[2012-04-28 01:26:34 -0400] flaccid: coderanger: what env ?
[2012-04-28 01:26:38 -0400] coderanger: (or any other app server)
[2012-04-28 01:26:44 -0400] flaccid: miah: yeah they are currently private but going public soon
[2012-04-28 01:26:49 -0400] coderanger: flaccid: OSL's ganeti system)
[2012-04-28 01:26:52 -0400] miah: coderanger: put varnish infront of unicorn?
[2012-04-28 01:27:06 -0400] flaccid: i don't really know about unicorn
[2012-04-28 01:27:08 -0400] miah: flaccid: cool.
[2012-04-28 01:27:23 -0400] coderanger: miah: the details of the worker isn't important, just that most app servers like that don't do SSL
[2012-04-28 01:27:30 -0400] miah: yup
[2012-04-28 01:27:38 -0400] flaccid: so nginx+haproxy, done
[2012-04-28 01:27:51 -0400] flaccid: i'm sure someone like you coderanger wouldn't find that hard to devop
[2012-04-28 01:27:57 -0400] miah: ya
[2012-04-28 01:28:06 -0400] miah: i already have haproxy + stud
[2012-04-28 01:28:52 -0400] coderanger: flaccid: Yes, it is doable
[2012-04-28 01:28:59 -0400] flaccid: its better than paying $100K a year for riverbed zeus
[2012-04-28 01:29:11 -0400] coderanger: My comments were aimed at pointing out this level of "tie shit together" shouldn't be needed
[2012-04-28 01:29:42 -0400] coderanger: basically all the simple HA LBs are hosted solutions in one form or another
[2012-04-28 01:29:56 -0400] flaccid: yeah i agree there, but change their requires contrib back to those open source projects to provide the missing features
[2012-04-28 01:30:07 -0400] coderanger: One day :)
[2012-04-28 01:30:11 -0400] flaccid: well haproxy is just an open source project, its not hosted heh
[2012-04-28 01:30:24 -0400] miah: elb == hosted haproxy
[2012-04-28 01:30:34 -0400] coderanger: And, as noted, haproxy isn't a solution on its own
[2012-04-28 01:30:36 -0400] hoover_damn: elb = routing protocol
[2012-04-28 01:30:37 -0400] miah: its too bad elb is broken as shit
[2012-04-28 01:30:39 -0400] hoover_damn: sorry
[2012-04-28 01:30:44 -0400] hoover_damn: you can't call elb haproxy
[2012-04-28 01:30:49 -0400] hoover_damn: you can call it a routing protocol
[2012-04-28 01:31:00 -0400] hoover_damn: and yes that's technically correct
[2012-04-28 01:31:03 -0400] hoover_damn: ELB is just a routing protocol
[2012-04-28 01:33:21 -0400] flaccid: haproxy is a solution on its own if you terminate the ssl on the lb pool tier, but like you noted you can't do that, so unfortunately its either pay up or do some dev!
[2012-04-28 01:56:14 -0400] hoover_damn: haproxy doesn't grok ssl so the only way you can use haproxy with ssl is to treat it like a tcp connection
[2012-04-28 01:56:46 -0400] hoover_damn: does not add x-forwarded-for, does not decrypt, converts the remote address to the local haproxy instance's ip
[2012-04-28 01:56:51 -0400] hoover_damn: does not collect 200$
[2012-04-28 01:57:50 -0400] flaccid: well you don't need x-forwarded-for with tcp mode because its terminated on the backend servers so they get the client IP already. the backend servers does the termination and decrpt, so its a non issue
[2012-04-28 01:58:22 -0400] flaccid: otherwise like we talked about you just put a http server in front of haproxy, simple
[2012-04-28 02:06:06 -0400] hoover_damn: actually it is an issue for rails
[2012-04-28 02:06:37 -0400] hoover_damn: if rails gets the request from localhost while the ruby on rails app is running in production mode, it will produce 'stack traces' and act like development mode
[2012-04-28 02:06:48 -0400] hoover_damn: so haproxy + ssl and your local instance is also running passenger
[2012-04-28 02:07:01 -0400] hoover_damn: that's a rails issue though
[2012-04-28 02:07:03 -0400] flaccid: request from localhost?
[2012-04-28 02:07:06 -0400] hoover_damn: yep
[2012-04-28 02:07:18 -0400] flaccid: i don't see how that happens
[2012-04-28 02:07:19 -0400] hoover_damn: imagine haproxy -> nginx -> passenger
[2012-04-28 02:07:26 -0400] flaccid: wrong way around
[2012-04-28 02:07:31 -0400] flaccid: nginx -> haproxy -> lb pool
[2012-04-28 02:07:34 -0400] hoover_damn: haproxy takes it on 443, wraps it into nginx... then into passenger
[2012-04-28 02:07:42 -0400] flaccid: haproxy can't terminate ssl hoover_damn
[2012-04-28 02:07:48 -0400] hoover_damn: yes it can
[2012-04-28 02:07:52 -0400] hoover_damn: it cannot decrypt ssl
[2012-04-28 02:08:00 -0400] hoover_damn: but you can absolutely put haproxy in the front
[2012-04-28 02:08:02 -0400] flaccid: termination requires decryption
[2012-04-28 02:08:15 -0400] flaccid: haproxy can pass it through in tcp mode, that is not termination.
[2012-04-28 02:08:21 -0400] hoover_damn: anywho, the nginx -> haproxy -> lb pool is LOL
[2012-04-28 02:08:33 -0400] hoover_damn: I hope there's only 1 haproxy as nginx sucks for round robining
[2012-04-28 02:08:37 -0400] flaccid: thats actually what we run on rightscale
[2012-04-28 02:08:37 -0400] hoover_damn: that's all
[2012-04-28 02:08:50 -0400] flaccid: otherwise people use apache -> haproxy -> lb pool
[2012-04-28 02:08:53 -0400] hoover_damn: I don't suggest that method I described
[2012-04-28 02:09:01 -0400] flaccid: i don't see how its funny. people have used it for mass scaling
[2012-04-28 02:09:04 -0400] hoover_damn: but also I have a client who's dumped nginx for just haproxy
[2012-04-28 02:09:16 -0400] flaccid: which was also one of my suggestions
[2012-04-28 02:09:18 -0400] hoover_damn: basically having haproxy in front of nginx has it's benefits
[2012-04-28 02:09:33 -0400] hoover_damn: there's a valid reason to have haproxy in tcp mode for ssl
[2012-04-28 02:09:35 -0400] flaccid: yep thats pretty much my.rightscale.com runs
[2012-04-28 02:09:38 -0400] hoover_damn: and have it just pass the buck to nginx
[2012-04-28 02:10:06 -0400] flaccid: and for our templates, switching to tcp mode is as simple as flicking the switch with an input
[2012-04-28 02:37:33 -0400] coderanger: miah: Where is your stud cookbook?
[2012-04-28 02:41:49 -0400] hoover_damn: lol stud sucks
[2012-04-28 02:41:51 -0400] hoover_damn: please don't use it
[2012-04-28 02:42:08 -0400] hoover_damn: it actually has memory allocation issues and unless they have addressed it which i doubt
[2012-04-28 02:42:13 -0400] hoover_damn: you are going to only hurt yourself
[2012-04-28 02:42:35 -0400] hoover_damn: it's okay to realize that crucially is right, apache is awesome for ssl termination and stunnel/stud is stupid
[2012-04-28 02:42:44 -0400] hoover_damn: nginx is okay if you don't mind doing event programming
[2012-04-28 02:42:46 -0400] coderanger: hoover_damn: Seems about as bad as shoving nginx or apach in front of haproxy
[2012-04-28 02:42:54 -0400] hoover_damn: nah
[2012-04-28 02:42:55 -0400] hoover_damn: nginx is better
[2012-04-28 02:43:08 -0400] coderanger: Thats what I have now, never hurts to compare :)
[2012-04-28 02:43:10 -0400] hoover_damn: coderanger, I actually tried out stud when I worked at Engine Yard as I wanted to solve this issue
[2012-04-28 02:43:29 -0400] hoover_damn: coderanger, I noticed it take up more memory and the connecions get slower and slower over time
[2012-04-28 02:43:45 -0400] hoover_damn: restarting it fixed it, but that's a crappy spot to be in
[2012-04-28 02:43:59 -0400] hoover_damn: now are you doing sessions in nginx?
[2012-04-28 02:44:11 -0400] coderanger: No, I don't need any sticky routing
[2012-04-28 02:44:34 -0400] hoover_damn: http://hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/2011/06/28/ssl-session-caching-in-nginx.html
[2012-04-28 02:44:47 -0400] hoover_damn: heh you end up storing the sessions in memcached
[2012-04-28 02:44:48 -0400] hoover_damn: lol
[2012-04-28 02:45:02 -0400] coderanger: Ahh, that kind of session :-)
[2012-04-28 02:45:07 -0400] hoover_damn: no
[2012-04-28 02:45:09 -0400] hoover_damn: same session
[2012-04-28 02:45:10 -0400] hoover_damn: just ssl
[2012-04-28 02:46:12 -0400] hoover_damn: people do it in apache too
[2012-04-28 02:46:27 -0400] coderanger: I don't think I am going to hit the kind of scale for any of this to matter
[2012-04-28 02:46:33 -0400] coderanger: This is for stuff like python.org
[2012-04-28 02:46:59 -0400] hoover_damn: thinking like that will only lead you to emergency scaling later on down the road
[2012-04-28 02:47:22 -0400] coderanger: Emergency scaling == calling crucially or marcos :)
[2012-04-28 02:48:05 -0400] hoover_damn: nah emergency scaling is when you grab your legs and put them behind your head and go oh crap... oh crap... oh crap
[2012-04-28 02:48:11 -0400] hoover_damn: while your website is flinging poo
[2012-04-28 02:49:01 -0400] hoover_damn: unless you become a manager.. then you can just yell at someone else to fix it
[2012-04-28 02:51:42 -0400] coderanger: hoover_damn: I think you have forgotten what small scale means ;-)
[2012-04-28 02:52:15 -0400] hoover_damn: coderanger, nope i've just seen too many people not thinking
[2012-04-28 02:52:18 -0400] hoover_damn: and being lazy
[2012-04-28 02:52:45 -0400] hoover_damn: coderanger, a little polish and pondering now can save your butt some burning later on down the line
[2012-04-28 02:52:56 -0400] hoover_damn: but thatis what your doing here actually I guess
[2012-04-28 02:52:56 -0400] hoover_damn: :D
[2012-04-28 02:53:04 -0400] hoover_damn: asking and pondering
[2012-04-28 02:53:17 -0400] coderanger: Yes, but a simpler infra helps a lot more when you have an all-volunteer ops "team"
[2012-04-28 02:53:55 -0400] hoover_damn: totally, I was just gonna say just do nginx
[2012-04-28 02:54:05 -0400] hoover_damn: depending on your gear hopefully it's enough
[2012-04-28 02:55:27 -0400] hoover_damn: and if not... it gives crucially the chance to heckle you for not using apache
[2012-04-28 02:57:45 -0400] coderanger: Or I can just use Fastly for SSL termination and not worry about sniffer attacks on public networks
[2012-04-28 02:57:47 -0400] coderanger: :)
[2012-04-28 02:57:53 -0400] coderanger: But one step at a time
[2012-04-28 02:58:25 -0400] hoover_damn: ooh
[2012-04-28 02:58:28 -0400] hoover_damn: that's using your brain :)
[2012-04-28 02:58:46 -0400] hoover_damn: I need to resign up for fastly
[2012-04-28 02:59:02 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, now imagine trying to explain that to a mailing list full of neckbeards that haven't worked in ops in 20 years
[2012-04-28 02:59:08 -0400] hoover_damn: my account was a beta account registered ahem on an old employers email address
[2012-04-28 02:59:24 -0400] hoover_damn: haven't gotten around to it
[2012-04-28 02:59:32 -0400] coderanger: "What do you mean it isn't encrypted? THE SKY IS FALLING"
[2012-04-28 02:59:56 -0400] otterley: what's so hard about doing your own SSL?
[2012-04-28 02:59:59 -0400] hoover_damn: encryptioin isn't that big of a deal to me
[2012-04-28 03:00:08 -0400] hoover_damn: it's just obscuficating plaintext
[2012-04-28 03:00:26 -0400] coderanger: encryption is important for the first hop generally, public WiFi, office networks, etc
[2012-04-28 03:00:28 -0400] hoover_damn: gosh if i could only spell suddenly
[2012-04-28 03:00:35 -0400] hoover_damn: yep
[2012-04-28 03:00:42 -0400] hoover_damn: we're talking lame firesheep
[2012-04-28 03:00:57 -0400] coderanger: If someone is going to sniff traffic on the real internet, there are better targets than wiki.python.org passwords
[2012-04-28 03:01:01 -0400] hoover_damn: amazing how simple network bridges could help
[2012-04-28 03:01:10 -0400] coderanger: otterley: Scaling SSL negotiation is terrible
[2012-04-28 03:01:25 -0400] otterley: coderanger, you mean like session key reuse?
[2012-04-28 03:01:28 -0400] coderanger: The protocol was never designed with stuff like load balancers in mind
[2012-04-28 03:01:37 -0400] otterley: that's why you invest in non-retarded LBs
[2012-04-28 03:01:55 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, see also: all-volunteer effort meaning no budget
[2012-04-28 03:02:18 -0400] otterley: that usually implies not enough traffic to matter
[2012-04-28 03:02:19 -0400] coderanger: If you would like to donate a hardware load balancer to the Python Software Foundation, I'll be glad to use it ;-)
[2012-04-28 03:02:41 -0400] coderanger: FOSS projects are in an odd position of both being important, medium-traffic, and having no money
[2012-04-28 03:02:51 -0400] hoover_damn: yup
[2012-04-28 03:03:12 -0400] hoover_damn: coderanger, you caould always just do haproxy in tcp mode to connect to nginx to do the termination
[2012-04-28 03:03:15 -0400] otterley: maybe you can get a BIG-IP on the cheap
[2012-04-28 03:03:18 -0400] hoover_damn: coderanger, without any session handling
[2012-04-28 03:03:27 -0400] otterley: you can often find stuff like that for a song on eBay
[2012-04-28 03:03:28 -0400] coderanger: hoover_damn: You lose the upstream IP :-/
[2012-04-28 03:03:33 -0400] hoover_damn: you want the ip
[2012-04-28 03:03:39 -0400] hoover_damn: okay, then :-P back to original
[2012-04-28 03:03:44 -0400] coderanger: Yeppers
[2012-04-28 03:04:02 -0400] hoover_damn: otterley, I don't think coderanger was wanting to invest that much
[2012-04-28 03:04:04 -0400] coderanger: What I have works [nginx->]haproxy->gunicorn
[2012-04-28 03:04:07 -0400] hoover_damn: we invest a lot in FOSS projects
[2012-04-28 03:04:19 -0400] hoover_damn: but to drop some $$ for a project personally is a bit ..
[2012-04-28 03:04:28 -0400] coderanger: Just was going to bench stud for the hell of it is miah had a nice cookbook
[2012-04-28 03:04:29 -0400] hoover_damn: you really have to love the project
[2012-04-28 03:04:30 -0400] hoover_damn: all i can say
[2012-04-28 03:04:59 -0400] otterley: you can get the IP with haproxy per the transparent mode, if yor kernel has the tproxy patch
[2012-04-28 03:05:02 -0400] coderanger: hoover_damn: I don't want to think about how many thousands I've spent on PSF-related stuff over the years
[2012-04-28 03:05:14 -0400] otterley: err, tproxy module
[2012-04-28 03:05:40 -0400] hoover_damn: coderanger, I don't mind
[2012-04-28 03:05:52 -0400] hoover_damn: it's why I offered up some monitors earlier
[2012-04-28 03:05:58 -0400] hoover_damn: there's always a need
[2012-04-28 03:07:38 -0400] otterley: see: usesrc clientip
[2012-04-28 03:07:48 -0400] hoover_damn: tproxy is insane
[2012-04-28 03:08:00 -0400] coderanger: otterley: That somewhat goes against the 'simple' :)
[2012-04-28 03:08:14 -0400] otterley: NO YOU CAN'T HAVE A PONY
[2012-04-28 03:08:18 -0400] otterley: :)
[2012-04-28 03:08:20 -0400] hoover_damn: because that means all the backend servers have to have the main haproxy server
[2012-04-28 03:08:24 -0400] hoover_damn: as a router
[2012-04-28 03:09:04 -0400] hoover_damn: if your hosting this on ec2... that makes it fun LOL
[2012-04-28 03:10:38 -0400] otterley: speaking of EC2, I wish they'd update their documentation
[2012-04-28 03:11:15 -0400] otterley: "yes, your ephemeral storage is automatically mounted!"  "no, your ephemeral storage is not automatically mounted, use the API, bitch!"
[2012-04-28 03:12:14 -0400] otterley: "oh and we're not going to tell you how to use the API to set it up either"
[2012-04-28 03:29:06 -0400] Bullardo: anyone going to chefcon?
[2012-04-28 03:29:48 -0400] Bullardo: got my boss to throw down for the first day course
[2012-04-28 03:33:50 -0400] flaccid: how can i fix [Sat, 28 Apr 2012 13:34:20 +1000] DEBUG: Platform archlinux not found, using all defaults. (Unsupported platform?)
[2012-04-28 03:35:47 -0400] coderanger: Bullardo: I'll be there :)
[2012-04-28 03:36:37 -0400] flaccid: let me just double check this code for paste
[2012-04-28 03:37:32 -0400] flaccid: yeah i don't know why chef don't like my arch :(
[2012-04-28 03:38:14 -0400] flaccid: code: package value_for_platform([ "centos", "redhat", "suse", "fedora" ] => {"default" => [ "libxml2", "libxml2-devel libxslt-devel"]}, [ "ubuntu", "debian" ] => {"default" => [ "libxml2", "libxml2-dev", "libxslt-dev"]}, "archlinux" => {"default" => [ "libxml2", "libxslt"]})
[2012-04-28 03:38:33 -0400] flaccid: fail on arch in, tested via shef: http://dpaste.org/PnIry/
[2012-04-28 03:41:04 -0400] flaccid: might just test it on a debian or ubuntu first
[2012-04-28 03:43:38 -0400] flaccid: works there, of course i can't give an array for package, so i'll fix that but the platform issue doesn't exist
[2012-04-28 03:43:57 -0400] flaccid: the weird thing is that node['platform'] does come up as 'archlinux'
[2012-04-28 04:47:41 -0400] hoover_damn: ahh nginx
[2012-04-28 04:47:47 -0400] hoover_damn: lol

[2012-04-28 06:05:33 -0400] echiu: hello
[2012-04-28 10:21:39 -0400] BryanWB_: ohai chefs!
[2012-04-28 10:28:07 -0400] specialsauce: ohai!
[2012-04-28 13:03:35 -0400] KarlFreeman: hey, think I might have a stupid question around Hosted Chef but can't find an answer anywhere
[2012-04-28 13:03:58 -0400] KarlFreeman: I've cloned chef-repo and started working with knife and generally getting places
[2012-04-28 13:04:17 -0400] KarlFreeman: However, how do I keep my chef-repo sync'd with hosted chef?
[2012-04-28 13:04:41 -0400] KarlFreeman: or vice-versa
[2012-04-28 13:07:16 -0400] cwj: KarlFreeman: maybe spiceweasel can help there https://github.com/mattray/spiceweasel
[2012-04-28 13:07:37 -0400] cwj: it will generate the commands that should be run to upload a repo to your chef server
[2012-04-28 13:08:52 -0400] cwj: not sure about going the opposite direction though.. you can download cookbooks, data bags, roles, etc via knife
[2012-04-28 13:10:39 -0400] KarlFreeman: thanks cwj. Just trying to figure out the best flow.
[2012-04-28 13:11:12 -0400] KarlFreeman: This looks promising. Essentially I'm trying to not make myself dependant on hosted chef ( just in case it 'disappears' )
[2012-04-28 13:11:39 -0400] BryanWB_: KarlFreeman, some people use guard
[2012-04-28 13:11:50 -0400] BryanWB_: KarlFreeman, i think there is a knife plugin somewhere
[2012-04-28 13:12:13 -0400] cwj: this? https://github.com/guard/guard-chef
[2012-04-28 13:12:26 -0400] BryanWB_: cwj, if it's by nistude
[2012-04-28 13:12:45 -0400] KarlFreeman: BryanWB_ & cwj, got guard-knife downloaded. Looked at guard-chef but it looked a little outdated
[2012-04-28 13:13:07 -0400] BryanWB_: KarlFreeman, https://github.com/nistude/guard-knife
[2012-04-28 13:13:13 -0400] BryanWB_: nistude rocks
[2012-04-28 13:13:47 -0400] BryanWB_: sometimes i get pissed at chef and ruby, and then i think about how life was before i started using them
[2012-04-28 13:13:59 -0400] KarlFreeman: yeah, seen a few bits of his work. Decided that guard-knife looked alot more promising
[2012-04-28 13:14:02 -0400] BryanWB_: s/life/shitty life was/
[2012-04-28 13:14:20 -0400] KarlFreeman: :)
[2012-04-28 13:15:29 -0400] KarlFreeman: So i'm right in thinking that even though you can 'create' in hosted chef. You shouldn't? Keep everything version-controlled?
[2012-04-28 13:15:38 -0400] cwj: the other day i had lunch with some former coworkers who i got started with chef. sounds like they still arent using it to its full potential but i think its the only way they've managed to deploy and maintain as many site installations as they have in the past year
[2012-04-28 13:16:03 -0400] cwj: KarlFreeman: yes the ideal is for everything to be in version control
[2012-04-28 13:16:04 -0400] BryanWB_: KarlFreeman, i never use create
[2012-04-28 13:16:17 -0400] KarlFreeman: cwj, thanks
[2012-04-28 13:16:23 -0400] KarlFreeman: BryanWB_, thanks
[2012-04-28 13:17:20 -0400] KarlFreeman: Then essentially spiceweasel / chef-knife are just two diffrent ways of syncing up the chef server from your chef-repo
[2012-04-28 13:18:10 -0400] KarlFreeman: Think I've got it
[2012-04-28 13:18:20 -0400] BryanWB_: cwj, u b at chefconf?
[2012-04-28 13:18:33 -0400] KarlFreeman: Thanks for the help.
[2012-04-28 13:18:36 -0400] cwj: BryanWB_: yes, with bells on
[2012-04-28 13:18:43 -0400] BryanWB_: cwj, awesome!
[2012-04-28 13:19:58 -0400] cwj: well the bells might get old pretty fast, we'll see
[2012-04-28 13:20:02 -0400] cwj: :)
[2012-04-28 14:51:35 -0400] specialsauce: Chefs, I have a large PHP config file that has a few hundred lines and is used in common across quite a number of hosts in different roles etc. There is a couple of extra lines I would like to append to the template for a couple of hosts only. I can't see any simple template append type resource so how has everyone else handled this? Seems wasteful and cause of drift to make a second copy of the template file in its entirety
[2012-04-28 15:35:37 -0400] yfeldblum: specialsauce, <% if @is_special_host %><%= @special_line_1 %><%= @special_line_2 %><% end %>
[2012-04-28 15:52:01 -0400] benner: specialsauce: or you can use include/require in php file and do templates for thease aditional files per host or keep it blank for thease who does not need special case
[2012-04-28 16:32:44 -0400] BryanWB_: how cna i tell if chef is running as solo or as chef-client?
[2012-04-28 16:39:55 -0400] specialsauce: "if Chef::Config[:solo]"
[2012-04-28 16:40:00 -0400] specialsauce: in a recipe
[2012-04-28 16:41:28 -0400] specialsauce: thanks yfeldblum, benner. this is in an ini, which doesn't support includes i believe. i've gone for whole-line attrs for now setting them in env attrs to blank on some and populated on others. bit messy so i might rework
[2012-04-28 16:41:53 -0400] specialsauce: sorry and ping BryanWB for answer to the solo query above ^
[2012-04-28 16:42:49 -0400] yfeldblum: morning, BryanWB_
[2012-04-28 16:44:44 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, morning homez, i m sure it is a beautiful day in b'more, perfect here in rome
[2012-04-28 16:44:50 -0400] BryanWB_: specialsauce, tks!
[2012-04-28 16:46:52 -0400] yfeldblum: `if Chef::Config.solo` may also work
[2012-04-28 16:47:33 -0400] yfeldblum: https://github.com/opscode/mixlib-config/blob/master/lib/mixlib/config.rb#L168
[2012-04-28 17:03:27 -0400] miah: moin
[2012-04-28 17:03:56 -0400] BryanWB_: miah, monin
[2012-04-28 17:14:47 -0400] miah: hullo
[2012-04-28 17:15:14 -0400] miah: hows your saturday?
[2012-04-28 17:23:26 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, i looked at the toft repo on github and there wasn't any mention of a Toftfile ... so what is that?
[2012-04-28 17:23:44 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, just a script to start a node
[2012-04-28 17:23:58 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, there isn't a command-line utility yet
[2012-04-28 17:24:19 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, do you have e.g. a github repo?
[2012-04-28 17:24:19 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, i "invented it" ;)
[2012-04-28 17:25:01 -0400] BryanWB_: the api for using toft is super straightforward, much better than  vagrant in that regard, esp. for our purposes
[2012-04-28 17:25:15 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, also toft looks like it uses lxc directly, rather than using lxc via libvirt ... is that correct?
[2012-04-28 17:25:27 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, yeah, lxc directly
[2012-04-28 17:25:40 -0400] BryanWB_: it just uses the lxc commands which are pretty friendly to begin w/
[2012-04-28 17:25:58 -0400] BryanWB_: i am working on a blog post but it keeps getting sidetracked
[2012-04-28 17:26:14 -0400] BryanWB_: i have some tips on how to avoid major pain, so let me know if u start w/ it
[2012-04-28 17:26:17 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, one of the issues i have is that a testing system has got to be usable by a non-root user, and i'm not aware of how to do that with lxc directly
[2012-04-28 17:26:50 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, uh yeah, toft isn't usable by non-root
[2012-04-28 17:26:53 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, which was why i spent a few hours looking into lxc via libvirt, which is usable by a non-root usre
[2012-04-28 17:27:08 -0400] BryanWB_: that would be neat
[2012-04-28 17:27:50 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, if toft could switch to that, it would provide two things: multiple types of virtualization for the price of one (lxc, kvm, etc), and ability to run tests by non-root
[2012-04-28 17:28:16 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, most definitely
[2012-04-28 17:29:42 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, another thing ... someone needs to invent a CoW type deal so i can debootstrap once and run multiple lxc's off of it
[2012-04-28 17:30:10 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, that would be sweet
[2012-04-28 17:30:27 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, because right now it's a real pain to have to cp -r 150MB or so every time i want to run another test case
[2012-04-28 17:30:29 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, but i am really desperate _now_ for a decent testing setup
[2012-04-28 17:30:45 -0400] BryanWB_: my current environment is getting really out of control
[2012-04-28 17:31:19 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, i hear ya ... i'm just throwing at ya some things i was thinking ... perhaps something you can bring up at the hackathon you're organizing
[2012-04-28 17:31:38 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, or on monday's testing show ;)
[2012-04-28 17:31:50 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, good points, i just need something that works asap
[2012-04-28 17:32:12 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, or that :P ... just some ideas that someone there or someone listening might think about and run with
[2012-04-28 17:32:36 -0400] miah: hackathon? http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-DevOps/events/62187472/
[2012-04-28 17:32:38 -0400] miah: =)
[2012-04-28 17:32:44 -0400] BryanWB_: miah, and tuesday!
[2012-04-28 17:32:52 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, what are your major pain points?
[2012-04-28 17:32:54 -0400] BryanWB_: monday is bemu's thing
[2012-04-28 17:33:08 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, quick testing using minitest-handler
[2012-04-28 17:33:26 -0400] BryanWB_: < 10 minutes
[2012-04-28 17:33:47 -0400] miah: oh awesome
[2012-04-28 17:33:53 -0400] miah: gonna be a week of awesome hacking
[2012-04-28 17:34:16 -0400] BryanWB_: vagrant may do the job, but i am hacking on minitest-handler now,  cuz doesn't support chef-solo yet
[2012-04-28 17:34:29 -0400] BryanWB_: but toft has much better api for this thing
[2012-04-28 17:37:37 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, gotcha
[2012-04-28 17:37:45 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, u r welcome to add stuff to the show for monday, i accept pull requests  for the show :) https://github.com/foodfight/showz/blob/master/scripts/30Apr2012-test-test.md
[2012-04-28 17:38:29 -0400] miah: awesome
[2012-04-28 17:39:28 -0400] miah: toft looks neat, but suffers a similar problem as cucumber-chef.
[2012-04-28 17:39:33 -0400] yfeldblum: ?
[2012-04-28 17:39:38 -0400] miah: lxc requirement.
[2012-04-28 17:40:08 -0400] BryanWB_: miah, that's a feature for running automated tests w/ a ci system like jenkins
[2012-04-28 17:40:21 -0400] BryanWB_: but does complicate life for macbook pro-toters
[2012-04-28 17:40:21 -0400] miah: does it work without it?
[2012-04-28 17:40:36 -0400] BryanWB_: w/out lxc?
[2012-04-28 17:40:36 -0400] miah: what if i want to use travis-ci for my testing?
[2012-04-28 17:40:43 -0400] hoover_damn: miah, do you use ec2?
[2012-04-28 17:40:49 -0400] miah: i do
[2012-04-28 17:41:03 -0400] hoover_damn: so then basically your pattern of ci testing /should/ be boot up a fresh instance via travis-ci or jenkins
[2012-04-28 17:41:10 -0400] hoover_damn: run your cookbooks in scenario's that you want, trap the results
[2012-04-28 17:41:20 -0400] hoover_damn: then terminate the instance
[2012-04-28 17:41:48 -0400] hoover_damn: obviously i'd suggest minitest and or some good brains in this
[2012-04-28 17:42:10 -0400] hoover_damn: I can go into more detail if you want really as I was a user and maintainer of said system
[2012-04-28 17:42:25 -0400] hoover_damn: not so much a developer of that... as that dude works for @github now lol
[2012-04-28 17:42:28 -0400] yfeldblum: how would you run tests without it?
[2012-04-28 17:42:36 -0400] miah: without lxc?
[2012-04-28 17:42:37 -0400] BryanWB_: miah, sorry, could work excellenty w/ travis-ci
[2012-04-28 17:43:00 -0400] BryanWB_: if they put lxc on their servers, and i could imagine they would want that
[2012-04-28 17:43:01 -0400] hoover_damn: github post-commit to a travis-ci or something to do the deed
[2012-04-28 17:43:03 -0400] hoover_damn: or your own ci
[2012-04-28 17:43:03 -0400] yfeldblum: miah, yes, what would you do differently?
[2012-04-28 17:43:17 -0400] hoover_damn: although there's no reason to avoid lxc
[2012-04-28 17:43:22 -0400] hoover_damn: you can totally do lxc on ec2
[2012-04-28 17:43:25 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, travis-ci does run your tests in lxc instances
[2012-04-28 17:44:20 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, nice
[2012-04-28 17:44:21 -0400] hoover_damn: basically lxc shouldn't change your landscape that much
[2012-04-28 17:44:23 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, however, they give you one instance for a full test run, and i'm not sure they let you create sub instances
[2012-04-28 17:45:12 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, speaking of which, i have librarian passing on travis-ci now for 1.8.7, 1.9.2, and 1.9.3 :P
[2012-04-28 17:45:18 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, awesome!
[2012-04-28 17:46:54 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, real shame u won't be at chefconf
[2012-04-28 17:47:32 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, yeah, well, sorry to disappoint ...
[2012-04-28 17:47:56 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, i know u r too cool to hang w/ us, i am ok w/ it :)
[2012-04-28 17:48:10 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, that's why i hang in #chef
[2012-04-28 17:48:25 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, so u can educate us lower life forms ;)
[2012-04-28 17:48:33 -0400] BryanWB_: we need it!
[2012-04-28 17:48:38 -0400] miah: srsly
[2012-04-28 17:50:46 -0400] yfeldblum: BryanWB_, heh, thanks, it seems i've got a developer's perspective when it comes to operations & operations automation (because i'm a developer) ... but that's what devops is all about
[2012-04-28 17:51:08 -0400] miah: yup
[2012-04-28 17:51:08 -0400] BryanWB_: yfeldblum, i think it's cuz ur damn smart
[2012-04-28 17:52:08 -0400] BryanWB_: hoover_damn, should i be worried aobut rubinius future since evan phoenix left EY?
[2012-04-28 17:53:08 -0400] BryanWB_: jtgiri_, just curious, any relation to Sandeep Giri?
[2012-04-28 18:27:44 -0400] yfeldblum: hmmm actually i'm not sure what travis-ci uses, looks like it might be using vagrant instead
[2012-04-28 18:36:31 -0400] dkingofpa: Any way to easily list what packages a chef-solo run will install?  Something like a dry run or simulate that lists all the packages to be installed?
[2012-04-28 18:37:55 -0400] dkingofpa: Without actually reading through all the included recipes.
[2012-04-28 18:39:08 -0400] coderanger: dkingofpa: Check out the why-run branch, not finished yet though
[2012-04-28 18:39:38 -0400] coderanger: (and obviously somewhat handwavey since Chef recipes are real code, so knowing what doesn't have side effects is technically impossible)
[2012-04-28 18:40:17 -0400] coderanger: or at the very least is technically NP complete
[2012-04-28 18:40:27 -0400] hoover_damn: BryanWB_, I have no opinion
[2012-04-28 18:40:45 -0400] hoover_damn: BryanWB_, the only thing I can say is that Engine Yard is full of incredibly passionate intelligent people who are likely burned out and tired
[2012-04-28 18:40:49 -0400] dkingofpa: coderanger: cool, I'm all about the handwavey.  I'll take a look.
[2012-04-28 18:40:51 -0400] hoover_damn: I hope for the best for Engine Yard
[2012-04-28 18:41:05 -0400] hoover_damn: butthey are burning their employees out trying to build back morale
[2012-04-28 18:49:05 -0400] hoover_damn: hrm he's not here doh
[2012-04-28 18:52:03 -0400] hoover_damn: yfeldblum, basically if you are worried about rubinius ask them
[2012-04-28 18:52:07 -0400] hoover_damn: I have no insight
[2012-04-28 18:52:15 -0400] hoover_damn: or want any gossip
[2012-04-28 19:15:20 -0400] sascha_d: anyone using the Cassandra cookbook in the community repository? Any feedback?
[2012-04-28 19:31:30 -0400] miah: i haven't looked at it
[2012-04-28 19:36:39 -0400] sascha_d: I'm wondering how hard it would be to retrofit an existing env with it
[2012-04-28 19:36:55 -0400] sascha_d: it looks complicated
[2012-04-28 19:44:47 -0400] miah: ah. its the ironfan package.
[2012-04-28 19:45:04 -0400] miah: well. it might be tricky. you should test it out on some vm's or other instances and get to know it a little more
[2012-04-28 19:54:56 -0400] sascha_d: yeah I was thinking that.  Looks complicated :)
[2012-04-28 19:57:02 -0400] miah: well, the ironfan has some good stuff in it
[2012-04-28 19:57:31 -0400] miah: it should automagically set up your cassandra cluster. i haven't used it though.
[2012-04-28 20:10:14 -0400] ssd7: Ohai Chefs!
[2012-04-28 20:15:20 -0400] hoover_damn: lusis should have a cassandra cookbook pref
[2012-04-28 20:18:30 -0400] yfeldblum: ohai ssd7
[2012-04-28 21:13:44 -0400] yfeldblum: in a CLI, which is a better name for a boolean option flag: --detailed, or --details?
[2012-04-28 21:28:03 -0400] z: --verbose
[2012-04-28 21:28:37 -0400] erikh: +1
[2012-04-28 21:40:37 -0400] yfeldblum: --verbose is taken in this case to mean verbose logging
[2012-04-28 23:56:25 -0400] coderanger: miah: Got to floor 4 in HSL, ~4k turns in. Raaaaaaaage
