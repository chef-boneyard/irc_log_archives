[2012-04-14 00:12:55 -0400] tarrant1: Using the nagios cookbook is there anyway to tell it to use the fqdn for the hostname? We have cases of box1.pop1.example.com and box1.pop2.example.com which causes nagios to not reload.
[2012-04-14 00:13:54 -0400] timsmith: tarrant1: for the nodes within the nagios config?
[2012-04-14 00:14:03 -0400] tarrant1: Yes
[2012-04-14 00:14:09 -0400] timsmith: does it not do that already?
[2012-04-14 00:14:28 -0400] tarrant1: I'm seeing 'host_name box1'
[2012-04-14 00:15:09 -0400] timsmith: there's a quick change you could make
[2012-04-14 00:15:09 -0400] tarrant1: when I look at /etc/nagios3/conf.d/hosts.cfg
[2012-04-14 00:15:20 -0400] timsmith: crach open template/default/nagios.cfg.erb
[2012-04-14 00:15:40 -0400] timsmith: crack*
[2012-04-14 00:16:40 -0400] timsmith: The template is using host_name <%= node['hostname'] %>
[2012-04-14 00:16:58 -0400] timsmith: you can change 'hostname' to 'fqdn' I believe and it will spit out a fully qualified name
[2012-04-14 00:17:12 -0400] tarrant1: Looks like it should work in theory. Thanks I'll try that.
[2012-04-14 00:17:40 -0400] timsmith: that *should* work
[2012-04-14 00:17:50 -0400] tarrant1: That is what testing is for :)
[2012-04-14 01:33:47 -0400] ssd7: Ohai Chefs!
[2012-04-14 01:36:46 -0400] z: ohai ssd7
[2012-04-14 01:37:10 -0400] z: or should the response have been 'facter stringtwiddlers'
[2012-04-14 01:37:22 -0400] ssd7: hehehehe
[2012-04-14 02:08:06 -0400] tarrant1: Including nagios::client in a node causes the ndoe to load all attributes for all depending recipies. This includes mysql, apache and nagios. This causes all of the attributes files to be run. The set function is then called in these attribute files causing a node with nagios::client to endup with attributes for mysql server pernamently saved in its node definition. Is there a good way to prevent this
[2012-04-14 02:08:08 -0400] tarrant1: pollution of a node definition?
[2012-04-14 02:24:48 -0400] yfeldblum: tarrant1, why does it matter?
[2012-04-14 02:32:16 -0400] tarrant1: yfeldblum: because it is messy. I go from nice neat node definitions where only the bear minimum is set to nodes where I have multiple pages of useless information for services that I'm not using nor intrested in using.
[2012-04-14 02:33:05 -0400] yfeldblum: tarrant1, raw JSON docs aren't supposed to be pretty
[2012-04-14 02:33:10 -0400] hoover_damn: node polution is a problem
[2012-04-14 02:33:18 -0400] hoover_damn: but it's just not one that people talk about much
[2012-04-14 02:34:01 -0400] hoover_damn: I personally care because i'm getting OCD to the point where I am UML'ing Cookbook diagrams
[2012-04-14 02:34:12 -0400] hoover_damn: and if i have to diagram 50 cookbooks attributes
[2012-04-14 02:34:20 -0400] hoover_damn: I have to ask myself maybe there's a easier path?
[2012-04-14 02:34:36 -0400] hoover_damn: it's easier to judge and say that, then do it
[2012-04-14 02:34:39 -0400] yfeldblum: UMLing cookbooks? why?
[2012-04-14 02:34:44 -0400] hoover_damn: why not?
[2012-04-14 02:35:08 -0400] hoover_damn: can you give me one valid reason why I shouldn't? not personal reasons.
[2012-04-14 02:35:30 -0400] hoover_damn: we had our diagrams back at EY...
[2012-04-14 02:35:43 -0400] hoover_damn: it has value, totally
[2012-04-14 02:36:09 -0400] yfeldblum: i personally haven't needed it
[2012-04-14 02:36:26 -0400] yfeldblum: but i'm wondering what problem does it solve that nothing else solves, or solves as well?
[2012-04-14 02:36:45 -0400] hoover_damn: it solves a organization problem and a sharing problem
[2012-04-14 02:36:49 -0400] hoover_damn: you organize, you share
[2012-04-14 02:36:54 -0400] yfeldblum: and what do node attributes have to do with UML?
[2012-04-14 02:37:00 -0400] tarrant1: In addition most of these attributes are worthless. The directory where nagios server's pids are stored should not be saved to a node definition.
[2012-04-14 02:37:07 -0400] hoover_damn: for me? I describe those
[2012-04-14 02:37:08 -0400] hoover_damn: that's all
[2012-04-14 02:37:37 -0400] hoover_damn: tarrant1, if you have a critique of a cookbook I'd suggest to open a pull request with the cookbook in question and lay it there
[2012-04-14 02:37:40 -0400] yfeldblum: tarrant1, it's not a node definition
[2012-04-14 02:37:58 -0400] yfeldblum: tarrant1, it's the historical, recorded state of a node
[2012-04-14 02:38:04 -0400] hoover_damn: tarrant1, as IRC is good for lots of things
[2012-04-14 02:38:31 -0400] yfeldblum: the node definition is the node's run-list and normal-level attributes
[2012-04-14 02:38:31 -0400] hoover_damn: finding answers to these questions sadly I don't think IRC is the best
[2012-04-14 02:39:02 -0400] tarrant1: And I'm refering to things that are getting set in a node's normal-level attributes.
[2012-04-14 02:39:52 -0400] tarrant1: I pulled that from memory let me go find a good example of something.
[2012-04-14 02:40:01 -0400] yfeldblum: tarrant1, please
[2012-04-14 02:40:26 -0400] yfeldblum: IMO recipes should never write normal-level attributes ...
[2012-04-14 02:41:19 -0400] tarrant1: On a node with the nagios::client recipe I have an attribute for [nagios][http_port]=80 set to a normal-level.
[2012-04-14 02:41:53 -0400] hoover_damn: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nagios/blob/master/attributes/client.rb
[2012-04-14 02:41:59 -0400] hoover_damn: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nagios/blob/master/attributes/default.rb
[2012-04-14 02:42:09 -0400] hoover_damn: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nagios/blob/master/attributes/server.rb
[2012-04-14 02:42:46 -0400] tarrant1: I also have normal attributes for all sorts of things like apache being in the www-data group.
[2012-04-14 02:42:49 -0400] hoover_damn: it's not pretty but heh there is a good deal of data loaded
[2012-04-14 02:43:14 -0400] hoover_damn: apache2 and php
[2012-04-14 02:43:16 -0400] hoover_damn: yep
[2012-04-14 02:43:24 -0400] hoover_damn: and you need apache2 if you want to use nagios
[2012-04-14 02:43:24 -0400] tarrant1: Maybe my solution is to go file bugs for each of the depending recipes and change 9/10ths of these attributes from set -> default.
[2012-04-14 02:43:36 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damn, yeah that's just wrong
[2012-04-14 02:43:43 -0400] hoover_damn: no it's not
[2012-04-14 02:43:55 -0400] hoover_damn: it's a cgi-bin that is C compiled
[2012-04-14 02:44:00 -0400] hoover_damn: nginx doesn't do cgi-bin
[2012-04-14 02:44:03 -0400] yfeldblum: tarrant1, please do
[2012-04-14 02:44:03 -0400] hoover_damn: let alone execute
[2012-04-14 02:44:24 -0400] hoover_damn: basically this is where a issue / pull request
[2012-04-14 02:44:27 -0400] hoover_damn: comes in handy
[2012-04-14 02:44:34 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damn, to clarify, the nagios attributes file is just wrong
[2012-04-14 02:44:34 -0400] hoover_damn: or email
[2012-04-14 02:44:44 -0400] hoover_damn: yfeldblum, ahh shrug
[2012-04-14 02:44:48 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damn, the nagios attributes file ought really to be setting default-level attributes only
[2012-04-14 02:44:53 -0400] hoover_damn: yfeldblum, i'm fairly sure i'll have folks bitch about my postgresql
[2012-04-14 02:44:59 -0400] hoover_damn: as i set a lot of attributes in it
[2012-04-14 02:45:08 -0400] hoover_damn: but i don't do default level
[2012-04-14 02:45:16 -0400] hoover_damn: everything should be in it's own proper clean level
[2012-04-14 02:45:21 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damn, that's really problematic ...
[2012-04-14 02:45:25 -0400] hoover_damn: no need to have a dirty house
[2012-04-14 02:45:48 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damn, normal-level attributes are there for admins to customize per-node data, not for recipes or roles to write to
[2012-04-14 02:46:19 -0400] hoover_damn: what would you hve them write to? databags?
[2012-04-14 02:47:40 -0400] hoover_damn: tarrant, agreed
[2012-04-14 02:48:17 -0400] tarrant: recipes are explitic includes, attributes are implicit.
[2012-04-14 02:48:30 -0400] tarrant: s/attributes/attribute files/
[2012-04-14 03:01:36 -0400] yfeldblum: hoover_damn, what data do you need to write to the node from a recipe that can't be written at the default level?
[2012-04-14 03:39:47 -0400] yfeldblum_: hoover_damn, what data do you need to write to the node from a recipe that can't be written at the default level?
[2012-04-14 04:03:15 -0400] hoover_damn: yfeldblum_, generally my cookbooks have a knob or two and they are attributes that are set on the node or role
[2012-04-14 04:03:41 -0400] hoover_damn: and always a default setting for 'oops I forgot to read the README' mode :)
[2012-04-14 04:08:17 -0400] hoover_damn: yfeldblum_, for my cookbook if given enough time i'll refactor most of the attributes required to the minimum
[2012-04-14 04:08:44 -0400] hoover_damn: but there's always something set, stored
[2012-04-14 04:08:45 -0400] hoover_damn: persisted
[2012-04-14 04:09:04 -0400] hoover_damn: discover(:postgresql, hi)
[2012-04-14 04:09:05 -0400] hoover_damn: :)

[2012-04-14 05:55:05 -0400] jtgiri_: I have one stupid question, if I set the action: rollback for deploy script, does that mean every time it runs chef-client it will roll it back to the previous version ?
[2012-04-14 06:02:57 -0400] Anand: can anybody give me answer of this Q?

[2012-04-14 09:40:10 -0400] BryanWB_: good morning chefs!
[2012-04-14 09:40:12 -0400] BryanWB_: keep it hot!
[2012-04-14 09:41:36 -0400] eugenmayer: do i need specific subfolders in attributes, to only include some attribute-definitions, if a specific recipe is used?
[2012-04-14 09:52:27 -0400] eugenmayer: just looking at http://blog.gomiso.com/2011/08/26/forget-chef-or-puppet-automate-with-sprinkle/
[2012-04-14 09:52:41 -0400] eugenmayer: "Chef and Puppet recipes are not trivial to create or manage and by default they are intended to be managed from a remote server"
[2012-04-14 09:53:12 -0400] eugenmayer: recipes are not trivial? There is nothing cooler then writing recipes, its easier then anything else. Pretty odd statement
[2012-04-14 10:03:22 -0400] eugenmayer: can i actuallly use http://rubydoc.info/gems/chef/0.10.4/Chef/Provider/Package/Apt#check_package_state-instance_method
[2012-04-14 10:03:29 -0400] eugenmayer: to check, if a package is already installed?
[2012-04-14 10:05:38 -0400] eugenmayer: (not sure what the context is and if iam allowed to do those deep-method calls
[2012-04-14 10:07:16 -0400] eugenmayer: jtimberman: i asked / discussed the question, how to approach "use debconf or chef" when thinking about deployment and configuration. While i think the dual-approach is good for some sort of packages, i really find, that chef is a lot more flexible, especially due to "configuration" management, which can be inherited.
[2012-04-14 10:09:28 -0400] Babar: eugenmayer: sprinkle seems to be for ruby what Rex is for perl. Still haven't gotten around to trying it. Maybe I should... rainy week-end...
[2012-04-14 10:09:40 -0400] eugenmayer: :)
[2012-04-14 10:10:10 -0400] eugenmayer: Babar: looking at the post, it is like apt for rails. If i would need that, i would go for bundler
[2012-04-14 10:10:34 -0400] eugenmayer: all the other things i more or less would use apt+meta packages for, if i want to avoid central management like chef
[2012-04-14 10:11:10 -0400] eugenmayer: Babar: or, as it seems to be app deployment, rather use a proper tool like capistrano, instead of fiddling your own tools for that kind of thing
[2012-04-14 10:11:53 -0400] eugenmayer: (for app-deployment, chef is simply to complicated to really do a good job - its not build for that kind of thing)
[2012-04-14 10:12:40 -0400] Babar: eugenmayer: no, I think you missed the point. capistrano is great to deploy your application. But usually you need more than just your app, which is where you need a tool like chef, sprinkle, puppet, etc... You need to install ruby, setup apache, varnish, redis, memcached, etc...
[2012-04-14 10:12:56 -0400] eugenmayer: Babar: no i dont miss the point
[2012-04-14 10:13:02 -0400] eugenmayer: because thats exactly what iam doing :)
[2012-04-14 10:13:21 -0400] eugenmayer: Server-Deps and configuration with chef, app-deployment with specific tools like capistrano
[2012-04-14 10:13:41 -0400] Babar: yes, but your previous comment seem to think sprinkle is in the same category as capistrano
[2012-04-14 10:13:47 -0400] Babar: anyway. if we agree, no need to argue :)
[2012-04-14 10:13:51 -0400] eugenmayer: :)

[2012-04-14 13:08:05 -0400] mehlah: Hello Chefs !
[2012-04-14 13:08:23 -0400] mehlah: I'm confused about configuring my workstation as a Chef client and using knife.
[2012-04-14 13:08:53 -0400] mehlah: I followed the wiki guide to setup a chef server http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installing+Chef+Server+on+Debian+or+Ubuntu+using+Packages
[2012-04-14 13:08:57 -0400] mehlah: and the section Create a Knife Client for Your Laptop/Desktop.
[2012-04-14 13:09:07 -0400] mehlah: Everything went smoothly and I run knife rackspace server list successfully. Which is awesome!
[2012-04-14 13:09:15 -0400] mehlah: but creating a node with knife fails on bootstrapping it as my validation_key don't exist on my laptop.
[2012-04-14 13:09:35 -0400] mehlah: The guide says: For these next settings, you can accept the defaults for now and update them later by editing your knife.rb file
[2012-04-14 13:09:47 -0400] mehlah: I have to get it from my chef server ?
[2012-04-14 13:09:47 -0400] mehlah: Or I need to configure my workstation as a chef client ?
[2012-04-14 15:34:54 -0400] mehlah: Is there any known problem for bootsraping nodes with knife with Rackspace UK ?
[2012-04-14 16:09:26 -0400] jtgiri_:  if I set the action: rollback for deploy script, does that mean every time it runs chef-client it will roll it back to the previous version ?
[2012-04-14 16:12:53 -0400] yfeldblum_: jtgiri_, yes
[2012-04-14 17:15:53 -0400] raz: is there a faster way to sync databags than databag:upload_all?
[2012-04-14 17:15:58 -0400] raz: this takes ages
[2012-04-14 17:59:25 -0400] raz: hm
[2012-04-14 17:59:33 -0400] raz: how do i get at the chef_environment in a recipe?
[2012-04-14 17:59:37 -0400] raz: chef.chef_environment is nil
[2012-04-14 18:00:25 -0400] coderanger: raz: node.chef_environment
[2012-04-14 18:00:39 -0400] coderanger: the node object has all the info about the current node, env, run list, attrs, etc
[2012-04-14 18:01:02 -0400] raz: doesn't work
[2012-04-14 18:01:07 -0400] raz: how do i print debug output in a chef run?
[2012-04-14 18:01:11 -0400] raz: chef-client run
[2012-04-14 18:01:24 -0400] coderanger: Use the log resource
[2012-04-14 18:01:42 -0400] raz: aah!
[2012-04-14 18:01:44 -0400] raz: now it works..
[2012-04-14 18:01:51 -0400] raz: strange, must have cached my cookbook or something
[2012-04-14 18:29:55 -0400] raz: hmm

[2012-04-14 19:20:40 -0400] amccloud: how do I change a node's fqdn on manage.opscode.com ?
[2012-04-14 19:23:31 -0400] coderanger: amccloud: Not what what you mean, you would need a recipe to do that
[2012-04-14 19:23:37 -0400] coderanger: Do you mean change a node name?
[2012-04-14 19:25:20 -0400] amccloud: hmm, maybe I don't understand the purpose of the fqdn. Right now it's the node's name. I'd like it to be domain like web1.site.com
[2012-04-14 19:25:50 -0400] coderanger: The node name only defaults to the fqdn, it can be anything though, just specify it in the chef.rb config file
[2012-04-14 19:59:48 -0400] josephholsten: am I doing it wrong?

[2012-04-14 20:01:28 -0400] josephholsten: owen1: could you pastie a full log? or at least tell us which file the error is coming from?

[2012-04-14 20:08:44 -0400] josephholsten: ah, could you set `chef.log_level = :debug` in your Vagrantfile? you're showing debug level logging from vagrant, but not the chef provisioner
[2012-04-14 20:09:41 -0400] owen1: josephholsten: sure, should i take out the VAGRANT_LOG=debug from when i run the vagrant command?
[2012-04-14 20:10:15 -0400] josephholsten: it can't hurt to keep it in for the moment, though I doubt it'll help

[2012-04-14 20:15:44 -0400] josephholsten: no, but I'm pretty sure solo will try to parse all the recipes even if it doesn't actually apply them

[2012-04-14 20:15:57 -0400] hoover_damn: well it can
