[2012-04-06 04:08:32 -0400] cwj: anybody used bluepill to manage an app that runs in a python virtualenv?
[2012-04-06 04:10:06 -0400] bemu: maybe damm.
[2012-04-06 04:10:15 -0400] bemu: But I think he's gone for the night.
[2012-04-06 04:10:20 -0400] bemu: hoover_damm: ping
[2012-04-06 04:21:32 -0400] miah: moin
[2012-04-06 04:21:42 -0400] hoover_damm: eh i'm here for the moment
[2012-04-06 04:21:48 -0400] hoover_damm: bluepill and virtualenv no
[2012-04-06 04:21:51 -0400] hoover_damm: runit and virtualenv yes
[2012-04-06 04:22:07 -0400] hoover_damm: github.com/damm/graphite I think
[2012-04-06 04:22:07 -0400] hoover_damm: ?
[2012-04-06 04:22:08 -0400] hoover_damm: heh
[2012-04-06 04:35:35 -0400] cwj: thanks but it looks like thats using runit?
[2012-04-06 04:35:54 -0400] cwj: i might have figured it out though
[2012-04-06 07:45:50 -0400] gadolin: Can anyone help me and point how can I loop over templates?
[2012-04-06 07:46:48 -0400] gadolin: i want fill all templates in loop
[2012-04-06 08:26:25 -0400] Kwanasolis: gadolin: ?
[2012-04-06 08:28:57 -0400] gadolin: Kwanasolis: yes?
[2012-04-06 08:29:59 -0400] gadolin: Kwanasolis: I have erb templates, now I dont want explicitly write template staticName ..., but what to loop over the templates in template dir
[2012-04-06 08:55:11 -0400] Kwanasolis: so you want to call all the templates in a directory, with the same parameters?
[2012-04-06 08:58:18 -0400] Kwanasolis: http://pastie.org/3737757
[2012-04-06 09:32:11 -0400] jacobat: Is there some way to tell chef where the binaries is installed so it can setup a proper init.d file?
[2012-04-06 09:43:26 -0400] Kwanasolis: ?
[2012-04-06 09:47:43 -0400] jacobat: Kwanasolis: Was that for me? :)
[2012-04-06 10:30:32 -0400] gadolin: is there any simple way to run script which in background?
[2012-04-06 11:03:56 -0400] kaz___: I've been using chef for about 2 years and I'm continiously impressed by it.  I wanted a way to synchronize two local directories.  Rsync was proposed, but I wouldn't be able to send/recieve notifications *if* the content had changed.  So I added a custom provider for remote_directory.  Given how easy chef is to read/modify, it was a breeze.  https://gist.github.com/2318839 for anyone who's interested in such functionality.
[2012-04-06 12:43:26 -0400] benner: I have question: if node is compromised so using chef api, bad guy can do whole infrastructure search?
[2012-04-06 12:53:29 -0400] ajardan_: so my next question is :)
[2012-04-06 12:53:39 -0400] ajardan_: I have a provider which generates a template
[2012-04-06 12:53:59 -0400] ajardan_: the source of that template is in the cookbook with the resource
[2012-04-06 12:54:39 -0400] ajardan_: and I'm trying to use that resource in a different cookbook, I am including the cookbook with the provider, but template resource is looking for the template source in the CURRENT cookbook, not the one with the provider
[2012-04-06 12:56:21 -0400] ajardan_: any ideas how to solve that ?
[2012-04-06 13:34:14 -0400] Zoubi: hi guys
[2012-04-06 13:34:28 -0400] yfeldblum: hi
[2012-04-06 13:34:31 -0400] matti: Hi
[2012-04-06 13:34:47 -0400] Zoubi: I control a chef server using knife in a virtual machine created with vagrant
[2012-04-06 13:35:17 -0400] yfeldblum: cool
[2012-04-06 13:36:25 -0400] Zoubi: yfeldblum: indeed, but I'm not finished ;)
[2012-04-06 13:36:37 -0400] Zoubi: I create EC2 instances using the knife ec2 plugin
[2012-04-06 13:36:59 -0400] Zoubi: in this file https://github.com/opscode/knife-ec2/blob/master/README.rdoc it is told I can set my AWS keys in environment variables
[2012-04-06 13:38:06 -0400] Zoubi: I have written as in this file, but how do I set the environment variables on the virtual machine when I start it using vagrant?
[2012-04-06 13:38:16 -0400] Zoubi: I've set them in Windows, but I don't know how to "pass" them from windows to the virtual machine
[2012-04-06 13:38:19 -0400] Zoubi: any idea?
[2012-04-06 13:45:19 -0400] afallows: Zoubi: It's an impefrect solution, but could you create a .box image to use with Vagrant that already has the ENV set?
[2012-04-06 13:45:49 -0400] Zoubi: afallows: that doesn't seem good
[2012-04-06 13:46:07 -0400] yfeldblum: Zoubi, the docs say you need to set `knife[:aws_access_key_id]` and `knife[:aws_secret_access_key]` in your `.chef/knife.rb`, and suggest that if your `.chef/knife.rb` will be added to source control, a good technique is to set them based on environment variables (but you don't have to: you could just hardcode your id/key if you like)
[2012-04-06 13:46:10 -0400] Zoubi: I won't be the only one to use this vagrant box, and each one will have its own environment variables
[2012-04-06 13:46:58 -0400] Zoubi: yfeldblum: as I've told, I'm not the only one to use this vagrant box, and each one will have its own access keys
[2012-04-06 13:47:16 -0400] Zoubi: currently, I have hardcoded the keys in knife.rb
[2012-04-06 13:47:22 -0400] Zoubi: but I'd like a more generic way
[2012-04-06 13:47:52 -0400] yfeldblum: Zoubi, if you choose to follow that suggestion, then you can set the environment variable in the same like as you type the knife command, like so: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=asdf1234 AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=0987zyxw knife ec2 server create OPTIONS`
[2012-04-06 13:48:16 -0400] yfeldblum: you would have to retype (or re-copy) the id/key every time you type the knife command
[2012-04-06 13:48:35 -0400] Zoubi: yfeldblum: yeah I know... I would have liked to avoid that if possible
[2012-04-06 13:50:02 -0400] yfeldblum: Zoubi, there are indeed better techniques: one technique is to require everyone to create a file named `.chef/aws.yml`, in yaml format, with their id/key, and make sure that file is .gitignored (or ignored from svn), and write code in your `.chef/knife.rb` to expect and read this file using `YAML.load_file(...)` and set those variables that way rather than looking in envvars
[2012-04-06 13:56:36 -0400] Zoubi: yfeldblum: ok thanks for the tip, I'll have a look at this
[2012-04-06 13:58:20 -0400] yfeldblum: Zoubi, your `.chef/knife.rb` is just a Ruby script (which Knife executes within a Knife-oriented context), so you can run any Ruby code you want ... you can create classes, create methods, create objects, call methods, just like you would in any ruby script or program
[2012-04-06 14:03:53 -0400] afallows: Are there any known issues with an Open Source Chef server intermittently hanging when are sent through knife?
[2012-04-06 14:39:57 -0400] hoover_damm: if it's hanging through knife, check out the server logs, knife -VV
[2012-04-06 14:40:10 -0400] hoover_damm: and basically check out the health of the server... you might have given it too little ram
[2012-04-06 14:40:14 -0400] hoover_damm: and it's just swapping during actions
[2012-04-06 14:40:17 -0400] hoover_damm: and takes a little longer
[2012-04-06 14:52:35 -0400] rayrod2030: so I understand that remote_file will do a wget of a file but how would I then take that file and pass it on to sh?
[2012-04-06 14:53:06 -0400] rayrod2030: I'd like to do the equivalent of this: wget -q -O - http://www.atomicorp.com/installers/atomic | sh
[2012-04-06 14:53:28 -0400] afallows: hoover_damm: What's a good amount of RAM to feed a chef server? I've been testing on a small EC2 instance, which doesn't have much (offset a little by the fact that it's a headless server that's not doing anything else)
[2012-04-06 14:55:57 -0400] jperry: anyone have any experience testing recipes using vagrant?
[2012-04-06 14:56:32 -0400] jperry: I have question around when I provision a vagrant box it works the first time but the second time it complains that the client already exists
[2012-04-06 14:56:48 -0400] jperry: do folks usually use a rake file that calls knife to remove the client from the chef_server?
[2012-04-06 15:00:09 -0400] jtimberman: jperry: i have a rake task that calls vagrant destroy, then knife node delete and knife client delete.
[2012-04-06 15:13:08 -0400] hoover_damm: afallows, I prefer at least 2gigs of ram
[2012-04-06 15:13:16 -0400] hoover_damm: afallows, if your doing ec2, m1.medium should be more then plenty
[2012-04-06 15:13:43 -0400] hoover_damm: the 4gigs will make you nice and comfy, 1 virtual cpu however can get you short changed easily on ec2
[2012-04-06 15:14:00 -0400] hoover_damm: you should never put anything into production (imo) on ec2 without at least 2 virtual cpu's
[2012-04-06 15:14:42 -0400] hoover_damm: if your kernel has the TSC bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/727459
[2012-04-06 15:14:58 -0400] hoover_damm: I know of one PaaS that has the TSC bug that hasn't fixed it yet
[2012-04-06 15:15:20 -0400] hoover_damm: that and just regular ole cpu steal
[2012-04-06 15:15:30 -0400] hoover_damm: you use 90%, 10% stolen, your out
[2012-04-06 15:15:36 -0400] hoover_damm: better to have a backup :)
[2012-04-06 15:15:42 -0400] hoover_damm: silly reason I know
[2012-04-06 15:15:59 -0400] hoover_damm: but 2 cpu's shouldn't cost an arm and a leg... and if it does cut off amazon's arm and leg
[2012-04-06 15:18:00 -0400] afallows: hoover_damm: Thanks for the input. I've got no idea what my employer thinks about costs, but I'm guessing that going from m1.small to m1.medium is cheaper than going to Hosted Chef, and it's not my money. ;)
[2012-04-06 15:19:08 -0400] hoover_damm: afallows, afaik it is
[2012-04-06 15:19:23 -0400] hoover_damm: afallows, basically if it's under 250$ it's likely to cause no issue
[2012-04-06 15:19:35 -0400] hoover_damm: afallows, as that's the up to 50 node price plan afaik
[2012-04-06 16:21:58 -0400] jtimberman: capex vs opex
[2012-04-06 16:22:09 -0400] jtimberman: is the thing you're going to look at as well
[2012-04-06 16:22:23 -0400] jtimberman: the cost per month for the instance is only part of the story
[2012-04-06 16:26:34 -0400] corp: can someone tell me the chef server endpoint for hosted chef?
[2012-04-06 16:26:38 -0400] corp: i cant find the docs for it
[2012-04-06 16:28:36 -0400] jtimberman: corp: https://api.opscode.com/organizations/YOURORGSHORTNAME

[2012-04-06 16:28:56 -0400] miah: moin
[2012-04-06 16:29:06 -0400] corp: thanks
[2012-04-06 16:29:12 -0400] corp: pretty hard to actually find that info online
[2012-04-06 16:29:57 -0400] jtimberman: corp: "online" ?
[2012-04-06 16:30:19 -0400] corp: jtimberman: imagine you lost your knife.rb. you want to quickly remember how to generate it or find the right URL
[2012-04-06 16:30:28 -0400] jtimberman: corp: when you sign up, you get a link for the management console, where you can download a knife.rb w/ the chef_server_url
[2012-04-06 16:30:45 -0400] corp: jtimberman: yes, but how do i know where to go in the management console to find the knife config?
[2012-04-06 16:30:51 -0400] corp: i just found it, but after a lot of clicking around
[2012-04-06 16:31:11 -0400] corp: just saying, it would be nice to know if there's a doc that tells me where to find that
[2012-04-06 16:31:40 -0400] corp: googling around or searching on the help pages didnt reveal that the knife config is in the 'organizations' section
[2012-04-06 16:31:53 -0400] jtimberman: ah
[2012-04-06 16:32:11 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2012-04-06 16:32:22 -0400] corp: are there plans to update the hosted chef ui ever?
[2012-04-06 16:32:33 -0400] jtimberman: yes
[2012-04-06 16:32:41 -0400] jtimberman: active work on that currently, iirc.
[2012-04-06 16:32:45 -0400] corp: it's pretty bad
[2012-04-06 16:33:06 -0400] jtimberman: near term it will level up for the reporting stuff that Cb mentioned on the mailing list thread the other day.
[2012-04-06 16:33:18 -0400] corp: surely the 20mil investment can go into a designer :)
[2012-04-06 16:34:06 -0400] jtimberman: we have one :D
[2012-04-06 16:36:54 -0400] chip-: Emoticons: Thinly veiling subtle knives since 1963.
[2012-04-06 16:37:02 -0400] jtimberman: hehehehe
[2012-04-06 16:53:43 -0400] afallows: So, when chef-server is running, should I expect to have about a dozen rabbitmq Erlang processes running at once?
[2012-04-06 16:55:19 -0400] cwj: a dozen seems high
[2012-04-06 16:57:14 -0400] afallows: I've been having issues with getting solr to behave - could it be that rabbitmq processes are sticking aorund because solr isn't managing something properly?
[2012-04-06 16:57:24 -0400] afallows: Or am I misunderstanding the architecture?
[2012-04-06 16:57:52 -0400] corp: anyone using the bluepill_service lwrp?
[2012-04-06 16:58:25 -0400] rayrod2030: I'm trying to pass default input to a bash script using echo but it's not working.  Is that the right way to approach that?
[2012-04-06 16:58:28 -0400] corp: i don't understand how the 'enable' action works, since all it does is link into /etc/init.d
[2012-04-06 16:58:47 -0400] rayrod2030: echo "yes" | sudo sh myscript
[2012-04-06 16:59:05 -0400] mahrtian: has anybody run into issues of runit services orphaning the processes they supervise?
[2012-04-06 17:01:08 -0400] corp: i think it also needs to handle the update-rc.d step
[2012-04-06 17:05:39 -0400] corp: jtimberman: what do you think?
[2012-04-06 17:08:32 -0400] jtimberman: corp: i think the "bluepill" recipe itself handles that for starting bluepill doesn' it?
[2012-04-06 17:09:18 -0400] corp: jtimberman: where?
[2012-04-06 17:09:44 -0400] corp: nothing in the bluepill recipe
[2012-04-06 17:10:43 -0400] corp: sysv-rc-conf --list doesnt show any of the services actually enabled
[2012-04-06 17:10:57 -0400] corp: linking in to /etc/init.d is only the first step
[2012-04-06 17:11:36 -0400] corp: guessing just nobody uses this feature
[2012-04-06 17:12:00 -0400] corp: the provider only needs to handle the init link, and then regular 'service' could be used
[2012-04-06 17:12:57 -0400] corp: so i think the provider is overkill here
[2012-04-06 17:16:17 -0400] bhunter: what's the best (most stable) distro to run chef-server on ?    alternatively - is it public knowledge what distro opscode uses themselves for hosted chef and/or private chef?
[2012-04-06 17:17:03 -0400] bhunter: or is it really just a personal decision?
[2012-04-06 17:18:29 -0400] bhunter: ie, my couchdb keeps crashing on centos 6.2 and I haven't debugged it yet
[2012-04-06 17:22:22 -0400] jtimberman: bhunter: we use Ubuntu 10.04 for Hosted Chef
[2012-04-06 17:22:27 -0400] cwj: bhunter: i believe chef-server is most heavily tested on ubuntu, but that may be changing in light of the upcoming omnibus installer release
[2012-04-06 17:22:45 -0400] jtimberman: bhunter: Private Chef is supported on RHEL/CentOS 6.2 and Ubuntu 10.04.
[2012-04-06 17:25:06 -0400] afallows: jtimberman: Are there any known issues for newer Ubuntu versinos, or is it just not fully tested?
[2012-04-06 17:25:40 -0400] jtimberman: afallows: for Private Chef?
[2012-04-06 17:25:45 -0400] afallows: Yessir
[2012-04-06 17:26:04 -0400] jtimberman: afallows: I don't know.
[2012-04-06 17:26:11 -0400] afallows: Fair enough
[2012-04-06 17:26:53 -0400] jtimberman: i think we've had more installations on RHEL/Cent
[2012-04-06 17:27:00 -0400] jtimberman: but thats speculation, I haven't been involved w/ that.
[2012-04-06 17:29:05 -0400] afallows: Does rabbitmq have a lot of work to do the first time it runs on a clean install of chef-server?
[2012-04-06 17:29:40 -0400] jtimberman: afallows: no, it only "does work" when objects are added to the server for search. like when creating a new role or a node.
[2012-04-06 17:31:59 -0400] afallows: Okay - well, I just discovered that solr hadn't been running because apparently Java didn't get installed properly, so I installed it and restarted everything. Now I have a rabbitmq process using 100% CPU and 25% RAM. I only have a small number of nodes and recipes, it seems like it's working pretty hard.
[2012-04-06 17:43:54 -0400] rocket: does anyone know why couchdb would seem to just go away .. it seems after a little bit the process just dies
[2012-04-06 17:44:13 -0400] rocket: I am not very familiar with debugging this component
[2012-04-06 17:44:44 -0400] rocket: the /var/log/couch/couch.log doesnt show anything that would indicate to me an error
[2012-04-06 17:47:48 -0400] rayrod2030: if I place a file in my "files" directory how do I access that file from within my recipe?
[2012-04-06 17:48:09 -0400] rayrod2030: I meant files directory within my cookbook
[2012-04-06 17:51:51 -0400] afallows: rayrod2030: Check out the cookbook_file resource.
[2012-04-06 17:52:06 -0400] rayrod2030: cool thanks

[2012-04-06 17:53:43 -0400] josephholsten: jtimberman: openldap::server starts the service before it updates the config, so a broken conf stops future converges. bug?
[2012-04-06 17:57:02 -0400] josephholsten: seems like a design choice driven by ye ole `notifies :restart, resources(:service => "slapd") ` style
[2012-04-06 18:01:17 -0400] jtimberman: josephholsten: probably a bug :)
[2012-04-06 18:01:26 -0400] jtimberman: josephholsten: that cookbook hasn't gotten love.
[2012-04-06 18:01:30 -0400] jtimberman: josephholsten: and it needs some.
[2012-04-06 18:01:48 -0400] josephholsten: that's my job. loving things no parent could.
[2012-04-06 18:01:53 -0400] jtimberman: it would be A+ nice to have the LDAP-ified config
[2012-04-06 18:02:01 -0400] jtimberman: i think ubuntu karmic moved to that
[2012-04-06 18:02:06 -0400] jtimberman: instead of the .conf files
[2012-04-06 18:02:12 -0400] josephholsten: see also windows support in cookbooks
[2012-04-06 18:02:22 -0400] rocket: jtimberman: have you ever seen a case of the couchdb just disappearing from the processlist?
[2012-04-06 18:02:53 -0400] jtimberman: rocket: not off hand
[2012-04-06 18:03:18 -0400] rocket: odd then .. I wonder if I have a buggy version of couch or erlang installed .. :/
[2012-04-06 18:05:09 -0400] cb_: hello
[2012-04-06 18:05:53 -0400] cb_: anyone here?
[2012-04-06 18:07:08 -0400] jtimberman: 361 people here. :)
[2012-04-06 18:08:11 -0400] _smith3v_: guys, where can I find best practices on cookbook debugging? Lost another day before found that not_it conditions are being evaluated while converge and I cannot use them in a loop :-/
[2012-04-06 18:13:04 -0400] |shad0w|: _smith3v_, example code of what your loop looked like?
[2012-04-06 18:14:22 -0400] smith3v_mob: A bit later, have to lool kid
[2012-04-06 18:15:25 -0400] smith3v_mob: *lull
[2012-04-06 18:30:55 -0400] jperry: @jtimberman - Thanks for the response, just got it
[2012-04-06 18:50:33 -0400] _smith3v_: <|shad0w|> check out http://pastebin.com/HqzPLYp2
[2012-04-06 18:51:54 -0400] _smith3v_: <|shad0w|> dpkg_package is used to install the solr package into several directories
[2012-04-06 18:53:33 -0400] _smith3v_: <|shad0w|> on each iteration  not_if will test /mnt/solr/1/Makefile , and the second package will not be installed
[2012-04-06 18:55:33 -0400] _smith3v_: <|shad0w|> as far as I see chef evaluate  "#{dest}/Makefile" on the convergence  stage.
[2012-04-06 18:56:59 -0400] |shad0w|: the probablem there is that the package resource for "solr" is likely to only trigger once
[2012-04-06 18:57:43 -0400] |shad0w|: does dpkg_package allow you to override the pacakage name inside the resource
[2012-04-06 18:59:48 -0400] _smith3v_: I'm not overriding the package name. The --instdir is the only parameter, that is being changed
[2012-04-06 19:00:04 -0400] |shad0w|: yes, but you've already defined a resource for package "solr"
[2012-04-06 19:00:08 -0400] |shad0w|: one sec
[2012-04-06 19:00:40 -0400] _smith3v_: hmm, it makes sense
[2012-04-06 19:01:11 -0400] |shad0w|: this _might_ work
[2012-04-06 19:01:12 -0400] |shad0w|: https://gist.github.com/2322084
[2012-04-06 19:03:21 -0400] _smith3v_: I've found the following solution http://pastebin.com/6jsP70pn
[2012-04-06 19:03:40 -0400] |shad0w|: you
[2012-04-06 19:03:47 -0400] |shad0w|: you'll likely run into the same issue
[2012-04-06 19:04:11 -0400] _smith3v_: but it works
[2012-04-06 19:04:25 -0400] _smith3v_: :)
[2012-04-06 19:04:55 -0400] |shad0w|: start fresh and see if anything but your first instance gets installed
[2012-04-06 19:06:36 -0400] _smith3v_: I've already tested it. Anyway your solution is more clear. I'm going to test it and use it, if it works.
[2012-04-06 19:07:26 -0400] _smith3v_: thanks :)
[2012-04-06 19:07:33 -0400] |shad0w|: np
[2012-04-06 19:33:21 -0400] afallows: Can the cron resource be used to install an @reboot job?
[2012-04-06 20:18:12 -0400] geekbri: afallows: no.
[2012-04-06 20:18:25 -0400] geekbri: afallows: there is an open ticket with chef to make it so it supports strings, but it doesn't yet.
[2012-04-06 20:24:02 -0400] afallows: geekbri: Roger, thanks for the heads-up.
[2012-04-06 21:04:21 -0400] David_Miller: I think I see an issue with the resources documentation
[2012-04-06 21:04:40 -0400] David_Miller: I have been using 'creates' in a script resource
[2012-04-06 21:05:20 -0400] David_Miller: seems to work OK, but the resources page doesn't list 'creates' as a valid attribute
[2012-04-06 21:23:55 -0400] jtimberman: David_Miller: creates comes from the execute resource which the script resource inherits. it is a file that will be created and if it exists, the provider takes no action (doesn't run the script/command)
[2012-04-06 22:08:42 -0400] tortoise_: im trying to add a Role inside of a Role, and it doesnt seem like that very much.. I can add it and it doesnt complain but the role's runlist doesnt expand.. any ideas?
[2012-04-06 22:10:03 -0400] cwj: tortoise_: gist the roles?
[2012-04-06 22:42:06 -0400] TrevorBramble: Having a terribly time trying to get rvm installed via chef-solo. Help? https://gist.github.com/2323622
[2012-04-06 22:42:27 -0400] TrevorBramble: If I execute the bash line it's allegedly getting a non-zero exit code from, it runs cleanly.
[2012-04-06 22:50:49 -0400] cwj: TrevorBramble: bash and execute resources don't get the same environment that commands get when you run them from a shell
[2012-04-06 22:51:06 -0400] cwj: because they never source your .bash_profile, .bashrc or whatever
[2012-04-06 22:51:26 -0400] TrevorBramble: Sure. That's as close as I can get to testing the operation outside the Chef run though.
[2012-04-06 22:52:27 -0400] cwj: if you run chef-solo with -l debug you will see more output from the exec
[2012-04-06 22:52:41 -0400] cwj: will probably give you more insight into why it is failing
[2012-04-06 22:52:42 -0400] TrevorBramble: I suspect curl's progress output is the problem but whether it's -s or --silent or piping output to /dev/null it always shows up.
[2012-04-06 22:52:56 -0400] TrevorBramble: Ah, will try that.
[2012-04-06 22:54:56 -0400] TrevorBramble: cwj: Thanks for the tip
[2012-04-06 23:01:19 -0400] bitprophet: I'd be surprised if it was just the presence of stderr causing the problem
[2012-04-06 23:02:26 -0400] bitprophet: question of my own: want to create groups and users, with some users belonging to >1 group. can't create groups first because it'll die if any of its members() don't exist. Likewise, the users can't be created first if their primary group ID doesn't exist.
[2012-04-06 23:02:49 -0400] bitprophet: The sol'n I found is to define groups twice, first with no members(), then define users, then define the groups again, but with members().
[2012-04-06 23:02:56 -0400] bitprophet: Seems to work; curious if there's a better or more compact way.
