[2012-04-23 22:26:28 -0400] caspyin: im going over the authentication section in the wiki now
[2012-04-23 22:27:19 -0400] cwj: i wish i could reliably reproduce this 400 on node.save so i could open a ticket
[2012-04-23 22:30:35 -0400] ravaa: well, looks like a full on manual install is the only way to get chef-server reliablly installed on ubuntu 11.x
[2012-04-23 22:30:46 -0400] ravaa: bootstrap attempt failed miserably
[2012-04-23 22:32:56 -0400] caspyin: ravaa: Im seeing a lot of explaination of what authentication and authorization is but not how to register a client
[2012-04-23 22:34:12 -0400] ravaa: client or node?
[2012-04-23 22:34:24 -0400] ravaa: client = something making api requests against server
[2012-04-23 22:34:30 -0400] ravaa: node = server
[2012-04-23 22:34:36 -0400] caspyin: client
[2012-04-23 22:34:46 -0400] ravaa: chef-client or knife?
[2012-04-23 22:34:57 -0400] caspyin: knife
[2012-04-23 22:35:51 -0400] coderanger: FOSS server or hosted?
[2012-04-23 22:36:01 -0400] caspyin: hosted
[2012-04-23 22:36:02 -0400] bemu: ravaa: We bootstrap, both using the stock one and a custom one. I doubt that statement is true.
[2012-04-23 22:36:37 -0400] ravaa: bemu: got a doc to point at with steps? because i'm following the official wiki for both trying to install via apt and chef-solo
[2012-04-23 22:36:43 -0400] coderanger: caspyin: You can reset your user key (and therefore redownload it) at https://www.opscode.com/account/password
[2012-04-23 22:36:45 -0400] ravaa: bemu: on fresh vms
[2012-04-23 22:36:51 -0400] coderanger: and oh look, more CSS errors
[2012-04-23 22:37:32 -0400] bemu: ravaa: I don't, really. The official docs are what I learned from. I don't do anything special there. We use a custom bootstrap mostly now because it uses omnibus packages.
[2012-04-23 22:37:34 -0400] ravaa: bemu: so if you have some tried and true "this works" steps i can gander at, i'd love to see them. doing this install manually is a pita and i've wasted half the day already
[2012-04-23 22:37:38 -0400] caspyin: I'm able to create both the node and the client at the same time using knife - so I think that means the org-validator.pem is working
[2012-04-23 22:37:50 -0400] bemu: But if you gist your problems, people might help.
[2012-04-23 22:38:07 -0400] ravaa: bemu: there are quite a few gists of these issues already
[2012-04-23 22:38:15 -0400] caspyin: what i cant do is have an pre-existing node and then use knife to provision a new server using it
[2012-04-23 22:38:39 -0400] caspyin: maybe Im misunderstanding some basics here though.
[2012-04-23 22:38:41 -0400] bemu: oh, you're talking about the server.
[2012-04-23 22:38:48 -0400] ravaa: yes
[2012-04-23 22:38:53 -0400] bemu: I can't help there, I don't run a server.
[2012-04-23 22:39:01 -0400] ravaa: the chef package installs just fine
[2012-04-23 22:39:02 -0400] bemu: I would strongly encourage you to check out platform.
[2012-04-23 22:39:33 -0400] bemu: Unless you have many hundreds or thousands of nodes, or have significant security concerns, your ROI is going to be much better using platform.
[2012-04-23 22:40:06 -0400] ravaa: bemu: security reasons say no
[2012-04-23 22:40:14 -0400] bemu: ah, gotcha.
[2012-04-23 22:40:24 -0400] bemu: Sorry I can't help more, good luck!
[2012-04-23 22:40:29 -0400] ravaa: trust me, if i had a choice...
[2012-04-23 22:40:44 -0400] bemu: I have run servers in the past, but it was a while ago.
[2012-04-23 22:41:06 -0400] ravaa: its hella frustrating as i did an explore run of all this last month and it all worked splendidly
[2012-04-23 22:42:08 -0400] coderanger: caspyin: Generally nodes create themselves
[2012-04-23 22:43:53 -0400] caspyin: coderanger: oh. I thought once I had a node I could use it to provision a server (knife rackspace server create -N node_name)
[2012-04-23 22:44:18 -0400] coderanger: Yes, in that case the node creates itself via the validation cert :)
[2012-04-23 22:45:39 -0400] caspyin: so do people just stick with roles and recipes to provision their servers? not worrying about the nodes and clients?
[2012-04-23 22:46:16 -0400] coderanger: caspyin: clients are an API usage thing, not really related to provisioning
[2012-04-23 22:46:28 -0400] coderanger: not sure about the rest of the question
[2012-04-23 22:47:38 -0400] caspyin: I guess what I'm really trying to figure out is how do people provision a server based off of a predefinded configuration?
[2012-04-23 22:48:05 -0400] caspyin: currently I can only get that by creating roles on my hosted server that define what I want
[2012-04-23 22:48:20 -0400] caspyin: then I use knife to provision using that role
[2012-04-23 22:48:56 -0400] caspyin: but if I needed a few different roles plus recipes I would have to remember that when I enter on the command line
[2012-04-23 22:49:06 -0400] coderanger: caspyin: Yeah, don't do that :)
[2012-04-23 22:49:23 -0400] coderanger: Basically each server should have everything in roles, and generally no more than a handful
[2012-04-23 22:49:42 -0400] coderanger: doing stuff like manually tweaking recipes on a node encourages special snowflakes
[2012-04-23 22:49:45 -0400] coderanger: and those are the enemy
[2012-04-23 22:49:58 -0400] caspyin: so is there no way for me to have that predefined configuration stored? (i thought a node did that for me)
[2012-04-23 22:50:12 -0400] coderanger: what predefined config?
[2012-04-23 22:50:32 -0400] caspyin: sure. that makes sense but what I"m doing is I have a blog role that uses the wordpress cookbook
[2012-04-23 22:50:36 -0400] coderanger: Usually our servers have exactly two roles, role[base] and role[$server-type]
[2012-04-23 22:50:54 -0400] coderanger: And even that could be reduced to just the latter
[2012-04-23 22:51:02 -0400] caspyin: and when you want to spin one up you have to use knife to specify those each time?
[2012-04-23 22:51:24 -0400] coderanger: Specify the roles? Yes, that is how you would do it wil knife
[2012-04-23 22:51:33 -0400] coderanger: if you want something higher-level, check out spiceweasel
[2012-04-23 22:52:05 -0400] caspyin: okay. no i don't want something higher level. I just wanted to understand that better.
[2012-04-23 22:52:32 -0400] coderanger: spiceweasel lets you keep a config file that documents what roles go where and how many of each you have
[2012-04-23 22:52:49 -0400] coderanger: but yeah, the info about how to run a specific service goes in the role
[2012-04-23 22:52:53 -0400] caspyin: so i'm doing the same thing you are. each time I want a server i specify role[base], role[blog] in my runlist with knife
[2012-04-23 22:53:02 -0400] coderanger: Yes
[2012-04-23 22:53:12 -0400] coderanger: I think the source of your confusion might be about the mapping nodes
[2012-04-23 22:53:19 -0400] coderanger: nodes represent a single server
[2012-04-23 22:53:22 -0400] coderanger: not a template for a server
[2012-04-23 22:53:48 -0400] caspyin: that is exactly what I thought a node was, thanks for clearing that
[2012-04-23 22:53:59 -0400] caspyin: I thought the client represented the single server
[2012-04-23 22:54:08 -0400] coderanger: ahh, no
[2012-04-23 22:54:21 -0400] coderanger: client is just something that controls access to the API
[2012-04-23 22:54:50 -0400] coderanger: In general every node is matched to a client of the same name
[2012-04-23 22:55:02 -0400] coderanger: but some clients (like your client you use for knife) doesn't map to a node
[2012-04-23 22:55:15 -0400] miah: walks are awesome
[2012-04-23 22:55:17 -0400] miah: AWESOME
[2012-04-23 22:55:23 -0400] coderanger: (and in rare cases you have nodes for something like a router or switch that don't have an attached client)
[2012-04-23 22:55:27 -0400] caspyin: okay. that is making a lot more sense
[2012-04-23 22:55:45 -0400] coderanger: miah: They really are, I've gotten in a habit of a 30 minute walk around my block every day after work :)
[2012-04-23 22:56:05 -0400] caspyin: coderanger: thanks so much for the clarity
[2012-04-23 22:56:17 -0400] coderanger: No problem, if you have any other questions feel free to ask :)
[2012-04-23 22:56:35 -0400] miah: we go for walks multiple times each day
[2012-04-23 22:57:18 -0400] coderanger: we == gf or pet? :P
[2012-04-23 22:57:32 -0400] miah: gf
[2012-04-23 22:57:36 -0400] miah: my cats don't like going for walks
[2012-04-23 22:57:46 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, that was going to be my next question :)
[2012-04-23 22:58:02 -0400] coderanger: then you had to go and spoil it!
[2012-04-23 23:00:03 -0400] miah:  i got a harness for them
[2012-04-23 23:00:08 -0400] miah: but when i take them out they get really upset
[2012-04-23 23:03:29 -0400] senthilr: them == gf or pet
[2012-04-23 23:03:34 -0400] senthilr: :)
[2012-04-23 23:04:10 -0400] miah: my cats are old and stuck in their ways
[2012-04-23 23:05:12 -0400] Brad_K: saddle, bridle, and bit, too?  ;-)
[2012-04-23 23:05:13 -0400] miah: brad_k, i will note. we live in san francisco.
[2012-04-23 23:05:24 -0400] Brad_K: where in sf?
[2012-04-23 23:06:00 -0400] miah: richmond district
[2012-04-23 23:06:10 -0400] Brad_K: and perhaps then you could answer a question  is "castro city" the same area that i've heard of being called "the castro"?
[2012-04-23 23:06:38 -0400] miah: it is not
[2012-04-23 23:06:51 -0400] Brad_K: ahh, okay.
[2012-04-23 23:07:05 -0400] miah: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castro_district / http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California
[2012-04-23 23:07:33 -0400] Brad_K: ahh, so Richmond District is close to the Golden Gate Bridge?  cool!
[2012-04-23 23:08:07 -0400] miah: well, richmond district is much closer
[2012-04-23 23:08:19 -0400] miah: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_District,_San_Francisco,_California
[2012-04-23 23:10:32 -0400] bemu: I've never heard it referred to as Richmond District, rather, The Richmond.
[2012-04-23 23:12:13 -0400] bemu: But I'm an SF noob, so all in favor of gf harnesses. Tethers are good too, don't want them leaving the kitchen
[2012-04-23 23:12:27 -0400] coderanger: SFBA folks are fans of confusing names
[2012-04-23 23:12:35 -0400] coderanger: Richmond is also the name of a city in the east bay
[2012-04-23 23:12:47 -0400] Brad_K: miah & bemu so, if someone wanted to live reasonably close to cupertino, what areas would you recommend?
[2012-04-23 23:12:49 -0400] miah: well, it is The Richmond. but out of towners get The Richmond, and Richmond, confused =)
[2012-04-23 23:12:58 -0400] miah: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_California
[2012-04-23 23:13:14 -0400] bemu: Brad_K: Not. :) I would recommend living in SF!
[2012-04-23 23:13:16 -0400] Brad_K: oh, there are many Richmond's.  Richmond, VA  for example.  there are probably almost as many Richmonds as there are Springfields.
[2012-04-23 23:13:17 -0400] coderanger: Brad_K: Sunnyvale is okay and not too expensive
[2012-04-23 23:13:27 -0400] miah: In March 2010, #3 Most Dangerous City - Richmond, California The second California city in the top ten list of most dangerous cities in the United States ranks as number 3 in terms of auto theft and terms of murders.
[2012-04-23 23:13:29 -0400] otterley: anyone ever built role definitions that inherit from other role defintions?
[2012-04-23 23:13:44 -0400] bemu: (I don't really know the south bay very well, but most of it is pretty nice. San Jose can get pretty rowdy)
[2012-04-23 23:13:47 -0400] coderanger: otterley: Frequently :)
[2012-04-23 23:13:47 -0400] Brad_K: otterley: almost all my roles do that.
[2012-04-23 23:13:57 -0400] otterley: how can one implement that?
[2012-04-23 23:13:57 -0400] coderanger: bemu: Rowdy? :P
[2012-04-23 23:14:04 -0400] bemu: Yeah, tons of college kids.
[2012-04-23 23:14:07 -0400] coderanger: otterley: put role[foo] in the run list
[2012-04-23 23:14:10 -0400] otterley: no no no
[2012-04-23 23:14:18 -0400] otterley: not like that :)
[2012-04-23 23:14:18 -0400] bemu: Not lots of crime rowdy, just loud rowdy.
[2012-04-23 23:14:23 -0400] miah: i dont like living where a car is required. thus, san jose is not for me.
[2012-04-23 23:14:25 -0400] otterley: that's not real inheritance
[2012-04-23 23:14:25 -0400] Brad_K: i test out new code in roles, and then when i'm ready to roll them out, i put them into one of the other roles that i'm already using.
[2012-04-23 23:14:32 -0400] coderanger: bemu: Depends on where you are, on my side of the city it is quiet :)
[2012-04-23 23:14:39 -0400] coderanger: otterley: What do you mean then?
[2012-04-23 23:15:01 -0400] miah: i <3 my place though. i have a nice backyard and can definitely bbq at home
[2012-04-23 23:15:13 -0400] miah: also huge kitchen with gas stove (my gf and i are food nerds)
[2012-04-23 23:15:28 -0400] coderanger: miah: /me jealouses at you
[2012-04-23 23:15:35 -0400] otterley: for example, I have a production role that contains some defaults, and a datacenter-specific production role that contains other defaults that could override those - I want the datacenter-specific role to automatically include the default_attributes from the base production role, without a node having to specifically refer to the base production role
[2012-04-23 23:15:39 -0400] coderanger: I would kill a man for a good range and a real panty
[2012-04-23 23:15:40 -0400] miah: when i was in high school i went to a charter school that was all about hospitality sciences. i wanted to go into the culinary industry.
[2012-04-23 23:15:48 -0400] miah: so its kind of awesome that i'm still a chef ;)
[2012-04-23 23:15:49 -0400] Brad_K: miah: i'm with you.  where we lived in Brussels, you could get a lot of things done just by walking down the street.  but if i do wind up out there, then i have to keep my commute to a reasonable level.
[2012-04-23 23:16:06 -0400] coderanger: otterley: Yes, just include the base role in the runlist of the specific one
[2012-04-23 23:16:07 -0400] Brad_K: and that would mean that I couldn't live in some place like The Castro, or The Richmond.
[2012-04-23 23:16:08 -0400] miah: i live in this little asian community in the richmond
[2012-04-23 23:16:17 -0400] miah: so we have lots of walkable grocery stores
[2012-04-23 23:16:17 -0400] otterley: coderanger, you can put roles in run_lists ?
[2012-04-23 23:16:21 -0400] coderanger: otterley: Yes
[2012-04-23 23:16:26 -0400] otterley: oh, sweet.  problem solved :)
[2012-04-23 23:16:28 -0400] coderanger: otterley: run lists are expanded recursively
[2012-04-23 23:16:36 -0400] otterley: thanks!
[2012-04-23 23:17:17 -0400] bemu: I have a really large place for the money, but I also heard gunshots last night that were way too close.
[2012-04-23 23:17:47 -0400] coderanger: bemu: Tenderloin?</troll>
[2012-04-23 23:17:57 -0400] bemu: :P Ingleside.
[2012-04-23 23:18:13 -0400] Brad_K: and neither of those names mean anything to me.
[2012-04-23 23:18:41 -0400] coderanger: Brad_K: tenderloin is a very high-crime, effective slum in SF
[2012-04-23 23:18:53 -0400] coderanger: cheap as hell though, as you might imagine
[2012-04-23 23:19:03 -0400] miah: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenderloin,_San_Francisco
[2012-04-23 23:19:18 -0400] miah: i bet i pay less in my neighborhood than many do in tenderloin / union square area
[2012-04-23 23:19:29 -0400] coderanger: Brad_K: http://burritojustice.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/islands-of-san-francisco-v10-72.jpg
[2012-04-23 23:19:30 -0400] Brad_K: probably not cheap enough to bring it down to the same rates that would be paid in some of the better places here in Austin, though.  ;-(
[2012-04-23 23:19:35 -0400] coderanger: Thats a good map of the area
[2012-04-23 23:20:19 -0400] miah: my gf lives with me, and we have a single roommate. we have a 4 bedroom victorian. the entire second floor. its 4 bedrooms. i have two, and so does my roommate. we pay $2000/mo. gas stove, huge backyard/kitchen. we have a washer/dryer in our apartment.
[2012-04-23 23:20:23 -0400] miah: =)
[2012-04-23 23:20:50 -0400] coderanger: o_O
[2012-04-23 23:22:16 -0400] bemu: That's a really good deal. $2000 total, right?
[2012-04-23 23:22:32 -0400] miah: yes
[2012-04-23 23:22:37 -0400] miah: i pay $1000
[2012-04-23 23:22:41 -0400] bemu: That's super good.
[2012-04-23 23:22:43 -0400] miah: my roommate and i split it
[2012-04-23 23:22:44 -0400] miah: yup
[2012-04-23 23:23:14 -0400] otterley: I work in the Tenderloin
[2012-04-23 23:23:23 -0400] otterley: access to crack has never been easier!
[2012-04-23 23:23:25 -0400] bemu: I pay a bit more and have a bit more room, garage, private back yard, single-family house, but worse location.
[2012-04-23 23:23:26 -0400] erikh: come to menlo park if you want high prices
[2012-04-23 23:23:28 -0400] bemu: :)
[2012-04-23 23:23:34 -0400] erikh: can't wait to get out of this lease.
[2012-04-23 23:23:37 -0400] miah: ouch
[2012-04-23 23:23:39 -0400] miah: bemu: nice
[2012-04-23 23:23:42 -0400] miah: i used to have that
[2012-04-23 23:24:01 -0400] miah: when i lived in texas. but i really <3 the neighborhood i am in
[2012-04-23 23:25:17 -0400] miah: tonight is scary movie night
[2012-04-23 23:25:22 -0400] miah: we are going to go see Cabin in the Woods
[2012-04-23 23:25:25 -0400] miah: i hope its not super lames
[2012-04-23 23:25:38 -0400] miah: (what thi shas to do with chef, i dont know. other than i <3 chef)
[2012-04-23 23:26:08 -0400] erikh: #offchef
[2012-04-23 23:26:11 -0400] erikh: :P
[2012-04-23 23:27:08 -0400] coderanger: miah: It is good, but definitely not scary
[2012-04-23 23:27:16 -0400] coderanger: unless you have never seen a movie before
[2012-04-23 23:29:24 -0400] c_t: maybe I'm thinking of something totally different, but I thought that was some arty kids movie
[2012-04-23 23:30:37 -0400] coderanger: It is nominally a horror movie, there are technically zombies in it
[2012-04-23 23:30:45 -0400] erikh: blair witch?
[2012-04-23 23:30:58 -0400] c_t: hmm, I'm thinking of something completely different
[2012-04-23 23:31:08 -0400] c_t: I think it involves a snowman, and may be French
[2012-04-23 23:31:29 -0400] ravaa: ugh..WHY? why would the chef-server init scripts overwrite the PATH environment variable entirely instead of appending needed paths to it?
[2012-04-23 23:33:39 -0400] coderanger: ravaa: Are you using omnibus?
[2012-04-23 23:33:45 -0400] coderanger: er no, that isn't out yet
[2012-04-23 23:34:02 -0400] jtimberman: ravaa: common practice for debian/ubuntu packaging included init scripts is to set $PATH
[2012-04-23 23:34:10 -0400] apolishch: nope 10.04 gives me the same rabbitmq error
[2012-04-23 23:34:17 -0400] apolishch: might it be a virtualbox thing?
[2012-04-23 23:34:32 -0400] ravaa: this line in /etc/init.d/chef-server:  24: test -x $DAEMON || exit 0  makes no sense. fail silently if the binary isn't found or executable
[2012-04-23 23:35:38 -0400] jtimberman: re init script PATH, it is due to this in debian packaging policy: http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#s9.9
[2012-04-23 23:36:15 -0400] ravaa: i stand corrected in my angst :)
[2012-04-23 23:36:19 -0400] ssd7: ravaa: While I agree it isn't great, I think that if you check out the skeleton init script in debian/ubuntu you'll see the same thing
[2012-04-23 23:36:28 -0400] ssd7: that is re the test -x
[2012-04-23 23:37:46 -0400] jtimberman: ssd7: I believe that is also correct, but it was what, almost 3 years since i made those packages :)
[2012-04-23 23:38:31 -0400] ravaa: jtimberman: any idea what pukes the package from creating the validation and client keys on ubuntu 11.x ?
[2012-04-23 23:38:51 -0400] ravaa: it actually worked a month or so back, but for the past week at least it's puked every time
[2012-04-23 23:40:06 -0400] otterley: what does anyone care what PATH is set to before launching chef-server ?
[2012-04-23 23:40:57 -0400] ravaa: if the path isn't set to a path the binary exists in, there's no starting of chef-server. so anyone that wants to start it cares
[2012-04-23 23:41:56 -0400] otterley: but if the package containing chef-server is installing the initscript, presumably the binary is in a place referenced by the initscript, no?
[2012-04-23 23:42:10 -0400] otterley: at least, that's usually the case for packages :)
[2012-04-23 23:42:12 -0400] ravaa: presumably, factually.. its not been the case today
[2012-04-23 23:42:21 -0400] ravaa: at least for the chef-server packages
[2012-04-23 23:42:44 -0400] ravaa: the chef-server packages installed to /usr/sbin/chef-*
[2012-04-23 23:42:58 -0400] ravaa: the chef-server packages installed to /usr/bin/chef-*
[2012-04-23 23:42:58 -0400] otterley: usually initscripts call the binary directly using an absolute pathname
[2012-04-23 23:43:08 -0400] otterley: rather than relying on PATH
[2012-04-23 23:44:28 -0400] otterley: otherwise there's a possibility that another package could insert a binary with the same name earlier in the PATH and Bad Things could happen
[2012-04-23 23:45:05 -0400] ravaa: otterley: now if only the package init scripts actually did that..
[2012-04-23 23:45:29 -0400] w3rd_: hey folks, using ohai to report state info local, not via chef, was wondering if there was a plugin of sorts that might allow for the data to populate via html or would this be something i would have to write?
[2012-04-23 23:46:38 -0400] ravaa: how can i force chef-server to create the validation and client keys?
[2012-04-23 23:51:19 -0400] coderanger: w3rd_: Can you rephrase that, I think you missed some words
[2012-04-23 23:51:30 -0400] coderanger: ravaa: Delete the validation client and restart the server
[2012-04-23 23:51:40 -0400] ravaa:  coderanger: tried that
[2012-04-23 23:51:41 -0400] coderanger: it will recreate it automatically
[2012-04-23 23:51:49 -0400] ravaa: coderanger: it didn't create them in the first place after install
[2012-04-23 23:51:55 -0400] coderanger: Is it in the DB?
[2012-04-23 23:52:46 -0400] Brad_K: ravaa: maybe you have an ownership/permissions problem?  i've seen some people having problems with the os-standard log rotation scripts that muck things up with regards to ownership/permissions thus causing chef to not properly start/restart.
[2012-04-23 23:53:52 -0400] ravaa: node idea, none of the ways (manually + chef_solo [since chef_solo pukes at trying to find chef-solr somewhere before it does installations], manually with just rubygems, and finally with the apt repo) ended up with keys being created
[2012-04-23 23:53:55 -0400] w3rd_: coderanger: Im interested to take the ohai output and patch the data to html, so this data can be viewed in a browser.. is this even possible with ohai?
[2012-04-23 23:53:59 -0400] ravaa: ~node = node
[2012-04-23 23:54:14 -0400] ravaa: damni...node = no
[2012-04-23 23:54:44 -0400] coderanger: w3rd_: Sure, just grab whichever API bindings you prefer (Ruby, Python, Java, PHP) and write a web frontend that uses the data from chef server
[2012-04-23 23:55:27 -0400] w3rd_: ok. thats what i was wondering, rather there is a module or its a custom thing to write frontend??
[2012-04-23 23:56:03 -0400] ravaa: Brad_K: everything was run as root directly as opposed to sudo. since the install failed to create the keys with sudo permissions was my next thought.
[2012-04-23 23:56:06 -0400] Brad_K: w3rd_: patch the data?  i'm not sure what that is supposed to mean.  however, the data discovered by ohai is stored in the node object, and it's easy enough to write a script to go through all the data in the node object and output that to whatever format you want.  heck, the "knife" command can dump all the contents of the node object in either text or JSON format, which could easily enough be massaged.
[2012-04-23 23:57:04 -0400] coderanger: w3rd_: Chef is just an API at heart
[2012-04-23 23:57:05 -0400] Brad_K: w3rd_: no module or custom thing to write a front end, not so far as i know.  you're welcome to create such a tool and contribute that back to the community, however.
[2012-04-23 23:57:10 -0400] coderanger: you can do whatever you want with the data
[2012-04-23 23:57:29 -0400] w3rd_: cool, just wanted to make sure before i start pluggin away
[2012-04-23 23:57:36 -0400] w3rd_: thanks for the direction folks
[2012-04-23 23:57:44 -0400] coderanger: What language do you work in?
[2012-04-23 23:57:47 -0400] w3rd_: new to chef / ohai
[2012-04-23 23:57:56 -0400] w3rd_: well, im familiar with ruby
[2012-04-23 23:57:59 -0400] mhalligan: is there some magic to re-populating an empty solr database?
[2012-04-23 23:58:06 -0400] mhalligan:  I thought that the mere act of running chef-client would do so
[2012-04-23 23:58:09 -0400] w3rd_: and a few others
[2012-04-23 23:58:10 -0400] mhalligan: but that doesn't appear to be the case
[2012-04-23 23:58:12 -0400] Brad_K: w3rd_: ohai really isn't a tool that is expected to be used much outside of chef itself.
[2012-04-23 23:58:21 -0400] w3rd_: right thats what i thought
[2012-04-23 23:58:29 -0400] mhalligan: knife index rebuild doesn't return an error but knife search now returns no results for any query
[2012-04-23 23:58:31 -0400] w3rd_: i just was thinking that maybe i could dual purpose the output
[2012-04-23 23:58:56 -0400] Brad_K: w3rd_: for the most part, ohai expects to be called by chef, to put the data it has discovered into the node object and save that back to the chef server, and then once that data is available on the chef server you can do whatever you want/need to do with it.
[2012-04-23 23:59:01 -0400] coderanger: w3rd_: Check out Spice then, it is a slightly nicer API binding for Ruby
[2012-04-23 23:59:13 -0400] ravaa: good luck with your endeavors everyone
[2012-04-23 23:59:29 -0400] w3rd_: ok, thanks for the advice will check into it
