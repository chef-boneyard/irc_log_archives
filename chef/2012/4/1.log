[2012-04-01 00:09:11 -0400] jkyle: ssd7: it comes from a custom ohai plugin
[2012-04-01 00:47:20 -0400] dikim33: jkyle: Kwanasolis I tried to use the hosted one and it seems to work fine with me but I found a problem with setting up chef client on my virtual machine.
[2012-04-01 00:47:21 -0400] dikim33: http://www.pastebin.ca/2134391
[2012-04-01 00:48:42 -0400] dikim33: I setup chef client in a same way as I did on a actual machine but i got the above error.
[2012-04-01 01:09:56 -0400] lflux: can anyone point me towards best practices for environments
[2012-04-01 01:10:11 -0400] lflux: like for testing cookbooks before I put them into production
[2012-04-01 01:17:41 -0400] mattdawson: is there a node attribute that contains all the recipes applied to that node?
[2012-04-01 01:54:13 -0400] z: jtimberman: Are you actively looking after the rsyslog cookbook?
[2012-04-01 01:56:44 -0400] z: jtimberman: I've just been looking at https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/rsyslog/tree/master/templates/default and whilst I've not fully tested yet, I think the lack of queues (http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/rsyslog_reliable_forwarding.html) will result in syslog() blocking in the event your remote host goes offline for any reason.
[2012-04-01 01:57:13 -0400] jtimberman: z: "actively" :)
[2012-04-01 01:57:27 -0400] jtimberman: mattdawson: "recipes'
[2012-04-01 01:57:28 -0400] z: jtimberman: Which is /probably/ not an optimal situation under the "defaults should be sane" argument.
[2012-04-01 01:57:33 -0400] jtimberman: mattdawson: as in, node['recipes']
[2012-04-01 01:57:41 -0400] jtimberman: mattdawson: that is the expanded run list for the node.
[2012-04-01 01:57:54 -0400] jtimberman: z: thats possible :)
[2012-04-01 01:57:56 -0400] mattdawson: jtimberman: awesome - thanks!
[2012-04-01 01:58:11 -0400] jtimberman: mattdawson: doesn't have the recipes from "include_recipe" statements.
[2012-04-01 01:58:13 -0400] z: jtimberman: If I get some time this weekend I'll test the failure potential and punt you a patch for the templates.
[2012-04-01 01:58:31 -0400] jtimberman: mattdawson: *during* the run that is available as node.run_state[:seen_recipes], but not automatically saved to an attribute.
[2012-04-01 01:58:34 -0400] mattdawson: jtimberman: okay - that's good to know. i actually don't need that behavior here.
[2012-04-01 02:00:40 -0400] z: jtimberman: stuff with a /me also doesn't get logged on http://community.opscode.com/chat/chef which may be intentional?  is the parser for ignoring joins/parts just too broad?
[2012-04-01 02:02:23 -0400] z: in fact. hit refresh repeatedly on http://community.opscode.com/chat/chef and you get the last line (about the /me behaviour) on 40-50% of refreshes, and not on the other 40-50%
[2012-04-01 02:02:34 -0400] z: do you have a coupel boxes behind a load balancer which are weirdly out of sync?
[2012-04-01 02:05:08 -0400] hoover_damm: z, best fire off an email about that.
[2012-04-01 02:05:38 -0400] hoover_damm: z, if you want irc logs for roughly the past several years... http://logs.likens.us
[2012-04-01 02:05:49 -0400] hoover_damm: z, I am their backfill of logs
[2012-04-01 02:06:07 -0400] shuvo__: dikim33, I guess this is an issue with using OPSCODE hosted chef with VM. I am working towards a solution to make a chef server that runs under virtualbox but need people to test it out
[2012-04-01 02:06:25 -0400] hoover_damm: and I do ignore join/parts/crap
[2012-04-01 02:06:34 -0400] hoover_damm: so as far as the backfill that is why it's omitted
[2012-04-01 02:14:12 -0400] shuvo__: Earlier in the day I was having an issue with my run_list of ["recipe[chef-server::rubygems-install]" failing with "FATAL: Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - /gems/chef-0.10.8/distro/debian/etc/init.d/chef-solr". I went about overriding node['languages']['ruby']['gems_dir'] using https://gist.github.com/7298a5f9428da39311e9 thanks to erikh. The run_list is in chef.json executed like so: "sudo chef-solo -c /etc/chef/solo.rb -j ~
[2012-04-01 02:14:19 -0400] shuvo__: All other trials of setting GEM_PATH and then executing said chef solo would fail. Example of failures: "sudo GEM_PATH=<what I want> chef-solo -c ..", "sudo bash;GEM_PATH=<what I want>;chef-solo -c ..". Is this expected to fail so?
[2012-04-01 02:26:07 -0400] dikim33: shuvo__: thanks for your input.
[2012-04-01 03:02:40 -0400] jberanek: Is there a way to build an encrypted data bag without knife?
[2012-04-01 03:12:34 -0400] erikh: shuvo__: don't mess with GEM_PATH, it's set the way it is usually for a good reason.
[2012-04-01 05:35:47 -0400] shuvo__: thanks erikh. is there a way I could write ruby code that would automagically generate the json using chef solo (like what happens in case of chef server). right now I have code that explicitly writes the json which is loaded by solo
[2012-04-01 07:00:52 -0400] ssd7: libguestfs is rocking my world at them moment. That is all.
[2012-04-01 08:05:07 -0400] Babar: jtimberman: around? I have a question regarding the apt cookbook... Why does it run update only if the cache is LESS than a day old? It seems backwards to me.
[2012-04-01 08:24:08 -0400] ssd7: Babar: are you refering to :     File.mtime('/var/lib/apt/periodic/update-success-stamp') < Time.now - 86400
[2012-04-01 08:25:00 -0400] Babar: ssd7: that, and the documentation
[2012-04-01 08:25:13 -0400] mosez: what is the way to publish a single file to all nodes for a specific package? have i got to create a recipe and put it in there? is there something like a share folder like on puppet where each role can pull a specific file?
[2012-04-01 08:25:24 -0400] Babar: oh
[2012-04-01 08:25:32 -0400] Babar: right, that means if it's OLDER
[2012-04-01 08:25:39 -0400] Babar: so the code is correct, the docco is wrong
[2012-04-01 08:25:55 -0400] ssd7: yeah :)
[2012-04-01 08:27:12 -0400] Babar: sent pull request :)
[2012-04-01 08:29:38 -0400] mosez: another way. i want to put a default file into the cookbook. but optionaly i want to overwrite it for specific nodes. how should i do that?
[2012-04-01 08:36:24 -0400] Babar: single copy nirvana... lets you do that. Isn't it enough for you?
[2012-04-01 09:03:05 -0400] mosez: babar: single copy nirvana?
[2012-04-01 09:04:04 -0400] mosez: ah, i see
[2012-04-01 09:04:49 -0400] mosez: works host-tld.com too?
[2012-04-01 09:14:33 -0400] Babar: no. but for that you can do it in the recipe :)
[2012-04-01 10:28:46 -0400] mosez: hum... i have added site-cookbooks to overwrite a specific template. but now i'm getting a warning. this way is deprecated :(
[2012-04-01 10:31:12 -0400] c64: Hey guys! - "chef-client -j"  takes an argument of file.bson or URL
[2012-04-01 10:31:38 -0400] c64: It gets translated to: Chef::Config[:json_attribs]
[2012-04-01 10:32:12 -0400] c64: oh, nevermind. I'll read the code.
[2012-04-01 12:08:13 -0400] ciastek: do you know where can be found the "chef tutorial session" webcast?
[2012-04-01 12:15:40 -0400] asg: ciastek: there may be a link at http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Guides
[2012-04-01 12:26:51 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: Are there any good tutorials on how to set up the node.json file? We're trying to set up Chef Solo and use 37signals cookbooks. Most tutorials out there are either brief on the subject or just explain "runlist".
[2012-04-01 12:27:33 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: Any tips or links would be much appreciated.
[2012-04-01 12:36:55 -0400] makuk66: jakobkpoulsen: when I use chef-solo my node.json only contains a run_list, which specifies a role, and then put override_attributes in the role file
[2012-04-01 12:38:57 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: makuk66: thanks for your answer. These override_attributes, how do I know which override_attributes to provide? When running 37s Nginx cookbook, for instance, I get the error: node attributes not given (or something along those lines).
[2012-04-01 12:39:54 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: makuk66: this is just a thought, is there perhaps a way to tell from their metadata.json? https://github.com/37signals/37s_cookbooks/blob/master/nginx/metadata.json
[2012-04-01 12:40:01 -0400] makuk66: I don't use the 37s cookbooks, but I assume that they explain either the cookbook README, or list them in the cookbook's metadata.rb
[2012-04-01 12:40:51 -0400] makuk66: jakobkpoulsen: look at the https://github.com/37signals/37s_cookbooks/blob/master/nginx/metadata.rb (the json one is generated from it)
[2012-04-01 12:41:15 -0400] makuk66: but they all show defaults, so I'm not sure what you're missing
[2012-04-01 12:42:18 -0400] makuk66: sorry, internet about to disappear for me. good luck
[2012-04-01 12:42:30 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: makuk66: thanks anyways (:
[2012-04-01 13:55:10 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: We keep running into this error when running more adv. cookbooks:
[2012-04-01 13:55:10 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: "/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/chef/node/attribute.rb:387:in `method_missing': Attribute node is not defined!"
[2012-04-01 13:55:10 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: Does anyone know what could be causing it? I'm think something is missing in the node.json file.
[2012-04-01 13:55:45 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: Google does not seem to be out friend in this case.
[2012-04-01 13:55:49 -0400] labria: what's your chef version?
[2012-04-01 13:56:02 -0400] labria: (client)
[2012-04-01 13:56:18 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: It's Chef Solo  - the newest version, I guess.
[2012-04-01 13:56:23 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: It's install as a gem.
[2012-04-01 13:56:30 -0400] labria: do a "git grep node.node"
[2012-04-01 13:56:56 -0400] labria: You're probably calling .node on a node by mistake
[2012-04-01 13:57:13 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: I would do this in the Chef dir?
[2012-04-01 13:58:03 -0400] labria: in your cookbook dir
[2012-04-01 13:58:29 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: done. Same error though.
[2012-04-01 13:59:02 -0400] labria: what did it tell you? nothing?
[2012-04-01 13:59:18 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: nothing, it went straight to the next command line
[2012-04-01 14:01:28 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: maybe I should try do update Chef?
[2012-04-01 14:01:45 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: could be it isn't the newest version
[2012-04-01 14:02:11 -0400] labria: shouldn't really be a problem
[2012-04-01 14:02:58 -0400] jakobkpoulsen: the cookbooks I've tried are Opscode's and 37Signal's for nginx - and various others.
[2012-04-01 14:52:28 -0400] rweng: hi guys. In a roles/role.rb file where the name of the role is set with 'name "app"', cat i get the name during customization of the attributes? s.th. like role["name"] or so?

[2012-04-01 19:53:20 -0400] dikim33: is it OK to run it as a root? I am afraid that it would break my setup as a normal user.
[2012-04-01 19:53:33 -0400] dikim33: on rvm.
[2012-04-01 19:56:43 -0400] dikim33: Anyone to help me to setup chef-solo with rvm without breaking my rvm configuration of normal users.
[2012-04-01 19:56:44 -0400] dikim33: ?
[2012-04-01 20:17:54 -0400] dikim33: it seems that it works fine by running with rvmsudo. Is it actually OK?

[2012-04-01 22:29:12 -0400] coderanger: I think
[2012-04-01 22:29:56 -0400] savant: will that be false if running under plain chef?
