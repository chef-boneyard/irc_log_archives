[2012-04-21 00:28:08 -0400] tech2: HI all, I don't know what I'm doing wrong but I get "ERROR: ArgumentError: Attribute required_containers is not defined" when trying to use knife to run chef-client? How do I debug chef failures? I'm getting a 401 Unauthorized but can't work out why it's not getting the right info
[2012-04-21 00:33:18 -0400] rvanniekirk: What's the Chef methodology for deploying new Vhosts to a server?
[2012-04-21 00:41:23 -0400] jtimberman: mhalligan: node['roles'] is a list of all the roles applied directly to a node's run list.
[2012-04-21 01:38:52 -0400] jtimberman: hoover_damn: because i didn't see your answer between lines of text, and you used the method invocation style instead of ['string'] stile :)
[2012-04-21 01:39:00 -0400] jtimberman: s/stile/style/
[2012-04-21 01:39:16 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, it's not you
[2012-04-21 01:39:25 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, that's why I didn't direct that at you
[2012-04-21 01:39:56 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, I'm referring to a pattern i've seen over the years that always makes me scratch my head... the 'Read inbetween the lines of what Damm says and re-organize it to what we want'
[2012-04-21 01:40:37 -0400] hoover_damn: jtimberman, I wasn't positive on node.roles because I still feel a little newbie when it comes to Chef now
[2012-04-21 01:41:04 -0400] hoover_damn: actually good to relearn chef and re-evaluate yin and yang
[2012-04-21 02:44:38 -0400] wamitchell: so, i'm trying to get my head around the proper way to create a file from a template and then update the same file later in the recipe
[2012-04-21 02:45:18 -0400] flaccid: wamitchell: file resource or template resource
[2012-04-21 02:45:25 -0400] wamitchell: template resource
[2012-04-21 02:46:05 -0400] flaccid: you should try to only do the template once, but there is ntohing stopping youf from notifying it again and updating it
[2012-04-21 02:47:24 -0400] wamitchell: ok. i think i need to get a better grasp on the notification flow
[2012-04-21 02:50:06 -0400] wamitchell: i'm messing around with the mysql recipe. the my.cnf file is created from a template, but then i want to change some of its values later on in the recipe.
[2012-04-21 02:53:47 -0400] wamitchell: flaccid: thanks for that info. that helps me along.
[2012-04-21 02:54:50 -0400] flaccid: yeah you should try to do the one template resource only, but a notify on the config file well re do it. better to layer or pull request the missing feature for the mysql cookbook
[2012-04-21 02:59:21 -0400] wamitchell: yeah, once i have a better grasp on the DSL, i'll see what it takes to make this change reusable
[2012-04-21 03:18:38 -0400] flaccid: for managing system users i should be using this right https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/users and users_manage lwrp to create one?
[2012-04-21 03:37:47 -0400] cwj: yeah users_manage is for automatically configuring a class of users based on a data bag
[2012-04-21 03:38:07 -0400] cwj: er group rather
[2012-04-21 03:39:28 -0400] flaccid: cwj: i just want to add a new user in a recipe, not a group so is this ok?
[2012-04-21 03:39:53 -0400] cwj: you can just use the 'user' resource directly
[2012-04-21 03:40:29 -0400] flaccid: ah true, sweet thanks; for some reason i forgot that existed
[2012-04-21 03:40:45 -0400] cwj: no problem
[2012-04-21 08:53:22 -0400] flaccid: getting hectic https://github.com/flaccid/cookbooks_linux/tree/master/cookbooks/znc/recipes

[2012-04-21 11:02:33 -0400] dstanek1: this only seems to happen when i use the nginx cookbookany ideas?
[2012-04-21 11:13:07 -0400] dstanek1: hmmnot sure what /etc/chef/ohai_plugins is, but when i move it out of the way everything works again

[2012-04-21 16:57:48 -0400] sagar_nikam: cwj: i have 2 nodes. server-83148.localdomain   server-89413.localdomain

[2012-04-21 16:58:22 -0400] sagar_nikam: using knife search
[2012-04-21 16:58:46 -0400] cwj: if you want to manipulate a specific node and you know its name you can do `knife ssh 'name:server-83148' 'some command here'`
[2012-04-21 16:59:00 -0400] cwj: if you just want to see the search results, knife node search 'name:*'
[2012-04-21 16:59:09 -0400] cwj: er knife search node 'name:*'
[2012-04-21 16:59:22 -0400] cwj: should show you all your nodes
[2012-04-21 17:04:14 -0400] sagar_nikam: ok let me try
[2012-04-21 17:13:37 -0400] sagar_nikam: cwf: i am trying this knife ssh 'name:server-89413.localdomain' 'sudo chef-client' -i key-file

[2012-04-21 17:19:37 -0400] sagar_nikam: shas0w: so the command would be knife ssh 'IP:10.6.55.159' 'sudo chef-client' -i key-file
[2012-04-21 17:19:41 -0400] sagar_nikam: is it correct
[2012-04-21 17:20:51 -0400] sagar_nikam: tried that command. no nodes returned
[2012-04-21 17:20:58 -0400] sagar_nikam: how do i search on IP
[2012-04-21 17:23:42 -0400] |shad0w|: no, have the search return the node ip
[2012-04-21 17:23:46 -0400] |shad0w|: i gave you an example

[2012-04-21 21:49:19 -0400] flaccid: works ok in irb. what n00bish thing am i doing wrong here?
[2012-04-21 22:20:42 -0400] erikh: flaccid: remove the puts, just return the value
[2012-04-21 22:20:59 -0400] erikh: puts returns nil
[2012-04-21 22:20:59 -0400] flaccid: return foo ?
[2012-04-21 22:21:07 -0400] erikh: return pass
[2012-04-21 22:21:12 -0400] flaccid: yeah
[2012-04-21 22:21:33 -0400] erikh: I should be working on a znc recipe RSN
[2012-04-21 22:21:36 -0400] flaccid: thanks y0. i read some ruby web page and it returned with puts, so my bad for trusting hehe
[2012-04-21 22:21:41 -0400] erikh: hosting a few proxies myself.
[2012-04-21 22:21:52 -0400] erikh: s/recipe/cookbook/
[2012-04-21 22:22:00 -0400] flaccid: this is pretty full featured if you want to prevent forking. its already forked twice
[2012-04-21 22:22:13 -0400] erikh: oh ok, I didn't realize it was public
[2012-04-21 22:22:22 -0400] erikh: derp, I wasn't paying attention to the url; thought it was a gist.
[2012-04-21 22:22:30 -0400] erikh: yeah, I'll try to look at it later this week.
[2012-04-21 22:22:45 -0400] flaccid: hopefully i finish it off
[2012-04-21 22:23:00 -0400] flaccid: i'm doing the uber case of trying to cater for everything, particularly in multi user and process
[2012-04-21 22:23:07 -0400] flaccid: have to see where i end up
[2012-04-21 22:23:28 -0400] erikh: cool
[2012-04-21 22:23:33 -0400] erikh: I have some patterns for that already
[2012-04-21 22:23:42 -0400] erikh: just need to chef them up.
[2012-04-21 22:23:51 -0400] flaccid: there doesn't seem to be an include directive in znc config though.. is that true?
[2012-04-21 22:23:59 -0400] flaccid: makes it harder
[2012-04-21 22:24:00 -0400] erikh: I'm not sure, to be honest.
[2012-04-21 22:24:07 -0400] erikh: the way I'm doing it is inverted
[2012-04-21 22:24:19 -0400] erikh: basically, there's an /etc/znc_clients file that contains a username per line
[2012-04-21 22:24:37 -0400] erikh: then I have an init script that walks each homedir in /etc/znc_clients and starts znc as the user
[2012-04-21 22:24:40 -0400] erikh: it doesn
[2012-04-21 22:24:46 -0400] erikh: doesn't do port conflicts or anything like that.
[2012-04-21 22:25:14 -0400] flaccid: right, apparently don't need to do multiple process though
[2012-04-21 22:25:17 -0400] flaccid: so i'm trying to avoid that, but if you do, its in the user's home..
[2012-04-21 22:26:37 -0400] erikh: it's a little cleaner when you don't have to share.
[2012-04-21 22:27:23 -0400] flaccid: but in theory, it looks like you don't need to
[2012-04-21 22:27:32 -0400] flaccid: the problem is that its all in the one conf right?
[2012-04-21 22:28:55 -0400] flaccid: i'm assuming that the password share is not an issue due to the hashing
[2012-04-21 22:31:41 -0400] flaccid: root@znc:~# znc --version
[2012-04-21 22:31:42 -0400] flaccid: ZNC 0.207 - http://znc.in

[2012-04-21 22:31:50 -0400] flaccid: ^^ that looks about right for git-devel right?
[2012-04-21 22:32:28 -0400] flaccid: woops wrong chan
[2012-04-21 22:36:49 -0400] flaccid: erikh: hmm i really can't do :user_password => generate_znc_password(node['znc']['admin_password']), ?
[2012-04-21 22:37:01 -0400] flaccid: it doesn't find the method in that template resource, must not be accessible
[2012-04-21 22:37:38 -0400] erikh: you should be able to... not sure why that isn't working for you.
[2012-04-21 22:37:52 -0400] erikh: I need to wander off so unfortunately for now you're on your own
[2012-04-21 22:38:01 -0400] flaccid: undefined method `generate_znc_password' for Chef::Resource::Template
