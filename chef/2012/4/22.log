[2012-04-22 00:41:58 -0400] flaccid: hmm is there a flags option or similar for execute resource like in script resource? if the command exits non-zero i need it to fail
[2012-04-22 01:53:15 -0400] hoover_damn: ; /bin/true
[2012-04-22 01:53:26 -0400] hoover_damn: but I think epic_fail should work on the script resource
[2012-04-22 01:55:02 -0400] flaccid: sorry?
[2012-04-22 01:55:20 -0400] hoover_damn: epic_fail true option
[2012-04-22 01:55:53 -0400] flaccid: can't say i know it
[2012-04-22 01:56:09 -0400] hoover_damn: try it? otherwise add ;/bin/true to the last argument of your command
[2012-04-22 01:56:14 -0400] hoover_damn: not what you wanted, but should work
[2012-04-22 01:57:04 -0400] flaccid: but i don't want it to be true
[2012-04-22 01:57:11 -0400] flaccid: i want it to be false/non-zero on error

[2012-04-22 10:16:27 -0400] BryanWB_: sounds like u need to add additional apt repository, did u check the readme?
[2012-04-22 10:19:08 -0400] BryanWB_: u probably have to put additional recipes in the run_list
[2012-04-22 10:19:21 -0400] sagar_nikam: i have put java in run lists
[2012-04-22 10:20:00 -0400] sagar_nikam: the readme specified that the attributes will have the hadoop mirrot url, version etc
[2012-04-22 10:20:13 -0400] sagar_nikam: but the downloaded cookbook does not have any attribute
