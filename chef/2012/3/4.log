[2012-03-04 09:57:00 -0500] onailerua: hello cheffers
[2012-03-04 09:57:00 -0500] onailerua: anyone has tryied installing chef architecture on ecc.eucalyptus?
[2012-03-04 10:41:00 -0500] onailerua: someone has already faced issues with rabbitmq while installing on ubuntu 10.4 ?
[2012-03-04 14:13:00 -0500] Xajin: morning everyone!
[2012-03-04 14:14:00 -0500] Kiall: Heya, Is there any way to override a file in a cookbook? (ie .. a cookbook_file file, rather than a .rb or .json etc file)
[2012-03-04 14:14:00 -0500] Xajin: heh no clue, I am in question land also :)
[2012-03-04 14:15:00 -0500] Xajin: I am using lamp instructions, with php-quick-start.  When I build the wiki server should that appear as a node in chefwebui?
[2012-03-04 14:42:00 -0500] asg: Kiall: for a different specific host? try putting the file in files/host-<fqdn>. That will be used for that host instead of the on in files/default
[2012-03-04 14:43:00 -0500] Kiall: asg: well, I was aiming for "dont want to modify the cookbook" so it's easy to update etc..
[2012-03-04 14:48:00 -0500] asg: Kiall: ah, then I'm not sure. Sorry.
[2012-03-04 14:50:00 -0500] bkocik: I now have Chef bootstrapping my servers with Ruby 1.9.3, Apache, Passenger, firewall rules, user accounts, etc. It's a beautiful thing.
[2012-03-04 14:51:00 -0500] bkocik: I just wanted to say to everyone in here that helped me: I can't thank you enough. You folks are awesome.
[2012-03-04 14:53:00 -0500] Xajin: Nice one bkocik, how long it take you to get to that point?
[2012-03-04 14:59:00 -0500] bkocik: Xajin: Honestly about two weeks.
[2012-03-04 14:59:00 -0500] bkocik: But this was my very first foray into Chef. I had zero experience. Went down a lot of blind hallways and dead ends.
[2012-03-04 15:00:00 -0500] bkocik: For everything I did right, I probably tried 15 different wrong ways first. :)
[2012-03-04 16:13:00 -0500] tightwork: Is the O'reilly book worth wild?
[2012-03-04 16:39:00 -0500] jtimberman: tightwork: its not a comprehensive book, its a short topical book on the concept of testing with cucumber and chef.
[2012-03-04 16:40:00 -0500] jtimberman: tightwork: the author, Stephen Nelson-Smith (Cope) is currently writing "Chef the Definitive Guide" due out this year (I don't know a release date tho)
[2012-03-04 17:27:00 -0500] sivy: hey jtimberman: question about the python resource
[2012-03-04 17:27:00 -0500] sivy: i mean, cokbook
[2012-03-04 17:27:00 -0500] sivy: I'm thinking about adding the ability to pass in a requirements file
[2012-03-04 17:27:00 -0500] sivy: and/or a hash of packages to install
[2012-03-04 17:32:00 -0500] sivy: i'd like to pass it in to python_pip
[2012-03-04 17:33:00 -0500] sivy: is there an example of where something like this is done elsewhere?
[2012-03-04 17:34:00 -0500] tightwork: jtimberman: thanks, good to know.. I'll wait for the definitive guide then
[2012-03-04 17:36:00 -0500] BryanWB: jtimberman, summertime for chef definitive guide
[2012-03-04 17:52:00 -0500] hoover_damm: honestly I think the best learning experience for Chef is pure Mentoring / Pairing
[2012-03-04 17:53:00 -0500] hoover_damm: learning on your own is pretty hard... (puppet is harder imo, but it's an opinion)
[2012-03-04 17:54:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and the parts that I really find people asking more questions on Chef isn't the typical day to day resource question
[2012-03-04 17:55:00 -0500] hoover_damm: they just don't know which way to setup the recipe, or how what to put in it... because they're trying to automate an installer or something and need a few hints
[2012-03-04 17:55:00 -0500] hoover_damm: because I am allowed to change my mind (for the better or worse) on anything
[2012-03-04 17:56:00 -0500] tightwork: I work with a bunch of old apples that resent automation and what is automated is crapdified ancient sh scripts
[2012-03-04 17:57:00 -0500] tightwork: so mentoring is out the door
[2012-03-04 17:57:00 -0500] tightwork: im half their age, what do I know
[2012-03-04 18:01:00 -0500] tightwork: well.. would you embrace change or die by the sword?
[2012-03-04 18:02:00 -0500] arreyder: It was a tough sell for me when using hardware, but I appreciate it now.  It took me 6 months to learn chef and ruby well enough to get around 20 recipes to work in three environment.
[2012-03-04 18:02:00 -0500] arreyder: I cursed the entire time at the people that were making me use it. :)
[2012-03-04 18:03:00 -0500] arreyder: Now thought, it's quite satisfying to be able to deploy a new server in a few minutes and see all the services be deployed and configured with only a few presses of the enter key.
[2012-03-04 18:03:00 -0500] arreyder: thought/though
[2012-03-04 18:04:00 -0500] tightwork: thats ridiculous.. you should have 5 perl scripts to do that
[2012-03-04 18:04:00 -0500] arreyder: We have a mix of cloud based stuff, where tools like chef and puppet are pretty much a requirement and hardware.  I never questioned the value of doing it in the virtual environments,  but I did on hardware.
[2012-03-04 18:05:00 -0500] tightwork: and another 3 to make sure everything is correct
[2012-03-04 18:05:00 -0500] arreyder: heh, yes.  Those 5 perl scripts for me was actually around 300 developed over 11 years at my last job.
[2012-03-04 18:06:00 -0500] tightwork: are you provisioning systems with chef from bare metal? pxe?
[2012-03-04 18:06:00 -0500] hoover_damm: tightwork, you automate everything
[2012-03-04 18:06:00 -0500] hoover_damm: tightwork, that's what you do
[2012-03-04 18:06:00 -0500] hoover_damm: tightwork, if your bringing configuration management into a company that has none.  Automate it all
[2012-03-04 18:06:00 -0500] hoover_damm: tightwork, you'll fight resistance because sysadmins think you're taking their job away.. Your not
[2012-03-04 18:06:00 -0500] hoover_damm: tightwork, your automating things to make their lives easier so they can work on the things that need to be done.
[2012-03-04 18:06:00 -0500] arreyder: tightwork: nah, we have ops people whose purpose in life is to get the OS up and an IP on it.  Then we do the rest with chef.
[2012-03-04 18:07:00 -0500] hoover_damm: tightwork, and not constantly build infrastructure manually
[2012-03-04 18:07:00 -0500] hoover_damm: tightwork, you'll find resistance and you'll find jobs who will fire you or more for bringing the subject up
[2012-03-04 18:07:00 -0500] arreyder: tightwork: demo it for management.  Show them how quickly you can get a box back up after total hardware failure.
[2012-03-04 18:07:00 -0500] hoover_damm: tightwork, but learning chef and finding the patterns that work for you.  Will make your job skills 5x better then those young kids
[2012-03-04 18:08:00 -0500] arreyder: then let management lean on the rest of the "old apples"
[2012-03-04 18:08:00 -0500] hoover_damm: tightwork, and you will start to find yourself shining like a bright sun
[2012-03-04 18:08:00 -0500] arreyder: heh
[2012-03-04 18:08:00 -0500] arreyder: what hoover_damm says is what happened to me.
[2012-03-04 18:08:00 -0500] tightwork: well, its kinda funny... where I work we are suppose to have a enterprise cmdb system where we are suppose to use internal systems, but the company is so large and systems so complex it generally doesnt happen
[2012-03-04 18:08:00 -0500] hoover_damm: because the more you automate, the more you learn
[2012-03-04 18:08:00 -0500] hoover_damm: the more awesome your life becomes
[2012-03-04 18:08:00 -0500] tightwork: plus I believe each departement must actually purchase the software from higher up
[2012-03-04 18:09:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and with chef, work in iterations
[2012-03-04 18:09:00 -0500] arreyder: yes
[2012-03-04 18:09:00 -0500] tightwork: I like to just make executive decisions because the execs are never around anyway
[2012-03-04 18:09:00 -0500] tightwork: its working? good
[2012-03-04 18:09:00 -0500] hoover_damm: i've been working with a client for the past 2 weeks, and we discussed friday the likelyhod that we couldn't get it all done in our allotted time
[2012-03-04 18:09:00 -0500] tightwork: bye
[2012-03-04 18:09:00 -0500] hoover_damm: because we've been replacing production one by one
[2012-03-04 18:09:00 -0500] hoover_damm: as we automate
[2012-03-04 18:10:00 -0500] hoover_damm: we're putting more care and consideration into production as we spin it up in the sizes, what's setup, etc
[2012-03-04 18:10:00 -0500] tightwork: I have my personal stuff working with opscode on rackspace, its fantastic I can spin up a vm with a role in seconds with knife
[2012-03-04 18:10:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and it allows us to verify what we're working on is +1
[2012-03-04 18:10:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so given another 4 weeks, and he may give us that
[2012-03-04 18:10:00 -0500] tightwork: and i dont question if snmp or iptables is correct and enabled.. i know it is
[2012-03-04 18:10:00 -0500] hoover_damm: we'll automate everything
[2012-03-04 18:11:00 -0500] hoover_damm: including adding instances to the rackspace load balancer
[2012-03-04 18:11:00 -0500] hoover_damm: iptables
[2012-03-04 18:11:00 -0500] hoover_damm: etc
[2012-03-04 18:11:00 -0500] tightwork: I think a bigger monster is windows, anyone work with automating windows with chef?
[2012-03-04 18:11:00 -0500] arreyder: hoover_damm: we have an api for that :)
[2012-03-04 18:11:00 -0500] hoover_damm: arreyder, well yeah I just have to use the API :)
[2012-03-04 18:11:00 -0500] hoover_damm: arreyder, not a hard thing to automate I hope
[2012-03-04 18:11:00 -0500] tightwork: heh is that the new slogan for 2012.. api for that
[2012-03-04 18:11:00 -0500] hoover_damm: honestly people who don't have an api
[2012-03-04 18:11:00 -0500] hoover_damm: make me sad
[2012-03-04 18:11:00 -0500] tightwork: yeah
[2012-03-04 18:12:00 -0500] arreyder: hoover_damm: the guy that built the loadbalancer offering is on my team now.  let me know if you have issues/gripes/etc...
[2012-03-04 18:12:00 -0500] hoover_damm: i've become super spoiled by companies having an api I can just yak up
[2012-03-04 18:12:00 -0500] hoover_damm: arreyder, it looks better then ELB so I doubt I'll have much to say
[2012-03-04 18:12:00 -0500] hoover_damm: cloud load balancers are meh fun
[2012-03-04 18:12:00 -0500] arreyder: hoover_damm: if you need automated montioring, we have a product in beta for that, which is completely api driven
[2012-03-04 18:13:00 -0500] hoover_damm: you get what you can from it, and implement your own once you grow beyond your cloud's ability
[2012-03-04 18:13:00 -0500] arreyder: I'll stop marketing now :)
[2012-03-04 18:13:00 -0500] hoover_damm: haha as I worked for EY up till a month ago
[2012-03-04 18:13:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I totally know how you feel arreyder :) so don't sweat it
[2012-03-04 18:13:00 -0500] hoover_damm: arreyder, you have an awesome product and I know my client is just hoping for bigger sizes in time
[2012-03-04 18:14:00 -0500] arreyder: heh, yeah, proud of what we have built, hard to not try and pimp it out :)
[2012-03-04 18:14:00 -0500] hoover_damm: arreyder, I am honestly just trying to get them to agree to a little physical hosted for their database on rackspace
[2012-03-04 18:14:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and keep the other stuff on the cloud
[2012-03-04 18:14:00 -0500] hoover_damm: because I see no reason on moving them from RS to EC2
[2012-03-04 18:14:00 -0500] arreyder: I'm a big fan of having your app on both.
[2012-03-04 18:14:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I'd rather keep them in a spot they know well, can grow well and are supported most excellently
[2012-03-04 18:14:00 -0500] hoover_damm: which Rackspace does
[2012-03-04 18:15:00 -0500] arreyder: libcloud is a pretty cool democratizer of apis for the various providers
[2012-03-04 18:16:00 -0500] arreyder: when I sadi both, I meant redundancy across providers when possible
[2012-03-04 18:18:00 -0500] arreyder: hoover_damm: there's some Database as a Service offerings at RAX now also.
[2012-03-04 18:18:00 -0500] arreyder: and more coming
[2012-03-04 18:18:00 -0500] arreyder: at certain levels they are pretty much your own box, but managed my rax for you.
[2012-03-04 18:18:00 -0500] hoover_damm: arreyder, kinda like EC2?
[2012-03-04 18:18:00 -0500] hoover_damm: ugh
[2012-03-04 18:19:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I admit I'm not a fan of RDS and all the mass of AWS offerings
[2012-03-04 18:19:00 -0500] arreyder: I dont know all the details, I really need to look into our DB related productions better.
[2012-03-04 18:19:00 -0500] hoover_damm: well i wouldn't be shocked if you did
[2012-03-04 18:20:00 -0500] hoover_damm: but if it's up to me, i'd tell you to not do that and work on other crap
[2012-03-04 18:20:00 -0500] hoover_damm: because your product is awesome, trying to automate a RDS clone for Rackspace to compete... shouldn't be where your at imo
[2012-03-04 18:20:00 -0500] hoover_damm: marketing may disagree
[2012-03-04 18:36:00 -0500] hoover_damm: tightwork, keep up on chef and you'll learn a valuable skill that will last longer then any job ever will.
[2012-03-04 19:01:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: Indeed
[2012-03-04 19:15:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I learned Chef back in 2009, and still use it in 2012
[2012-03-04 19:16:00 -0500] hoover_damm: 2 jobs and several contracts
[2012-03-04 19:20:00 -0500] Aengus: I rarely find people hiring for a standard *nix admin, they usually like to see some sort of CM in the mix as well.
[2012-03-04 19:25:00 -0500] Twirrim: That's interesting.  Generally I find the opposite (or you end up speaking with battlescarred greybeards who've only ever dealt with cfengine2).  CM is still not big enough in the market.
[2012-03-04 19:34:00 -0500] Aengus: Twirrim: I suppose I avoid places like that :)
[2012-03-04 19:36:00 -0500] Twirrim: I work for a great online based company, but out of 27 subsidiaries we're the only one actually implementing config management.  I'm mostly at the start of the process too :)
[2012-03-04 19:38:00 -0500] Twirrim: It's going to be a good long while before I can get our entire infrastructure using it, but I can at least now make sure all new stuff does!
[2012-03-04 19:38:00 -0500] hoover_damm: Aengus, you won't find sysadmins going out of style
[2012-03-04 19:38:00 -0500] hoover_damm: what you will find is the classic role of sysadmins hopefully will become less popular as time goes on
[2012-03-04 19:38:00 -0500] Aengus: hoover_damm: very true
[2012-03-04 19:38:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and sysadmins will working on the same thing, but they'll be automating it
[2012-03-04 19:39:00 -0500] Aengus: hoover_damm: agreed.
[2012-03-04 19:39:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and using their spare time to keep up on other things that need to be kept up on
[2012-03-04 19:39:00 -0500] hoover_damm: Noops is a marketing slogan by Engine Yard and other PaaS's to get you to give up a sysadmin and just use them
[2012-03-04 19:40:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and the problem with putting your stuff in another person's pocket, is they don't always care about it the way you do
[2012-03-04 19:40:00 -0500] Twirrim: If you look at the sysadmin job over the past 20 years it's constantly changing.  Even in the past 5 years things have changed quite significantly and I doubt that's going to slow down :)
[2012-03-04 19:40:00 -0500] hoover_damm: really sysadmins are going to be in demand for quite some time
[2012-03-04 19:40:00 -0500] Aengus: if I have to hear noops again I may shoot myself.
[2012-03-04 19:40:00 -0500] Twirrim: hoover_damm: thus spake a suitably paranoid sysadmin :D
[2012-03-04 19:40:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I'm a jack of all trades sysadmin
[2012-03-04 19:40:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I guess
[2012-03-04 19:40:00 -0500] hoover_damm: Aengus, at least you didn't have to work for a company who sputed the noops bs and then put it into their workforce
[2012-03-04 19:41:00 -0500] Aengus: ffs
[2012-03-04 19:41:00 -0500] hoover_damm: expecting them buy the party line as well
[2012-03-04 19:41:00 -0500] Aengus: you left I hope
[2012-03-04 19:41:00 -0500] hoover_damm: nah they shitcanned me
[2012-03-04 19:41:00 -0500] Aengus: oh, awesome.
[2012-03-04 19:41:00 -0500] Aengus: I wonder how they are doing now :\
[2012-03-04 19:41:00 -0500] hoover_damm: the same
[2012-03-04 19:41:00 -0500] hoover_damm: it looks like their stack is getting dated since they shitcanned me
[2012-03-04 19:42:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I didn't realize honestly how big my role was in keepign it up to date, until I was gone
[2012-03-04 19:42:00 -0500] Aengus: good move.
[2012-03-04 19:42:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and then I watched ruby versions drop and them not move
[2012-03-04 19:42:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and I was like damn... I really didn't think they'd stop
[2012-03-04 19:42:00 -0500] hoover_damm: web stacks constantly move and if your trying to host ruby on rails apps and can't say no to a customer
[2012-03-04 19:43:00 -0500] hoover_damm: you constantly have to keep updating your stack every day of your life
[2012-03-04 19:43:00 -0500] Aengus: been in that spot, laid off in support of EY at the time... they quickly moved back.
[2012-03-04 19:43:00 -0500] hoover_damm: that musta been back in 2008
[2012-03-04 19:43:00 -0500] Aengus: nailed it
[2012-03-04 19:43:00 -0500] hoover_damm: :)
[2012-03-04 19:43:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yeah I know
[2012-03-04 19:44:00 -0500] hoover_damm: almost 2 years of EY and you pretty much know the history
[2012-03-04 19:44:00 -0500] Aengus: heh
[2012-03-04 19:44:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yeah that layoff was a very sad one
[2012-03-04 19:45:00 -0500] Aengus: you seem to be doing fine.
[2012-03-04 19:45:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I don't think EY really ever grasped that their sole credit to their name was support
[2012-03-04 19:45:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I'm not doing as good as I would have hoped honestly
[2012-03-04 19:45:00 -0500] hoover_damm: but i'm surviving with 2 contracts
[2012-03-04 19:45:00 -0500] Aengus: remote gigd?
[2012-03-04 19:45:00 -0500] Aengus: gigs
[2012-03-04 19:45:00 -0500] hoover_damm: yer
[2012-03-04 19:46:00 -0500] hoover_damm: honestly i haven't worked in an office in 4 years
[2012-03-04 19:46:00 -0500] Aengus: yeah, those are still a pain in the ass to get ... still.
[2012-03-04 19:46:00 -0500] hoover_damm: the thought of going into an office now and wasting 8 hours a day listening to marketing and such
[2012-03-04 19:46:00 -0500] Aengus: hah, bout right.
[2012-03-04 19:46:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and yes they are hard, but unfortunately I didn't get my medical issues taken care of while I was at EY
[2012-03-04 19:47:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I took some medication when I was a kid that unfortunately had a side effect of Crohn's disease.
[2012-03-04 19:47:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so I get to live with that for the rest of my life and try and work
[2012-03-04 19:47:00 -0500] Aengus: fuck, a close mate of mine has that.
[2012-03-04 19:48:00 -0500] hoover_damm: what's messed up to me is looking over the wikipedia article makes me realize i've been suffering from this for a craplongtime
[2012-03-04 19:48:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I had an interview tuesday when I actually had a boss ask me why I didn't want to work in the office
[2012-03-04 19:48:00 -0500] hoover_damm: that's when I gave up on that interview
[2012-03-04 19:49:00 -0500] hoover_damm: people always want to pick my brain
[2012-03-04 19:49:00 -0500] hoover_damm: and ask me questions
[2012-03-04 19:49:00 -0500] hoover_damm: if I have to explain to my boss that because of my medical condition I prefer to work from home and I can provide a much better employee value that way as well.
[2012-03-04 19:49:00 -0500] hoover_damm: ... I am in the wrong interview in part
[2012-03-04 19:49:00 -0500] Aengus: heh, I do like working from a office if I get be left alone.
[2012-03-04 19:49:00 -0500] Aengus: otherwise I am more than happy to work from home.
[2012-03-04 19:49:00 -0500] hoover_damm: i'm never left alone
[2012-03-04 19:50:00 -0500] erikh: Aengus: !
[2012-03-04 19:50:00 -0500] Aengus: Would they not just hit you up on IRC/Skype/WE
[2012-03-04 19:50:00 -0500] Aengus: yo erikh
[2012-03-04 19:50:00 -0500] erikh: the bot has been up all weekend!
[2012-03-04 19:50:00 -0500] Aengus: erik, you are a fucking king
[2012-03-04 19:50:00 -0500] erikh: haha
[2012-03-04 19:50:00 -0500] hoover_damm: you'd think
[2012-03-04 19:50:00 -0500] erikh: heading to crepes
[2012-03-04 19:50:00 -0500] erikh: later.
[2012-03-04 19:51:00 -0500] hoover_damm: lol erikh have a good breakfast
[2012-03-04 19:51:00 -0500] hoover_damm: it's a nice day in seattle
[2012-03-04 19:51:00 -0500] hoover_damm: i'm going to stretch my legs while I can
[2012-03-04 19:51:00 -0500] hoover_damm: before I get blown away
[2012-03-04 19:51:00 -0500] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-03-04 19:51:00 -0500] Aengus: hoover_damm: it is a cloudy day in Van
[2012-03-04 19:51:00 -0500] Aengus: haha
[2012-03-04 19:51:00 -0500] hoover_damm: Aengus, just been windy the past few days
[2012-03-04 19:52:00 -0500] Aengus: nice, I life in the city ... don't see it
[2012-03-04 19:52:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: hrm, this is curious
[2012-03-04 19:53:00 -0500] hoover_damm: I live only 20minutes from downtown
[2012-03-04 19:53:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: I am using the yum cookbook ius recipe and the ius repo rpm version changes apparently quite often, causing the recipe to fail
[2012-03-04 19:53:00 -0500] hoover_damm: the gangs still seem to be coming back in seattle
[2012-03-04 19:53:00 -0500] hoover_damm: :(
[2012-03-04 19:54:00 -0500] hoover_damm: so you run centos and you're having hell with the chef/ruby rpm's?
[2012-03-04 19:54:00 -0500] hoover_damm: what's wrong with omnibus?
[2012-03-04 19:58:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: Twirrim: So I am trying to decide if the extra strong version string match even matters
[2012-03-04 19:58:00 -0500] Twirrim: to the point of thinking about knocking up a daily script to check version number and update local coobook.
[2012-03-04 19:59:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: I don't think it needs to be more than rpm -qa | grep ius-release
[2012-03-04 20:00:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: afaict ius-release ought to get updated if necessary with yum update once it's installed and they aren't very well going to break the repository, so flyign with an older ius-release isn't likely to blow up anyway
[2012-03-04 20:00:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: So I think I'm going to just relax the not_if grep match for ius and epel instead
[2012-03-04 20:02:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: heck, ius even ships epel-release
[2012-03-04 20:05:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: Nothing earth shattering
[2012-03-04 20:06:00 -0500] Twirrim: the actual recipe itself breaks for install every time the version number changes.
[2012-03-04 20:06:00 -0500] Twirrim: It does this: source "http://dl.iuscommunity.org/pub/ius/stable/Redhat/#{major}/i386/ius-release-#{ius}.ius.el#{major}.noarch.rpm"
[2012-03-04 20:07:00 -0500] Twirrim: so any time they update ius, you need to go and change the attribute in default.rb : default['yum']['ius_release'] = '1.0-8'
[2012-03-04 20:07:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: Well, yeah
[2012-03-04 20:08:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: But it's okay if the version string test isn't so precise for existing nodes
[2012-03-04 20:08:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: I can fix it for new nodes
[2012-03-04 20:09:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: hrm, that made no sense; was a late night for me
[2012-03-04 20:10:00 -0500] Twirrim: likewise, was up 'till 2am grappling with something in python.
[2012-03-04 20:26:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: Oh, I figured it out; if via yum update ius-release gets updated, existing nodes will fail when the rpm qa check fails due to a newer version and the subsequent download of the 'old' rpm fails, killing the chef run
[2012-03-04 20:26:00 -0500] tightwork: does the pxe_dust recipe do what I imagine? kickstart from bare metal?
[2012-03-04 20:26:00 -0500] JasonBoxLaptop: That's why I thought the checks should be relaxed
[2012-03-04 21:53:00 -0500] jtimberman: Twirrim: you can set that attribute in a role instead of modifying the cookbook
[2012-03-04 22:08:00 -0500] Twirrim: sure.  What I can't figure out is why they feel it's necessary to update the version string on that file.  It's not like the actual repository path changes at all.
[2012-03-04 22:27:00 -0500] danderson: Anyone around to give me design feedback on my plan for DHCP in my (small, home) network?
[2012-03-04 22:28:00 -0500] danderson: I was thinking of adding node attributes to each node in my network along the lines of [:eth0][:assigned_ip] = "10.1.2.3"
[2012-03-04 22:28:00 -0500] danderson: then have the dhcpd recipe run over all the nodes and build static assignments for nodes with those attributes set, based on the ohai reported MAC address
[2012-03-04 22:29:00 -0500] danderson: and in the environment definition, I'd add attributes specifying the network (network addr, cidr prefix), so that the dhcpd recipe can generate dynamic allocation blocks for guest machines
[2012-03-04 22:30:00 -0500] danderson: that way, I figure the dhcpd machines will always be synced to Chef's node/network map, and as an added bonus I can search for nodes where the ohai IP differs form the assigned IP
[2012-03-04 22:30:00 -0500] danderson: does any of this make sense? Anything I should be doing differently?
[2012-03-04 23:21:00 -0500] fujin: don't reinvent the wheel? :)
[2012-03-04 23:21:00 -0500] fujin: most dhcp servers have a pretty easy to manage static allocation facility, mac address -> ip addresses
[2012-03-04 23:22:00 -0500] fujin: I don't have an ideal, alternate solution; but be warned about building stuff like this - chances are you'll end up with a Provisioning system.
[2012-03-04 23:22:00 -0500] fujin: hmm, that hippiehacker guy did a load of work regarding dhcp on small networks and provisioning and stuff
[2012-03-04 23:24:00 -0500] fujin: https://github.com/hh
[2012-03-04 23:24:00 -0500] fujin: maybe something there. or look for him on irc
[2012-03-04 23:28:00 -0500] hoover_damm: dude his picture is dope
[2012-03-04 23:33:00 -0500] danderson: fujin: I was looking through the existing opscode recipes and found nothing that manages the host IP allocation stuff, and I figured chef has a nice searchable store of machines I care about. That's where I was coming from with this :)
[2012-03-04 23:34:00 -0500] fujin: hoover_damm: yeah, dude is a beast. he like hacks out of a van, 1hr drive from me
[2012-03-04 23:34:00 -0500] fujin: in the wilderness or something with his wife
[2012-03-04 23:34:00 -0500] danderson: but yeah, I'm keenly aware that I'm reinventing bits of a provisioning system, which I have little interest in inventing :)
[2012-03-04 23:34:00 -0500] fujin: danderson: so have a look at cobbler (it can interface with puppet) have a look at Crowbar (the dell/openstack tool) and.. I dunno
[2012-03-04 23:35:00 -0500] fujin: you could probably build something pretty simple around databags
[2012-03-04 23:35:00 -0500] danderson: well, I looked at cobbler and foreman, they both looked overly complex for my needs
[2012-03-04 23:35:00 -0500] danderson: and their desire to strongly integrate with puppet bothered me :)
[2012-03-04 23:36:00 -0500] fujin: foreman was the other one I was thinking about, ohadlevys one
[2012-03-04 23:36:00 -0500] fujin: hrmm
[2012-03-04 23:36:00 -0500] danderson: I'll check out hh's stuff and keep playing around, I guess.
[2012-03-04 23:36:00 -0500] fujin: when I worked at cloudscaling they were building something like this, although I don't know it was ever released.
[2012-03-04 23:36:00 -0500] fujin: danderson:  I know hh did some stuff for managing dhcp on networks or at leastI thought I saw him playing with it
[2012-03-04 23:36:00 -0500] danderson: right now this is all still in a playground network of VMs, and getting used to chef
[2012-03-04 23:36:00 -0500] fujin: it wasn't on his main account - like a team account he is a part of
[2012-03-04 23:37:00 -0500] fujin: yeah. here you go
[2012-03-04 23:37:00 -0500] fujin: found it
[2012-03-04 23:37:00 -0500] fujin: https://github.com/passionengine/ii
[2012-03-04 23:37:00 -0500] shadoi: fujin: maybe soon :)
[2012-03-04 23:37:00 -0500] fujin: awesome
[2012-03-04 23:37:00 -0500] hoover_damm: fujin, a good proper hippie hacker good :)
[2012-03-04 23:38:00 -0500] hoover_damm: fujin, it's good to see people who are stuck that way
[2012-03-04 23:38:00 -0500] danderson: aha, awesome. I'll check it out.
[2012-03-04 23:38:00 -0500] danderson: fujin: thanks!
[2012-03-04 23:38:00 -0500] fujin: danderson: that was the magic sauce I was remembering, 'ii', for sure... windows & ubuntu boxen boot over the network
[2012-03-04 23:38:00 -0500] fujin: more than likely directly reusable
[2012-03-04 23:38:00 -0500] fujin: #winning
[2012-03-04 23:39:00 -0500] fujin: k, I'm out, later guys. good luck
[2012-03-04 23:39:00 -0500] fujin: be interested to hear if you get somethign working well danderson
[2012-03-04 23:41:00 -0500] danderson: like I said, right now I'm just messing around, figuring out how to build a home network config that derives as much as possible from chef automagically
[2012-03-04 23:41:00 -0500] danderson: I'm fairly sure most of it won't be reusable in environments where more control is needed. I'm just okay with convention over configuration in these cases :)
