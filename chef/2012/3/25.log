[2012-03-25 11:15:00 -0400] null_route: Hi guys! - I understand that the Git Deploy Resource creates a new directory for each revision which is deployed
[2012-03-25 11:15:00 -0400] null_route: Is there a way to just have the deploy_resource "switch" (or "checkout") a revision into the same directory each time?
[2012-03-25 17:34:00 -0400] rocket: Does anyone know if its possible to install chef server on an osX instance?
[2012-03-25 17:35:00 -0400] rocket: or should I plan on installing a vm to do that anyway?
[2012-03-25 17:37:00 -0400] hoover_damm: you should use a vm
[2012-03-25 17:37:00 -0400] hoover_damm: it's possible
[2012-03-25 17:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but you should use a vm just so you can move or stop it easily likely
[2012-03-25 17:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: pow.cx likely would be enough of a webserver if it works
[2012-03-25 17:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: not sure if it would out of the box
[2012-03-25 17:41:00 -0400] rocket: thanks
[2012-03-25 22:48:00 -0400] jkyle: to access default_attributes for an environment, you would do this? node.chef_environment["default_attributes"]["someattr"]
[2012-03-25 22:54:00 -0400] silk: jkyle, play with it in shef
[2012-03-25 22:55:00 -0400] |shad0w|: attribs aren't part of enviornments
[2012-03-25 22:55:00 -0400] |shad0w|: You'd have to factor out env based attribs on your own
[2012-03-25 22:56:00 -0400] |shad0w|: afaik envs only you give you env run lists and cookbook version constraints
[2012-03-25 22:56:00 -0400] silk: you can load the environment, and ask it
[2012-03-25 22:57:00 -0400] |shad0w|: ?environments
[2012-03-25 22:57:00 -0400] |shad0w|: environments?
[2012-03-25 22:57:00 -0400] bawt_: environments is a feature of the Chef Server allowing you to constrain cookbooks to specific versions, set environment specific run lists for roles and set up environment specific attributes for nodes. Documentation: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Environments
[2012-03-25 22:58:00 -0400] |shad0w|: ahh, guess you can do attribs in the env, but only in the env scope
[2012-03-25 22:58:00 -0400] |shad0w|: but you shouldn't really care where the attrib comes from, you should just be able to look at node["someattr"]
[2012-03-25 23:33:00 -0400] hoover_damm: environments have attributes
[2012-03-25 23:34:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but they are just merged into the regular node tree no?
[2012-03-25 23:34:00 -0400] hoover_damm: ala deep merge
[2012-03-25 23:45:00 -0400] jkyle: hoover_damm: cool
