[2012-03-11 09:17:00 -0400] btipling: you are a broken human being
[2012-03-11 09:17:00 -0400] tarrant: probably.

[2012-03-11 12:05:00 -0400] c64: Hi Guys! I'm writing chef recipes and uploading them to our local Chef server. Our production environment does NOT have incoming access to our office. Is there a way to keep 2 Chef servers in sync, or is tehre a better way to do things?
[2012-03-11 12:56:00 -0400] auro: I just installed Chef Server (community).
[2012-03-11 12:56:00 -0400] auro: It looks like it works. But the tab "Status" in the web interface is inactive.
[2012-03-11 12:56:00 -0400] auro: Why can it be?
[2012-03-11 12:56:00 -0400] auro: hi)
[2012-03-11 17:43:00 -0400] _aeris_: hello #chef
[2012-03-11 17:43:00 -0400] _aeris_: i have a question
[2012-03-11 17:43:00 -0400] _aeris_: chef-client seems running twice per hour, but no cron or others are activated
[2012-03-11 17:44:00 -0400] _aeris_: where those runs come from ?
[2012-03-11 17:52:00 -0400] ssd7_: _aeris_: Do you have the chef-client cookbook in your run_list?
[2012-03-11 17:52:00 -0400] _aeris_: no =(
[2012-03-11 17:53:00 -0400] _aeris_: seems a chef-client process respawn periodically
[2012-03-11 17:53:00 -0400] _aeris_: /usr/bin/ruby1.8 /usr/bin/chef-client -d -P /var/run/chef/client.pid -L /var/log/chef/client.log -c /etc/chef/client.rb -i 1800 -s 20
[2012-03-11 17:53:00 -0400] _aeris_: but no idea why
[2012-03-11 17:54:00 -0400] ssd7_: well, it seems you have -i 1800 which tells chef-client to run every 30 minutes
[2012-03-11 17:54:00 -0400] _aeris_: yep but i kill this process
[2012-03-11 17:55:00 -0400] _aeris_: but always respawn
[2012-03-11 17:55:00 -0400] _aeris_: where is the configuration location for this  -i  ?
[2012-03-11 17:56:00 -0400] ssd7_: How did you install chef-client and what platform are you on?
[2012-03-11 17:57:00 -0400] _aeris_: debian, and installed from apt-get
[2012-03-11 17:58:00 -0400] ssd7_: Those look like the defaults for the init script on ubuntu, which can be set in /etc/default/chef-client
[2012-03-11 17:58:00 -0400] ssd7_: s/ubuntu/debian/
[2012-03-11 18:00:00 -0400] _aeris_: yes =)
[2012-03-11 18:00:00 -0400] _aeris_: 0 disable it ?
[2012-03-11 18:01:00 -0400] ssd7_: Well, I'm not sure the init script will let you disable it.  Disabling that option is basically the same as disabling the service though
[2012-03-11 18:04:00 -0400] _aeris_: indeed
[2012-03-11 18:06:00 -0400] ssd7_: yeah, so if you just stop the service and then disable it, you should be good to go
[2012-03-11 18:12:00 -0400] hoover_damm: if you don't want chef-client running, ensure you don't run the chef-client cookbook
[2012-03-11 18:13:00 -0400] hoover_damm: as it sets it up in runit / init.d / whatever
[2012-03-11 18:13:00 -0400] hoover_damm: ideally if you don't want chef-client running periodically like chef-client -i shove it in crontab
[2012-03-11 18:13:00 -0400] hoover_damm: or run it manually
[2012-03-11 18:13:00 -0400] hoover_damm: the only disadvantage with crontab is you should either add a --splay 1800 or really randomize your crons across production
[2012-03-11 18:14:00 -0400] hoover_damm: or you'll just really pound on the chef-server every time all your servers run chef-client at once
[2012-03-11 19:20:00 -0400] Viral: q: does anyone use Noah? how stable would you say it is?
[2012-03-11 19:29:00 -0400] matti: Viral: You can ask the author himself --> lusis
[2012-03-11 19:29:00 -0400] matti: ;d
[2012-03-11 19:30:00 -0400] Viral: @lusis: ping :)
[2012-03-11 19:31:00 -0400] Viral: @matti: thanks, i didnt notice he was hanging out
[2012-03-11 19:31:00 -0400] matti: No problem.
[2012-03-11 19:31:00 -0400] matti: But I recommend against using @ on IRC.
[2012-03-11 19:31:00 -0400] matti: This will not trigger high-lighting in most of known IRC clients ;]
[2012-03-11 19:31:00 -0400] matti: ;d
[2012-03-11 19:32:00 -0400] Viral: () <{ damn
[2012-03-11 19:32:00 -0400] matti: Viral: BTW, he likes when people go and tell him how awesome he is ;p
[2012-03-11 19:33:00 -0400] Viral: matti:  Like he even needs to be told how awesome he is :P
[2012-03-11 19:33:00 -0400] matti: Viral: Well... ;p
[2012-03-11 19:43:00 -0400] ranjibd: fujin, around?
[2012-03-11 19:59:00 -0400] simon_d: data bags - how does the workflow go with these? do I modify the data bags from my work station only or is it ok to make changes to databags on the server? (I'm self hosted)
[2012-03-11 20:00:00 -0400] Viral: simon_d: you can either upload them directly to your chef-server (see the knife commands) or create/edit them via the webui
[2012-03-11 20:01:00 -0400] simon_d: what if I modify a data bag using the webui, can I then modify it from my workstation using knife?
[2012-03-11 20:02:00 -0400] Viral: simon_d: see the `knife data bag` commands
[2012-03-11 20:02:00 -0400] simon_d: lol, just what i've done!
[2012-03-11 20:02:00 -0400] Viral: np
[2012-03-11 20:02:00 -0400] jtimberman: simon_d: pick whether your workflow is going to be to use knife and upload them, or use the webui and modify directly.
[2012-03-11 20:03:00 -0400] jtimberman: if you want them in version control, i recommend you use 'knife data bag from file'
[2012-03-11 20:03:00 -0400] simon_d: that is all ok for manual stuff. what about if I really want to automate this and generate the data in the data bags from some other source/database?
[2012-03-11 20:04:00 -0400] simon_d: I'm a small web host. I want to be able to spin up new servers when clients order
[2012-03-11 20:07:00 -0400] Viral: simon_d: automation / auto-scaling are complex topics, if you're just a small web host, i'd suggest just bootstrapping the servers for your clients, if you need automation you may want to look at using Chef:DataBag/Item directly or even further into the topic coronation services like Noah
[2012-03-11 20:08:00 -0400] Viral: simon_d: fyi: you're look at weeks to months of work, from my experience
[2012-03-11 20:10:00 -0400] simon_d: OK thanks. For now I am just bootstrapping my servers but I'm just trying to get things straight in my head so that I can start this with good practices in place so that when things do need to be automated at the next level I'm ready!
[2012-03-11 20:12:00 -0400] Viral: simon_d: skim chef's source, Databag / Knife::Ssh / Search get familiar with those, checkout Noah, it has a lot of good concepts https://github.com/lusis/Noah/wiki
[2012-03-11 20:13:00 -0400] simon_d: oK thanks. I just tried searching for Noah and didnt come up with much.
[2012-03-11 20:14:00 -0400] Viral: best of luck
[2012-03-11 20:14:00 -0400] simon_d: thanks
[2012-03-11 20:33:00 -0400] David_Miller: Hey has anyone seen really slow behavior with knife ssh -C N
[2012-03-11 20:34:00 -0400] David_Miller: when I do a concurency limit the command takes forever and I end up doing ctrl_c
[2012-03-11 20:36:00 -0400] erikh: David_Miller: I've had problems in the past with parallel ssh choking on missing hosts
[2012-03-11 20:37:00 -0400] David_Miller: hmm that could be an issue
[2012-03-11 20:39:00 -0400] nshb: anyone here on osx 10.6.x and have a quick sec to dump the contents of their /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb into http://gist.github.com ?
[2012-03-11 20:42:00 -0400] nshb: found it online.. http://cvsweb.dragonflybsd.org/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/locate/locate/updatedb.sh
[2012-03-11 20:45:00 -0400] David_Miller: I just did -C 10 and it worked great
[2012-03-11 20:45:00 -0400] David_Miller: earlier I did -C 5 and it never exited
[2012-03-11 20:46:00 -0400] David_Miller: go figure
