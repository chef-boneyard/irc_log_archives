[2012-03-24 07:58:00 -0400] neurodamage: for README.md files, how is chef parsing those for documentation and is there any specific format we need to follow other than the standard github markup?
[2012-03-24 07:58:00 -0400] neurodamage: thanks in advance btw
[2012-03-24 10:12:00 -0400] neurodamage: is there any README.md generator out there that anyone know's of that puts together the documentation necessary?
[2012-03-24 10:47:00 -0400] HasanB: ping
[2012-03-24 11:25:00 -0400] neurodamage: HasanB: pong
[2012-03-24 11:27:00 -0400] HasanB: neurodamage:   g'morn'n  <yawn>
[2012-03-24 11:48:00 -0400] neurodamage: HasanB: I feel ya
[2012-03-24 11:50:00 -0400] HasanB: grmbl grmbl .  feed the cat.   try not to fall into the toilet  look at my computer.  look at my bed.  look at my bed again.
[2012-03-24 12:04:00 -0400] HasanB: do you happen to know :-   in a recipe with a  'bash "xyz" do ...' block in it --- is it possible to alter a ruby variable from within the bash script? in other words ... use some bash result in Ruby
[2012-03-24 12:04:00 -0400] HasanB: (I'm writing my first cookbook)
[2012-03-24 12:54:00 -0400] neurodamage: HasanB: not really sure what the question is could you rephrase and possibly give the use case?
[2012-03-24 12:54:00 -0400] neurodamage: and I'd be happy to help
[2012-03-24 12:54:00 -0400] neurodamage: but remember things like script/exec/bash , all fork children processes
[2012-03-24 12:54:00 -0400] neurodamage: which makes them unique in a sense
[2012-03-24 13:19:00 -0400] HasanB: neurodamage: I'll try.
[2012-03-24 13:20:00 -0400] HasanB: in a recipe
[2012-03-24 13:20:00 -0400] HasanB: in a bash block
[2012-03-24 13:20:00 -0400] HasanB: i have a 'Here' block of bash scripting.
[2012-03-24 13:21:00 -0400] HasanB: in there I get some text into a variable.
[2012-03-24 13:22:00 -0400] HasanB: later, outside the "Here" block, I want to have that text in a Ruby variable.
[2012-03-24 13:22:00 -0400] HasanB: does that make sense?
[2012-03-24 13:24:00 -0400] spheromak: HasanB: what are you trying to get back from your shell
[2012-03-24 13:24:00 -0400] HasanB: I am studying how to do the same thing in Ruby rather than bash, but I'm new to both Ruby & chef.
[2012-03-24 13:25:00 -0400] HasanB: I grep'd a version number out of a cong file.
[2012-03-24 13:25:00 -0400] HasanB: I grep'd a version number out of a config file.
[2012-03-24 13:26:00 -0400] HasanB: brb
[2012-03-24 14:03:00 -0400] neurodamage: HasanB: I'm not sure that there's an easy way to accomplish what you're trying to do
[2012-03-24 14:04:00 -0400] neurodamage: that or I'm unaware of any message passing between the child and parent process in this case the parent being the chef run and the child being the forked bash/exec script
[2012-03-24 14:04:00 -0400] neurodamage: and I'm pretty sure once it returns out of the code block and is done executing it cleansup the memory space and program/code you ran in the bash script
[2012-03-24 14:34:00 -0400] HasanB: neurodamage: what you say makes perfect sense.  the more I think about it, the more I realise it's a job for Ruby not fot bash.
[2012-03-24 14:34:00 -0400] HasanB: (back in a few hours)
[2012-03-24 14:45:00 -0400] neurodamage: HasanB: awesome
[2012-03-24 14:46:00 -0400] neurodamage: glad you were able to figure it out
[2012-03-24 15:43:00 -0400] jkyle: saturday chef bonanza! morning folks
[2012-03-24 15:43:00 -0400] jkyle: knife node list returns results for me, but all knife search * commands on any attribute or glob return nothing
[2012-03-24 15:51:00 -0400] neurodamage: jkyle: what's the search you're doing?
[2012-03-24 15:51:00 -0400] neurodamage: can you show the command, yolu might be searching the wrong dataset in solr
[2012-03-24 15:51:00 -0400] schuckles: Sort of a general/stupid question. However, I'm looking for a 1st party application/binary repo that's compatible with both RHEL and Debian
[2012-03-24 15:51:00 -0400] schuckles: and C code as well as Java code
[2012-03-24 15:51:00 -0400] schuckles: I'm wondering what you all would recommend?
[2012-03-24 15:52:00 -0400] jkyle: neurodamage: knife search node with queries: 'id:*', 'name:*', 'hostname:*' etc
[2012-03-24 15:52:00 -0400] jkyle: neurodamage: when I knife node show node.name, the node is displayed with attributes populated
[2012-03-24 15:52:00 -0400] jkyle: neurodamage: the node also shows up in my chef-server and, oh and tried query 'id:*'
[2012-03-24 15:53:00 -0400] jkyle: v0.10.8
[2012-03-24 15:53:00 -0400] cwj: jkyle: is this on your own chef server? perhaps you need to rebuild indexes
[2012-03-24 15:53:00 -0400] jkyle: it is
[2012-03-24 15:54:00 -0400] cwj: knife index rebuild
[2012-03-24 15:54:00 -0400] cwj: i think
[2012-03-24 15:54:00 -0400] jkyle: I get a warning saying the operation is destructive...will I lose the nodes?
[2012-03-24 15:54:00 -0400] jkyle: "This operation is destructive."
[2012-03-24 15:55:00 -0400] cwj: i think thats warning you that the current indexes will be dropped
[2012-03-24 15:55:00 -0400] cwj: afaik you ought not to lose any data that's really there
[2012-03-24 15:56:00 -0400] jkyle: didn't work
[2012-03-24 15:56:00 -0400] jkyle: which logs might indicate the error?
[2012-03-24 15:57:00 -0400] cwj: you could start with the chef-solr logs
[2012-03-24 15:58:00 -0400] jkyle: k
[2012-03-24 16:05:00 -0400] jkyle: no errors, queries on a node produce logs like: INFO: [] webapp=/solr path=/select params={sort=&indent=off&start=0&q=content:name__%3D__*&wt=json&fq=%2BX_CHEF_database_CHEF_X:chef+%2BX_CHEF_type_CHEF_X:node&rows=1000} hits=0 status=0 QTime=2
[2012-03-24 16:06:00 -0400] jkyle: I restarted solr, no errors from that either
[2012-03-24 16:08:00 -0400] jkyle: ah, here we go. expander restart threw error: /usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems.rb:238:in `activate': can't activate eventmachine (~> 0.12.10, runtime) for ["chef-expander-0.10.8"], already activated eventmachine-1.0.0.beta.4 for ["amqp-0.6.7", "chef-expander-0.10.8"] (stack trace here)
[2012-03-24 16:08:00 -0400] jkyle: version issue?
[2012-03-24 16:12:00 -0400] jkyle: looks like I have duplicate versions of amqp and eventmachine gems
[2012-03-24 16:12:00 -0400] jkyle: s/dup/multiple
[2012-03-24 16:13:00 -0400] jkyle: eventmachine (1.0.0.beta.4, 0.12.10) & amqp (0.9.4, 0.6.7)
[2012-03-24 16:31:00 -0400] jkyle: back in business :)
[2012-03-24 16:32:00 -0400] jkyle: cwj: thanks for the debug tips! sometimes the hardest part is knowing where to start :)
[2012-03-24 16:32:00 -0400] cwj: no problem, glad you were able to noodle it out
[2012-03-24 16:58:00 -0400] jkyle: k, getting a binutils cookbook error for invalid version, the recipe expands to: apt-get -q -y install binutils-doc=2.21.0.20110327-2ubuntu
[2012-03-24 16:58:00 -0400] jkyle: where 2.21.0..... is an invalid version
[2012-03-24 16:59:00 -0400] jkyle: it's just a package do action :install end block
[2012-03-24 17:01:00 -0400] jkyle: so the nil version arg for the package resource seems to expand to an invalid version
[2012-03-24 17:01:00 -0400] cwj: is your recipe, or another recipe preceding it in the run list, calling apt-get update
[2012-03-24 17:02:00 -0400] cwj: so you can trust that apt knows about recent/valid package version
[2012-03-24 17:04:00 -0400] schuckles: most of my recipes are using apt-get update
[2012-03-24 17:04:00 -0400] schuckles: however, I'd like to use something that's more cross platform compatible
[2012-03-24 17:05:00 -0400] cwj: you might consider using the opscode 'apt' cookbook (http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/apt/source) which will call apt-get update
[2012-03-24 17:05:00 -0400] schuckles: what about for RHEL?
[2012-03-24 17:05:00 -0400] cwj: then you can put that in an ubuntu/debian specific role
[2012-03-24 17:05:00 -0400] cwj: there's a 'yum' cookbook too
[2012-03-24 17:06:00 -0400] schuckles: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/apt/source goes to a page that says 'Please select a file'
[2012-03-24 17:06:00 -0400] cwj: use the file browser to the left
[2012-03-24 17:06:00 -0400] cwj: recipes > default.rb
[2012-03-24 17:06:00 -0400] cwj: but i have no experience with it myself
[2012-03-24 17:07:00 -0400] jkyle: cwj: using apt
[2012-03-24 17:07:00 -0400] cwj: jkyle: so if you run `apt-get update && apt-get -q -y install binutils-doc=2.21.0.20110327-2ubuntu` manually you get invalid version?
[2012-03-24 17:08:00 -0400] jkyle: giving that a shot now
[2012-03-24 17:08:00 -0400] schuckles: well, on the same note, what do you all recommend as a apt repo?
[2012-03-24 17:09:00 -0400] jkyle: but, out of curiosity, why would a version not present in the repo be referenced by the package resource?
[2012-03-24 17:09:00 -0400] schuckles: jkyle: for testng?
[2012-03-24 17:10:00 -0400] cwj: jkyle: it wouldn't be.
[2012-03-24 17:11:00 -0400] cwj: if you dont specify a version, the package provider (in this case Chef::Provider::Package::Apt) queries the packaging subsystem (in this case apt) to figure out what the latest version is
[2012-03-24 17:11:00 -0400] cwj: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/provider/package/apt.rb
[2012-03-24 17:11:00 -0400] jkyle: hm
[2012-03-24 17:11:00 -0400] RJ2: hi, I'd like rabbitmq, and a modern erlang installed - the opscode rabbitmq cookbook depends on the erlang cookbook, which uses apt, which gives an ancient version of erlang. what's the best way to install R15 and have rabbit use it (without installing an ancient erlang from apt)?
[2012-03-24 17:12:00 -0400] RJ2: i could edit the rabbit cookbook to not depend on the erlang one, and then roll my own erlang install cookbook for R15. is that a sane approach?
[2012-03-24 17:12:00 -0400] jkyle: found in inconsistency with apt though, looks like it wants to update from a server not in our apt cache
[2012-03-24 17:13:00 -0400] cwj: RJ2: if you roll your own erlang install cookbook, you should probably not remove the erlang cookbook dependency from rabbitmq
[2012-03-24 17:13:00 -0400] RJ2: oh, i can call mine "erlang" and let it use that
[2012-03-24 17:13:00 -0400] cwj: you could probably patch the existing erlang cookbook and contribute it back if it made sense to do so
[2012-03-24 17:13:00 -0400] RJ2: the existing erlang one just uses package, and is at the mercy of the distro
[2012-03-24 17:14:00 -0400] RJ2: which is fine if you just want rabbitmq, but not if you do erlang dev and need a modern erlang, so i think the recipe is reasonable as it is
[2012-03-24 17:14:00 -0400] cwj: you could add a recipe that installs from source
[2012-03-24 17:14:00 -0400] RJ2: yeah i'll do that then, call it erlang, and leave rabbit alone
[2012-03-24 17:14:00 -0400] RJ2: thanks
[2012-03-24 17:16:00 -0400] cwj: np
[2012-03-24 17:16:00 -0400] cwj: jkyle: next time you can also use -l debug with chef-client/chef-solo to see debug output
[2012-03-24 17:16:00 -0400] cwj: and there will be a lot of it
[2012-03-24 17:17:00 -0400] cwj: but it will help you better understand chef's decision making process
[2012-03-24 17:17:00 -0400] cwj: as will reading the code
[2012-03-24 17:21:00 -0400] jkyle: I figured out part of it
[2012-03-24 17:23:00 -0400] jkyle: we use a proxy, so our sources.list looks like build-host:53211 or the what not. the apt package appends a few repositories, but uses the direct url for that repo e.g. security.us.ubuntu.com
[2012-03-24 17:23:00 -0400] jkyle: which times out on update
[2012-03-24 17:25:00 -0400] jkyle: so, networking issue
[2012-03-24 17:29:00 -0400] schuckles: jkyle: that will work for deb releases, but what about RHEL?
[2012-03-24 17:30:00 -0400] schuckles: I'm starting to think that the only way to do so will be to put 1st party binaries into GiT
[2012-03-24 17:35:00 -0400] jkyle: schuckles: we don't use rhel
[2012-03-24 17:35:00 -0400] hoover_damm: RJ2, erlang-esl
[2012-03-24 17:35:00 -0400] hoover_damm: RJ2, if you don't mind R15
[2012-03-24 17:35:00 -0400] hoover_damm: RJ2, it's a package set for debian/ubuntu that you can use (and I do) with Ubuntu Natty for RabbitMQ
[2012-03-24 17:36:00 -0400] RJ2: hoover_damm: thanks!
[2012-03-24 17:36:00 -0400] hoover_damm: http://www.erlang-solutions.com/section/132/download-erlang-otp
[2012-03-24 17:36:00 -0400] hoover_damm: RJ2, should provide enough so you can actually get the package, make sure you select the right distro/arch
[2012-03-24 17:37:00 -0400] hoover_damm: RJ2, you can use the apt recipe to add this repository btw
[2012-03-24 17:38:00 -0400] RJ2: hoover_damm: ah, if i add that repo, then add my own erlang cookbook that just does package "erlang-esl"  that should work as a dep for rabbit etc
[2012-03-24 17:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: https://gist.github.com/6e5f23f04d8060d9b962 is a example of it being used int he erlang cookbook
[2012-03-24 17:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: the key isn't right unfortunately and i'll admit that up front
[2012-03-24 17:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so if you can find the right gpg key, and make it work it'll work 100% otherwise you need to apt-get install force it
[2012-03-24 17:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: should be easy to find the key I hope
[2012-03-24 17:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: really should be http://binaries.erlang-solutions.com/debian/erlang_solutions.asc
[2012-03-24 17:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so I'm not sure if the last time I ran it, it didn't add that key
[2012-03-24 17:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and I just modified erlang to this
[2012-03-24 17:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so that way the dependency of chef was fairly straight forward
[2012-03-24 17:54:00 -0400] RJ2: ah yes the machine i want erlang r15 on has r13 because it was installed as part of installing all the chef stuff
[2012-03-24 17:54:00 -0400] RJ2: (i used the chef-box github repo to get 3 vms running with vagrant)
[2012-03-24 17:55:00 -0400] RJ2: but without chef i can't use chef to install erlang r15... do i have to just install erlang r15 from the deb as part of the bootstrap script that sets up chef?
[2012-03-24 17:57:00 -0400] cwj: i'm confused, one does not need erlang to run chef-client
[2012-03-24 17:58:00 -0400] RJ2: oh, then i have my deps in a muddle. erlang must've been installed for something else
[2012-03-24 18:01:00 -0400] RJ2: ah, looks like i had the chef server deps on all the VMs, not just the one acting as the chef server
[2012-03-24 18:02:00 -0400] RJ2: hoover_damm: yep that gist worked nicely, thanks (now that i've purged the older distro erlang packages)
[2012-03-24 18:06:00 -0400] hoover_damm: chef-server likely
[2012-03-24 18:06:00 -0400] hoover_damm: RJ2, excellent
[2012-03-24 18:27:00 -0400] miah: moin

[2012-03-24 20:52:00 -0400] jtgiri_: Hello, I am using knife to bootstrap  a server and set the environment like this: knife bootstrap 10.2.2.1 --environment staging , but when I do knife node list , it's still in _default environment, any idea why ?
[2012-03-24 20:53:00 -0400] cwj: hm have you tried -E in lieu of --environment just for kicks?
[2012-03-24 20:54:00 -0400] jtgiri_: Same thing
[2012-03-24 20:54:00 -0400] cwj: i know -E works for knife-ec2 server create subcommand, but i dont use bootstrap much myself
[2012-03-24 20:54:00 -0400] cwj: sounds like a boog
[2012-03-24 20:54:00 -0400] jtgiri_: Okay - thanks . I thought maybe I wasn't using it right
[2012-03-24 20:55:00 -0400] cwj: is it possible that your first chef run isn't succeeding when you bootstrap?
[2012-03-24 20:55:00 -0400] jtgiri_: yeah
[2012-03-24 20:55:00 -0400] jtgiri_: I had that issue
[2012-03-24 20:55:00 -0400] jtgiri_: is that why ?
[2012-03-24 20:55:00 -0400] cwj: i bet that would prevent the environment from being saved
[2012-03-24 20:55:00 -0400] jtgiri_: Ah okay
[2012-03-24 20:55:00 -0400] jtgiri_: I see
[2012-03-24 20:56:00 -0400] cwj: like, you probably had to readd items to the run list right?
[2012-03-24 20:56:00 -0400] jtgiri_: right
[2012-03-24 20:56:00 -0400] cwj: yeah thats probably why
[2012-03-24 20:56:00 -0400] jtgiri_: Okay
[2012-03-24 20:56:00 -0400] jtgiri_: that explains it - thanks
[2012-03-24 20:56:00 -0400] cwj: sure

[2012-03-24 22:49:00 -0400] cmceldowney: hi all having an issue spinning up a new chef server and connecting to it from a chef client
[2012-03-24 22:49:00 -0400] cmceldowney: server spins up correctly
[2012-03-24 22:50:00 -0400] cmceldowney: on client, running sudo chef-client, I get: ERROR: Connection refused connecting to : for 10.241.91.31/clients, retry 1/5
[2012-03-24 22:58:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: either your pointing the client to the wrong place (host:port) or the host didn't actually start the server correctly, or a firewall interfered
[2012-03-24 22:59:00 -0400] cmceldowney: kwanasolis: server side is working. I can access the web UI and see all my config/roles, etc. in there
[2012-03-24 22:59:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: check client settings
[2012-03-24 22:59:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: connection refused is basic network jargon
[2012-03-24 22:59:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: nothing magical
[2012-03-24 22:59:00 -0400] cmceldowney: understood.
[2012-03-24 22:59:00 -0400] cmceldowney: is there somewhere in client.rb that I should specify port?
[2012-03-24 23:00:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: make sure you can get from the client to the host on that port, nmap is your friend
[2012-03-24 23:00:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: I typically bootstrap my clients
[2012-03-24 23:00:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: which takes care of that for me once the repo is configured
[2012-03-24 23:00:00 -0400] cmceldowney: ok, as opposed to manually configuring chef client, you mean?
[2012-03-24 23:00:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: and I've never used the webui, so I'm only helpful for cli :)
[2012-03-24 23:00:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: basically
[2012-03-24 23:00:00 -0400] cmceldowney: yeah, WebUI is just sanity check
[2012-03-24 23:01:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: j,,. O
[2012-03-24 23:01:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: hmm, I'm on a fresh install, so I don't have a bootstrap command in my history buffer
[2012-03-24 23:01:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: but its pretty straight foward, you just need ot have ssh installed on the client, and you bootstrap from your workstation, which then pulls in chef-client and validates, configured, executes the first run
[2012-03-24 23:02:00 -0400] cmceldowney: ok. well, these are dynamically provisioned boxes, so it's a little trickier than that
[2012-03-24 23:02:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: mine are too
[2012-03-24 23:02:00 -0400] cmceldowney: using AWS CloudFormation?
[2012-03-24 23:02:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: linodes
[2012-03-24 23:02:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: all you need is the ip
[2012-03-24 23:02:00 -0400] cmceldowney: ok
[2012-03-24 23:03:00 -0400] cmceldowney: makes for some sequencing challengs, but let me see if that helps
[2012-03-24 23:03:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: why?
[2012-03-24 23:04:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: make sure the vps is built, somewhere your executing code that's got a .chef dir so it can even access the chef-server, at that 'somewhere' run bootstrap, once its finished the node is wrapped into the network
[2012-03-24 23:04:00 -0400] cmceldowney: well, I'm tossing webheads in auto-scaling arrays. but in order to bootstrap chef, I need to know the IP ahead of time.
[2012-03-24 23:04:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: and you don't get that back from provision time?
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: oh, right, aws
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] cmceldowney: :)
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: you don't get public facing ips
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: I don't have that problem
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: I get real ip's :)
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] cmceldowney: private IPs are fine too I'm all in the same zone so I don't have to get too fancy
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] cmceldowney: here's my client.rb on the client box
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] cmceldowney: log_level        :info
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] cmceldowney: log_location     STDOUT
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] cmceldowney: chef_server_url  "10.241.91.31"
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] cmceldowney: validation_client_name "chef-validator"
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] cmceldowney: # Using default node name
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] cmceldowney: file_backup_path   "/var/lib/chef"
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] cmceldowney: file_cache_path    "/var/cache/chef"
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] cmceldowney: pid_file           "/var/run/chef/client.pid"
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: well your chef server is wrong off the bat
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: be careful on spam too btw
[2012-03-24 23:05:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: use pastebins
[2012-03-24 23:06:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: let me find one of my nodes, hold on
[2012-03-24 23:06:00 -0400] cmceldowney: ah, good call. doesn't matter since this'll get crumpled up and deleted. and it's behind amazon security groups. thx for the heads up on that tho
[2012-03-24 23:06:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: about the spam? no I meant its annoying :)
[2012-03-24 23:07:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: chef_server_url  'http://ebrodeur.com:4000'
[2012-03-24 23:07:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: that's how it should look
[2012-03-24 23:07:00 -0400] cmceldowney: cool.
[2012-03-24 23:09:00 -0400] cmceldowney: awesome. much closer. thx for that
[2012-03-24 23:10:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: yeah, so chef binds to http, if you don't get specific its trying port 80
[2012-03-24 23:11:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: which is likely not open
[2012-03-24 23:11:00 -0400] cmceldowney: ya. we actually didn't have http in front of it which is what was causing the problem
[2012-03-24 23:11:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: gotcha
[2012-03-24 23:11:00 -0400] cmceldowney: now just getting 403 forbidden, 409 Conflict: Client already exists prolly because the client got registered in the first aborted bootstrap, maybe?
[2012-03-24 23:12:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: yeah
[2012-03-24 23:12:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: try knife client list
[2012-03-24 23:12:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: and knife node list
[2012-03-24 23:12:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: they should sync up (basically), if you've got trailing stuff just knife XX delete
[2012-03-24 23:13:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: chef doesn't clean up after itself after it fails :)
[2012-03-24 23:13:00 -0400] cmceldowney: ya. I've encountered that before. All this stuff works great when I run the knife commands muself. it's just tracking down when in this other framework
[2012-03-24 23:13:00 -0400] cmceldowney: I think this is gonna get us there Thanks so much Kwanasolis!
[2012-03-24 23:14:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: anytime
[2012-03-24 23:15:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: yeah, that basically sums it up
[2012-03-24 23:15:00 -0400] Kwanasolis: running it down when its wraped up
[2012-03-24 23:50:00 -0400] nicholasf: hi, anyone here using the postgresql cookbook? How do you work out what the password was set to?
