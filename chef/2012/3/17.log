[2012-03-17 07:21:00 -0400] josephholsten_: this is getting ridiculous
[2012-03-17 07:22:00 -0400] josephholsten_: it's one thing to port the git cookbook to windows
[2012-03-17 07:22:00 -0400] josephholsten_: but having to install .NET 4.0 so I can port mysql::client is a little much
[2012-03-17 07:22:00 -0400] josephholsten_: we're going to start needing conditional dependencies for cookbooks soon
[2012-03-17 07:24:00 -0400] josephholsten_: (as if the number of dependencies for the application cookbook weren't bad enough)
[2012-03-17 11:44:00 -0400] ch_: Hi there. I was wondering if anyone could help with a "EADDRNOTAVAIL" error when attempting to bootstrap a Ubuntu server VM
[2012-03-17 11:45:00 -0400] ch_: I can ping and SSH into the machine fine
[2012-03-17 12:02:00 -0400] dmistriotis_: Very fast question: I am studying chef and want to do things "the right way"
[2012-03-17 12:03:00 -0400] dmistriotis_: Suppose that I want to add a single user with zsh as default shell
[2012-03-17 12:03:00 -0400] dmistriotis_: what goes on cookbook, databag etc? I am a bit confused by the ontology
[2012-03-17 12:45:00 -0400] fujin: dmistriotis_: check the opscode users cookbook
[2012-03-17 12:47:00 -0400] dmistriotis_: @fujin thanks looking now
[2012-03-17 12:48:00 -0400] dmistriotis_: @fujin
[2012-03-17 12:48:00 -0400] dmistriotis_: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/users
[2012-03-17 12:48:00 -0400] dmistriotis_: so including the cookbook
[2012-03-17 12:48:00 -0400] dmistriotis_: creating a databag
[2012-03-17 12:48:00 -0400] fujin: yeh one item per user
[2012-03-17 12:49:00 -0400] dmistriotis_: and then do I need to assign the bag to a node?
[2012-03-17 12:59:00 -0400] fujin: no
[2012-03-17 13:00:00 -0400] fujin: bags are not associated to nodes
[2012-03-17 13:00:00 -0400] fujin: dmistriotis_: the users cookbook does a search for users data bags with like, group:sysadmin or something like that
[2012-03-17 13:00:00 -0400] fujin: Ii don't recall
[2012-03-17 13:01:00 -0400] dmistriotis_: In the specific tutorial, the cookbook "knows" a specific
[2012-03-17 13:01:00 -0400] dmistriotis_: databag and goes there
[2012-03-17 16:07:00 -0400] hcastro: does a ticket in jira need to be marked as resolved by the person committing a patch or by someone at opscode?
[2012-03-17 17:11:00 -0400] hoover_damm: hcastro, review the http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/How+to+Contribute
[2012-03-17 17:11:00 -0400] hoover_damm: that goes over all the details required for your changes to be included if you filed a ticket
[2012-03-17 17:25:00 -0400] tightwork: anyone know what the rackspace flavors are? since rackspace server list is broken atm
[2012-03-17 17:25:00 -0400] tightwork: I should be able to create, no?
[2012-03-17 17:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: tightwork, you can create... btw grab knife-rackspace from github
[2012-03-17 17:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: tightwork, it's been updated to working
[2012-03-17 17:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: tightwork, so just grab down knife-rackspace from github.com/opscode/knife-rackspace
[2012-03-17 17:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: make a gem install it, then knife rackspace flavor list
[2012-03-17 17:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: will work
[2012-03-17 17:31:00 -0400] hoover_damm: or do it in your gemfile
[2012-03-17 17:32:00 -0400] hoover_damm: your free to ask opscode (not me) why it's not been released yet
[2012-03-17 17:57:00 -0400] siezer: how in the hell have I not seen the infochimps cookbooks yet
[2012-03-17 18:00:00 -0400] cwj: siezer: been under any good rocks lately?
[2012-03-17 18:00:00 -0400] cwj: jk :D
[2012-03-17 18:00:00 -0400] cwj: i havent looked at them but i have heard a lot of talk on that there foodfight podcast
[2012-03-17 18:36:00 -0400] hoover_damm: siezer, heh... github.com/damm/cookbooks/tree/edge
[2012-03-17 18:36:00 -0400] hoover_damm: siezer, there's a graphite cookbook in there that uses runit and virtualenv
[2012-03-17 18:37:00 -0400] hoover_damm: siezer, provided you can cope with both... it should be a slapshot
[2012-03-17 18:37:00 -0400] hoover_damm: define the schema by the role... so it's super easy to support multiple priorities/etc
[2012-03-17 18:38:00 -0400] siezer: quoth the server, "404"
[2012-03-17 18:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/damm/cookbooks/tree/gentoo/graphite
[2012-03-17 18:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: damn
[2012-03-17 18:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i called the tree gentoo not edge
[2012-03-17 18:38:00 -0400] hoover_damm: sorry
[2012-03-17 18:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: don't forget to depends/include python
[2012-03-17 18:39:00 -0400] hoover_damm: only real bug with that cookbook is it's not loading python automatically
[2012-03-17 18:40:00 -0400] siezer: I've got enough yak clipping on the floor gentoo eh
[2012-03-17 18:40:00 -0400] siezer: er
[2012-03-17 18:40:00 -0400] siezer: \n
[2012-03-17 18:45:00 -0400] hoover_damm: heh if you think that recipe is really for gentoo only
[2012-03-17 18:45:00 -0400] hoover_damm: then it's your loss
[2012-03-17 18:47:00 -0400] siezer: nope, just trying to figure out if it's quicker to fix up the infochimps to work on centos, or grok and use yours =)
[2012-03-17 18:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: use mine
[2012-03-17 18:47:00 -0400] siezer: any chance you can break that off into its own git repo and update the license to apache2? ;)
[2012-03-17 18:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: siezer, the reason why I made my recipe is because none of them used virtualenv...
[2012-03-17 18:47:00 -0400] siezer: right
[2012-03-17 18:47:00 -0400] hoover_damm: the license is free as in beer dude
[2012-03-17 18:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: what more of a free license do you need?
[2012-03-17 18:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: i know that's not exactly a legit license, it's basically my way of saying this isn't licensed
[2012-03-17 18:48:00 -0400] siezer: the one that will let me use in the context of I-work-for-opscode ;)
[2012-03-17 18:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so it falls under public domain
[2012-03-17 18:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: right, you work for opscode so you should know what you can do with  PD right?
[2012-03-17 18:52:00 -0400] siezer: IANAL, but I'm pretty sure in order for this to get merged into the opscode cookbooks repo it needs to be slightly more formal
[2012-03-17 18:52:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I wasn't offering that
[2012-03-17 18:53:00 -0400] hoover_damm: and that cookbook isn't fully documented nor does it have 100% polish
[2012-03-17 18:53:00 -0400] hoover_damm: so it's 100% as sis
[2012-03-17 18:53:00 -0400] hoover_damm: as is
[2012-03-17 18:53:00 -0400] hoover_damm: but it does more then the infochimp / heavywater cookbooks out of the box
[2012-03-17 18:53:00 -0400] hoover_damm: imo
[2012-03-17 18:53:00 -0400] hoover_damm: I have several clients running it happily without an issue (obviously)
[2012-03-17 18:55:00 -0400] hoover_damm: anywho take it or leave it... /me &
[2012-03-17 18:57:00 -0400] tightwork: i'm using knife to create servers in rackspace, although ruby 1.8 is installed by default. Where is this set?
[2012-03-17 18:57:00 -0400] tightwork: i want 1.9
[2012-03-17 18:58:00 -0400] chip-: tightwork: I'm pretty sure that's done in the bootstrap scripts.
[2012-03-17 19:00:00 -0400] siezer: the full stack installers should become standard soon
[2012-03-17 19:00:00 -0400] siezer: tightwork use this bootstrap script: https://gist.github.com/1439774
[2012-03-17 19:32:00 -0400] df11: Having issues with encrypted data bags, getting "OpenSSL::Cipher::CipherError - bad decrypt", trace here: http://pastie.org/3612304, 0.10.8 on server/client, using default secret location and loading with: something_creds = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("databag", "item") -- any thoughts?
[2012-03-17 19:36:00 -0400] cwj: df11: any chance the key on one side or the other has a trailing \n?
[2012-03-17 19:36:00 -0400] cwj: sounds like the key for decrypt doesnt match the key you encrypted with
[2012-03-17 19:36:00 -0400] cwj: just a guess though
[2012-03-17 19:36:00 -0400] df11: cwj: nope, diffed the keys and they match
[2012-03-17 19:37:00 -0400] cwj: hash them for extra certainty?
[2012-03-17 19:38:00 -0400] df11: they match.
[2012-03-17 19:40:00 -0400] cwj: data_bag_key = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load_secret(node['data_bag_key'])
[2012-03-17 19:40:00 -0400] cwj: secrets = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load('secrets', node.chef_environment, data_bag_key)
[2012-03-17 19:40:00 -0400] cwj: thats how i load my encrypted data bag items
[2012-03-17 19:40:00 -0400] cwj: where node['data_bag_key'] is a remote url in my case
[2012-03-17 19:41:00 -0400] cwj: i dont know if you need to explicitly load the key when its in the default location
[2012-03-17 19:41:00 -0400] cwj: but you might want to try it
[2012-03-17 19:42:00 -0400] df11: yeah, i tried that already, no luck, i used '/etc/chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret' as my location.
[2012-03-17 19:43:00 -0400] cwj: have you used 'knife show data bag foo bar' to validate that item bar in bag foo is actually encrypted?
[2012-03-17 19:44:00 -0400] df11: yes.
[2012-03-17 19:45:00 -0400] cwj: i'd use shef to retrieve the encrypted contents of the item and make sure you're seeing what you expect there
[2012-03-17 19:45:00 -0400] df11: is there a value length limit or character issues?  some of my values are 3-4k characters.
[2012-03-17 19:45:00 -0400] df11: ok, trying.
[2012-03-17 19:45:00 -0400] cwj: not sure on character limits
[2012-03-17 19:48:00 -0400] cwj: i seem to recall someone was talking about a size limitation in solr or some other part of the search facilities, but i am having trouble finding
[2012-03-17 19:52:00 -0400] df11: cwj: not a common shef user, running shef -c /etc/chef/client.rb, and then data_bag_key = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load_secret('/etc/chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret'), and then secrets = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("my bag", "myitem", data_bag_key) and getting "TypeError: can't convert nil into String"
[2012-03-17 19:53:00 -0400] cwj: i think you want to run shef -z to enter client mode
[2012-03-17 19:54:00 -0400] df11: got it, it worked
[2012-03-17 19:54:00 -0400] df11: looking at my keys and encrypted values
[2012-03-17 19:56:00 -0400] df11: there does appear to be an appended "\n" to all of my values but i am not sure if that is an issue
[2012-03-17 19:58:00 -0400] cwj: in the decrypted values or the encrypted values?
[2012-03-17 19:58:00 -0400] df11: encrypted
[2012-03-17 19:59:00 -0400] df11: ah, maybe it is in the way i am accessing the hashes, doing: puts secrets["value"]
[2012-03-17 19:59:00 -0400] cwj: i see trailing \n on my encrypted values as well, so i dont think thats a probem
[2012-03-17 20:00:00 -0400] df11: sorry, value is a bad term, i mean the key for each one
[2012-03-17 20:01:00 -0400] cwj: i access mine as secret['foo'], i dont think thats a problem
[2012-03-17 20:01:00 -0400] cwj: are you running shef on the same node where your recipe fails?
[2012-03-17 20:01:00 -0400] df11: yes
[2012-03-17 20:01:00 -0400] df11: getting the same trace when i do puts secret['foo']
[2012-03-17 20:02:00 -0400] cwj: well i dont know how your data is structured, but 'it works on my machines' :/
[2012-03-17 20:03:00 -0400] df11: if i puts secret['id'] i get the correct value
[2012-03-17 20:04:00 -0400] df11: the id isn't encrypted though
[2012-03-17 20:04:00 -0400] cwj: right, id wont be encrypted
[2012-03-17 20:05:00 -0400] cwj: if you want to gist a redacted version of your unencrypted data bag item that might shed some light
[2012-03-17 20:09:00 -0400] df11: ok, maybe this is some insight, on my local system if i do: knife data bag show databag item --secret-file ~/.chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret, i get "ERROR: OpenSSL::Cipher::CipherError: bad decrypt" but if i do: knife data bag show databag item -s ~/.chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret, it works and shows the decrypted value.  something with knife maybe?
[2012-03-17 20:10:00 -0400] df11: running kinfe-ec2 0.5.10 locally.
[2012-03-17 20:10:00 -0400] df11: and maybe it didn't encrypt them properly to begin with (can't remember if i used -s or --secret-file)
[2012-03-17 20:11:00 -0400] cwj: hm
[2012-03-17 20:11:00 -0400] cwj: i always use --secret-file
[2012-03-17 20:11:00 -0400] cwj: -s is a different option for other subcommands
[2012-03-17 20:12:00 -0400] cwj: i.e. if you run knife --help it says -s is for specifying the server url
[2012-03-17 20:12:00 -0400] df11: yeah, i don't know.  seems really weird that it works with -s vs. --secret-file for me.
[2012-03-17 20:12:00 -0400] cwj: so, although it sounds like it works, thats kind of confusing
[2012-03-17 20:12:00 -0400] cwj: knife -v reports Chef 0.10.8 for you?
[2012-03-17 20:13:00 -0400] df11: yes.
[2012-03-17 20:19:00 -0400] df11: maybe a key length limit?  i used 1024 vs. 512 in the tutorial
[2012-03-17 20:21:00 -0400] df11: going to start from scartch with all these EDBs and hopefully it was a silly mistake.
[2012-03-17 20:22:00 -0400] cwj: it uses the aes-256-cbc cipher, so perhaps your key size is not compatible
[2012-03-17 20:22:00 -0400] cwj: not sure
[2012-03-17 21:08:00 -0400] df11: cwj: re-creation of all data bags solved it.  my guess is that i used -s and it didn't error so i thought it worked.  it is a bit confusing with those args, should i submit an improvement to either error if using -s with a file name or update the help section a bit to make it clearer?
[2012-03-17 22:03:00 -0400] Viral: q: how does one load a node object for actual changes?Chef::Node.load returns a Hash :(
[2012-03-17 22:08:00 -0400] Viral: nevermind: https://gist.github.com/2065750  this feels so wrong.
[2012-03-17 22:57:00 -0400] josephholsten: oh the joys of windowzifying cookbooks
[2012-03-17 23:18:00 -0400] Viral: @josephholsten : labour of love?
[2012-03-17 23:21:00 -0400] josephholsten: labour of supporting hacks that became infrastructure
[2012-03-17 23:21:00 -0400] josephholsten: excel as a service, I kid you not
[2012-03-17 23:30:00 -0400] tightwork: josephholsten: working with old hams?
[2012-03-17 23:30:00 -0400] tightwork: I have some old hams, they have years of scheduling in excel... terrible
[2012-03-17 23:30:00 -0400] josephholsten: \me twitches slightly
[2012-03-17 23:31:00 -0400] josephholsten: hams?
[2012-03-17 23:31:00 -0400] tightwork: old people
[2012-03-17 23:31:00 -0400] josephholsten: no, this is for very new people
[2012-03-17 23:32:00 -0400] josephholsten: actually, we've got a team porting excel formulas to work on hbase tables
[2012-03-17 23:33:00 -0400] josephholsten: so you can write excel instead of map-reduce
