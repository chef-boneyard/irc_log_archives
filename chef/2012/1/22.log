[2012-01-22 09:42:00 -0500] BryanWB_: ohai chefs!
[2012-01-22 12:22:00 -0500] rudolf_: hi
[2012-01-22 12:22:00 -0500] rudolf_: is this the channel for chef programming language?
[2012-01-22 12:23:00 -0500] rudolf_: i need some help in it
[2012-01-22 12:23:00 -0500] rudolf_: please reply if there is someone listening
[2012-01-22 12:28:00 -0500] laurent\: rudolf_: are you talking about this chef : http://www.opscode.com/chef/ ?
[2012-01-22 12:31:00 -0500] rudolf_: on :(
[2012-01-22 12:31:00 -0500] rudolf_: http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/chef.html
[2012-01-22 12:31:00 -0500] rudolf_: about this
[2012-01-22 12:36:00 -0500] laurent\: i guess the /topic will confirm that this is not the channel for this programming  language :)
[2012-01-22 15:15:00 -0500] yatesy: I see someone noticed the chef-repo accidental commits then :)
[2012-01-22 17:17:00 -0500] mleinart: what should the init command to trigger a run be? e.g. /etc/init.d/chef-client <trigger a run> (working CHEF-2881)
[2012-01-22 17:17:00 -0500] mleinart: run? trigger? execute? reload?
[2012-01-22 17:24:00 -0500] btm: mleinart: Tradition is that reload will reread the config file and nothing else.
[2012-01-22 17:24:00 -0500] mleinart: btm: yeah i see that the debian scripts already have a reload; i didnt realize chef-client took a -HUP
[2012-01-22 17:27:00 -0500] btm: mleinart: unless there is something already common (I'm looking for one) I think 'run' sounds best. I'm wondering if that command would be compatible with upstart too.
[2012-01-22 17:30:00 -0500] mleinart: ah yeah upstart..
[2012-01-22 17:31:00 -0500] btm: I fear upstarts developers would say, "why would a user ever want to signal a daemon? most users don't even care what a daemon is."
[2012-01-22 17:35:00 -0500] mleinart: hah
[2012-01-22 17:41:00 -0500] btm: from the docs, it looks like you can only emit a system-wide event, like 'chef-run' and then have chef pick that up :/
[2012-01-22 17:47:00 -0500] btm: mleinart: fetchmail uses 'awaken' which makes a lot of sense, but 'run' is probably more straightforward. up to you.
[2012-01-22 18:16:00 -0500] ashb: i've got a script that wraps sending the chef-client deamon a USR1 then tailing the logs files

[2012-01-22 20:16:00 -0500] lukes: how can i update a node's IP address after the stop/start of an ec2 instance?
[2012-01-22 20:17:00 -0500] lukes: eg "knife node show ec2-rails-instance" shows the wrong FQDN and IP after the ec2 instance was stopped and started
[2012-01-22 20:17:00 -0500] lukes: better to delete and recreate the node somehow?
[2012-01-22 20:20:00 -0500] lukes: nvm, best thing seems to be to ssh to the restarted instance and run chef-client
[2012-01-22 22:39:00 -0500] Damm: so pardon the newb question but what's with ohai and no ec2-metadata?
[2012-01-22 22:39:00 -0500] Damm: i'm not running in vpc.
[2012-01-22 22:43:00 -0500] Damm: bdha, on 0.6.10?
[2012-01-22 22:44:00 -0500] bdha: ...

[2012-01-22 22:46:00 -0500] Damm: i believe you i'm just trying to figure out wtf
[2012-01-22 22:46:00 -0500] bdha: What AMI?
[2012-01-22 22:46:00 -0500] Damm: gentoo
[2012-01-22 22:46:00 -0500] Damm: (modern)
[2012-01-22 22:46:00 -0500] Damm: I can give you the specific AMI if you'd like as it's public
[2012-01-22 22:46:00 -0500] Damm: but i don't know why the heck you'd boot it
[2012-01-22 22:47:00 -0500] Damm: it's just my own happy arse gentoo ami
[2012-01-22 22:48:00 -0500] Damm: you know how that goes i hope
[2012-01-22 22:50:00 -0500] Damm: the problem is ifconfig i guess isn't showing my neat hardware address
[2012-01-22 22:55:00 -0500] Damm: bdha, btw the problem is ifconfig got updated by coreutils
[2012-01-22 22:55:00 -0500] Damm: bdha, so i'm guessing the ec2 plugin is going to break
[2012-01-22 22:55:00 -0500] Damm: for lots
[2012-01-22 22:56:00 -0500] bdha: \o/

[2012-01-22 22:58:00 -0500] Damm: this is why running ifconfig and scraping it is bad
[2012-01-22 22:59:00 -0500] Damm: because when the format changes; you fail
[2012-01-22 22:59:00 -0500] Damm: and I know I know; who woulda thought ifconfig could change
[2012-01-22 22:59:00 -0500] bdha: :(
[2012-01-22 23:00:00 -0500] Damm: ohwell
[2012-01-22 23:00:00 -0500] Damm: for the purposes of this excercise I won't cry
[2012-01-22 23:04:00 -0500] Babar: Damm: ip addr list? :)
[2012-01-22 23:09:00 -0500] Damm: Babar, no
[2012-01-22 23:09:00 -0500] Damm: no food for you
[2012-01-22 23:09:00 -0500] Damm: j/k
[2012-01-22 23:10:00 -0500] Damm: Babar, I was confused figured it out based on the suckyness of ifconfig change
