[2012-01-01 14:02:00 -0500] millisami: Hi everyone,
[2012-01-01 14:03:00 -0500] millisami: I've been banging my head with this problem
[2012-01-01 14:03:00 -0500] millisami: Using the opensource chef server
[2012-01-01 14:03:00 -0500] millisami: Googling around, this is the exact problem I'm facing
[2012-01-01 14:03:00 -0500] millisami: Its described here http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2011-07/msg00150.html
[2012-01-01 14:03:00 -0500] millisami: and the thread is just left without any solution.
[2012-01-01 14:04:00 -0500] millisami: Can anybody plz plz look into it.

[2012-01-01 14:54:00 -0500] yorickpeterse: Guys, I have a question about bootstrapping a node. On my local computer I have the organization key, my user key and a knife.rb configuration file all nicely tucked in a .chef directory. Running $ knife client list shows the right client (ORG-validatior) so it seems these keys are all working nicely. However, when bootstrapping a node (said node runs on Arch Linux) I get a 401 error.
[2012-01-01 14:54:00 -0500] yorickpeterse: I looked through the support pages but sadly couldn't find anything helpful
[2012-01-01 14:54:00 -0500] yorickpeterse: I'm using hosted chef btw
[2012-01-01 14:55:00 -0500] yorickpeterse: Any clues as tho what might cause this? (if error messages and the like are needed I have plenty :))
[2012-01-01 15:12:00 -0500] yorickpeterse: Hm, manually creating the client in the web app and copying the private key to /etc/chef/client.pem fixes it for now
[2012-01-01 15:12:00 -0500] yorickpeterse: Still curious as to why knife bootstrap failed
[2012-01-01 15:14:00 -0500] maxrabin: hi. Newb here. I'm setting up chef server and clients and I am not sure how to proceed.
[2012-01-01 15:15:00 -0500] maxrabin: I installed chef server on a production machine
[2012-01-01 15:15:00 -0500] maxrabin: and set up the client on the dev machine
[2012-01-01 15:15:00 -0500] maxrabin: first question: I would like to manage the production machine with chef
[2012-01-01 15:16:00 -0500] maxrabin: so what is the terminology for that? making it a node? A client?
[2012-01-01 15:16:00 -0500] maxrabin: how do I register it as a node with chef?
[2012-01-01 15:28:00 -0500] maxrabin: Is it smart to run chef server and chef client on the same machine?
[2012-01-01 16:58:00 -0500] natea: if i make a change to a file in a cookbook, do i need to change the version # in order for Chef server to recognize that a change has been made?
[2012-01-01 17:21:00 -0500] asgmo: natea: No, just upload and it will work.
[2012-01-01 17:21:00 -0500] natea: asgmo: ok, cool. thx
[2012-01-01 17:22:00 -0500] natea: anyone know how the gunicorn cookbook works with a django virtualenv?
[2012-01-01 18:26:00 -0500] Damm: natea, that's basically sourcing bin/activate and then passing the environment
[2012-01-01 18:26:00 -0500] Damm: natea, a bit difficult in chef actually unless you want to read the file and then export it in the chef recipe
[2012-01-01 18:27:00 -0500] Damm: natea, but i'm sure there's other ways to accomplish it and still make it work without as much work
[2012-01-01 18:29:00 -0500] natea: Damm: this line seems like it should do the trick:
[2012-01-01 18:29:00 -0500] natea: https://github.com/coderanger/djangocon2011/blob/master/cookbooks/gunicorn/recipes/default.rb#L30
[2012-01-01 18:29:00 -0500] natea: but how to ensure that node["gunicorn"]["virtualenv"] gets set?
[2012-01-01 18:29:00 -0500] natea: it's an attribute passed to the gunicorn recipe from the application cookbook?
[2012-01-01 18:31:00 -0500] Damm: read the readme
[2012-01-01 18:31:00 -0500] Damm: https://github.com/coderanger/djangocon2011/tree/master/cookbooks/python
[2012-01-01 18:32:00 -0500] natea: not sure where to set it. there are several places where gunicorn is referenced:
[2012-01-01 18:32:00 -0500] natea: https://github.com/coderanger/djangocon2011/blob/master/cookbooks/application_python/providers/gunicorn.rb
[2012-01-01 18:32:00 -0500] natea: https://github.com/coderanger/djangocon2011/blob/master/cookbooks/application_python/resources/gunicorn.rb
[2012-01-01 18:32:00 -0500] Damm: then your not reading what I linked
[2012-01-01 18:32:00 -0500] Damm: and if your not reading what I linked; you likely won't understand what your reading
[2012-01-01 18:33:00 -0500] natea: well, i understand that python_pip accepts a virtualenv parameter
[2012-01-01 18:33:00 -0500] natea: as in:
[2012-01-01 18:33:00 -0500] natea: python_pip "gunicorn" do
[2012-01-01 18:33:00 -0500] natea:   virtualenv "/home/ubunut/my_ve"
[2012-01-01 18:33:00 -0500] natea:   action :install
[2012-01-01 18:33:00 -0500] natea: end
[2012-01-01 18:33:00 -0500] natea: but in this example, the virtualenv is hardcoded,
[2012-01-01 18:34:00 -0500] natea: whereas in our case, we want to pass the virtualenv set by the application
[2012-01-01 18:34:00 -0500] Damm: you gotta set it up first; then set it as a node attribute to pass it
[2012-01-01 18:34:00 -0500] Damm: can't get to step c, without setting up a
[2012-01-01 18:34:00 -0500] Damm: python_virtualenv "/home/bob/pypy" do
[2012-01-01 18:35:00 -0500] Damm: owner "bob"
[2012-01-01 18:35:00 -0500] Damm: group "bob"
[2012-01-01 18:35:00 -0500] natea: where do we set up the node attribute?
[2012-01-01 18:35:00 -0500] Damm: interpreter "pypy"
[2012-01-01 18:35:00 -0500] Damm: action :create
[2012-01-01 18:35:00 -0500] natea: sorry, we're both chef newbs
[2012-01-01 18:35:00 -0500] Damm: end
[2012-01-01 18:35:00 -0500] Damm: node['gunicorn']['virtualenv']="/home/bob/pypy"
[2012-01-01 18:36:00 -0500] Damm: and if your a newbie, i'd suggest taking your time and reading over the wiki
[2012-01-01 18:36:00 -0500] Damm: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources
[2012-01-01 18:36:00 -0500] natea: this seems to already be happening in the gunicorn/recipes/default.rb file:
[2012-01-01 18:36:00 -0500] natea: https://github.com/coderanger/djangocon2011/blob/master/cookbooks/gunicorn/recipes/default.rb
[2012-01-01 18:36:00 -0500] Damm: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Attributes
[2012-01-01 18:36:00 -0500] natea: there is an action:create followed by an action:install
[2012-01-01 18:37:00 -0500] Damm: right if you set it, it'll install it
[2012-01-01 18:37:00 -0500] Damm: so create in gunicorn/attributes/virtualenv.rb
[2012-01-01 18:37:00 -0500] natea: is that the right place to set it though? seems like it should be set by the application_python and passed to the gunicorn cookbook
[2012-01-01 18:38:00 -0500] Damm: gunicorn :virtualenv => "/home/bob/pypy"
[2012-01-01 18:38:00 -0500] Damm: well your trying to follow cookbooks; the readme and trying to understand the pattern that was made will be your key to using them
[2012-01-01 18:39:00 -0500] Damm: coderanger makes awesome cookbooks but those cookbooks look pretty awesome and pretty odd (to me)
[2012-01-01 18:39:00 -0500] Damm: so it'd take me a bit to find all the steps in order to use his cookbooks succesfully
[2012-01-01 18:39:00 -0500] coderanger: I did what in the where? :)
[2012-01-01 18:39:00 -0500] natea: Damm: there are many gunicorn attributes defined here: https://github.com/coderanger/djangocon2011/blob/master/cookbooks/application_python/resources/gunicorn.rb
[2012-01-01 18:40:00 -0500] natea: hey coderanger ! :)
[2012-01-01 18:40:00 -0500] Damm: coderanger, nothing bad, natea is just tryign to understand your djangocon recipes
[2012-01-01 18:40:00 -0500] coderanger: natea: Its a full wrapper for all features gunicorn offers
[2012-01-01 18:40:00 -0500] natea: happy new year!
[2012-01-01 18:40:00 -0500] Damm: and seems to be going in circles
[2012-01-01 18:40:00 -0500] natea: coderanger: we're trying to get your Packaginator + Chef project working,
[2012-01-01 18:40:00 -0500] natea: Damm: thx for your help
[2012-01-01 18:40:00 -0500] natea: coderanger: russf is working with me on this
[2012-01-01 18:41:00 -0500] Damm: I have nothing against python or django, this was just more of a lesson in how coderanger does chef recipes
[2012-01-01 18:41:00 -0500] Damm: likely people would say the same about me
[2012-01-01 18:41:00 -0500] Damm: and do
[2012-01-01 18:41:00 -0500] coderanger: natea: Heh, I can try and help once I wake up a bit more fully, can't quite brain yet
[2012-01-01 18:41:00 -0500] natea: coderanger: it appears that when we run the launch.sh script, the gunicorn config file gets created, but gunicorn doesn't get installed in django's virtualenv
[2012-01-01 18:42:00 -0500] coderanger: Oh right, virtualenv made --no-site-packages the default in the latest release
[2012-01-01 18:42:00 -0500] natea: coderanger: aftermath of NYE festivities? ;)
[2012-01-01 18:42:00 -0500] coderanger: that would, indeed, break it :-)
[2012-01-01 18:42:00 -0500] coderanger: Remember kids, always pin your versions
[2012-01-01 18:42:00 -0500] natea: 1aha
[2012-01-01 18:42:00 -0500] natea: aha!
[2012-01-01 18:42:00 -0500] natea: we were just talking about that the other day
[2012-01-01 18:42:00 -0500] natea: so the possible solutions are to:
[2012-01-01 18:43:00 -0500] natea: 1) pin to an earlier version of virtualenv that doesn't make --no-site-packages the default
[2012-01-01 18:43:00 -0500] natea: 2) keep the newer virtualenv, and change it to allow global site packages
[2012-01-01 18:44:00 -0500] coderanger: 3) fix the gunicorn recipes to grok venvs
[2012-01-01 18:45:00 -0500] coderanger: 4) include virtualenv in packaginators package list
[2012-01-01 18:45:00 -0500] natea: coderanger: realizing that in looking at the way you've constructed this chef project, there are many layers of abstraction and delegation
[2012-01-01 18:45:00 -0500] coderanger: https://github.com/coderanger/djangocon2011/blob/master/cookbooks/packaginator/recipes/default.rb#L11
[2012-01-01 18:45:00 -0500] coderanger: If you add gunicorn there it should JFW
[2012-01-01 18:45:00 -0500] natea: application -> application_python -> packaginator
[2012-01-01 18:47:00 -0500] natea: coderanger: so adding it to packages, will add it to the local virtualenv?
[2012-01-01 18:47:00 -0500] coderanger: Yes
[2012-01-01 18:48:00 -0500] natea: awesome, thanks!
[2012-01-01 18:48:00 -0500] russf: How can I run chef-client after tweaking a file in the chef cache, without it overwriting my changes?
[2012-01-01 18:49:00 -0500] russf: Purely for a kludgy test??
[2012-01-01 18:49:00 -0500] russf: ( natea is just telling me about coderanger: 's chef's hat at djangocon)
[2012-01-01 18:52:00 -0500] coderanger: russf: You can't, you have to update the server
[2012-01-01 18:55:00 -0500] russf: coderanger: OK. Thanks. How do you prefer to debug chef recipes. shef? or chef-solo?  I was looking at this: http://pivotallabs.com/users/chad/blog/articles/366-ruby-debug-in-30-seconds-we-don-t-need-no-stinkin-gui-  but that might be a bit more primitive than your approach.
[2012-01-01 18:55:00 -0500] coderanger: russf: I just upload to the server when I change them
[2012-01-01 18:57:00 -0500] coderanger: If you want to get fancy you can use a folder watcher to do it automatically on file change, but I don't usually bother
[2012-01-01 18:57:00 -0500] coderanger: Would make a nice knife plugin though :-)
[2012-01-01 18:58:00 -0500] russf: coderanger: Thanks for the tips!    'Nuther question: While we are iterating we are creating new AWS instances like crazy.  Is --purge on its way anytime soon?
[2012-01-01 18:58:00 -0500] coderanger: What is --purge
[2012-01-01 18:59:00 -0500] coderanger: You mean nuking the node and client at the same time, or mass delete?
[2012-01-01 19:01:00 -0500] natea: coderanger: success! http://ec2-184-72-93-92.compute-1.amazonaws.com/
[2012-01-01 19:01:00 -0500] russf: coderanger: We <3 you ;)  Just got the packaginator running, thanks to that tip!
[2012-01-01 19:03:00 -0500] russf: coderanger: probably both mass delete, and node and client at same time.  We did see the bash script for the node and client delete.
[2012-01-01 19:09:00 -0500] russf: coderanger: Thanks for your help!
[2012-01-01 19:09:00 -0500] natea: coderanger: here's the diff in case you want to apply it to the packaginator cookbook: http://dpaste.com/680002/
[2012-01-01 19:09:00 -0500] coderanger: natea: I'll ponder it, really the LWRP for gunicorn should be upgraded to do this for you
[2012-01-01 19:10:00 -0500] natea: ok
[2012-01-01 19:22:00 -0500] natea: coderanger: do you know if there's any chef recipe to use Amazon's tagging feature to better identify nodes?
[2012-01-01 19:22:00 -0500] natea: i thought knife's --node-name option would do it, but that only changes the name on the Chef server, not using Amazon's "Name" tag.
[2012-01-01 19:23:00 -0500] coderanger: No idea, I have vague memories that ohai reads those out
[2012-01-01 19:23:00 -0500] coderanger: but I don't think we set them because you could just do it in chef
[2012-01-01 19:23:00 -0500] natea: oh, ohai can read them, but can it write them too?
[2012-01-01 19:23:00 -0500] coderanger: ohai never writes anything
[2012-01-01 19:23:00 -0500] natea: when you're looking in the AWS dashboard, the nodes all look the same - no way to identify one from the other.
[2012-01-01 19:23:00 -0500] coderanger: its just a collector
[2012-01-01 19:24:00 -0500] natea: it's easy to do with boto, but don't know how to do it with chef/ruby
[2012-01-01 19:25:00 -0500] coderanger: I would think you would want to do it during startup, not in a recipe
[2012-01-01 19:26:00 -0500] coderanger: I would put it in the provisioning layer :-)
[2012-01-01 19:26:00 -0500] natea: right, but knife is the tool that is starting up the nodes
[2012-01-01 19:26:00 -0500] natea: so i would think that knife would be responsible for naming them
[2012-01-01 19:26:00 -0500] coderanger: Then stop using knife for that ;-)
[2012-01-01 19:27:00 -0500] natea: oh, what would you use instead?
[2012-01-01 19:27:00 -0500] natea: i saw a blog post about using CloudFormation with Chef
[2012-01-01 19:27:00 -0500] coderanger: Boto + PyChef + Fabric?
[2012-01-01 19:28:00 -0500] natea: http://www.full360.com/blogs/integrating-aws-cloudformation-and-chef
[2012-01-01 19:29:00 -0500] natea: i like knife but it seems to be missing a lot of key features and is quite buggy
[2012-01-01 19:29:00 -0500] coderanger: The knife cloud tools are nice for manual testing, but they are a far cry from a real provisioning layer
[2012-01-01 19:29:00 -0500] natea: i see
[2012-01-01 19:29:00 -0500] coderanger: Nor is it intended to be a real provisioning layer, obviously that would need to be a service somewhere not a one-run tool
[2012-01-01 19:30:00 -0500] ssd7: Happy New year Chefs!
[2012-01-01 19:30:00 -0500] natea: and you think boto and fabric are a better fit than using something like CloudFormation or Juju for the provisioning?
[2012-01-01 19:30:00 -0500] coderanger: Juju doesn't do provisioning, and CloudFormation is fine
[2012-01-01 19:30:00 -0500] coderanger: Or CloudKick, ASG, RightScale, etc
[2012-01-01 19:30:00 -0500] coderanger: Unfortunately there are very few tools in the arena
[2012-01-01 19:31:00 -0500] natea: didn't know CloudKick did provisioning, just monitoring.
[2012-01-01 19:31:00 -0500] coderanger: They can spin up new boxes, which makes it technically a provisioning system, just not a great one :)
[2012-01-01 19:31:00 -0500] natea: hadn't heard of ASG
[2012-01-01 19:31:00 -0500] coderanger: asg == auto-scaling groups
[2012-01-01 19:31:00 -0500] coderanger: Most of the tools that do exist are both commercial and lock-in driven
[2012-01-01 19:32:00 -0500] coderanger: CloudFormation is the closest to anything open that exists, but its really minimal
[2012-01-01 19:32:00 -0500] coderanger: Well, there are some other tools that are OpenStack-specific too
[2012-01-01 19:32:00 -0500] coderanger: but that isn't helpful
[2012-01-01 19:33:00 -0500] coderanger: The same guy that does little-chef is working on something called Overmind which is aimed to be a provisioning system, and there is TracClouds which does boto+pychef as a Trac plugin
[2012-01-01 19:34:00 -0500] coderanger: (though after last week I don't think I can recommend using anything trac-related until wandisco jumps in a river)
[2012-01-01 19:34:00 -0500] natea: i ran across spice weasel today
[2012-01-01 19:35:00 -0500] natea: yeah, i remember trying out Overmind awhile back
[2012-01-01 19:36:00 -0500] natea: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Spiceweasel
[2012-01-01 19:36:00 -0500] coderanger: spiceweasel is just a wrapper for knife
[2012-01-01 19:36:00 -0500] natea: right
[2012-01-01 19:36:00 -0500] coderanger: it has no persistent service side
[2012-01-01 19:36:00 -0500] natea: define your infrastructure as yaml or json,
[2012-01-01 19:36:00 -0500] coderanger: The deeper question is "what restarts failed servers?"
[2012-01-01 19:36:00 -0500] natea: and it generates the corresponding knife commands
[2012-01-01 19:37:00 -0500] natea: right, something like CloudKick or Scoutapp?
[2012-01-01 19:37:00 -0500] natea: any idea why celeryd isn't starting up? http://dpaste.com/680006/
[2012-01-01 19:38:00 -0500] natea: looks like a prob with kombu talking to redis
[2012-01-01 19:39:00 -0500] coderanger: No idea, sorry

[2012-01-01 19:43:00 -0500] natea: doesn't like 'verbose' for some reason :/
[2012-01-01 19:45:00 -0500] coderanger: Hmm, another new version issue I guess
[2012-01-01 19:50:00 -0500] natea: coderanger: if i want to use the latest cookbooks from opscode github repo, is this the best way to manage those? http://jetpackweb.com/blog/2011/06/12/manage-your-third-party-chef-cookbooks-with-knife-github-cookbooks/
[2012-01-01 19:50:00 -0500] coderanger: There is no best way right now
[2012-01-01 19:50:00 -0500] coderanger: Librarian is probably the closest, but its not a complete solution
[2012-01-01 19:51:00 -0500] coderanger: Its an ongoing question :)
[2012-01-01 19:51:00 -0500] natea: yeah, seems like a point of contention in the community.
[2012-01-01 19:53:00 -0500] coderanger: I think there is agreement that the style of Librarian (which is the style of Bundler/Pip) is the right way to go
[2012-01-01 19:53:00 -0500] coderanger: Just a bad time of year to get things done
