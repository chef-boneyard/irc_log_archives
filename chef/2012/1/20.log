[2012-01-20 09:12:00 -0500] BryanWB: buon giorno chefs!
[2012-01-20 09:54:00 -0500] nacer: bonjour les Chefs
[2012-01-20 09:55:00 -0500] nacer: !
[2012-01-20 09:55:00 -0500] nacer: BryanWB: :)
[2012-01-20 09:58:00 -0500] BryanWB: nacer: will b at fosdem?
[2012-01-20 09:58:00 -0500] nacer: BryanWB: nop
[2012-01-20 10:03:00 -0500] ranjibd: nacer?
[2012-01-20 10:03:00 -0500] bawt: nacer is this a machine you're upgrading or a fresh isntall of chef server
[2012-01-20 10:04:00 -0500] nacer: bawt: ?
[2012-01-20 10:05:00 -0500] nacer: ranjibd: ?
[2012-01-20 10:05:00 -0500] bawt: ranjibd: are there any good tools for trimming the repos that you mirror?  for example, doing the equivalent of a yum_priority plugin, but from the server side?  that way, you could make sure that EPEL doesn't conflict with some of your other repos.
[2012-01-20 10:07:00 -0500] ranjibd: nacer: ?
[2012-01-20 10:07:00 -0500] bawt: nacer: is that the solr package installs a custom configuration in the resources directory for the debian jetty
[2012-01-20 10:08:00 -0500] nacer: bawt: i don't know
[2012-01-20 10:35:00 -0500] nico: hi there
[2012-01-20 10:36:00 -0500] nico: I'm facing a little problem : I'm writing a cookbook, to distribute a sysctl LWRP and this one uses a tempalte for sysctl.conf. but my templates don't get synchronized on client
[2012-01-20 10:36:00 -0500] nico: any idea about why ?
[2012-01-20 10:37:00 -0500] nico: they do appear on the server of course
[2012-01-20 10:50:00 -0500] BryanWB: nico: u r writing a new sysctl cookbook or using the one that already exists?
[2012-01-20 10:51:00 -0500] nico: a new one
[2012-01-20 10:51:00 -0500] nico: the existing one does not satisfy me
[2012-01-20 10:52:00 -0500] BryanWB: nico: ok, butt i  don't understand what u mean by "templates don't get synchronized on client"
[2012-01-20 10:53:00 -0500] nico: the cache dir on the client does not have the templates
[2012-01-20 10:53:00 -0500] nico: not even the directory
[2012-01-20 10:53:00 -0500] nico: (cookbook cache dir)
[2012-01-20 10:53:00 -0500] BryanWB: weird
[2012-01-20 10:53:00 -0500] nico: sure
[2012-01-20 10:59:00 -0500] ranjibd: nico .. check  versions
[2012-01-20 10:59:00 -0500] ranjibd: of your updated cook book and the nodes environment
[2012-01-20 10:59:00 -0500] ranjibd: does it restrict the cookbook version?
[2012-01-20 11:21:00 -0500] nico: ranjibd: no restrictions on version
[2012-01-20 11:22:00 -0500] BryanWB: and u sure that the recipe is in the node's run_list?
[2012-01-20 11:22:00 -0500] nico: yes
[2012-01-20 11:30:00 -0500] ranjibd: knife coobook show `recipe name `
[2012-01-20 11:30:00 -0500] ranjibd: check which versions are there
[2012-01-20 11:30:00 -0500] ranjibd: and if your cookbook's metadata.rb version is higher or equal  to that
[2012-01-20 11:46:00 -0500] lukes: if a cookbook defines definitions (eg postgresql_user from https://github.com/mhluongo/chef-postgresql )
[2012-01-20 11:46:00 -0500] lukes: how can i call those from another cookbook?
[2012-01-20 11:47:00 -0500] lukes: i tried putting https://gist.github.com/94b9abe046ccaae8bc81 in cookbooks/my_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
[2012-01-20 11:47:00 -0500] lukes: but then i just get "NoMethodError: undefined method `postgresql_user' for #<Chef::Recipe:0xb6e90a3c>"
[2012-01-20 11:47:00 -0500] lukes: :(
[2012-01-20 11:52:00 -0500] BryanWB: lukes:  include_recipe "postgresql"
[2012-01-20 11:52:00 -0500] BryanWB: lukes: sorry, i c in your gist u already do that
[2012-01-20 11:53:00 -0500] lukes: yeah
[2012-01-20 11:53:00 -0500] lukes: but if that should work it's good to know
[2012-01-20 11:53:00 -0500] BryanWB: that should work
[2012-01-20 11:53:00 -0500] lukes: perhaps it's referring to the wrong postgresql or something
[2012-01-20 11:53:00 -0500] lukes: thanks
[2012-01-20 11:54:00 -0500] BryanWB: lukes: which postgresql ckbk u using?
[2012-01-20 11:54:00 -0500] lukes: i'm attempting to use this one https://github.com/mhluongo/chef-postgresql
[2012-01-20 11:54:00 -0500] lukes: which i cloned into my cookbooks directory
[2012-01-20 11:54:00 -0500] lukes: and uploaded
[2012-01-20 11:55:00 -0500] lukes: however i suspect i messed that up somehow
[2012-01-20 11:55:00 -0500] lukes: as knife cookbook list shows it's really called "chef-postgresql      0.11.1" and not postgresql
[2012-01-20 11:56:00 -0500] BryanWB: i would try include_recipe "chef-postgresql"
[2012-01-20 11:56:00 -0500] lukes: i'll try that, cheers
[2012-01-20 11:57:00 -0500] BryanWB: lukes actually better, rename his the cookbook dir from chef-postgresql to postgresql, and then upload
[2012-01-20 11:57:00 -0500] zts: you might need "depends 'chef-postgresql'" in your metadata.rb too
[2012-01-20 11:58:00 -0500] BryanWB: +1
[2012-01-20 11:58:00 -0500] lukes: cool, i'll try all those things and come back
[2012-01-20 12:09:00 -0500] lukes: right, that worked. renaming it from chef-postgresql to postgres and uploading that did the trick.
[2012-01-20 12:10:00 -0500] lukes: i had tried that before but that lead to there being lots of different versions of the postgresql cb
[2012-01-20 12:10:00 -0500] lukes: deleting all the other ones seemed to be the key there
[2012-01-20 12:10:00 -0500] lukes: thanks guys, very helpful :)
[2012-01-20 12:11:00 -0500] lukes: strange that it's postgresql 8.4 rather than 9.x though.
[2012-01-20 12:11:00 -0500] lukes: someone must have made a cb for 9.x.
[2012-01-20 12:12:00 -0500] lukes: the cookbooks on http://community.opscode.com/ seem a bit out of date. how do you find other ones, github search?
[2012-01-20 12:20:00 -0500] BryanWB: yes
[2012-01-20 12:21:00 -0500] BryanWB: it is annoying to update the version on c.o.c
[2012-01-20 13:53:00 -0500] lukes: is there a recommended way to enable custom sources on an ubuntu/debian instance (in /etc/apt/sources.list) ?
[2012-01-20 13:54:00 -0500] lukes: should i log in and manually do it for each node or script it or what?
[2012-01-20 14:05:00 -0500] BryanWB: lukes: the apt cookbook doesn't have a way to do that?
[2012-01-20 14:09:00 -0500] lukes: hm, i had not heard of the apt cookbook
[2012-01-20 14:09:00 -0500] lukes: i'll investigate
[2012-01-20 14:10:00 -0500] lukes: yeah that looks like what i want
[2012-01-20 14:10:00 -0500] lukes: BryanWB: thanks again
[2012-01-20 14:11:00 -0500] BryanWB: lwrps are the best ;)
[2012-01-20 14:16:00 -0500] lukes: yeah i like the mix and match concept
[2012-01-20 14:16:00 -0500] lukes: if this all comes together i'll be stoked
[2012-01-20 14:36:00 -0500] yfeldblum: hmm ... we need some rigorous knowledge & rigorous practices around building good Rs/Ps ... how to do correct analysis of current state & how to do correct state transitions & how to come up with proper non-leaky abstractions to put behind a resource interface ... opscode's low-level Rs/Ps look pretty good for the most part
[2012-01-20 14:41:00 -0500] nacer: i have a lot of  HTTP Request Returned 500 Internal Server Error: internal service error on api.opscode.com
[2012-01-20 14:41:00 -0500] nacer: today
[2012-01-20 14:42:00 -0500] yfeldblum: fnichol has some good providers ... https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm/blob/master/providers/ruby.rb
[2012-01-20 14:46:00 -0500] BryanWB: yfeldblum: good morning!
[2012-01-20 14:47:00 -0500] yfeldblum: BryanWB, good morning to you!
[2012-01-20 15:01:00 -0500] ctrabold: Any hints how I can colorize output from knife scripts? ui.color(), color(text, COLOR) [inspired by chef/lib/chef/knife/status.rb] does not work...
[2012-01-20 15:03:00 -0500] ctrabold: How can I access the CLI output lib used by knife to make my output fancy as well? ;)
[2012-01-20 15:04:00 -0500] matti: Colors?
[2012-01-20 15:04:00 -0500] bawt: Colors are great for bbs's
[2012-01-20 15:10:00 -0500] ctrabold: colors like "knife status"... green, red, yellow - no fance stuff but proven usefull for catching errors for example
[2012-01-20 15:12:00 -0500] matti: Can you write a custom formatter for Knife output as a plugin?
[2012-01-20 15:12:00 -0500] matti: I am not that familiar with Chef yet.
[2012-01-20 15:13:00 -0500] matti: ctrabold: I can see ... http://rubydoc.info/gems/chef/0.10.4/Chef/Knife/UI
[2012-01-20 15:13:00 -0500] matti: - (Boolean) color?
[2012-01-20 15:13:00 -0500] matti: Should colored output be used? For output to a terminal, this is determined by the value of `config`.
[2012-01-20 15:13:00 -0500] ctrabold: It's ruby - so I can do whatever I want but if "knife status" can already colorize output, I should be able to do this out of the box (think API) ... How can I get this magic in my own knife scripts?
[2012-01-20 15:14:00 -0500] Atlaz: hi
[2012-01-20 15:14:00 -0500] Atlaz: what's the default mysql password likely to be
[2012-01-20 15:14:00 -0500] Atlaz: and default user for that matter
[2012-01-20 15:14:00 -0500] ctrabold: matti thanks for the pointer! Will have a look on this.
[2012-01-20 15:14:00 -0500] Atlaz: if I spin it up with chef naturally
[2012-01-20 15:15:00 -0500] matti: ctrabold: ;)
[2012-01-20 15:15:00 -0500] matti: ctrabold: I don't know Chef interlans too well yet.
[2012-01-20 15:15:00 -0500] matti: ;]
[2012-01-20 15:19:00 -0500] Atlaz: anyone?
[2012-01-20 15:21:00 -0500] lukes: Atlaz: when i did it with postgres i could find it via "knife node show node-name -a node"
[2012-01-20 15:24:00 -0500] Atlaz: any idea what the command would be for mysql?
[2012-01-20 15:24:00 -0500] BryanWB: Atlaz: depends on your distro, it just uses the package that comes w/ your distro
[2012-01-20 15:25:00 -0500] Atlaz: inside the VM or on the host?
[2012-01-20 15:25:00 -0500] BryanWB: the vm
[2012-01-20 15:25:00 -0500] Atlaz: lucid32 base box
[2012-01-20 15:26:00 -0500] Atlaz: aha
[2012-01-20 15:26:00 -0500] Atlaz: unconfigured knife
[2012-01-20 15:26:00 -0500] Atlaz: bah... talk about a pita ;)
[2012-01-20 16:00:00 -0500] BryanWB: is using /etc/default/ the ubuntu equivalent to RedHat's  /etc/sysconfig ?
[2012-01-20 16:16:00 -0500] brett_h: it's not clear to me what the best/cleanest way to override attributes is. I have the apache2 cookbook, but then I have my own app-cookbook where I want to set [apache][listen_ports] = foo
[2012-01-20 16:17:00 -0500] brett_h: I tried putting it in app-cookbook/attributes/default.rb but that didn't seem to work
[2012-01-20 16:17:00 -0500] brett_h: thoughts?
[2012-01-20 16:21:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: brett_h, have you tried overriding attributes in environments or roles?
[2012-01-20 16:23:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: BryanWB, /etc/default is similar to /etc/sysconfig
[2012-01-20 16:25:00 -0500] BryanWB: atomic-penguin: tks
[2012-01-20 16:28:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: BryanWB, /etc/default usually contains options for init scripts if I'm not mistaken.  While /etc/sysconfig on RedHat contains a lot of the files written by the management TUIs in the admin tools package.
[2012-01-20 16:30:00 -0500] BryanWB: atomic-penguin: i c most EL init scripts loading /etc/sysconfig/some_app   for init script vals
[2012-01-20 16:31:00 -0500] BryanWB: hadn't noticed them referencing /etc/default/* before
[2012-01-20 16:31:00 -0500] BryanWB: could be jsut me
[2012-01-20 16:32:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: BryanWB, I concur
[2012-01-20 16:32:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: BryanWB, pretty much the same purpose then
[2012-01-20 16:35:00 -0500] lukes: has anyone set up nginx with rails on a node? and if so can i ask you some stuff before i storm into this?
[2012-01-20 16:37:00 -0500] lukes: i should read http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Build+A+Rails+Stack first i suppose
[2012-01-20 16:45:00 -0500] yfeldblum: lukes, what's up?
[2012-01-20 16:47:00 -0500] lukes: yfeldblum: i was really looking for someone to tell me which cookbooks they recommend to use to get a rails server running
[2012-01-20 16:49:00 -0500] ranjibd: yfeldblum, what are you trying to build  ? higher abstraction on top of chef's Rs/Ps or restful way to interact with them?
[2012-01-20 16:51:00 -0500] BryanWB: good night all and good weekend
[2012-01-20 16:52:00 -0500] lukes: BryanWB: g'night, thanks for the help
[2012-01-20 16:54:00 -0500] cap10morgan: what's the best way to contribute fixes to the opscode cookbooks on community.opscode.com ? "Add Comment" doesn't seem to work.
[2012-01-20 16:56:00 -0500] brett_h: cap10morgan: fork and pull request? https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks
[2012-01-20 16:57:00 -0500] cap10morgan: brett_h: great, that's what i was hoping the answer would be. thanks!
[2012-01-20 16:57:00 -0500] yfeldblum: lukes, you don't need extra cookbooks beyond the nginx cookbook (to install nginx and for conveniently declaring nginx sites), but you should study the opscode application::rails recipe, looking at it for an example of combining the deploy resource with other resources to make things work ... you will probably also want some way to keep the application running, so you might want to look into the runit cookbook too
[2012-01-20 16:58:00 -0500] yfeldblum: ranjibd, good knowledge of how to write tight abstractions that you can use in the rest of your infrastructure or that you can share, by writing your own R's and P's
[2012-01-20 16:58:00 -0500] lukes: yfeldblum: great, thanks
[2012-01-20 16:59:00 -0500] yfeldblum: ranjibd, basically means, good knowledge of how to do idempotence and how to do state-checking and state-transitions on multiple attributes
[2012-01-20 17:03:00 -0500] mgolisch: is there some easy way to run some chef recipes as another user on windows?
[2012-01-20 17:05:00 -0500] ranjibd: yeah... but then u have to only deal with certain resource right? like the execute execute .. and rest can be built on top of that,
[2012-01-20 17:06:00 -0500] ranjibd: yfeldblum, i am having a tough time distributing behaviors across my chef, mcollective and ci pipelines.. the integration points are kinda hazy
[2012-01-20 17:07:00 -0500] mgolisch: basicaly i want to run some powershell snipets as another user than the  user invoking chef-solo
[2012-01-20 17:18:00 -0500] ranjibd: we need the bawt to tell us jokes.. when no one is asking anything in the irc channels
[2012-01-20 17:19:00 -0500] fancybone: a rabbi, a priest, an an imam walk into a bar
[2012-01-20 17:19:00 -0500] fancybone: the priest and rabbi enjoy a beer but the imam can't, because muslims are forbidden from drinking alcohol.
[2012-01-20 17:20:00 -0500] fancybone: the end.
[2012-01-20 17:23:00 -0500] ranjibd: thats  not funny
[2012-01-20 17:25:00 -0500] yfeldblum: opscode: "Here's the grammar file we used." the link is wrong
[2012-01-20 17:25:00 -0500] yfeldblum: i'm interested in seeing that grammar file
[2012-01-20 17:26:00 -0500] fancybone: needs more jokes
[2012-01-20 17:26:00 -0500] yfeldblum: DDH on releasing rails-3.2.0: "So we didnt quite make the December release date as we intended, but hey, why break a good tradition and start hitting release targets now!"
[2012-01-20 17:26:00 -0500] yfeldblum: DHH*
[2012-01-20 17:33:00 -0500] ranjibd: yfeldblum, link?
[2012-01-20 17:33:00 -0500] ranjibd: grammer?
[2012-01-20 17:35:00 -0500] yfeldblum: http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/1/20/rails-3-2-0-faster-dev-mode-routing-explain-queries-tagged-logger-store
[2012-01-20 17:37:00 -0500] fancybone: A woman walks into a bar and asks the bartender for a double entendre.
[2012-01-20 17:37:00 -0500] fancybone: So he gave it to her.
[2012-01-20 17:46:00 -0500] chip_: Have a problem after a restart of my chef-server.
[2012-01-20 17:47:00 -0500] chip_: chef-server, chef-expander, chef-solr are all running, but all my knife search requests are coming back empty set
[2012-01-20 18:00:00 -0500] lukes: can someone tell me what this means "Using the node's run_state that contains the current application in the search" ? (from the application cookbook)
[2012-01-20 18:00:00 -0500] lukes: what's the run_state ?
[2012-01-20 18:05:00 -0500] thom: lukes: it's an attribute of the node
[2012-01-20 18:05:00 -0500] thom: chef > pp node.run_state
[2012-01-20 18:05:00 -0500] thom: {:template_cache=>{}, :seen_recipes=>{}, :seen_attributes=>{}}
[2012-01-20 18:05:00 -0500] thom: ie, what chef has processed in the current run
[2012-01-20 18:08:00 -0500] lukes: thom: right, thanks
[2012-01-20 18:10:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: howdy, my chef-server is suddenty  bloating up on disk usage for the root fs but I can't seem to pinpoint the file/folder/cause, ideas?
[2012-01-20 18:12:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: to be specific I've traversed all the directories and catalogues about 10GB of files, including a check on the couch size of only 386MB, so I'm not sure where another 30GB of my disk suddenly went...
[2012-01-20 18:15:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: /var/cache/chef/checksums/ is empty...
[2012-01-20 18:15:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: using couch version 1.0.1
[2012-01-20 18:16:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: gosh its quiet in here
[2012-01-20 18:17:00 -0500] NightMonkey: Everyone is in the kitchen. ;)
[2012-01-20 18:20:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: NightMonkey, any idea where the chef cache really is?
[2012-01-20 18:23:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: Chef is servin up my hdd platter as pancakes to the infrastucture, and not saving any for me.  Anyone know what the heaviest chef files/folders are for Version 0.9.18?
[2012-01-20 18:24:00 -0500] cwj: try /srv/chef ?
[2012-01-20 18:25:00 -0500] cwj: when in doubt `find / -iname chef -type d`
[2012-01-20 18:29:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: du -h /srv/chef
[2012-01-20 18:29:00 -0500] kbourdlaies:  returns about 1GB, not the droids we're looking for
[2012-01-20 18:35:00 -0500] miah: moin
[2012-01-20 18:35:00 -0500] miah: du -h --max-depth=1
[2012-01-20 18:36:00 -0500] miah: fun way to find out which dir's are eating space
[2012-01-20 18:36:00 -0500] ranjibd: kbourdlaies, couchdb compaction
[2012-01-20 18:36:00 -0500] ranjibd: chef cache in client side or in server side?
[2012-01-20 18:38:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: ranjibd, before running compaction, I was checking couch shows a size of only 367,890,530 -- curl http://localhost:5984/chef
[2012-01-20 18:38:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: ranjibd, am I wrong to assume that there is less than a GB of chef to compact?
[2012-01-20 18:39:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: thanks miah, I've already tried it as du -h from all the native folders to tally up about 10GB of accountable usage, the othe 30-35GB are a mystery.
[2012-01-20 18:42:00 -0500] brett_h: I know that 401 Errors have like 80 pages on the wiki, but does anyone know why a daemonized chef-client run might 401 while I can manually chef-client just fine?
[2012-01-20 18:42:00 -0500] brett_h: I'm using the opscode chef-client cookbook to install/rn it
[2012-01-20 18:44:00 -0500] miah: kbourdlaies: start with your du at / and follow the rabbit hole

[2012-01-20 18:47:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: necromancer, did you ever play Talisman?
[2012-01-20 18:47:00 -0500] necromancer: kbourdlaies: nope.
[2012-01-20 18:47:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: necromancer, nvm, thought it was the cause of your namesake
[2012-01-20 18:48:00 -0500] necromancer: kbourdlaies: nah, necromancer was the char i played in diablo 2
[2012-01-20 18:48:00 -0500] ranjibd: kbourdlaies, htop and sort by virt
[2012-01-20 18:48:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: atomic-penguin, thanks, I'll compact and see if there is relief despite numbers in couch showing no hope...
[2012-01-20 18:49:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: ranjibd, thanks
[2012-01-20 18:52:00 -0500] jslatts: anyone here ever have issues with chef-solr crashing on their chef instance?
[2012-01-20 18:54:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: jslatts, yes on 0.9.x releases
[2012-01-20 18:56:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: jslatts, you might try increasing the solr_heap_size
[2012-01-20 19:03:00 -0500] miah: i have seen solr crash when the owner of the /var/run/chef and /var/log/chef directory changes from chef to root
[2012-01-20 19:06:00 -0500] miah: which i dont see a bug on.. so i'll do that =)
[2012-01-20 19:09:00 -0500] gpapilion: I'm having issues with chef-10.8 restarting services via the notifies syntax.  my services don't restart, but are registered.
[2012-01-20 19:09:00 -0500] gpapilion: is this a syntax issue: https://gist.github.com/1649037
[2012-01-20 19:09:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: miah, good point
[2012-01-20 19:12:00 -0500] jslatts: atomic-penguin: I am running the latest version of chef. I'll look into the solr heap size. Lame thing is, I don't get any clues in any of the log files
[2012-01-20 19:14:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: jslatts, double-check the permissions in /var as miah pointed out
[2012-01-20 19:14:00 -0500] geekbri: anybody know if the java chef cookbook by opscode has been updated to handle the fact that sun java is no longer available to install via the partners repository ?
[2012-01-20 19:15:00 -0500] jslatts: atomic-penguin, miah: just checked. Perms look good
[2012-01-20 19:15:00 -0500] stphung_: for a package install, will it upgrade if there is a new version available?
[2012-01-20 19:20:00 -0500] asg: stphung_: yes if you use 'action :upgrade'. If you have 'action :install', it won't
[2012-01-20 19:21:00 -0500] stphung_: awesome thanks asg
[2012-01-20 19:21:00 -0500] asg: stphung_: you're welcome
[2012-01-20 19:40:00 -0500] gpapilion: can anyone tell me if there is a known issue with chef 0.10.8 and restarting services? I have a medium sized installation(300+ nodes) and this seems to have broken when moving from 10.4->10.8. jtimberman perhaps?
[2012-01-20 19:43:00 -0500] miah: gpapilion: elaborate?
[2012-01-20 19:43:00 -0500] gpapilion: https://gist.github.com/1649037 I zero out gmond.conf and it does not restart gmond
[2012-01-20 19:44:00 -0500] gpapilion: my co-workers and I have not seen chef restart a service the update
[2012-01-20 19:45:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: gpapilion, gmond is likely the problem, over chef
[2012-01-20 19:45:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: ssh to one of the trouble nodes
[2012-01-20 19:45:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: manually restart the service
[2012-01-20 19:46:00 -0500] gpapilion: done. I used pdsh to restart the gmond manually across the whole cluster. no issues.
[2012-01-20 19:46:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: you'll probably  see something has hung up gmond, not chef
[2012-01-20 19:46:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: hmmm
[2012-01-20 19:49:00 -0500] gpapilion: we were able to get ntp to restart by doing the following: https://gist.github.com/521bb95084ae4c80ff34
[2012-01-20 19:49:00 -0500] gpapilion: basically we enumerated all of the attributes, and it worked, but not until then.
[2012-01-20 19:51:00 -0500] miah: only time i see a issue with services restaring is when they are managed by upstart
[2012-01-20 19:51:00 -0500] Damm: and that's what you get for using upstart
[2012-01-20 19:52:00 -0500] miah: ya
[2012-01-20 19:52:00 -0500] miah: i dont do that anymore
[2012-01-20 19:57:00 -0500] spicyWith: has anyone managed to successfully run the apt recipe?
[2012-01-20 19:57:00 -0500] spicyWith: I'm having trouble getting the very simple apt-get update to work
[2012-01-20 19:57:00 -0500] gpapilion: so the consensus is its broken, and i should just enumerate every attribute?
[2012-01-20 19:59:00 -0500] peplin: hey, what's going on with github.com/opscode/chef-repo ? it doesn't look like this paulycom means to be committing there

[2012-01-20 20:14:00 -0500] miah: peplin: ya. thats a good question..
[2012-01-20 20:15:00 -0500] yatesy: oh dear, he must be staff and has access to the repo, probably accidently pushing to it

[2012-01-20 20:40:00 -0500] Matthaeus: Question about deep merge:  Is there a way to have role['users'] merge nicely with node['users'] instead of just being overwritten by it?
[2012-01-20 20:40:00 -0500] Matthaeus: Or is it preferable to just refactor the recipe to not expect an array and use a hash instead?

[2012-01-20 20:52:00 -0500] Matthaeus: matti:  I'm not doing anything manual; as I understand it, recipe defaults, role attributes, etc. get merged down into the node attributes according to a priority list.
[2012-01-20 20:55:00 -0500] kbourdlaies: miah, and friends, I was able to get back 68% of my disk by doing a service couchdb restart

[2012-01-20 21:13:00 -0500] danryan: but I can connect directly to the server using simple telnet
[2012-01-20 21:16:00 -0500] danryan: whoops, nm. It's the net/http bug
[2012-01-20 21:36:00 -0500] dkingofpa: Using the php cookbook and building from source, I get:  "configure: error: libpng.(a|so) not found".  libpng12-dev package is being installed by the source recipe.  Any thoughts?
[2012-01-20 22:03:00 -0500] slantview: how does one pass setting overrides to knife for knife rackspace commands?
[2012-01-20 22:07:00 -0500] slantview: for example, i have this working:
[2012-01-20 22:07:00 -0500] slantview: knife rackspace server create -r 'role[development]' --server-name dev01 --node-name dev01 --image 111 --flavor 2 -d rhel6-rbel
[2012-01-20 22:07:00 -0500] slantview: but i have a varnish cookbook and by default varnish listens on port 6081
[2012-01-20 22:08:00 -0500] slantview: but in vagrant i have it working to pass some json to set it to listen on port 80
[2012-01-20 22:08:00 -0500] slantview: but when i deploy to the rs cloud, i don't know how to pass the default overrides along
[2012-01-20 22:10:00 -0500] slantview: 329 people and nobody knows how to override default attributes?
[2012-01-20 22:11:00 -0500] iretd: Depending on the IP of the machine running chef-client, I'd like to assign different attributes to it (ie, its backup-server). Where should I do this? Roles? cookbook's attributes?
[2012-01-20 22:12:00 -0500] slantview: you would likely do it in a role instead of an ip address
[2012-01-20 22:12:00 -0500] slantview: you should consider the "role" of the machine to be completely independent of the ip address
[2012-01-20 22:13:00 -0500] iretd: Agreed, but depending where in the world it is, it will have (for instance) a different backup server.
[2012-01-20 22:13:00 -0500] slantview: i would use roles with "environments" in that case
[2012-01-20 22:14:00 -0500] iretd: A machine can be part of only one environment right?
[2012-01-20 22:14:00 -0500] slantview: that i'm not sure
[2012-01-20 22:14:00 -0500] slantview: i'm fairly newbish too, so i could absolutely be wrong
[2012-01-20 22:15:00 -0500] iretd: =)
[2012-01-20 22:15:00 -0500] lukes: using the rvm cookbook "sudo chef-client" still uses the stock 1.8.7 ruby rather than the rvm one
[2012-01-20 22:15:00 -0500] lukes: do you guys use rvm on your nodes?
[2012-01-20 22:16:00 -0500] slantview: lukes: when you run sudo it runs as root user, so you would need to set rvm to work with the root user as well
[2012-01-20 22:17:00 -0500] miah: iretd: yes. i believe a node can only belong to one enviornment at a time. but you may want to verify in code or elsewhere.
[2012-01-20 22:17:00 -0500] lukes: slantview: is that possible?
[2012-01-20 22:18:00 -0500] miah: iretd: ah yes. one only it appears
[2012-01-20 22:18:00 -0500] miah: ERROR: Chef::Exceptions::ValidationFailed: Option chef_environment's value ["dev", "stage"] does not match regular expression /^[\-[:alnum:]_]+$/
[2012-01-20 22:19:00 -0500] miah: in that, it expects a string and not an array
[2012-01-20 22:19:00 -0500] iretd: ahh thanks miah
[2012-01-20 22:20:00 -0500] iretd: miah: regarding determining attributes based on its IP, would you agree with slantview about using Roles instead?
[2012-01-20 22:20:00 -0500] slantview: lukes: i'm not sure how exactly to do it
[2012-01-20 22:20:00 -0500] ctrabold: lukes In my eyes RVM is great for local development but I don't like it on production servers / have bad experience with it. Even removing it caused pretty much hassle
[2012-01-20 22:22:00 -0500] yfeldblum: slantview, roles are for defining classes of nodes and setting their default/override attributes
[2012-01-20 22:22:00 -0500] yfeldblum: slantview, your case sounds like a good case for roles
[2012-01-20 22:23:00 -0500] slantview: if i had physically distributed nodes i would probably set the env to be region
[2012-01-20 22:23:00 -0500] slantview: but that's just me
[2012-01-20 22:23:00 -0500] slantview: i tend to stay in single datacenters for my work
[2012-01-20 22:23:00 -0500] yfeldblum: slantview, your httpcache role could have a default_attributes setting varnish listen port to 80, and it could add the varnish recipe to its run-list too
[2012-01-20 22:23:00 -0500] iretd: but then you lose the possibility of using env for dev/staging/prod :(
[2012-01-20 22:24:00 -0500] slantview: true
[2012-01-20 22:24:00 -0500] slantview: yfeldblum: i have it working correctly with vagrant
[2012-01-20 22:24:00 -0500] yfeldblum: slantview, why? why not just have either an ohai plugin or a cookbook early in the run-list which sets a node attribute to a region? do you plan to actually have customized run-lists and cookbook-versions and defaults/overrides per-region?
[2012-01-20 22:24:00 -0500] slantview: i just want to pass the attribute overrides to knife
[2012-01-20 22:25:00 -0500] slantview: sorry
[2012-01-20 22:25:00 -0500] slantview: two different conversations
[2012-01-20 22:25:00 -0500] slantview: the region stuff is a question iretd was asking
[2012-01-20 22:26:00 -0500] slantview: i should just add it to a role i suppose
[2012-01-20 22:26:00 -0500] yfeldblum: slantview, you can `EDITOR=vim knife node edit $NODE` and update the JSON structure
[2012-01-20 22:26:00 -0500] slantview: development role should just override the default attributes huh?
[2012-01-20 22:26:00 -0500] slantview: yeah but i'm trying to automate this so i can just "have it work"
[2012-01-20 22:26:00 -0500] yfeldblum: slantview, but yes i would do this in a role; i don't generally like setting attributes per-node
[2012-01-20 22:26:00 -0500] slantview: ok
[2012-01-20 22:26:00 -0500] slantview: i think that solves my question
[2012-01-20 22:27:00 -0500] yfeldblum: slantview, because setting attributes per-node as a long-term strategy makes automation harder, not easier
[2012-01-20 22:27:00 -0500] yfeldblum: slantview, setting default attributes in a role file in source control makes automation easier
[2012-01-20 22:28:00 -0500] slantview: as long as i have it running in chef-server, i'm ok with it
[2012-01-20 22:28:00 -0500] slantview: we have 2 classes of dev servers
[2012-01-20 22:28:00 -0500] slantview: one is local using vagrant
[2012-01-20 22:28:00 -0500] slantview: easy enough to override attributes in vagrantfile
[2012-01-20 22:28:00 -0500] msonnabaum: slantview: I also do all this in roles
[2012-01-20 22:28:00 -0500] slantview: the next is a remote testing server
[2012-01-20 22:28:00 -0500] msonnabaum: even with chef-solo, much easier to just make a bunch of roles and use different run lists when necessary
[2012-01-20 22:28:00 -0500] slantview: i was playing with knife-rackspace
[2012-01-20 22:28:00 -0500] slantview: ah
[2012-01-20 22:28:00 -0500] slantview: gotcha
[2012-01-20 22:29:00 -0500] slantview: mr mark, i feel like we connect on every social chat app :)
[2012-01-20 22:29:00 -0500] msonnabaum: lol
[2012-01-20 22:29:00 -0500] msonnabaum: serious
[2012-01-20 22:29:00 -0500] slantview: real life, skype, twitter and now irc lulz
[2012-01-20 22:29:00 -0500] slantview: you must be stalking me
[2012-01-20 22:29:00 -0500] slantview: :D
[2012-01-20 22:30:00 -0500] msonnabaum: funny enough, I actually have a vim alert on IRC which was set off earlier :)
[2012-01-20 22:30:00 -0500] miah: iretd: i wouldnt base it on 'ip' i'd instead base it on roles
[2012-01-20 22:30:00 -0500] miah: i work mostly with ec2 instances so ip is fully unknown to me
[2012-01-20 22:30:00 -0500] msonnabaum: slantview: here's how I override default attributes in a role: https://github.com/msonnabaum/drush-ci-chef/blob/master/roles/ci-server.json
[2012-01-20 22:31:00 -0500] slantview: k
[2012-01-20 22:31:00 -0500] slantview: got it
[2012-01-20 22:31:00 -0500] msonnabaum: also an example of how to install jenkins plugins in the role
[2012-01-20 22:31:00 -0500] slantview: so you keep a ci-server role then?
[2012-01-20 22:31:00 -0500] msonnabaum: yup
[2012-01-20 22:31:00 -0500] msonnabaum: that repo is what I use for ci.drush.org
[2012-01-20 22:31:00 -0500] slantview: so far i have web, db, memcahe and development roles
[2012-01-20 22:31:00 -0500] msonnabaum: then I'll create a run list with only that role
[2012-01-20 22:32:00 -0500] iretd: miah, thanks. I'd like to keep the information in a role, yet have the role be "auto-detected". Any idea if it's possible?
[2012-01-20 22:32:00 -0500] slantview: development is web+db+memcache+some extra stuff i don't want on prod
[2012-01-20 22:32:00 -0500] slantview: oh and solr too
[2012-01-20 22:33:00 -0500] msonnabaum: makes sense
[2012-01-20 22:33:00 -0500] slantview: mark are you guys running the knife-ec2 plugin?
[2012-01-20 22:34:00 -0500] slantview: ie. are you spinning up instances from knife or is that some other scripts?
[2012-01-20 22:34:00 -0500] msonnabaum: well, we run nothing chef. we're a puppet shop unfortunately
[2012-01-20 22:34:00 -0500] slantview: ah
[2012-01-20 22:34:00 -0500] msonnabaum: but I've played with knife-ec2 before and I like
[2012-01-20 22:34:00 -0500] slantview: i'm trying to make it so i can spin up rs cloud instances for feature branches
[2012-01-20 22:34:00 -0500] msonnabaum: just for provisioning and boostraping
[2012-01-20 22:34:00 -0500] msonnabaum: huh
[2012-01-20 22:34:00 -0500] slantview: lcoal development happens with vagrant
[2012-01-20 22:35:00 -0500] slantview: but we need to run tests for focus groups
[2012-01-20 22:35:00 -0500] slantview: and each "ux feature" that is being worked on can be independently
[2012-01-20 22:35:00 -0500] msonnabaum: yeah, I've had similar needs before
[2012-01-20 22:35:00 -0500] slantview: so i need a developer to be able to "show off" the feature branch
[2012-01-20 22:35:00 -0500] msonnabaum: do they need to be on different hardware or could they jsut be vhosts?
[2012-01-20 22:35:00 -0500] slantview: but the lifecycle might be days or weeks only
[2012-01-20 22:36:00 -0500] slantview: i suppose it could be vhosts, but i like the idea of independent servers so nobody steps on toes
[2012-01-20 22:37:00 -0500] miah: iretd: why auto-detected?
[2012-01-20 22:37:00 -0500] msonnabaum: sure, just potentially a lot simpler. Either way, it looks like jenkins provisioning a rackspace instance, bootstrapping it, then running chef?
[2012-01-20 22:38:00 -0500] miah: i think at some point its less autodetected and something saying "this system should be this". if that means your pxe server is passing details based on subnet then it at least knows the roles.
[2012-01-20 22:38:00 -0500] iretd: miah, thanks
[2012-01-20 22:38:00 -0500] slantview: msonnabaum: i'm still exploring a bit, but i was trying to let a developer/set of developers provision new servers directly.  our situation is a bit weird
[2012-01-20 22:39:00 -0500] slantview: we don't have a "production" environment
[2012-01-20 22:39:00 -0500] miah: i suppose though you could write a recipe that figures out what you want and then modifies the node and adds the appropriate roles
[2012-01-20 22:39:00 -0500] miah: but i've never done that
[2012-01-20 22:39:00 -0500] slantview: everything is test/integration
[2012-01-20 22:39:00 -0500] msonnabaum: huh
[2012-01-20 22:39:00 -0500] slantview: the production environment is a java application
[2012-01-20 22:39:00 -0500] iretd: miah, nah that sounds too tricky :P
[2012-01-20 22:39:00 -0500] slantview: with many many levels of engineering
[2012-01-20 22:39:00 -0500] miah: yes, well all of its going to be tricky
[2012-01-20 22:39:00 -0500] miah: easiest to just say "node is role[database]"
[2012-01-20 22:40:00 -0500] slantview: we are building a drupal based mimic of the real environment
[2012-01-20 22:40:00 -0500] slantview: for ux testing and approval
[2012-01-20 22:40:00 -0500] iretd: How does chef typically run on a machine once it's configured? cron?
[2012-01-20 22:40:00 -0500] slantview: the "big" environment takes weeks/months to get new features pushed.
[2012-01-20 22:41:00 -0500] msonnabaum: slantview: sounds like a combination of knife-rackspace and some well defined roles would do the job
[2012-01-20 22:41:00 -0500] slantview: word
[2012-01-20 22:41:00 -0500] slantview: thanks for the help
[2012-01-20 22:41:00 -0500] slantview: am i gonna see you on icq next or what? ;)
[2012-01-20 22:41:00 -0500] slantview: 3500364
[2012-01-20 22:41:00 -0500] msonnabaum: lol
[2012-01-20 22:48:00 -0500] btm: iretd: cron, run chef-client as a daemon, trigger it remotely via 'knife ssh'.
[2012-01-20 22:58:00 -0500] iretd: btm, thanks.
[2012-01-20 23:05:00 -0500] miah: iretd: daemon mode.
[2012-01-20 23:06:00 -0500] miah: you can of course run it from cron. i run it via runit
