[2012-01-28 17:39:00 -0500] ssd7: Ohai Chefs
[2012-01-28 19:36:00 -0500] iamsmrtk: Hey all, I'm having some issues with a chef node checking in. It looks like it's sending some bad JSON because my couchdb logs says "invalid UTF-8 JSON". Where can I find the JSON it's trying to upload?
[2012-01-28 19:37:00 -0500] erikh: look for anything that consists of binary data
[2012-01-28 19:37:00 -0500] erikh: usually that's the culprit
[2012-01-28 19:39:00 -0500] iamsmrtk: Where should I be looking? I have no idea where the bad JSON is coming from.
[2012-01-28 20:20:00 -0500] miah: HELLO
[2012-01-28 20:20:00 -0500] miah: I AM AT THE HACKDAY
[2012-01-28 20:25:00 -0500] macros: Are there any chef internals hackers at the hackday?
[2012-01-28 20:26:00 -0500] macros: I have a feature mostly implemented, though not very cleanly and no tests
[2012-01-28 20:29:00 -0500] miah: no idea
[2012-01-28 20:46:00 -0500] holoway: macros: coderanger is nearby
[2012-01-28 20:48:00 -0500] coderanger: holoway: Good timing, just got to the hackday :)
[2012-01-28 20:49:00 -0500] macros: :)
[2012-01-28 20:49:00 -0500] macros: Also would like to see something like a sinatra base app that has chef built in to easily build apps on top of the chef api
[2012-01-28 20:59:00 -0500] miah: i dont think i could recognize any of you
[2012-01-28 20:59:00 -0500] miah: im the tall obnoxious girl by the window
[2012-01-28 21:01:00 -0500] fujin: well get a beer and relax miah  :)
[2012-01-28 21:01:00 -0500] fujin: get some vegan pizza or whatever
[2012-01-28 21:03:00 -0500] fujin: miah: help macros and coderanger with macros' feature! =P
[2012-01-28 21:07:00 -0500] volker-: if I have two network interfaces (eth0, eth1) and I bootstrap the client via eth1 and the chef-server is only reachable via eth1, why does the client get then the IP from eth0
[2012-01-28 21:08:00 -0500] volker-: and how can I change the chef-client IP at the server?
[2012-01-28 21:09:00 -0500] fujin: volker-: you mean the 'ipaddress' attribute?
[2012-01-28 21:11:00 -0500] fujin: it gets the ipaddress from the interface with the default route
[2012-01-28 21:11:00 -0500] fujin: (the default interface)
[2012-01-28 21:11:00 -0500] fujin: network plugin populates 'default_route' 'default_gateway' and then 'ipaddress' based on that.
[2012-01-28 21:11:00 -0500] fujin: volker-: you have full access to the data it is performing that logic on, just uses the 'network' attribute.
[2012-01-28 21:11:00 -0500] fujin: https://github.com/opscode/ohai/blob/master/lib/ohai/plugins/linux/network.rb#L23-27
[2012-01-28 21:12:00 -0500] fujin: https://github.com/opscode/ohai/blob/master/lib/ohai/plugins/network.rb#L40
[2012-01-28 21:13:00 -0500] volker-: fujin: correct
[2012-01-28 21:14:00 -0500] fujin: so in the past if I have wanted ohai to pick up a particular network interface as the default, I use metrics to achieve that
[2012-01-28 21:14:00 -0500] fujin: you know, a route metric?
[2012-01-28 21:14:00 -0500] fujin: having two gateways is always a PITA unless you have route metrics working correctly anyway.
[2012-01-28 21:15:00 -0500] volker-: fujin: it's more of a public and a privat network.
[2012-01-28 21:15:00 -0500] fujin: heh
[2012-01-28 21:16:00 -0500] Damm: there is an iproute2 patch upcoming to ohai
[2012-01-28 21:16:00 -0500] Damm: that ctennis submitted
[2012-01-28 21:16:00 -0500] Damm: that should make ohai produce more results
[2012-01-28 21:16:00 -0500] volker-: fujin: thanks. have to check now how i can change it e.g. with knife
[2012-01-28 21:16:00 -0500] fujin: volker-: so what does the output of the route table look like?
[2012-01-28 21:16:00 -0500] fujin: .. that isn't really how it works
[2012-01-28 21:17:00 -0500] volker-: fujin: it takes the IP of the default route and not of the private net behind it which is running chef
[2012-01-28 21:17:00 -0500] fujin: if you change it with knife on the node, the next time chef runs ohai it will get set back to what ohai picked up
[2012-01-28 21:17:00 -0500] iamsmrtk: Hey all, I'm having problem with my client checking in, couchDB says something about some bad JSON but I'm not sure where I should be looking. Here's the trimmed down bit from my couch.log http://pastebin.com/rXSSxx44. I'm running chef 0.9.8 and ohai 0.5.6. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
[2012-01-28 21:17:00 -0500] fujin: right so how are you getting that ipaddress? show the code
[2012-01-28 21:17:00 -0500] fujin: are you doing a search or something?
[2012-01-28 21:17:00 -0500] volker-: fujin: nagios cookbook
[2012-01-28 21:18:00 -0500] thehar: hack hack hack
[2012-01-28 21:18:00 -0500] fujin: volker-: so the node objects included in the search result will contain both the local and public ipaddresses.. well.. all of that network information
[2012-01-28 21:18:00 -0500] fujin: you have to write code to pull out the attributes that you want.
[2012-01-28 21:18:00 -0500] fujin: I have a cookbook that makes this search-and-get-some-attributes pretty easy, take a look https://github.com/fujin/chef-discovery
[2012-01-28 21:19:00 -0500] fujin: nagios = Discovery.search("nagios_server, :node => node, :enviornment_aware => false)
[2012-01-28 21:19:00 -0500] volker-: fujin: hmmm. so there isn't a way without messing the cookbook to tell the server which ip a client is?
[2012-01-28 21:19:00 -0500] fujin: local_ipv4 = Disocvery.ipaddress(:remote_node => nagios, :node => node, :type => :local)
[2012-01-28 21:19:00 -0500] fujin: lol
[2012-01-28 21:20:00 -0500] fujin: i don't think you understand what you are saying by "tell the server which ip a client is"
[2012-01-28 21:20:00 -0500] fujin: if you want to get a different attribute out of the search result - just get it.
[2012-01-28 21:21:00 -0500] miah: macros feature?
[2012-01-28 21:21:00 -0500] fujin: you have full access to the network hash, the default_gateway/interface are being set correctly
[2012-01-28 21:21:00 -0500] macros: chef-client --collect_only
[2012-01-28 21:21:00 -0500] fujin: miah: macros (in the channel) was talking about a feature he wanted someone to look at @ hack day
[2012-01-28 21:22:00 -0500] miah: oh
[2012-01-28 21:22:00 -0500] miah: --collect_only ?
[2012-01-28 21:22:00 -0500] Damm: macros, so like run all the attributes but no recipes?
[2012-01-28 21:22:00 -0500] Damm: and all the collection mechanisms?
[2012-01-28 21:22:00 -0500] macros: Just run ohai and persist the node object
[2012-01-28 21:22:00 -0500] macros: We use ohai plugins
[2012-01-28 21:22:00 -0500] volker-: fujin: thanks. need to dig through it. also because the boxes have multiple interfaces
[2012-01-28 21:22:00 -0500] Damm: macros, yum!
[2012-01-28 21:23:00 -0500] Damm: macros, now your talking smart
[2012-01-28 21:23:00 -0500] fujin: pretty cool idea. you could read in the json_attribs as well.
[2012-01-28 21:23:00 -0500] macros: Yeah, it does :)
[2012-01-28 21:24:00 -0500] macros: Creates Chef::Client.run_collect_only
[2012-01-28 21:24:00 -0500] macros: And calls that instead of .run
[2012-01-28 21:24:00 -0500] fujin: neat
[2012-01-28 21:24:00 -0500] macros: Trivial changes
[2012-01-28 21:24:00 -0500] Damm: ugh what's with folks who like beecher's flagship cheese
[2012-01-28 21:24:00 -0500] Damm: crazy
[2012-01-28 21:24:00 -0500] macros: Could probably be a little cleaner
[2012-01-28 21:24:00 -0500] fujin: yeah fuck those people
[2012-01-28 21:24:00 -0500] fujin: i mean get some real cheese, asshats
[2012-01-28 21:24:00 -0500] fujin: (i don't eat cheese)
[2012-01-28 21:25:00 -0500] macros: I'm starting to explore more chef as descriptive system model
[2012-01-28 21:25:00 -0500] Damm: fujin, beecher's is a local cheese shop that loves to hand out curds fresh the same day
[2012-01-28 21:25:00 -0500] fujin: got ya
[2012-01-28 21:25:00 -0500] Damm: fujin, but to see the stuff online is weird
[2012-01-28 21:25:00 -0500] fujin: macros: would like to see a bit more of that
[2012-01-28 21:26:00 -0500] Damm: macros, gotta be better then catalyst blueprints
[2012-01-28 21:26:00 -0500] macros: Part of why I am asking for a base sinatra setup
[2012-01-28 21:26:00 -0500] fujin: well, it's obviously merb
[2012-01-28 21:26:00 -0500] macros: I would like to do something like rack tables built from node attributes
[2012-01-28 21:26:00 -0500] fujin: rack tables?
[2012-01-28 21:26:00 -0500] fujin: like inventory?
[2012-01-28 21:26:00 -0500] Damm: it's merb... and with the crap i've done recently
[2012-01-28 21:27:00 -0500] miah: i think the only person i recognize here besides my pal gba is jrobbins
[2012-01-28 21:27:00 -0500] Damm: i know how to convert a merb app to rails 3.2
[2012-01-28 21:27:00 -0500] miah: but there is easily 40 people here
[2012-01-28 21:27:00 -0500] fujin: miah: need nametag stickers
[2012-01-28 21:27:00 -0500] miah: seriously
[2012-01-28 21:27:00 -0500] fujin: there was easily 30+ at the one we ran in SF devops, kind of crazy
[2012-01-28 21:27:00 -0500] fujin: people just bunched up and hacked around eachother. cool though.
[2012-01-28 21:27:00 -0500] Damm: macros, system inventory on top?
[2012-01-28 21:27:00 -0500] macros: Yeah
[2012-01-28 21:27:00 -0500] Damm: macros, that's best if you embed the inventory data in dmi
[2012-01-28 21:28:00 -0500] Damm: then you can just dmidecode and pull it out and win
[2012-01-28 21:28:00 -0500] miah: i have been to 1 sf devops group
[2012-01-28 21:28:00 -0500] Damm: store it, then a couch call
[2012-01-28 21:28:00 -0500] macros: I have a basic dmidecode plugin
[2012-01-28 21:28:00 -0500] miah: it was in like... november?
[2012-01-28 21:28:00 -0500] macros: I need the chef-client memory work to make it more useful
[2012-01-28 21:28:00 -0500] macros: I am restraining myself in node object size
[2012-01-28 21:28:00 -0500] fujin: =\
[2012-01-28 21:28:00 -0500] Damm: yeah that's what i was worried about
[2012-01-28 21:29:00 -0500] Damm: having done inventory actually
[2012-01-28 21:29:00 -0500] Damm: (system inventory stuff)
[2012-01-28 21:29:00 -0500] Damm: the node setup isn't really designed well to accept it
[2012-01-28 21:29:00 -0500] Damm: (in my view, it's just too much data, that doesn't fit in the current design well)
[2012-01-28 21:30:00 -0500] Damm: let alone lenght issues
[2012-01-28 21:30:00 -0500] Damm: because in my head, what macros stores in DMI
[2012-01-28 21:30:00 -0500] Damm: is alot
[2012-01-28 21:30:00 -0500] Damm: and it's all 100% valid
[2012-01-28 21:30:00 -0500] fujin: i dunno? how many bytes ? kbs? are we talking about
[2012-01-28 21:30:00 -0500] fujin: how many characters total? where does the memory usage come from
[2012-01-28 21:30:00 -0500] Damm: they're not just in 1 dc
[2012-01-28 21:31:00 -0500] Damm: that's part of it
[2012-01-28 21:31:00 -0500] macros: I havknife search node "sysctl_vm.zone_reclaim_mode:0"
[2012-01-28 21:32:00 -0500] macros: I also want to encode rack numbers and lat/long in dc databags
[2012-01-28 21:32:00 -0500] macros: chef is the "model" of truth
[2012-01-28 21:33:00 -0500] fujin: If there was a way to dynamically adjust the search schema for some of the attributes, that might helpo
[2012-01-28 21:33:00 -0500] fujin: ignore a whole bunch of stuff
[2012-01-28 21:33:00 -0500] macros: Yeah, that is what I think is planned
[2012-01-28 21:33:00 -0500] fujin: I know the opscode guys are talkign about the incremental/partial result stuff
[2012-01-28 21:33:00 -0500] fujin: is that the mem work you were referrint o?
[2012-01-28 21:34:00 -0500] macros: There was also talk about expanding the query interface to accept an attribute list to return
[2012-01-28 21:34:00 -0500] holoway: macros: yeah, all that is in the forks
[2012-01-28 21:34:00 -0500] holoway: s/forks/works/g
[2012-01-28 21:34:00 -0500] fujin: nice
[2012-01-28 21:34:00 -0500] holoway: you can prune what gets saves already from a cookbook
[2012-01-28 21:34:00 -0500] fujin: i could have sworn 0.6 or 0.7 had an attribute list to return param to search, and we took it out for 0.8
[2012-01-28 21:34:00 -0500] holoway: fujin: yep
[2012-01-28 21:34:00 -0500] holoway: fujin: like a boss
[2012-01-28 21:35:00 -0500] fujin: I destroyed so many spaceship systems at cloudscaling by throwing the full node data at it (lolol)
[2012-01-28 21:36:00 -0500] fujin: tuplespace go buh-bye
[2012-01-28 21:36:00 -0500] macros: Pruning what gets saved always seemed wrong to me, the cookbooks aren't the only consumer
[2012-01-28 21:36:00 -0500] miah: so who else from #chef is here at this hackday?
[2012-01-28 21:52:00 -0500] macros: real0m1.924s
[2012-01-28 21:52:00 -0500] macros: To run --collect-only
[2012-01-28 21:53:00 -0500] macros: Though it isn't running my ohai plugins yet
[2012-01-28 21:54:00 -0500] macros: https://gist.github.com/1695881
[2012-01-28 21:55:00 -0500] macros: Interplay with --once and --daemonize could probably be better
[2012-01-28 21:55:00 -0500] macros: And not sure what tests should look like
[2012-01-28 21:55:00 -0500] macros: But seems to be working
[2012-01-28 21:57:00 -0500] defghanistan: Hi all, I am trying to bootstrap some windows boxes behind a firewall that doesn't allow external traffic. I have a proxy setup that works with my linux boxes (setting environment variable in bootstrap file) but am having issues getting the same results with windows to work with the proxy. Has anyone worked with running chef-client behind a proxy on windows?
[2012-01-28 22:31:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: hey, if I want to notify an execute block does the definition have to be contained in the same .rb file?  For example.  base.rb has include_recipe "supervisor::default" and wants to call 'supervisor update',  'supervisor update' is defined in supervisor:default.rb.  There should be no problems as long as the includes are done in the correct order right?
[2012-01-28 22:32:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: stil lgetting a grip on scoping of various definitions
[2012-01-28 22:51:00 -0500] yfeldblum: flashmanbahadur, you can `notifies :run, "execute[supervisor update]" from a resource declaration even if that resource declaration occurs earlier than `include_recipe "supervisor::default"`
[2012-01-28 22:51:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: ok
[2012-01-28 22:51:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: thanks
[2012-01-28 22:52:00 -0500] yfeldblum: keep in mind, that's a delayed notification, so the actual running of `supervisor update` will occur only after all of the resources declared anywhere have completely executed all of the actions assigned to them (after all directories have been created, templates have been written, executes have been run, etc)
[2012-01-28 22:55:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: ok, so it will run through the whole script before notifications are sent, so if I need it right away I should call it directly?
[2012-01-28 23:00:00 -0500] yfeldblum: if you need it right away, then you would have to `include_recipe "supervisor::default"` first, and then you can have some other resource declared later do a `notifies :run, "execute[supervisor update]", :immediately`
[2012-01-28 23:12:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: ahh k
[2012-01-28 23:22:00 -0500] floehmann: cd /windo 1
