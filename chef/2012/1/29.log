[2012-01-29 20:59:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: With a template file, is it possible to embed other templates inline?  I know in Rails you can use erb to include a header/footer erb to make it easier to get a consistent look.
[2012-01-29 21:00:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: Trying to dynamically generate a config file that changes depending on what other recipes are included, instead of using if servertype = blah   blocks
[2012-01-29 21:07:00 -0500] cwj: flashmanbahadur: not sure, ive never tried. i think it might require you to know the exact location on disk where the templates you'd like to include reside, which seems like a pain in the butt
[2012-01-29 21:11:00 -0500] yfeldblum: flashmanbahadur, chef does not have template partials (the parallel being to rails' view partials)
[2012-01-29 21:12:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: yfeldblum: ok, thanks
[2012-01-29 21:12:00 -0500] yfeldblum: flashmanbahadur, some software supports .d directories; is your case one such?
[2012-01-29 21:12:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: i dont think so
[2012-01-29 21:12:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: making a dynamic nrpe.conf that gets constructed based on the server role
[2012-01-29 21:13:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: its being read by AppFirst collector instead of nagios though, but same idea
[2012-01-29 21:14:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: I could probably do it in ruby by checkign some node configs
[2012-01-29 21:16:00 -0500] ranjibd: flashmanbahadur, i generally iterate of node.rceipes and check if they have an attribute name :nrpe, if yes, add them for nrpe mediated checks
[2012-01-29 21:16:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: ok
[2012-01-29 21:16:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: thanks ranjibd
[2012-01-29 21:17:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: do all of your servers have all of the check scripts and some just never run
[2012-01-29 21:17:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: or do you upload them dynamically as well
[2012-01-29 21:17:00 -0500] ranjibd: not all , thats based on tags
[2012-01-29 21:18:00 -0500] ranjibd: unless you have tagged monitor:off , it will be included for basic host monitoring .. other wise service list of generated from node.recipe and corresponding node[:recipe_name][:nrpe] attribute..
[2012-01-29 21:19:00 -0500] ranjibd: this way the recipe development is coupled with corresponding monitoring
[2012-01-29 23:05:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: whats the best way to manage the node_name attribute in client.rb during the bootstrap process, not finding where I can inject that property into the startup.  Do I have to modify it after setup and then register the new node_name with the chef server?
[2012-01-29 23:05:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: er wait
[2012-01-29 23:06:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: -N when passed to knife ec2 server create
[2012-01-29 23:06:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: nm
[2012-01-29 23:12:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: is there a way to access the node_name attribute after setup?  not seeing it in ohai
[2012-01-29 23:18:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: found it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7781624/node-name-in-chef-template
