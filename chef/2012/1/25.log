[2012-01-25 08:02:00 -0500] flowerpot: It looks like I'm missing files / have them in the wrong place somehow, but I don't see an obvious solution.
[2012-01-25 08:03:00 -0500] flowerpot: BryanWB, do you have a good resource you could share for how to install Chef on CentOS?
[2012-01-25 08:03:00 -0500] flowerpot: chef-server, I mean.
[2012-01-25 08:04:00 -0500] flowerpot: There is also no file named chef-solr on my system
[2012-01-25 08:04:00 -0500] BryanWB: flowerpot: trying chef-server on centos or ubuntu?
[2012-01-25 08:04:00 -0500] flowerpot: yes, on ubuntu.
[2012-01-25 08:05:00 -0500] flowerpot: No matter how I try to install it, it seems like services aren't automatically configured properly or files are missing...it's not going smoothly at all
[2012-01-25 08:06:00 -0500] flowerpot: The guides on Opscode's website don't seem to work well for Ubuntu on EC2.  Do you know of a good guide for Ubuntu or CentOS I could try?
[2012-01-25 08:07:00 -0500] BryanWB: this instructions work for me on centos but on my own hardware
[2012-01-25 08:08:00 -0500] BryanWB: if u try w/ centos, let me know the errors and I will try to help
[2012-01-25 08:12:00 -0500] flowerpot: BryanWB, which instructions do you mean?
[2012-01-25 08:20:00 -0500] BryanWB: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installing+Chef+Server+using+Chef+Solo, and see the CentOS notes
[2012-01-25 08:26:00 -0500] flowerpot: I'll give it a whirl
[2012-01-25 08:45:00 -0500] ranjibd: flowerpot, i just provisioned a chef server on ec2/amazon linux
[2012-01-25 08:46:00 -0500] BryanWB: flowerpot: ranjibd is much smarter than i, i recommend listening to him
[2012-01-25 08:47:00 -0500] ranjibd: flowerpot, what error u got when tried with apt ? that will be the fastest and easiest one to do...
[2012-01-25 09:03:00 -0500] flowerpot: ranjibd, I'll address that question in a second, but at the moment I'm workingg on getting it set up in centos 6
[2012-01-25 09:03:00 -0500] flowerpot: I get this error following the instructions, right at the chef-solo step:
[2012-01-25 09:04:00 -0500] ranjibd: ok..
[2012-01-25 09:04:00 -0500] flowerpot: http://pastebin.com/w6YdNpNJ
[2012-01-25 09:05:00 -0500] ranjibd: flowerpot, it wont work
[2012-01-25 09:06:00 -0500] ranjibd: the cookbook tar ball dont have that
[2012-01-25 09:06:00 -0500] flowerpot: Isn't yum the default package manager for CentOS?
[2012-01-25 09:06:00 -0500] ranjibd: http://blog.frameos.org/2011/05/19/installing-chef-server-0-10-in-rhel-6-scientificlinux-6/
[2012-01-25 09:06:00 -0500] ranjibd: try this
[2012-01-25 09:07:00 -0500] ranjibd: 4 step and you are done.. for centos6 at least ..  it will be 3 step if you have iptables already stopped
[2012-01-25 09:07:00 -0500] flowerpot: huh
[2012-01-25 09:07:00 -0500] ranjibd: no.. the error signifies a chef recipe named "yum"
[2012-01-25 09:08:00 -0500] ranjibd: which allows you to manipulate yum repos and their keys etc
[2012-01-25 09:08:00 -0500] ranjibd: atomic-penguin maintains it
[2012-01-25 09:10:00 -0500] BryanWB: flowerpot: copy in the yum/ cookbook from bootstrap-latest.tar.gz and then try
[2012-01-25 09:26:00 -0500] ranjibd: flowerpot, did that work? or you are still struggling with the chef solo .. :0)
[2012-01-25 09:40:00 -0500] flowerpot: ranjibd, BryanWB: looks like those 4 steps work.  I'll have to poke around more tomorrow.  thank you for your help
[2012-01-25 09:56:00 -0500] ranjibd: thanks to sergio for all the love on chef rpms
[2012-01-25 09:58:00 -0500] BryanWB: ranjibd: how much swap do you give your centos machines? i.e. what calculation do u use?
[2012-01-25 09:58:00 -0500] ranjibd: depends on the memorry
[2012-01-25 09:59:00 -0500] BryanWB: u still use 1.5 x RAM?   i have been just been putting 2GB for all my machines regardless of RAM
[2012-01-25 10:01:00 -0500] ranjibd: anything less that 2gig , 2x swap
[2012-01-25 10:01:00 -0500] ranjibd: for higher .. it depends.. upon the actual ram and what kinda app we'll run
[2012-01-25 10:01:00 -0500] BryanWB: do u use more than 2 gb ram on any machines?
[2012-01-25 10:01:00 -0500] ranjibd: we give 16 gig swap to 155gig Dell R710s
[2012-01-25 10:02:00 -0500] BryanWB: do u ever actually use it?
[2012-01-25 10:02:00 -0500] ranjibd: BryanWB, should work fine ..
[2012-01-25 10:02:00 -0500] BryanWB: w/ 2gb?
[2012-01-25 10:03:00 -0500] ranjibd: oh yes.. we run massive build grids using Go (ThoughtWorks CI product).. and Go being a java product particularly uses lot of memory
[2012-01-25 10:03:00 -0500] BryanWB: but doesn't the jvm die when it starts using swap?
[2012-01-25 10:04:00 -0500] ranjibd: and when it does not get enough of it.. it starts disk swapping ..
[2012-01-25 10:04:00 -0500] BryanWB: die as in slow down horribly
[2012-01-25 10:04:00 -0500] ranjibd: not really.. you can control it..the build grid run on openvz based private cloud..
[2012-01-25 10:04:00 -0500] ranjibd: where you can control almost all system parameter (like memory pages, cpu , diskquotas) without a downtime..
[2012-01-25 10:05:00 -0500] ranjibd: so,,,we dynamically change them vm to vm.. based on priorities ...
[2012-01-25 10:06:00 -0500] ranjibd: yes.. disk swapping has immense performance cost.. but as i said.. there can be use cases where you want that
[2012-01-25 10:07:00 -0500] ranjibd: also we do live migrations of containers .. like migrate a system which requires load of io to a ssd based physical server ... this kinda stuff requires swap
[2012-01-25 10:07:00 -0500] ranjibd: so,, as i said.. depends upon ur use case
[2012-01-25 10:11:00 -0500] BryanWB: tks
[2012-01-25 10:48:00 -0500] natrium42: does anybody know why /etc/init.d/chef-server (start|stop|status|restart) might not show any messages?
[2012-01-25 10:53:00 -0500] natrium42: ah, test -x $DAEMON || exit 0
[2012-01-25 10:54:00 -0500] natrium42: wtf, why did it install it to /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p0/bin/chef-server
[2012-01-25 11:02:00 -0500] natrium42: install instructions are wrong or outdated
[2012-01-25 11:27:00 -0500] laurent\_: has anybody ever written a rails app with chef as database backend ?
[2012-01-25 11:29:00 -0500] laurent\_: what would you use, chef lib from the rails app or the http api
[2012-01-25 11:58:00 -0500] laurent\_: nevermind i come to the same conclusion, it's simpler to modify chef-server-ui add the needed feature
[2012-01-25 12:34:00 -0500] ranjibd: laurent\_, you want to use Chef::CouchDB as the backend? or Chef::Rest and active resource ??
[2012-01-25 12:35:00 -0500] ranjibd: laurent\_, opscode was planning to migrate the webui to rails ..
[2012-01-25 12:38:00 -0500] BryanWB: yeah, i wouldn't touch the chef-server codebase now w/ a 10 ft pole
[2012-01-25 12:40:00 -0500] itwasntandy: ranjibd / BryanWB  for most purposes I'd set swap to 0, or at least set vm.swappiness=0
[2012-01-25 12:41:00 -0500] itwasntandy: as you really don't want a java app or similar hitting swap
[2012-01-25 12:41:00 -0500] BryanWB: itwasntandy: agreed, i leave the swap there in case our crap backup sw needs space
[2012-01-25 12:42:00 -0500] ranjibd: :-)
[2012-01-25 12:42:00 -0500] BryanWB: and because conventional wisdom says ur supposed have some swap, though not sure how correct that wisdom is
[2012-01-25 12:43:00 -0500] ranjibd: as i mentioned i do the same as we run build grids and im not sure the code that is under development will use swap or not.. so for me its better for me to have it along with monitoring in place to alert the appropriate contacts in case their vm/containers start  swapping
[2012-01-25 12:44:00 -0500] ranjibd: but for individual service hosting.. it's desirable to live without swap
[2012-01-25 12:50:00 -0500] aperezaranda: hi
[2012-01-25 12:50:00 -0500] itwasntandy: BryanWB: conventional wisdom says if you ever need swap, you're in trouble. It's better to fail hard, than degrade to crap. :)
[2012-01-25 12:50:00 -0500] aperezaranda: can remote_file handle urls ?
[2012-01-25 12:52:00 -0500] BryanWB: itwasntandy: +1
[2012-01-25 12:56:00 -0500] laurent\_: ranjibd: yep Chef::Rest and active resource
[2012-01-25 12:57:00 -0500] laurent\_: and i also heard about the move to rails. but i haven't seen any eta about it :)
[2012-01-25 12:58:00 -0500] laurent\_: it's not a big deal at all to play with the webui, i'll add some the features i need
[2012-01-25 13:02:00 -0500] ranjibd: laurent\_, what features tou are adding ?
[2012-01-25 13:02:00 -0500] ranjibd: s/tou/you/
[2012-01-25 13:03:00 -0500] ranjibd: write a afterhook .. for node creation ,
[2012-01-25 13:03:00 -0500] ranjibd: :-)
[2012-01-25 13:04:00 -0500] laurent\_: i'm going to give access to some of my collegue, i don't really want them to use knife (they will prefer the webui anyway), i'm going to implement some acl stuff on the webui and make a special partial for node creation
[2012-01-25 13:04:00 -0500] laurent\_: because i can't really ask them to use the js attribute editor :)
[2012-01-25 13:23:00 -0500] aperezaranda: Are there ":unzip" or similar to unzip a downloaded file with "remote_file" ?
[2012-01-25 13:25:00 -0500] ranjibd: notify an execute resource that will run unzip/tar -x from you remote file
[2012-01-25 14:03:00 -0500] packet911: anyone know of anyway to slipstream the client install into a windows 7 install ?
[2012-01-25 14:10:00 -0500] Andorbal: For testing purposes, I set up a chef server on EC2 but after reboot of the server, clients can no longer authenticate.  Are the keys used by chef tied to the hostname?
[2012-01-25 14:17:00 -0500] Andorbal: Is there a way to get chef server to regenerate its keys?
[2012-01-25 14:18:00 -0500] Andorbal: The wiki suggests deleting the keys and restarting the server, but that doesn't seem to work: the keys are not regenerated and the server does not seem to start
[2012-01-25 15:30:00 -0500] dkingofpa: I'm trying to upload a new cookbook to the community site, but get the error that my tarball doesn't include a metadata.json file.  How do I generate that if I'm only using chef-solo?
[2012-01-25 15:31:00 -0500] dkingofpa: I've tried "knife cookbook metadata mycookbook" from my cookbooks folder, but that didn't work.
[2012-01-25 15:38:00 -0500] hcastro: dkingofpa: any of this work? http://support.rightscale.com/06-FAQs/FAQ_0151_-_How_can_I_generate_the_metadata.json_file_from_metadata.rb%3F
[2012-01-25 15:41:00 -0500] dkingofpa: hcastro:  I had tried the -o option before, but that didn't work either.  "knife cookbook metadata mycookbook -o ."
[2012-01-25 15:42:00 -0500] dkingofpa: hcastro: And I don't have a rake file in my cookbook folder.  So that method didn't work either.
[2012-01-25 15:49:00 -0500] mattray1: dkingofpa: hmm interesting problem. I believe the metadata.json is from the Chef server, but you don't have one...
[2012-01-25 15:52:00 -0500] dkingofpa: mattray1:  yeah, when I run the command, there is zero outputeven with verbose.  If it didn't work for chef-solo, I was hoping it would at least tell me it couldn't connect to a chef-server.
[2012-01-25 15:53:00 -0500] mattray1: dkingofpa: sounds like a use case that should be handled. Please open a ticket at tickets.opscode.com
[2012-01-25 15:57:00 -0500] hcastro: dkingofpa: i'm pretty sure littlechef produced metadata.json files of cookbooks -- i'm just not sure if they're 100% the same as what chef server would produce
[2012-01-25 15:58:00 -0500] hcastro: dkingofpa: https://github.com/tobami/littlechef  also, you from pennsylvania?
[2012-01-25 16:01:00 -0500] dkingofpa: hcastro: thanks for the tip, alsoyes, what gave it away?
[2012-01-25 16:01:00 -0500] dkingofpa: mattray: I'll submit a ticket.
[2012-01-25 16:07:00 -0500] fish_: re
[2012-01-25 16:29:00 -0500] dkingofpa: mattray, hcastro:  thanks for the feedback, ticket created - http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2891
[2012-01-25 16:33:00 -0500] fish_: how do you run apt-get update (or whatever you use to update your distribution package list)? is there a way to run a apt-get update each time I use `package` to install new packages?
[2012-01-25 16:34:00 -0500] itwasntandy: fish_: there's somethign like that for the yum provider
[2012-01-25 16:34:00 -0500] itwasntandy: so I would check for what the apt provider does
[2012-01-25 16:37:00 -0500] dkingofpa: fish_:  Just include the default apt recipe in your recipe.  That will perform an "apt-get update" to make sure the package cache is up-to-date.
[2012-01-25 16:39:00 -0500] fish_: dkingofpa: we're doing that right now. but running apt-get update each chef run isn't that friendly and probably also violates the policy of most public debian mirrors
[2012-01-25 16:40:00 -0500] fish_: and even more important: if a mirror is down, it breaks the chef run even if no package is installed
[2012-01-25 16:40:00 -0500] dkingofpa: fish_:  Set up a cache on your network?
[2012-01-25 16:40:00 -0500] cwj: so use recipe[apt::cacher] and run a local cache
[2012-01-25 16:41:00 -0500] cwj: although i thought apt-cacher-ng was somewhat more stable
[2012-01-25 16:41:00 -0500] cwj: its been a while
[2012-01-25 16:44:00 -0500] fish_: I've setup a cache but a apt-get update can't really be cached
[2012-01-25 16:48:00 -0500] cwj: not sure how you figure that, the requests for package lists are sent to the cache as well if the caching mechanism is polling the upstream mirror every time it gets update requests then that seems like a bug
[2012-01-25 16:52:00 -0500] icoffey: jtimberman: would it be poor form to embed your omnibus bootstrap template script in an application?
[2012-01-25 16:52:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: icoffey, I use it in my kickstart
[2012-01-25 16:57:00 -0500] miah: moin
[2012-01-25 17:00:00 -0500] fish_: cwj: well I think it doesn't make much sense to cache the apt-get update since if you run that, you expect to have the most recent package list
[2012-01-25 17:01:00 -0500] fish_: anyway, it looks like it doesn't do it. since if the backend can't be reached, the apt-get update fails
[2012-01-25 17:05:00 -0500] mattray: fish_: there are 2 recipes, apt::cacher and apt::cacher-client that are incredibly simple.
[2012-01-25 17:05:00 -0500] mattray: the server uses apt::cacher and the clients use apt::cacher-client which uses search to automatically find the server and configure the proxy
[2012-01-25 17:06:00 -0500] mattray: everything you add after that gets proxied and all requests are handled
[2012-01-25 17:07:00 -0500] mattray: at some point I'll move it to apt-cacher-ng, but it "just works" and I've had zero issues with it
[2012-01-25 17:10:00 -0500] fish_: mattray: as I said, we already use apt-cacher-ng. but a apt-get update still fails when the backend isn't responding
[2012-01-25 17:12:00 -0500] mattray: which backend? The upstream server or the caching proxy?
[2012-01-25 17:12:00 -0500] mattray: because I think that's configurable in the caching proxy, how often to check upstream and how to handle intermittent internet connections
[2012-01-25 18:19:00 -0500] damienj: good morning part 3 :)
[2012-01-25 18:20:00 -0500] damienj: Anyone have any idea why my site-cookbooks are not being uploaded with knife on this 10.6 chef server?
[2012-01-25 18:20:00 -0500] damienj: only getting the standard 'cookbooks' dir...
[2012-01-25 18:20:00 -0500] damienj: seems to be ignoring my site-cookbooks
[2012-01-25 18:22:00 -0500] damienj: oh nvm
[2012-01-25 18:22:00 -0500] damienj: my ~/.chef/knife.rb only lists that folder explicitly :)
[2012-01-25 18:28:00 -0500] tolland: does rabbitmq have a pid file to monitor?
[2012-01-25 18:33:00 -0500] brandoma: it does, it is commonly defined in rabbitmq-env.conf although your installation may vary
[2012-01-25 18:56:00 -0500] dajia: Hello, all.  I have a shell script that concatenates four seperate files (certificates) into a single file.  I would like to move this into chef, but I cannot place the final file into chef's control at the moment.  Is there some trick I can use to merge files using templates or something?
[2012-01-25 18:58:00 -0500] ssd7: dajia: Well, there are a number of possibilities.  You could have a template that does a File.read() on other files.
[2012-01-25 18:59:00 -0500] dajia: Okay, I can see that, once I learn how to put ruby code in my templates.  Is that what you would do?
[2012-01-25 19:02:00 -0500] ssd7_: Hmm.  To be honest, I'm unsure.  I think it is where I would start, along with some not_if/only_if clauses to ensure the files exist
[2012-01-25 19:02:00 -0500] ssd7_: (sorry, moved from wired to wireless, got reset)
[2012-01-25 19:36:00 -0500] dajia: ssd7: Do you have any examples of using Ruby code (like File.read() in a template?
[2012-01-25 19:36:00 -0500] holoway: dajia: you can just do it
[2012-01-25 19:36:00 -0500] holoway: dajia: <%= File.read("whatever") %>
[2012-01-25 19:36:00 -0500] holoway: would insert the contents of that file at that place in the template
[2012-01-25 19:54:00 -0500] dajia: Excellent.
[2012-01-25 19:55:00 -0500] dajia: I suppose my other option might be to put the certificates in a data bag.  But that would make for some rather long strings...
[2012-01-25 19:57:00 -0500] holoway: dajia: but easy to encrypt there, and handy to extract
[2012-01-25 19:57:00 -0500] betamatt: dajia: actually, i think that's the right move.
[2012-01-25 19:57:00 -0500] betamatt: what he said :)
[2012-01-25 19:58:00 -0500] dajia: OKay, so this isn't really a chef question, but here goes:  A certificate file has a ----BEGIN blah blah ----- line, then a bunch of other lines.  If I leave those line breaks in, it will break the JSON, correct?
[2012-01-25 19:58:00 -0500] dajia: and if I remove them, will it break the certificate?
[2012-01-25 19:58:00 -0500] holoway: dajia: it won't break it
[2012-01-25 19:58:00 -0500] holoway: you can have newlines in a string
[2012-01-25 19:59:00 -0500] dajia: Hmm...I thought I tried that once.  I'll have another look.
[2012-01-25 20:00:00 -0500] dajia: Yeah, I have a simple json with an ID and one cert, in a multi-line string (with \n newlines) and knife data bag from file fails.
[2012-01-25 20:03:00 -0500] jbz: dajia: Does it pass jsonlint.com?
[2012-01-25 20:03:00 -0500] jbz: (oh, if it's a private/unencrypted cert, maybe you shouldn't use that, sorry)
[2012-01-25 20:04:00 -0500] dajia: Heh.  'sokay.  I can fabricate several lines of pseudo-cert.
[2012-01-25 20:05:00 -0500] dajia: It fails there, too.
[2012-01-25 20:05:00 -0500] dajia: Is the string delimiter different for a multi-line string in json, or is it just a " ?
[2012-01-25 20:09:00 -0500] fujin: dajia: I always read the file into ruby, then write it out with ruby
[2012-01-25 20:09:00 -0500] dajia: fujin:  I don't follow...
[2012-01-25 20:09:00 -0500] dajia: Can you elaborate?
[2012-01-25 20:09:00 -0500] fujin: ruby -rubygems -rjson -e 'JSON.pretty_generate(IO.read("somefile").strip)' > somefile.json
[2012-01-25 20:10:00 -0500] fujin: obviously if the file can't go directly into JSON, you might need to wrap it.. :)
[2012-01-25 20:10:00 -0500] fujin: ruby -rubygems -rjson -e 'JSON.pretty_generate({ "id" => "foo", "public_key" => IO.read("public_key.pem").strip, "private_key" => IO.read("private_key.pem").strip' > somefile.json
[2012-01-25 20:11:00 -0500] fujin: missing a }
[2012-01-25 20:12:00 -0500] fujin: https://gist.github.com/51437ce7edffeccaf44b
[2012-01-25 20:12:00 -0500] fujin: ./keys.rb foo public_key.pem private_key.pem
[2012-01-25 20:13:00 -0500] fujin: dajia: ^^
[2012-01-25 20:13:00 -0500] dajia: Pulling that down now...
[2012-01-25 20:13:00 -0500] fujin: well -- read it -- don't just blindly run it
[2012-01-25 20:13:00 -0500] fujin: do you understand what the code does?
[2012-01-25 20:17:00 -0500] dajia: Yeah.  I think so.
[2012-01-25 20:17:00 -0500] dajia: It uses strip to remove the newlines, and dumps the contents into json, using the first argument as the "id", then writes it out.
[2012-01-25 20:19:00 -0500] JasonBox: Neat, that's always convenient to have
[2012-01-25 20:30:00 -0500] mconigliaro: so how can i tell which version ruby chef is running under?
[2012-01-25 20:30:00 -0500] mconigliaro: *version of ruby
[2012-01-25 20:30:00 -0500] mconigliaro: i just set up 1.9 and set it as the default, but i see that the chef packages are still pulling in 1.8 stuff
[2012-01-25 20:31:00 -0500] jbz: mconigliaro: Chef::Log.info("Ruby version #{RUBY_VERSION}") should work
[2012-01-25 20:32:00 -0500] mconigliaro: ah, crap
[2012-01-25 20:32:00 -0500] mconigliaro: still 1.8.7
[2012-01-25 20:32:00 -0500] jbz: (RUBY_PATCHLEVEL works too I think)
[2012-01-25 20:32:00 -0500] mconigliaro: i just did echo RUBY_VERSION from shef
[2012-01-25 20:32:00 -0500] mconigliaro: err, puts
[2012-01-25 20:32:00 -0500] jbz: ah, yes, simpler. :-)
[2012-01-25 20:33:00 -0500] mconigliaro: but is there a way to make the packages use 1.9?
[2012-01-25 20:33:00 -0500] mconigliaro: i thought the alternatives system would take care of that on ubuntu
[2012-01-25 20:33:00 -0500] mconigliaro: apparently not
[2012-01-25 20:34:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: Hey, Im running some tests on ec2 to change the hostname via chef.  Getting in to the problem where after I change the hostname, I can no longer connect to the chef server.  Any good workaround for this, or should I just bite the bullet and bootstrap the hostname properly on startup/registering w/ chef server and stay away from changing it in the future
[2012-01-25 20:34:00 -0500] jbz: Idunno.  We ran into version issues, tried RVM, found it totally didn't work on servers, and ended up ripping out ruby and installing our own packages when we instantiate a VM. :-P
[2012-01-25 20:34:00 -0500] mconigliaro: oh, maybe this is why: the shebang line explicitly refers to 1.8
[2012-01-25 20:34:00 -0500] mconigliaro: at least in shef...
[2012-01-25 20:34:00 -0500] jbz: flashmanbahadur: Well, the server is identified on the chef server by fqdn, so changing that hostname will mean you disassociate the node from its record on the server
[2012-01-25 20:35:00 -0500] stphung_: I asked this question yesterday but, does anyone have any additional insights as to why a sysv script in init.d would not start using the service resource but does using an execute resource with nohup?
[2012-01-25 20:36:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: jbz: yeah, got to that part, was just curious if someone else has solved this before, if not I'll just bootstrap the hostname before registration
[2012-01-25 20:36:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: stphung_: is it a custom sysv service script?
[2012-01-25 20:40:00 -0500] stphung_: yeah it is
[2012-01-25 20:42:00 -0500] dajia: jbz:  in the case that flashmanbahadur is presenting, would setting the node_name in client.rb fix this?
[2012-01-25 20:45:00 -0500] jbz: dajia: Yes, actually, it should.  Thank you.  flashmanbahadur: as dajia points out, if you set /etc/chef/client.rb's 'node_name' field to whatever the machine *originally registered with the chef server* with, you should be OK after changing the hostname.
[2012-01-25 20:49:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: ok
[2012-01-25 20:54:00 -0500] ijcd: Is there a best practices guide for writing recipes? The ones from community.opscode.com seem to be quite adhoc. Something as simple as specifying the specifics for a distribution seems to be all over the place. Sometimes a case is used, sometimes string matching, sometimes clever interpolation... are there guidelines on what is preferred?
[2012-01-25 20:55:00 -0500] ijcd: the list of packages for debian vs ubuntu vs redhat, is a good example
[2012-01-25 20:56:00 -0500] ijcd: TMTOWTDI and ruby  offer too much here maybe
[2012-01-25 20:56:00 -0500] JasonBox: Ah, okay
[2012-01-25 20:58:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: ijcd, I try to parameterize distro specific packages/services as attributes.  You can hide a great deal of case switching in attribute files, thus keeping your recipe code simple and straightforward.
[2012-01-25 21:00:00 -0500] ijcd: atomic-penguin: k, thx. -- I'lllook into that. You just one the cookbook contest, right? :)
[2012-01-25 21:00:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: ijcd, correct
[2012-01-25 21:00:00 -0500] ijcd: I think chef could really benefit from some consitency here
[2012-01-25 21:00:00 -0500] ijcd: s/one/won
[2012-01-25 21:00:00 -0500] fujin: flashmanbahadur: on ec2 i'd suggest using instance ids as the node name, not fqdn or hostname or anything
[2012-01-25 21:01:00 -0500] ijcd: atomic-penguin: which of your recipes would be good to look at as an example?
[2012-01-25 21:01:00 -0500] jbz: flashmanbahadur: what fujin said, seconded.  We use a human-readable tag + the instance name for the chef name.
[2012-01-25 21:01:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: fujin: ok thanks, still learning much of this as well as the infra I am working with, thanks for the tips
[2012-01-25 21:01:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: ill work it in to the startup
[2012-01-25 21:06:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: ijcd, nfs recipe is probably the best example, it has a little bit of case switching in the main recipe however
[2012-01-25 21:07:00 -0500] ank: speaking of the nfs recipe, where's a good place to put client mounts? loop through an array in the recipe and put specifics in the role attrs like the exports recipe?
[2012-01-25 21:10:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: ank, for client side, I would either template out the fstab, or possibly template an autofs config file
[2012-01-25 21:13:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: ijcd, http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cookbook+Style+Guide+Draft
[2012-01-25 21:16:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: ijcd, an older version of the creating new cookbook has some important principles like not repeating yourself, http://wiki.opscode.com/display/LEG/Creating+New+Cookbooks
[2012-01-25 21:19:00 -0500] akraut: Ok, all the experts in the channel here, what's your workflow for creating cookbooks/recipes? How do you test them out as you work?
[2012-01-25 21:20:00 -0500] ijcd: atomic-penguin: thanks!
[2012-01-25 21:21:00 -0500] stphung_: akraut: I'm not sure I am an expert but if I'm trying to get something to work it's usually bootstrap the node successfully first, modify chef code, upload, knife ssh sudo chef-client, upload, knife ssh sudo chef-client,.... and then if i want to do a very pure test I do it from bootstrap
[2012-01-25 21:23:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: ijcd, opscode's ntp cookbook is another good example.  Which I contributed some RHEL specific code.
[2012-01-25 21:31:00 -0500] akraut: stphung_: That's the best I've been able to come up with, too. :-/
[2012-01-25 21:32:00 -0500] akraut: I kind of wish there was a way to operate them similar to sh -x ie: output all the filled templates into a test dir, then show all the other actions that would be performed (chmods, services, etc.)
[2012-01-25 21:41:00 -0500] hcastro: how do people capture ebs snapshot ids produced by the aws_ebs_volume provider with action = :snapshot?
[2012-01-25 21:47:00 -0500] siezer: anybody doing consulting in Boston?
[2012-01-25 22:13:00 -0500] dajia: Hey, I need a way to check within a template if a file exists before reading it.
[2012-01-25 22:17:00 -0500] dajia: Maybe I could use "rescue" somehow on a File.read ?
[2012-01-25 22:18:00 -0500] ssd7_: dajia: Depends on the exact shape of the problem, but I would use a not_if block in the template resource description itself that tests for teh file's existance
[2012-01-25 22:19:00 -0500] ssd7_: use something like File.exists?(/path/to/file)
[2012-01-25 22:19:00 -0500] dajia: Yeah, that's not going to do it.  I need to read three files in the template, and if one of them doesn't exist, I still need the other two.
[2012-01-25 22:19:00 -0500] dajia: If I use a not_if, the entire template won't be processed.
[2012-01-25 22:20:00 -0500] dajia: Can I do a if File.exists() within the template?
[2012-01-25 22:20:00 -0500] Babar: only_if { File.exists( ... ) }
[2012-01-25 22:20:00 -0500] Babar: sure
[2012-01-25 22:21:00 -0500] Babar: wait, haven't read it all
[2012-01-25 22:28:00 -0500] miah: dajia: i am doing something similar
[2012-01-25 22:29:00 -0500] miah: https://gist.github.com/94b368aa602991fd7b2c
[2012-01-25 22:29:00 -0500] miah: i kinda feel like its not the cleanest way though, since you have to ignore_failure.
[2012-01-25 22:31:00 -0500] miah: im thinking there is probably a easier way to check cookbook_resources and see if the file exists, but I'm not sure about that structure.
[2012-01-25 22:31:00 -0500] ijcd: does anyoneknow why using web_app from the apache2 cookbook in my own recipe causes it to look for web_app.conf.erb in *my* recipe instead of in apache2? Is this a definition vs LWRP thing?
[2012-01-25 22:32:00 -0500] ijcd: nm
[2012-01-25 22:32:00 -0500] ijcd: RTFM
[2012-01-25 22:32:00 -0500] ijcd: seems like it should look in apache2 if it doesn't find it local, but there is a "cookbook" parameter for where to look this up
[2012-01-25 22:33:00 -0500] jslatts: where are the chef client certifcates stored on the server? i am trying to transfer my chef installation to a new box and can't figure out how to get a full backup
[2012-01-25 22:33:00 -0500] miah: its so you can call the web_app function from other recipes.
[2012-01-25 22:34:00 -0500] ijcd: miah: would you not normally be able to? I was just surprised that it failed because I hadn't supplied my own template -- it seems like it has a sensible default to use (it's own)
[2012-01-25 22:38:00 -0500] miah: you can only use lwrp's or definitions provided by cookbooks from other cookbooks
[2012-01-25 22:39:00 -0500] miah: generally they will reference files local to the cookbook, look at the runit cookbook as another example
[2012-01-25 22:39:00 -0500] arp: hi miah
[2012-01-25 22:39:00 -0500] miah: heya arp
[2012-01-25 22:39:00 -0500] arp: hows it goin
[2012-01-25 22:40:00 -0500] miah: super duper
[2012-01-25 22:40:00 -0500] miah: how about you?
[2012-01-25 22:49:00 -0500] fujin: dajia: sorry for late response, but it is best to try to read those files and stuff inside of the recipe, instead of putting the logic into the template in ERB syntax blocks
[2012-01-25 22:49:00 -0500] dajia: 'sokay, I was away from my desk for a few.  Can you send me an example?
[2012-01-25 22:49:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: ijcd, you triggered my OCD, I had to refactor my SNMP cookbook as a result
[2012-01-25 22:49:00 -0500] fujin: template(foo) { variables :first => IO.read(some_path).strip rescue nil }
[2012-01-25 22:50:00 -0500] fujin: lol
[2012-01-25 22:50:00 -0500] fujin: maybe want some parantheses for clarity on the rescue, or.. add a method to read the contents of the file
[2012-01-25 22:50:00 -0500] fujin: hell. what file are you reading in? it sounds like you are doing it wrong
[2012-01-25 22:50:00 -0500] fujin: reading in a file and making decisions based off it is a sure sign of chaos
[2012-01-25 22:50:00 -0500] fujin: you want to declare desired state, not reflect what state the system might be in based on a human editing something.. or not editing something
[2012-01-25 23:08:00 -0500] zuhaib: Hey got a quick question, what is the proper way to throw and handle an error with chef so that a) its stops the chef run and returns an error b) it hold the error and print its at the end.  I am trying to write some scripts that after deploying our application it will do a quick sanity check and I want something that will output to Jenkisn
[2012-01-25 23:09:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: ijcd, https://twitter.com/#!/atomic_penguin/status/162310742505308160
[2012-01-25 23:11:00 -0500] ssd7_: hmmm: unless ! node['snmp']['cookbook_files'].empty?
[2012-01-25 23:13:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: lol
[2012-01-25 23:13:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: Okay, that's not good style
[2012-01-25 23:13:00 -0500] ssd7_: overall a nice improvement though!
[2012-01-25 23:14:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: Point was to hide most of the case switching in attributes files
[2012-01-25 23:15:00 -0500] zuhaib: at lest the old code still work, after the 10.6 push it broke a bunch of hacks we did abusing only_if statements as case switching, which was very bad.  The new code looks a lot nice now so it was at lest an excuse to fix things
[2012-01-25 23:16:00 -0500] flagg0204: does chef-server-expander require an actually jetty insallation?
[2012-01-25 23:16:00 -0500] flagg0204: i notice in the configs their is a solr_jetty_path
[2012-01-25 23:18:00 -0500] fujin: zuhaib: I use Chef::Application.fatal! "message", error_code
[2012-01-25 23:21:00 -0500] miah: flagg0204: the solr daemon runs ontop of jetty
[2012-01-25 23:32:00 -0500] flagg0204: miah - ah ok. so its bundled with solr normally?
[2012-01-25 23:32:00 -0500] miah: i dont believe so
[2012-01-25 23:32:00 -0500] flagg0204: miah - ok..  thanks
[2012-01-25 23:32:00 -0500] miah: but im not sure, i have only begun to look at the solr set up
[2012-01-25 23:33:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: whats a good way to test the server architecture if it is not defined in the node properties?  Trying    only_if "arch | grep x84_64"  but doesnt seem to like that
[2012-01-25 23:38:00 -0500] ssd7_: flashmanbahadur: Any ideas why it isn't being picked up by Ohai?
[2012-01-25 23:39:00 -0500] JasonBox: What are people doing to add new yum repos with gpgs in the middle of everything?
[2012-01-25 23:42:00 -0500] ssd7_: flashmanbahadur: on Linux arch should be the same as uname -m which is what Ohai uses to populate node["kernel"]["machine"]
[2012-01-25 23:59:00 -0500] zuhaib: Does anyone have a good guide to point to about using shed and/or rake for full cookbook testing.  I am getting a bit tired of doing full pushes to find bugs in my code.  I know there is a rake to check basic ruby syntax but it won't catch things outside of that.  Example is a bug I just ran in too
[2012-01-25 23:59:00 -0500] zuhaib: curb_pkgs = value_for_platform(
[2012-01-25 23:59:00 -0500] zuhaib:     "default" => ["libcurl3,libcurl3-gnutls,libcurl4-openssl-dev"]
[2012-01-25 23:59:00 -0500] zuhaib:    )
[2012-01-25 23:59:00 -0500] zuhaib: thats valid ruby but it will fail on deploy
