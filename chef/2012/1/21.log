[2012-01-21 10:06:00 -0500] SteffenG: hi all!
[2012-01-21 10:07:00 -0500] SteffenG: question: can I be sure that resources notified by delayed notifications are executed in the same order as they were notified? or is this non-deterministic?
[2012-01-21 10:07:00 -0500] SteffenG: atm I often use :immediately to enforce a particular order
[2012-01-21 10:32:00 -0500] SteffenG: and second question :) is it possible to group resource and notify them at once? e.g. I want to execute some scripts but don't want to list every single one of them at many places. so just notify one resource, which then includes a bunch of resources to execute?
[2012-01-21 10:45:00 -0500] SteffenG: cya, have a nice day! (asked in the mailing list in the meantime)
