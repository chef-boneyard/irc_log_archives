[2012-01-15 17:28:00 -0500] coderanger: bawt: seen nduff
[2012-01-15 17:28:00 -0500] bawt: nDuff was last seen 1 month, 4 days, 13 hours, 40 minutes and 43 seconds ago, quitting IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2012-01-15 17:44:00 -0500] yfeldblum: precision is important
[2012-01-15 17:45:00 -0500] yfeldblum: i don't see ms or us in there
[2012-01-15 19:43:00 -0500] hikeit: good day all...
[2012-01-15 19:44:00 -0500] hikeit: ran into an selinux issue today anyone know if there is planned support for it?
[2012-01-15 19:45:00 -0500] siezer: hikeit yep, it's on the way. for now there's a cookbook to turn if off
[2012-01-15 19:45:00 -0500] siezer: s/if/it/
[2012-01-15 19:47:00 -0500] hikeit: k i'll grab that for now I haven't run with it so far, but was hoping to evaluate going forward (moving up to centos 6 from 5.5, chef from puppet)
[2012-01-15 19:47:00 -0500] hikeit: so far all i've run into is that templates and files don't do a restorecon when complete, leaving services unable to start (I'm writing a basic authconfig/sssd cookbook)
[2012-01-15 19:51:00 -0500] hikeit: ruby error in the selinux recipes extra , at the end of the arguments array in all three
[2012-01-15 19:59:00 -0500] JasonBox: ah
[2012-01-15 19:59:00 -0500] JasonBox: I was wondering about selinux myself, as I have all SL 6.1
[2012-01-15 20:00:00 -0500] Damm: selinux is a pita, disabling it the easiest path if you can
[2012-01-15 20:00:00 -0500] Damm: that's more likely failure
[2012-01-15 20:00:00 -0500] hikeit: thats like saying that having a deadbolt on your front door is a pain, leaving it unlocked is the easiest path
[2012-01-15 20:01:00 -0500] Damm: failure and punishment are often confused
[2012-01-15 20:01:00 -0500] Damm: attempting to do something you think is complicated; when it's fraught with so many pits you will fail... it's not a challenge
[2012-01-15 20:01:00 -0500] Damm: it's a suicide
[2012-01-15 20:01:00 -0500] Damm: hikeit, I prefer SSP and other methods
[2012-01-15 20:01:00 -0500] Damm: hikeit, I have always found SELinux to go too 'far' to be useful
[2012-01-15 20:02:00 -0500] JasonBox: It is rather extreme
[2012-01-15 20:02:00 -0500] hikeit: damm: you do have a point there...
[2012-01-15 20:02:00 -0500] JasonBox: What's SSP?
[2012-01-15 20:03:00 -0500] Damm: stack smashing protection
[2012-01-15 20:03:00 -0500] Damm: there's many ways to secure a box (the gentoo Hardened project makes most of them choices) 
[2012-01-15 20:03:00 -0500] Damm: NX, SELinux... they were not about security between you and me
[2012-01-15 20:03:00 -0500] Damm: they were about security above us
[2012-01-15 20:04:00 -0500] Damm: (NX = Non Execute aka the TPM chip that most of us have now)
[2012-01-15 20:05:00 -0500] hikeit: for example a sysadmin manager to not allow a sysadmin monkey to edit files even as root?
[2012-01-15 20:06:00 -0500] hikeit: is that what you mean 'above us'?
[2012-01-15 20:06:00 -0500] Damm: nope
[2012-01-15 20:06:00 -0500] Damm: TPM's benefit is more for companies trying to enforce copyrights (or that was the idea)
[2012-01-15 20:07:00 -0500] Damm: SELinux is about running code and giving it a 'playground' with limits to what it can do
[2012-01-15 20:07:00 -0500] Damm: and if your program doesn't have those limits, you have to give it to SELinux for it to let you play
[2012-01-15 20:08:00 -0500] Damm: It's not a bad pattern; it's just not a pattern that I personally enjoy.
[2012-01-15 20:08:00 -0500] Damm: I waste more time with selinux support files then doing work when I deal with selinux sometimes
[2012-01-15 20:12:00 -0500] JasonBox: Indeed
[2012-01-15 20:16:00 -0500] hikeit: is there a way to tell a client to update itself, besides just reloading/restarting chef-client?
[2012-01-15 20:17:00 -0500] Damm: restart, it doesn't listen to the server exactly
[2012-01-15 20:17:00 -0500] Damm: so you can't push something to it
[2012-01-15 20:17:00 -0500] Damm: opscode-agent used nanite and allowed you to do this behavior
[2012-01-15 20:17:00 -0500] Damm: and remember, chef is just a gem... there is nothing to stop you from wrapping chef around a rest push service
[2012-01-15 20:19:00 -0500] hikeit: i'm just trying not to stray too far from the standard. I'm implementing chef in our environment so I can piece-by-piece wipe out my hand-built configuration engine (perl/template based), so that I can point to standard docs for new people to look at
[2012-01-15 20:20:00 -0500] hikeit: will just require some rethinking
[2012-01-15 20:22:00 -0500] hikeit: our current setup runs once nightly, and has 3 different stages, one that deploys updated app specific files to a nas volume including any databases to be imported, one that tells the db servers a new client needs to be picked up, and one that tells the app servers to spin up the app pointing at those config files/databases ...
[2012-01-15 20:23:00 -0500] hikeit: will need some more work to remove the requirement of things happening in a specific order
[2012-01-15 20:28:00 -0500] tui701: Hi. Does anyone know how to update knife ec2 to handle us-west-2? I have been trying to create servers in this new region with the "knife ec2 server create" command and just get this error >> ERROR: ArgumentError: Unknown region: "us-west-2"
[2012-01-15 20:51:00 -0500] ssd7: tui701: All of that is actually handled by fog.  I think if you get the latest version of fog installed you should be able to get it working.
[2012-01-15 22:00:00 -0500] ampledata: anyone ever experienced a chef-client run NOT saving automatic attributes (those from ohai)?
[2012-01-15 22:05:00 -0500] grgori: ampledata: when runs fail, yes
[2012-01-15 22:07:00 -0500] ampledata: yeah this one isn't failing
[2012-01-15 22:07:00 -0500] ampledata: actually it looks like it's got all of the attributes before it makes the POST to api.opscode.com
[2012-01-15 22:08:00 -0500] ampledata: just not showing up with knife node show
[2012-01-15 22:09:00 -0500] ampledata: oh no
[2012-01-15 22:09:00 -0500] Damm: tui701, update fog
[2012-01-15 22:09:00 -0500] ampledata: it's just not showing up with -Fj
[2012-01-15 22:10:00 -0500] Damm: tui701, fog has the regions hard coded in it.. so if knife is pulling in the wrong version of fog you might need to update knife, or modify it
[2012-01-15 22:10:00 -0500] Damm: kinda annoying as heck
[2012-01-15 22:10:00 -0500] Damm: I think i'm gonna have to release a fog 0.7.2 gem myself with us-west-2 support and brazil
[2012-01-15 22:11:00 -0500] Damm: just because I can't take the latest fog in a few spots
[2012-01-15 22:23:00 -0500] silk1: Im pretty sure that this is right the validation key is only used to register new clients?
[2012-01-15 22:25:00 -0500] russss: silk: yes
[2012-01-15 22:30:00 -0500] silk: Can someone from opscode tell me why a previously good validation key would have perhaps been expired?
[2012-01-15 22:30:00 -0500] silk: Or would it have been a different person generating a new key?
[2012-01-15 22:35:00 -0500] Damm: silk, validation keys can be cycled/re-generated
[2012-01-15 22:35:00 -0500] Damm: old keys would be revoked
[2012-01-15 22:35:00 -0500] silk: yeah, i guess im wondering under what circumstances that would happen
[2012-01-15 22:36:00 -0500] silk: I can see that I can regenerate a validation key
[2012-01-15 22:36:00 -0500] silk: (which I assume revokes an old one) but im wondering if there is another possibility
[2012-01-15 22:37:00 -0500] Damm: I would think there's some kind of transaction history on your account or review your server logs
[2012-01-15 23:23:00 -0500] mib_mib: hi guys - when trying to install redis i keep getting the error that it "cant find user for redis"
[2012-01-15 23:23:00 -0500] mib_mib: after it tries to install everything - can someone help?
[2012-01-15 23:24:00 -0500] ssd7: silk: If you PM me your organization name I can poke around a bit; otherwise open a ticket on help.opscode.com.
[2012-01-15 23:35:00 -0500] silk: ta
