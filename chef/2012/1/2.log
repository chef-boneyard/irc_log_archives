[2012-01-02 13:07:00 -0500] `brendan: morning folks
[2012-01-02 13:46:00 -0500] millisami: Hi everyone,
[2012-01-02 13:46:00 -0500] millisami: I've been banging my head with this problem
[2012-01-02 13:46:00 -0500] millisami: Using the opensource chef server
[2012-01-02 13:46:00 -0500] millisami: Googling around, this is the exact problem I'm facing
[2012-01-02 13:46:00 -0500] millisami: Its described here http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2011-07/msg00150.html
[2012-01-02 13:46:00 -0500] millisami: and the thread is just left without any solution.
[2012-01-02 13:46:00 -0500] millisami: Can anybody plz plz look into it.
[2012-01-02 15:18:00 -0500] jamiemill: Any tips on chef client/server and AWS auto-scaling? i.e. how best for a new node to register/dereigster itself with chef-server?
[2012-01-02 17:03:00 -0500] jamiemill: when I include the apache2 recipe in my custom recipe, then i call the web_app resource, it looks for the web_app.conf.erb template file in MY cookbook's template dir instead of inside the apache2 cookbook - is that the expected behavior?
[2012-01-02 17:08:00 -0500] asgmo: jamiemill: Add a depends to metadata.rb
[2012-01-02 17:09:00 -0500] asgmo: depends "apache2"
[2012-01-02 17:10:00 -0500] jamiemill: asgmo Well, I do actually have that now, although it was missing at first. Would that have been the problem? I ended up copying the template to my cookbook anyway as I needed to edit it,
[2012-01-02 17:10:00 -0500] jamiemill: .
[2012-01-02 17:10:00 -0500] asgmo: Oh, then that is expected behavior.
