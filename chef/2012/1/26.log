[2012-01-26 08:01:00 -0500] worklez: hmm. recipes are run periodically. how can I restart the service from within a recipe only if some configuration changed?
[2012-01-26 08:04:00 -0500] ranjibd: worklez, use  notify  in the file/template which controls the config
[2012-01-26 08:07:00 -0500] worklez: ranjibd, thanks. looks like what I need
[2012-01-26 08:15:00 -0500] worklez: if there would be many notifies for the same service with the same action, will they be aggregated or just run n times?
[2012-01-26 08:24:00 -0500] tolland: there appears to be a chef gem in the /usr/lib and also the /usr/lib64 on my server, and they are not linked. There are also many gems duplicated, any suggestions on how that might happen
[2012-01-26 08:25:00 -0500] tolland: i only have the rubygem appears to be noarch, but it has randomly installed duplicates of the target gems
[2012-01-26 08:27:00 -0500] ranjibd: worklez, no only once
[2012-01-26 08:42:00 -0500] lolwuttt: whats with user registration on the opscode page right now?
[2012-01-26 08:43:00 -0500] lolwuttt: (its all fucked, emails get sent, but you cant create orgs)
[2012-01-26 08:49:00 -0500] ranjibd: lolwuttt, check status.opescode.com
[2012-01-26 08:49:00 -0500] lolwuttt: hasn't been touched in the last 2 days
[2012-01-26 08:55:00 -0500] lflux: ohai
[2012-01-26 09:05:00 -0500] lolwuttt: An organization with that short name already exists. (Error 32037)
[2012-01-26 09:06:00 -0500] lolwuttt: no matter what i put
[2012-01-26 09:07:00 -0500] lolwuttt: superaids2020numba1 <- ORG SHORTCODE ALREADY EXIST? damn guys, chef is super popular among super aids lovers
[2012-01-26 12:13:00 -0500] lolwuttt: you pros fix org creation yet
[2012-01-26 12:16:00 -0500] worklez: is there a way to "not_if" the whole recipe? or maybe some progress with one-off runlists?
[2012-01-26 13:07:00 -0500] BryanWB: worklez: u can make another recipe that has  :       if <condition>   include_recipe "foo"  end
[2012-01-26 13:15:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: Is there a simple way to access the current node's attributes programatically on a node?
[2012-01-26 13:16:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: I do have client.pem etc. set up, but I can't seem to find a way to load and access that in a ruby script
[2012-01-26 13:34:00 -0500] moos3: has anyone ever seen this /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/openssl/cipher.rb:22: Cipher is not a module (TypeError) when running chef ?
[2012-01-26 13:48:00 -0500] klauern: So I am having trouble reading the wiki docs on Windows...no code blocks seem to show up at all.
[2012-01-26 13:48:00 -0500] klauern: At home on my Mac, they show up just fine,
[2012-01-26 13:48:00 -0500] klauern: but both of my Windows computers at work don't display them at all.
[2012-01-26 14:02:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: klauern: try a different browser?
[2012-01-26 14:02:00 -0500] klauern: I'll add that these blocks don't show up on IE, Chrome or FireFox
[2012-01-26 14:03:00 -0500] klauern: Safari, Chrome, Firefox on my Mac at home works, so I'm not sure what about my environment at work is preventing just the code blocks from not showing up
[2012-01-26 14:03:00 -0500] klauern: seems really weird,
[2012-01-26 14:10:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: Sounds like you have some odd proxy there sitting between you and the wiki
[2012-01-26 14:10:00 -0500] klauern: possibly
[2012-01-26 14:10:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: Maybe try access via ssh: https://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources
[2012-01-26 14:11:00 -0500] klauern: oh
[2012-01-26 14:11:00 -0500] klauern: that works
[2012-01-26 14:11:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: proxy
[2012-01-26 14:11:00 -0500] klauern: what is this code macro doing that a proxy would be involved?  XHR seems pretty vanilla for a proxy to not need to get in the way
[2012-01-26 14:11:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: Or some other kind of thing that sits between you and the web, maybe some adblocking service
[2012-01-26 14:11:00 -0500] klauern: hm.
[2012-01-26 14:12:00 -0500] klauern: Thanks for the tip, I didn't know there was an SSL version of the site, so now I have at least something to work with
[2012-01-26 14:12:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: ssl works because anything sitting between the browser and the server won't be able to manipulate request/response
[2012-01-26 14:12:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: Just tried it out right now as well
[2012-01-26 14:12:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: I never understand why people offer SSL but do not make it mandatory
[2012-01-26 14:13:00 -0500] klauern: I'm hoping the SSL movement is just beginning, as it seems to have picked up some speed recently
[2012-01-26 14:14:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: Yeah, thanks to things like firesheep (or what that thing was called). IMHO nothing should be non-ssl anyway
[2012-01-26 14:15:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: Yeah it needs a bit more CPU, but if a company is cutting cost on user security I'm not sure I'd want to make business with them anyway
[2012-01-26 14:15:00 -0500] lolwuttt:  IMHO you're an idiot. hope this helps.
[2012-01-26 14:16:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: thanks man
[2012-01-26 14:16:00 -0500] lolwuttt: np, i'm here to help where i can
[2012-01-26 14:16:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: you've got something to prove that point?
[2012-01-26 14:16:00 -0500] lolwuttt: bro my imgur links deff need to be https
[2012-01-26 14:17:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: Well you can't embed non-ssl images in an ssl site, can you?
[2012-01-26 14:17:00 -0500] lolwuttt: bro anything imgur should deff be https
[2012-01-26 14:18:00 -0500] lolwuttt: totally agree
[2012-01-26 14:18:00 -0500] lolwuttt: you've convinced me
[2012-01-26 14:18:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: Great, time to move on I guess
[2012-01-26 14:18:00 -0500] lolwuttt: man i better https my hackernews front page loads
[2012-01-26 14:18:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: If you're logged in you'd better do
[2012-01-26 14:19:00 -0500] lolwuttt: cuz your hackernews account is fucking A+ srs business
[2012-01-26 14:19:00 -0500] lolwuttt: kill yourself
[2012-01-26 14:19:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: It's not just that. Things like that BS O2 uk was doing wouldn't be possible via HTTPS (injecting your phone number as request header)
[2012-01-26 14:20:00 -0500] lolwuttt: who cares, the fact that you think because you're using ssl provides you any type of account privacy anywhere is a joke
[2012-01-26 14:21:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: why?
[2012-01-26 14:21:00 -0500] lolwuttt: can someoen fuckign fix org creation on the opscode page so i can get the fuck off irc
[2012-01-26 14:22:00 -0500] lolwuttt: DEADSRSSRSR: because a ton of those sites are selling your fucking user info anyway, and the ones that aren't will eventually get poppped with some shitbox 0day and your use details will get owned anyway. want to be super secure on the internet? stay the fuck off it.
[2012-01-26 14:23:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: well, of course, totally agree on that, But to me that risk isn't a reason to not at least use *some* kind of security
[2012-01-26 14:28:00 -0500] geekbri: Does anybody know if there are plans to update the java  runtime cookbook?  I believe now that sun's JDK is no longer available from the ubuntu partner repo it is going to break many things.
[2012-01-26 14:33:00 -0500] jamescarr: so I'm trying to use the rabbitmq cookbook and I get this error: https://gist.github.com/1683038
[2012-01-26 14:38:00 -0500] hcastro: jamescarr: i think you need to add the apt cookbook to your run_list
[2012-01-26 14:49:00 -0500] moos3: anyone have a recommedation on how to check out code from svn using a recipe
[2012-01-26 14:49:00 -0500] moos3: ?
[2012-01-26 14:49:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: maybe just write a bash script and bundle it?
[2012-01-26 14:50:00 -0500] jespada: moos3, check http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Deploy+Resource
[2012-01-26 14:51:00 -0500] moos3: jespada can i specify username and password for the check out ?
[2012-01-26 14:51:00 -0500] nicholasr-bf: TheDeadSerious...   require "rubygems" ; require "chef" ; Chef::Config.from_file "path_to_rake_file" ; node = Chef::Node.load `hostname`.chomp
[2012-01-26 14:52:00 -0500] jespada: moos3, yup.. is all detailed there ;)
[2012-01-26 14:52:00 -0500] moos3: jespada cool
[2012-01-26 14:52:00 -0500] nicholasr-bf: sorry should be "path_to_knife_file"
[2012-01-26 14:52:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: great! thanks, I'll try that out!
[2012-01-26 14:52:00 -0500] moos3: jespada does it support svn+shh tho
[2012-01-26 14:54:00 -0500] TheDeadSerious: nicholasr-bf: Works, thanks again :)
[2012-01-26 14:55:00 -0500] jespada: moos3, not yet I think.. but you can write your provider.. like the one for git.. please see ssh_wrapper
[2012-01-26 14:56:00 -0500] moos3: k
[2012-01-26 15:30:00 -0500] lolwuttt:  fix.org.creation.

[2012-01-26 15:59:00 -0500] dkingofpa: Was the current maintenance on the community site planned?  Did I miss an email?  I don't see anything about it on the opscode blog or twitter account.
[2012-01-26 16:05:00 -0500] jamescarr: sorry, I got disconnected
[2012-01-26 16:06:00 -0500] jamescarr: so i got this error when using the rabbitmq cookbook: https://gist.github.com/1683038
[2012-01-26 16:06:00 -0500] jamescarr: any ideas what the heck I am doing wrong?
[2012-01-26 16:07:00 -0500] cwj: jamescarr: looks like a recipe is trying to utilize the apt_repository resource but the apt cookbook isn't in your run_list
[2012-01-26 16:07:00 -0500] jamescarr: ah
[2012-01-26 16:08:00 -0500] cwj: which ever cookbook is using that resource should probably have a 'depends "apt"' in its metadata.rb
[2012-01-26 16:08:00 -0500] jamescarr: I see
[2012-01-26 16:09:00 -0500] jamescarr: hmmm
[2012-01-26 16:09:00 -0500] jamescarr: I have it
[2012-01-26 16:09:00 -0500] jamescarr: and in the metadata.rb: depends           "apt", ">= 1.1"
[2012-01-26 16:10:00 -0500] cwj: is there an "include_recipe 'apt'" in the recipe?
[2012-01-26 16:11:00 -0500] jamescarr: there is not
[2012-01-26 16:11:00 -0500] jamescarr: I'll try with that
[2012-01-26 16:11:00 -0500] jamescarr: DAMN
[2012-01-26 16:11:00 -0500] jamescarr: same error
[2012-01-26 16:12:00 -0500] jamescarr: I have this setup as a vagrant box... would it help if I shared it?
[2012-01-26 16:13:00 -0500] jamescarr: https://github.com/jamescarr/nodejs-vagrant
[2012-01-26 16:17:00 -0500] cwj: i would try adding the apt cookbook to you vagrantfile and DNA.json
[2012-01-26 16:17:00 -0500] jbz: Is anyone else in EC2 seeing long delays on the Amazon apt mirror servers?
[2012-01-26 16:20:00 -0500] moos3: can i call a recipe mode the once in a run_list with different overrides ?
[2012-01-26 16:30:00 -0500] jbz: moos3: resources are deduped in the compilation phase, so unless you invoke the resources with different names, it won't work.
[2012-01-26 16:31:00 -0500] moos3: k i'm trying to figure out how to recycle some code with out making another recipe
[2012-01-26 16:31:00 -0500] moos3: basically i'm tyring to make multiple symlinks for apaches vdocroot
[2012-01-26 16:31:00 -0500] jbz: moos3: We do that by looping the code in the recipe and having the resource names be written using the loop variables (or some other changing string)
[2012-01-26 16:32:00 -0500] jbz: That causes a string of different resources (differently-named) to be generated during compile phase
[2012-01-26 16:33:00 -0500] nstielau1: Hey, I'm having some issues with the yum_package provider.  I figured out what I wanted to do with an 'execute' resource, but couldn't get the yum_package provider to install the new package for anything: https://gist.github.com/e673770737030d3369c7     Any ideas?
[2012-01-26 16:34:00 -0500] moos3: jbz
[2012-01-26 16:34:00 -0500] moos3: http://pastie.org/3257442
[2012-01-26 16:34:00 -0500] moos3: so can do like that ?
[2012-01-26 16:36:00 -0500] ssd7: dkingofpa: Check status.opscode.com.  One of our upstreams went down causing various errors. We disabled new account sign ups to minimize the impact.  The upstream is back up so we should be bringing everything back soon.
[2012-01-26 16:39:00 -0500] dkingofpa: ssd7:  thanks for the update.  I just wanted to download some cookbooks from the community site.  Didn't realize the disabled org creation was related.
[2012-01-26 16:39:00 -0500] jbz: moos3: sorry, looking, 1 sec
[2012-01-26 16:39:00 -0500] mattdawson: so i have a cookbok that's declaring include_recipe "gitolite" and it's just  not.
[2012-01-26 16:39:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: What's a good way to check if a kernel module is loaded or not in Ohai?
[2012-01-26 16:39:00 -0500] mattdawson: there's no failures - it just doestn' run.
[2012-01-26 16:39:00 -0500] jbz: moos3: bingo
[2012-01-26 16:40:00 -0500] mattdawson: the included recipe is in the dependency list of the cookbook, so it's not that.
[2012-01-26 16:40:00 -0500] moos3: question is how do i replace the "host1" host2 with varable from the role file ?
[2012-01-26 16:41:00 -0500] mattdawson: can anyone provide tips for what else to check?
[2012-01-26 16:41:00 -0500] nstielau1: atomic-penguin, you can run ohai from the command-line
[2012-01-26 16:41:00 -0500] jbz: moos3: Does the role contain multiple values?  Or just one?
[2012-01-26 16:41:00 -0500] moos3: multile
[2012-01-26 16:41:00 -0500] moos3: a web might have 100's of thse hosts defined
[2012-01-26 16:41:00 -0500] nstielau1: atomic-penguin: or, try to Chef::Log.info the appropriate stuff from 'node'
[2012-01-26 16:42:00 -0500] jbz: moos3: Oh, then the role can just contain that hash in the attribute and you can iterate over it
[2012-01-26 16:42:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: nstielau1, I was wondering more along the lines in a recipe, like "if node.kernel.modules.foo.exists?"
[2012-01-26 16:42:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: nstielau1, Would that determine if a kernel module was loaded or not
[2012-01-26 16:42:00 -0500] nstielau1: atomic-penguin yeah, something like that.  Even node.kernel.exists? might do it
[2012-01-26 16:42:00 -0500] moos3: jbz k how tho ?
[2012-01-26 16:43:00 -0500] moos3: just like override_defaults  "blah" : {}
[2012-01-26 16:43:00 -0500] moos3: ?
[2012-01-26 16:44:00 -0500] nstielau1: moos3 yeah that'll work.  Put it in override_attributes not default_attributes.
[2012-01-26 16:44:00 -0500] jbz: sorry, splitting attention - yeah, what nstielau1 said.
[2012-01-26 16:47:00 -0500] moos3: k
[2012-01-26 16:47:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: nstielau1, this worked, "if node['kernel']['modules'].has_key('ip6_tables')"
[2012-01-26 16:49:00 -0500] nstielau1: nice atomic
[2012-01-26 16:53:00 -0500] tolland: can i run a recipe from the command line without adding it to the run list, from a script?
[2012-01-26 16:54:00 -0500] ssd7: dkingofpa: cookbook site should be good to go again
[2012-01-26 16:54:00 -0500] mkent_: tolland, i'd imagine chef-solo would work for that
[2012-01-26 16:55:00 -0500] dkingofpa: ssd7:  thanks
[2012-01-26 16:56:00 -0500] tolland: mkent_: unforunately most of my recipes use search, so I dont see that solo is an option.
[2012-01-26 16:57:00 -0500] tolland: is there any way to stop the -j option in chef client being permanent? other than to fail the recipe somehow?
[2012-01-26 16:57:00 -0500] nstielau1: Hey, I'm having some issues with the yum_package provider. I figured out what I wanted to do with an 'execute' resource, but couldn't get the yum_package provider to install the new package for anything: https://gist.github.com/e673770737030d3369c7  Any ideas?
[2012-01-26 16:58:00 -0500] mkent_: ah gotcha
[2012-01-26 16:59:00 -0500] dkingofpa: nstielau1:  typo?  "excecute"
[2012-01-26 16:59:00 -0500] mkent_: oops :)
[2012-01-26 16:59:00 -0500] nstielau1: dkingofpa, thanks, that's fixed
[2012-01-26 16:59:00 -0500] nstielau1: I mean, that wasn't the issue
[2012-01-26 17:00:00 -0500] nstielau1: I was up late and was sloppy, but even after fixing syntax errors still can't find the package
[2012-01-26 17:01:00 -0500] nstielau1: (just pulled that out of git hstory of all the shit I was trying)
[2012-01-26 17:01:00 -0500] mkent_: nstielau1, have you seen? http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Yum+Package+Resource there's a repo installing example there from gaffneyc
[2012-01-26 17:01:00 -0500] mkent_: seen:*
[2012-01-26 17:01:00 -0500] tolland: i am thinking of a nasty hack to script up something on the client like "chef-client stop; knife node zzz show | grep run_list > /tmp/run_list; chef_client -j /tmp/my_recipe.json; knife node xxx remove recipe; knife node xxx run_list add <original runlist>
[2012-01-26 17:01:00 -0500] dkingofpa: nstielau1: if you run those commands manually on the node, do you get the same result?
[2012-01-26 17:01:00 -0500] tolland: is that really necessary
[2012-01-26 17:02:00 -0500] dkingofpa: nstielau1: also, do you have any debug or verbose output?
[2012-01-26 17:03:00 -0500] nstielau1: dkingofpa I'll get some, thanks for the pointers
[2012-01-26 17:04:00 -0500] nstielau1: dkingofpa, I want to help improve Chef's yum stuff, but right now it seems like just shelling out to execute with a not_if is way simpler, 4 fewer notifications, 2 fewer resources
[2012-01-26 17:06:00 -0500] nstielau1: Also, I think gaffneyc's example was before the flush_cache existed
[2012-01-26 17:10:00 -0500] mkent_: er hold on
[2012-01-26 17:12:00 -0500] mkent_: nstielau1, https://gist.github.com/0e1179dc1e1d28c78666 you had noarch in the version string, it either has to be not passed in at all, using "arch" or as part of the package name, eg: foo.noarch
[2012-01-26 17:14:00 -0500] mkent_: the gaffneyc's example is good as it's a more general solution that can standalone in a recipe, the flush_cache stuff works but relies on you ordering it a certain way (the next package after installing a repo has to call flush_cache), plus if you were to add flush_cache to every package install you'd see some really long client run times
[2012-01-26 17:16:00 -0500] nstielau1: @mkent_ thanks, I'm trying to grab some debug output, seeing, if gaffneyc's code will work
[2012-01-26 17:18:00 -0500] nstielau1: I think it's hard because you have Chef internal caches and yum system/disk caches, and they both need to be cleared, in the right order
[2012-01-26 17:20:00 -0500] gustavo__: hi !, I'm getting a segfault when I upload cookboos to chef server:  "/usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/chef/checksum_cache.rb:174: [BUG] Segmentation fault ruby 1.8.7 (2010-08-16 patchlevel 302) [x86_64-linux] Abortado"
[2012-01-26 17:23:00 -0500] gustavo__: can anyone help me to debug this problem ?
[2012-01-26 17:25:00 -0500] ssd7: gustavo__: Is this on CentOS/RHEL?
[2012-01-26 17:26:00 -0500] nstielau1: mkent_ gaffneyc's code work.  Thanks for RTFM, late night, I appreciate it.
[2012-01-26 17:26:00 -0500] mkent_: awesome :) np
[2012-01-26 17:29:00 -0500] nstielau1: @gustavo__You can try to remove all of the checksum caches, I think at /etc/chef/cache
[2012-01-26 17:37:00 -0500] holoway: gustavo__: wow
[2012-01-26 17:37:00 -0500] holoway: gustavo__: what platform are you on, and where did your ruby build come from?
[2012-01-26 17:40:00 -0500] gustavo__: holoway, debian squeeze, chef 0.10.8 installed from opscodepackages
[2012-01-26 17:44:00 -0500] gustavo__: nstielau1, I found a cache in the following path /var/cache/chef/checksums/
[2012-01-26 17:45:00 -0500] gustavo__: holoway, nstielau1 , the error is not always repeated, for example if I run "mysql upload cookbooks knife" fails, the next execution works
[2012-01-26 17:46:00 -0500] gustavo__: sorry "knife cookbooks upload mysql"
[2012-01-26 17:49:00 -0500] gustavo__: ssd7, is  debian squeeze, chef 0.10.8 installed from opscode packages
[2012-01-26 17:53:00 -0500] nstielau1: gustavo__ that used to happen to me on Debian.  I forget if I did anything to fix it, maybe a new version of Chef.  How often does it happen?
[2012-01-26 17:58:00 -0500] gustavo__: nstielau1, The scenario is as follows. Upgrade the server that I use knife from 0.9.12 to  0.10.8. The error is sporadic, now delete the /var/cache/chef/checksums/ and not to repeat again, but the directory is empty ...
[2012-01-26 18:02:00 -0500] nstielau1: gustavo__ ok, at least you have a temporary fix.  Hopefully it had to do with the upgrade and you won't see it again.
[2012-01-26 18:06:00 -0500] gustavo__: nstielau1, Thank you very much for your help !!
[2012-01-26 18:07:00 -0500] nstielau1: gustavo__ good luck!
[2012-01-26 18:39:00 -0500] moos3: what does this mean ERROR: Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - /etc/chef/validation.pem i'm getting that when i spin up new ami instances ?
[2012-01-26 18:44:00 -0500] cwj: i cannot find the page for regenerating my user api key on manage.opscode.com, feel like i am taking crazy pills
[2012-01-26 18:45:00 -0500] cwj: moos3: sounds like your chef-client is unable to register with the chef server because it does not have the validation.pem certificate which is required for chef-client authenticate and request a unique certificate of its own
[2012-01-26 18:46:00 -0500] moos3: yeah i found that
[2012-01-26 18:46:00 -0500] moos3: just trying to find a client.rb example or how to generate that
[2012-01-26 18:48:00 -0500] coderanger: moos3: knife bootstrap will generate one for you :)
[2012-01-26 18:48:00 -0500] moos3: k
[2012-01-26 18:48:00 -0500] moos3: coderanger i'm using knife ec2
[2012-01-26 18:48:00 -0500] moos3: :d
[2012-01-26 18:49:00 -0500] coderanger: Same difference
[2012-01-26 18:49:00 -0500] jamescarr: dammit
[2012-01-26 18:49:00 -0500] jamescarr: I'm almost in tears here
[2012-01-26 18:49:00 -0500] miah: moin

[2012-01-26 18:49:00 -0500] jamescarr: I know for CERTAIN that the apt cookbook is being used, and it is available
[2012-01-26 18:49:00 -0500] miah: the validation.pem is also in /etc/chef on your chef server
[2012-01-26 18:49:00 -0500] jamescarr: ARGH
[2012-01-26 18:50:00 -0500] cwj: coderanger: do you know where i go to regenerate hosted chef user api keys?
[2012-01-26 18:50:00 -0500] coderanger: cwj: https://www.opscode.com/account/password
[2012-01-26 18:51:00 -0500] cwj: oh ok
[2012-01-26 18:52:00 -0500] cwj: i think its confusing that it's not linked in the management interface
[2012-01-26 18:52:00 -0500] coderanger: jamescarr: Check the cookbook browser on the chef server, make sure it sees the resource/provider files
[2012-01-26 18:52:00 -0500] coderanger: cwj: Yeah, working on it :-) That site went up yesterday
[2012-01-26 18:53:00 -0500] jamescarr: ah
[2012-01-26 18:53:00 -0500] jamescarr: I think the guy had an older cookbook
[2012-01-26 18:53:00 -0500] jamescarr: I just updated it... and it works! :)
[2012-01-26 18:53:00 -0500] coderanger: jamescarr: Thats usually the problem :)
[2012-01-26 18:58:00 -0500] jamescarr: how can I define in my recipe to run a command after installation? For example, after rabbitmq is installed I want it to install a bunch of plugins
[2012-01-26 18:59:00 -0500] coderanger: Look at #notifies
[2012-01-26 18:59:00 -0500] coderanger: Or just put them in order if you can make it idempotent
[2012-01-26 18:59:00 -0500] jamescarr: ah I see
[2012-01-26 19:14:00 -0500] JasonBox: Indeed, notify is beautiful
[2012-01-26 19:15:00 -0500] iamsmrtk: Hey all, i'm having some trouble updating some data bags/roles via knife. It throws "undefined method `raw_data=' for nil:NilClass - (NoMethodError" and i'm not sure where i'm going wrong.
[2012-01-26 19:17:00 -0500] jbz: iamsmrtk: can you pastie the command you're using and any JSON you're feeding it?
[2012-01-26 19:17:00 -0500] coderanger: iamsmrtk: Thats the error you would see if you tried to upload malformed JSON probably
[2012-01-26 19:17:00 -0500] jbz: (what coderanger said :-) )
[2012-01-26 19:17:00 -0500] coderanger: Double check all your commas and quotes
[2012-01-26 19:20:00 -0500] iamsmrtk: The command I'm using: knife data bag from file Software data_bags/Software/NEWSNAV.json -c ~/.chef/prod.rb -l error
[2012-01-26 19:21:00 -0500] iamsmrtk: and the json: http://pastebin.com/G3bVunv0
[2012-01-26 19:22:00 -0500] iamsmrtk: I know there have been problems with the json gem in the past but everything I was reading said it was a problem in 1.4.4 and I'm using 1.4.6
[2012-01-26 19:23:00 -0500] jbz: iamsmrtk: Does your JSON pass jsonlint.com?
[2012-01-26 19:23:00 -0500] jbz: Hm, that does look unexceptionable to my not-terribly-experienced eyes
[2012-01-26 19:23:00 -0500] iamsmrtk: Yup, it does. Cool site btw, definitely saving this one!
[2012-01-26 19:24:00 -0500] jbz: :-D
[2012-01-26 19:24:00 -0500] jbz: saves my bacon daily
[2012-01-26 19:25:00 -0500] iamsmrtk: I don't think it's something wrong with the json files because i can upload it to my other chef server and they upload fine
[2012-01-26 19:27:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: Hey all. I'm having trouble with the web_app resource in the apache2 cookbook.  It seems that it aways passes enable=true to apache_site.  Has anyone else run into this?
[2012-01-26 19:28:00 -0500] coderanger: bkmontgomery: Why would that be incorrect?
[2012-01-26 19:29:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: coderanger: I may want apache configs available, but I may not want them enabled.  For example: I might have a separate config for a staging/testing version of a site, but I don't wan't it enabled.
[2012-01-26 19:29:00 -0500] coderanger: bkmontgomery: Then don't use webapp :-) Its pretty crufty anyway
[2012-01-26 19:29:00 -0500] coderanger: Or change it
[2012-01-26 19:30:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: hah. well, other than that it meets my needs really well.
[2012-01-26 19:30:00 -0500] coderanger: bkmontgomery: It doesn't do all that much
[2012-01-26 19:30:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: yeah, it seems like it's a quick/easy change, but begging new to chef, I'm not sure if I'm missing something.
[2012-01-26 19:30:00 -0500] coderanger: Just writes a template and calls apache_site
[2012-01-26 19:30:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: s/begging/being/
[2012-01-26 19:31:00 -0500] coderanger: bkmontgomery: How are you calling webapp?
[2012-01-26 19:31:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: fwiw, I found web_app to help me grok how chef works.
[2012-01-26 19:32:00 -0500] coderanger: Heh, just be aware that is using an older style of abstraction called a definition, the shinier way is an LWRP
[2012-01-26 19:32:00 -0500] coderanger: :)
[2012-01-26 19:32:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: coderanger: i'm iterating over data from a data bag, and just passing values to web_app... i'll get you post in a sec.
[2012-01-26 19:32:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: ahh.. that's good to know.
[2012-01-26 19:32:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: I guess I need to read up on LWRPs, then.
[2012-01-26 19:33:00 -0500] geekbri: Is there a way for chef to have a cookbook depend on another cookbooks version?  IE lets say i had a cookbook that installed nginx but i wanted it to require a certain version of some other cookbook (lets say fcgi)  is that possible?
[2012-01-26 19:33:00 -0500] coderanger: geekbri: Sure, just put it in the metadata
[2012-01-26 19:34:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: coderanger: here's what I'm doing: https://gist.github.com/1684589
[2012-01-26 19:34:00 -0500] geekbri: coderanger: hrm ok, so i can just put in there something like depends <cookbook_name>="1.0.1" ?
[2012-01-26 19:36:00 -0500] geekbri: coderanger:  i found the docs on it, thanks.
[2012-01-26 19:36:00 -0500] coderanger: bkmontgomery: That looks like it should be working
[2012-01-26 19:40:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: coderanger:  I don't know ruby well enough to know why, but it works if I make a small change to web_app.rb  (https://gist.github.com/1684618 - line 46 & 49)
[2012-01-26 19:40:00 -0500] coderanger: derp, thats right, you are getting the inner scope's version
[2012-01-26 19:40:00 -0500] coderanger: You should file a ticket :-)
[2012-01-26 19:41:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: cool, so I'm not crazy ;)
[2012-01-26 19:41:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: and I will file the ticket.
[2012-01-26 19:41:00 -0500] coderanger: Ruby like to play fast a loose with scoping rules
[2012-01-26 19:42:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: lesson learned. I'll keep that one in my back pocket!
[2012-01-26 19:47:00 -0500] bkmontgomery: coderanger: btw, thanks for you help!
[2012-01-26 19:47:00 -0500] coderanger: No problem
[2012-01-26 19:57:00 -0500] geekbri: coderanger: is it possible to have a role only execute a cookbook if its higher/lower than a certain version?  So lets say i had two different ENV's for a role and i wanted each env to be running a different version of a cookbook.  Do you think that is possible?
[2012-01-26 19:57:00 -0500] coderanger: Yep, environments can specify additional version constraints for exactly that reason
[2012-01-26 19:57:00 -0500] coderanger: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Environments#Environments-cookbookversions
[2012-01-26 19:58:00 -0500] geekbri: coderanger: ahh totally awesome.
[2012-01-26 20:02:00 -0500] moos3: so have the validate /etc/chef/validation.pem but i'm still getting ERROR: Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - /etc/chef/validation.pem
[2012-01-26 20:03:00 -0500] mconigliaro: geekbri: are you brian carpenter?
[2012-01-26 20:06:00 -0500] geekbri: mconigliaro: I am not!  whoever he is, hes ok in my book though
[2012-01-26 20:06:00 -0500] mconigliaro: haha
[2012-01-26 20:06:00 -0500] mconigliaro: i have a friend name brian who uses the nickname geeknik
[2012-01-26 20:06:00 -0500] mconigliaro: i thought maybe he changed it
[2012-01-26 20:06:00 -0500] geekbri: well you can tell him if he ever does change it, this variation is taken ;)
[2012-01-26 20:07:00 -0500] mconigliaro: haha, i'll let him know!
[2012-01-26 20:10:00 -0500] mlei: hi folks. i'm trying to figure out why apt-get installing chef on ubuntu (lucid) pulls in a lot of x libraries
[2012-01-26 20:10:00 -0500] mlei: can anyone point me in the right direction?
[2012-01-26 20:10:00 -0500] mlei: particularly stuff like libqt4, libgtk2.0, libxcb, etc
[2012-01-26 20:11:00 -0500] jbz: Ah, the malicious magic of package deps :-P
[2012-01-26 20:12:00 -0500] mlei: i've got a sysadmin looking at those deps and balking at me
[2012-01-26 20:13:00 -0500] moos3: so how do i fix this validation.pem issue, becuase its def tehre
[2012-01-26 20:14:00 -0500] jbz: moos3: Sorry, what's the issue?  Lost track.
[2012-01-26 20:14:00 -0500] moos3: when i try to bootstrap ERROR: Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - /etc/chef/validation.pem
[2012-01-26 20:14:00 -0500] moos3: its def there on the node
[2012-01-26 20:15:00 -0500] jbz: Is it there on the machine you're calling the bootstrap from?
[2012-01-26 20:15:00 -0500] jbz: That's where it gets it.
[2012-01-26 20:15:00 -0500] moos3: oh really ?
[2012-01-26 20:15:00 -0500] jbz: Yeah, bootstrap grabs the validation pem from its local machine and uses that to register the client on the node it's bootstrapping.
[2012-01-26 20:15:00 -0500] moos3: let me throw it on my laptop and see if that works
[2012-01-26 20:15:00 -0500] jbz: If you have a local .chef, make sure that knife can find it
[2012-01-26 20:15:00 -0500] jbz: (i.e. it's in your current path)
[2012-01-26 20:16:00 -0500] jbz: Wait, no, not current pathwhatever. Heh.  Make sure knife can find the .chef, however.
[2012-01-26 20:18:00 -0500] mlei: okay, so, i found at least one path where x libraries are installed... openjdk-6-jdk
[2012-01-26 20:18:00 -0500] moos3: jbz can i tell it the location of it my knife.rb ?
[2012-01-26 20:25:00 -0500] jbz: moos3: Hm, if that knife.rb has the location of the validation.pem, that should work?  I think?
[2012-01-26 20:25:00 -0500] moos3: yeah
[2012-01-26 20:25:00 -0500] moos3: looked at my knife and found it
[2012-01-26 20:25:00 -0500] moos3: now its working
[2012-01-26 20:25:00 -0500] moos3: now to figure out elasticsearch and its clusterings mount volumes
[2012-01-26 20:27:00 -0500] Urocyon: What's the best way to go about modifying a vendored cookbook?   In the past I've used site-cookbooks entries to override the vendored cookbook, but now knife is giving me a warning about having two cookbooks with the same name.
[2012-01-26 20:29:00 -0500] moos3: jbz how do i push up a role ?
[2012-01-26 20:38:00 -0500] jamescarr: whats a good way to say "do after this?" I have an array in my dna.json of rabbitmq plugins to install, I want to restart the rabbitmq service after all of them are enabled
[2012-01-26 20:38:00 -0500] jamescarr: not after each individual one :)
[2012-01-26 20:40:00 -0500] moos3: place it at the every end of the script ?
[2012-01-26 20:47:00 -0500] ssd7: jamescarr: If you are OK with waiting for the restart until the end of the chef-client run, you can use a notification with :delayed timing.  The service will be restart at the end of the run, only once.
[2012-01-26 20:47:00 -0500] Urocyon: @ssd7 I thought that was the default, though.  that all notifications were :delayed unless marked as :immediately.
[2012-01-26 20:49:00 -0500] Urocyon: at least according to the notifications section on http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources
[2012-01-26 20:50:00 -0500] ssd7: Urocyon: Yes, that is the default.
[2012-01-26 20:52:00 -0500] ssd7: Urocyon: Nice catch, that should save on a good deal of typing if jamescarr goes that route.
[2012-01-26 20:52:00 -0500] geekbri: so if you had 4 nodes using a role, and you wanted to temporarily change what 2 of those nodes were running as a run list how would you do that?  I assume you would use knife somehow to alter just the run list of those two nodes?
[2012-01-26 20:53:00 -0500] moos3: how do you rerun a recipe across all nodes ?
[2012-01-26 20:54:00 -0500] asg: geekbri: I'd setup a different environment with a role that had the correct run_list for the two nodes and then put them in that environment.
[2012-01-26 20:55:00 -0500] geekbri: asg: mmm yes that seems the proper way to do it if you wanted to have them different permanently.  What if you literally just wanted this to be different until the next chef-client daemon checkin.
[2012-01-26 20:55:00 -0500] geekbri: is there a way to basically search the node list, and the adhoc change the run list for those 2 nodes you pick ?
[2012-01-26 20:58:00 -0500] fujin: you could add a recipe that adds itself to the runlist and then it also removes itself
[2012-01-26 21:01:00 -0500] geekbri: fujin: hrm very interesting idea.
[2012-01-26 21:02:00 -0500] fujin: sounds like you are probably trying to solve for something else, like inter-node orchestration something
[2012-01-26 21:03:00 -0500] ranjibd: mcollective?
[2012-01-26 21:03:00 -0500] bawt: mcollective is seriously bad. ass.
[2012-01-26 21:03:00 -0500] ranjibd: salt?
[2012-01-26 21:04:00 -0500] ranjibd: we need a common CI system for all the community cookbooks
[2012-01-26 21:04:00 -0500] ranjibd: does opscode hase one?
[2012-01-26 21:04:00 -0500] fujin: pennyworth?
[2012-01-26 21:04:00 -0500] bawt: pennyworth is on the list of things to look at.
[2012-01-26 21:04:00 -0500] fujin: !forget pennyworth
[2012-01-26 21:04:00 -0500] bawt: can do!
[2012-01-26 21:04:00 -0500] fujin: pennyworth is https://github.com/heavywater/pennyworth
[2012-01-26 21:05:00 -0500] fujin: jenkins + ... + databags + ... + reprepro / fpm / .. sauce
[2012-01-26 21:05:00 -0500] ranjibd: fujin, but does any one runs all the cookbooks and atleast check if they can coexits? with their dependencies ..
[2012-01-26 21:05:00 -0500] fujin: oh
[2012-01-26 21:05:00 -0500] fujin: I think Adam was working on something like that
[2012-01-26 21:05:00 -0500] fujin: his modified chef-jenkins
[2012-01-26 21:06:00 -0500] fujin: I dont' know where it ended up
[2012-01-26 21:06:00 -0500] fujin: ranjibd: it's definitely a good idea. i have been using Librarian a little to try to manage it more effectively
[2012-01-26 21:06:00 -0500] fujin: on a few projs)
[2012-01-26 21:07:00 -0500] ranjibd: we  use the report handler + ssh/rspec. but only against centos... and now i;ve started stuff on amazon, ubuntu.. things break left right center..
[2012-01-26 21:08:00 -0500] ranjibd: i doubt how many cookbooks work on a vanialla setup across different versions of the platform they support
[2012-01-26 21:08:00 -0500] fujin: not many (in my experience)
[2012-01-26 21:08:00 -0500] fujin: i have to butcher basically everything that says it is crosss platform to actually get it going
[2012-01-26 21:08:00 -0500] fujin: lets me do lots of contributions bvack to stuff. eventually everything will be fixed
[2012-01-26 21:09:00 -0500] geekbri: Well I can tell you that the java cookbook is broken on ubuntu if you try to install the sun version.  :)
[2012-01-26 21:09:00 -0500] ranjibd:  i guess the practices around recipe development evolving rapidly ... 2011 was a good year :-)
[2012-01-26 21:11:00 -0500] ranjibd: today a guy in my city went on a rampage with a public bus ..killing 9 people and hitting tens of vehicles ... insane
[2012-01-26 21:11:00 -0500] ranjibd: like live simcity
[2012-01-26 21:11:00 -0500] ranjibd: life is so fragile :0(
[2012-01-26 21:12:00 -0500] jamescarr: man.... I really like chef :)
[2012-01-26 21:14:00 -0500] cwj: me too :)
[2012-01-26 21:15:00 -0500] gmcinnes: I'm on the fence :)
[2012-01-26 21:16:00 -0500] moos3: anyone have a good elasticsearch recipe that does the clustering ?
[2012-01-26 21:17:00 -0500] asg: geekbri: you have to go and stab Oracle for that
[2012-01-26 21:17:00 -0500] jamescarr: whew... the fruits of my hacking: https://github.com/jamescarr/nodejs-vagrant
[2012-01-26 21:18:00 -0500] geekbri: asg: oh i know, believe me, my hatred for oracle is inherent to my existence.  Im just wondering if it will get updated with some sort of hackery like automating downloading the binaries and creating local repos to install from or something :)
[2012-01-26 21:18:00 -0500] geekbri: asg: i've created my own pretty hacky work around thats pretty gross.  Heres to hoping somebody is more clever than i am
[2012-01-26 21:19:00 -0500] asg: geekbri: nothing wrong with submitting what you have and if others benefit, great. If others find a better way, then great. Either way, great is better than borked :)
[2012-01-26 21:20:00 -0500] geekbri: asg: i'll make sure to push it up stream :)
[2012-01-26 21:23:00 -0500] jamescarr: what's the "chef way" of creating a directory?
[2012-01-26 21:24:00 -0500] hcastro: jamescarr: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Directory
[2012-01-26 21:24:00 -0500] stphung_: +1 hcastro :)
[2012-01-26 21:24:00 -0500] jamescarr: hcastro, thanks
[2012-01-26 21:25:00 -0500] ranjibd: directory?
[2012-01-26 21:26:00 -0500] ranjibd: fujin, how one can teach bawt about new key words?
[2012-01-26 21:27:00 -0500] fujin: ranjibd: he just learns from natural language
[2012-01-26 21:28:00 -0500] fujin: directory is http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Directory
[2012-01-26 21:28:00 -0500] jamescarr: sorry, I'm such a noob. So if I want to create directories for where my app will get deployed, do I need to actually create a cookbook with a recipe to do that?
[2012-01-26 21:28:00 -0500] fujin: directory?
[2012-01-26 21:28:00 -0500] bawt: directory is http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Directory
[2012-01-26 21:28:00 -0500] fujin: jamescarr: depends on how you want to deploy your application, of course.. there is something like the deploy resource
[2012-01-26 21:28:00 -0500] fujin: which will create the deployment target directory automatically if I am not mistaken
[2012-01-26 21:28:00 -0500] fujin: deploy?
[2012-01-26 21:28:00 -0500] bawt: deploy is http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Deploy+Resource
[2012-01-26 21:29:00 -0500] fujin: ranjibd: I guess I always remember all of the keywords, more of spare URL memory for me than anything else :)
[2012-01-26 21:29:00 -0500] fujin: ranjibd: you can say to him <foo> is also <bar> and he will learn that, too, I think
[2012-01-26 21:29:00 -0500] fujin: directory is also cool
[2012-01-26 21:29:00 -0500] fujin: directory?
[2012-01-26 21:29:00 -0500] bawt: directory is http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Directory or cool
[2012-01-26 21:29:00 -0500] fujin: see?
[2012-01-26 21:30:00 -0500] fujin: !meet ranjibd
[2012-01-26 21:30:00 -0500] bawt: fujin, you don't have 'auth::user::manage::meet' permissions here
[2012-01-26 21:33:00 -0500] jamescarr: fujin, I feel like I remember seeing the ability to create a directory and assign user permissions in the dna.json file
[2012-01-26 21:33:00 -0500] fujin: well, you didn't
[2012-01-26 21:33:00 -0500] fujin: you may have seen someone passing through attributes that a recipe uses to manage a directory
[2012-01-26 21:34:00 -0500] jamescarr: ah
[2012-01-26 21:34:00 -0500] jamescarr: that makes sense
[2012-01-26 21:34:00 -0500] fujin: e.g. dna.json { "directories_to_manage": { "/foo": { "user": "aj", "group": "banana" } } }
[2012-01-26 21:34:00 -0500] jamescarr: what I saw was someone providing configuration details that a recipe provides :)
[2012-01-26 21:35:00 -0500] fujin: recipe: node.directories.to_manage.each { |k,v| directory(k) { user v["user"]; group v["group"]; } }
[2012-01-26 21:35:00 -0500] fujin: kazinga
[2012-01-26 21:36:00 -0500] fujin: but yeah. dna.json = attributes. :)
[2012-01-26 21:39:00 -0500] hcastro: would anyone using the aws cookbook see value in the ebs volume snapshot action storing snapshot_ids to a node attribute?
[2012-01-26 21:39:00 -0500] hcastro: similar to the way volume_ids get added during creation?
[2012-01-26 21:42:00 -0500] fujin: like record the snapshot has taken place into the node?
[2012-01-26 21:43:00 -0500] fujin: i guess i would be worried about that growing over time, not to mention it is really a stale misrepresentation of state
[2012-01-26 21:43:00 -0500] fujin: like.. just use the api? :)
[2012-01-26 21:43:00 -0500] gmcinnes: mcollective looks like engine yard's nanite stuff
[2012-01-26 21:43:00 -0500] gmcinnes: sorta.
[2012-01-26 21:43:00 -0500] fujin: kind of, yeah, I guess.
[2012-01-26 21:43:00 -0500] fujin: a little more specialized than nanite I guess
[2012-01-26 21:52:00 -0500] densone: can someone tell me the best way to get the ip address to an interface in chef. I tried something like:  node[:network][:interfaces][:vlan104][:addresses].keys[1] , but it's not ordered so it fails.
[2012-01-26 21:56:00 -0500] hcastro: fujin: good point. i'm looking to add code to the prune action too.
[2012-01-26 22:01:00 -0500] geekbri: when using chef for deployments, is there some built in facility for adding an SSH private key, or its just assumed you'll add that somewhere else to the user doing the deploy
[2012-01-26 22:09:00 -0500] mattray: geekbri: if you're using bootstrap against a cloud provider, the ssh keys get injected (ie. knife ec2 server create)
[2012-01-26 22:10:00 -0500] geekbri: mattray: yeah that i knew, I meant I have a github repository im trying to deploy using the deploy resource, but of course the user thats deploy it needs a private key for access to the repository.
[2012-01-26 22:10:00 -0500] mattray: geekbri: if it's VMs or baremetal, you may need to pull ssh keys in with the bootstrap template
[2012-01-26 22:10:00 -0500] geekbri: mattray: Im guessing i can just store it in a data_bag and stream it to a file in the users directory somewhere
[2012-01-26 22:10:00 -0500] mattray: yup
[2012-01-26 22:10:00 -0500] mattray: the users cookbook does that
[2012-01-26 22:10:00 -0500] mattray: data bag
[2012-01-26 22:11:00 -0500] geekbri: mattray: I have that cookbook, but i didn't see a section for a private key
[2012-01-26 22:11:00 -0500] mattray: ahh, private key
[2012-01-26 22:11:00 -0500] mattray: no, it installs public keys
[2012-01-26 22:11:00 -0500] geekbri: yeah, I mean its not like its incredibly difficult to do, just a bit odd that the users cookbook doesn't do it
[2012-01-26 22:12:00 -0500] mattray: usually you don't want private keys spread willy-nilly
[2012-01-26 22:12:00 -0500] geekbri: mattray: well thats also a fact, but sometimes you need them installed :'(
[2012-01-26 22:13:00 -0500] geekbri: mattray: either way, i think its pretty simple to just add the private key to an encrypted data bag, then I can just create a recipe to write it to a file under whatever user
[2012-01-26 22:14:00 -0500] mattray: yup
[2012-01-26 22:18:00 -0500] knightorc: I've hit a wall with Chef 0.10.8 and Powershell 1.0.1 & 1.0.2, the chef-client is hanging (not exiting) on powershell execution. It just hangs and never proceeds. I'd NOT had this issue with Chef 0.10.6  I've tried Windows 2008 64 Ent R2 and Windows 2003 R2 Ent (32 and 64 bit)
[2012-01-26 22:19:00 -0500] ssd7: knightorc: I think it is probably this: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-988
[2012-01-26 22:21:00 -0500] knightorc: yes that does sound exactly my challenge. I'm not sure how I missed that in my search.
[2012-01-26 22:25:00 -0500] thehar: Who's stocked for the hack day on Saturday!
[2012-01-26 22:46:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: hmmm I've seen this error before but it's been so long I can't remember how to fix
[2012-01-26 22:46:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: "/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/socket.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32 "
[2012-01-26 22:47:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: I now it's a 32 vs 64 bit thing
[2012-01-26 22:50:00 -0500] knightorc: wdpro_kevin: not sure if this thread would help you, http://unix.derkeiler.com/Newsgroups/comp.unix.solaris/2006-05/msg01590.html  but it does talk about 32 vs 64 bit
[2012-01-26 22:51:00 -0500] flaccid: hey guys, anyone seen a boto cookbook around?
[2012-01-26 22:51:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: Thanks. I'm trying to solidify a document for Chef server installation and this prob hit me last time.
[2012-01-26 23:02:00 -0500] grgori: https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rbenv   heck yeah, now to fix it for debian
[2012-01-26 23:05:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: seems my 32 bit woes stem from a wonky Ruby or Gems install

[2012-01-26 23:09:00 -0500] closedbracket: never mind, I just now saw the --sudo flag
[2012-01-26 23:19:00 -0500] Damm: ubuntu uses the ubuntu user
[2012-01-26 23:19:00 -0500] Damm: and you have to sudo to get to root
[2012-01-26 23:19:00 -0500] Damm: so the bootstrap may need to be modified to use that
[2012-01-26 23:19:00 -0500] Damm: you can of course modify the ami and change what user is modified; if your up to it.
[2012-01-26 23:19:00 -0500] Damm: reminds me i need to fix the block mapping of one of my images
[2012-01-26 23:23:00 -0500] Damm: doh can't do what I want... pooh
[2012-01-26 23:34:00 -0500] flaccid: can someone just cite a recipe/cookbook where the install source is a tar.gz - i'd like to see the general routine of download, unarchive, install..

[2012-01-26 23:45:00 -0500] holoway: wdpro_kevin: from inside ruby or outside?
[2012-01-26 23:45:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: outside I think I have it
