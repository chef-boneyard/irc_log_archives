[2012-01-08 16:40:00 -0500] mrtazz: so the solution to manage rc.conf is rather easy. Just put the content in /etc/rc.conf.d/your-service and not in the global one
[2012-01-08 16:40:00 -0500] mrtazz: so these files can be written easily from the service's cookbook
[2012-01-08 16:41:00 -0500] mrtazz: feels a lot better this way
[2012-01-08 16:49:00 -0500] BryanWB: anyone done any work on templating apache rewrite rules?
[2012-01-08 17:51:00 -0500] labria: hey
[2012-01-08 17:52:00 -0500] labria: guys, what could be the reason for the chef-server not to write anything to the server.log? the permissions are right, the settings seem right too...
[2012-01-08 17:52:00 -0500] labria: (server 0.10.4)
