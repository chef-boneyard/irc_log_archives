[2012-01-30 12:52:00 -0500] gadolin: hey, i am tring to enable yum repo, as there is no recipe to do that, I delete it repo  and then add it, within yum_repository I run action [:remove, :add], however it looks that remove return control before file is removed, so i see in log action delete, action add, and then action delete which is called from within remove. May you point me how can I fix this order?
[2012-01-30 12:55:00 -0500] gadolin: action remove, action add, action delete
[2012-01-30 13:16:00 -0500] ghanteeds: Should I have one chef repository per project, or one per company I work for, or just one?
[2012-01-30 13:31:00 -0500] ghanteeds: Is your chef repo private? Do I commit it somewhere so that multiple members of the company can use it?? Why is this stuff not explained anywhere :(

[2012-01-30 14:28:00 -0500] geekbri: does anybody know of a good cookbook for managing unix groups ?
[2012-01-30 15:13:00 -0500] jamescarr: this might be a dumb question, but where the heck can I get my AWS access key from?
[2012-01-30 15:13:00 -0500] jamescarr: I'm following one of the quickstart tutorials
[2012-01-30 15:14:00 -0500] yfeldblum: jamescarr, the AWS website
[2012-01-30 15:14:00 -0500] thom: jamescarr: log in to the aws console, top right (where it says your account name), click that, dropdown, security credentials
[2012-01-30 15:15:00 -0500] jamescarr: duh... thanks guys
[2012-01-30 15:16:00 -0500] jamescarr: please bare with me this week... I am trying to get up and running with chef for my organization
[2012-01-30 15:16:00 -0500] jamescarr: :)
[2012-01-30 16:04:00 -0500] lorin1: Hi all. Is communication between knife and a chef server encrypted?
[2012-01-30 16:05:00 -0500] jamescarr: Is it common to see "waiting for sshd" for a long period of time?
[2012-01-30 16:06:00 -0500] itwasntandy: lorin1: look for chef_server_url in your knife.rb
[2012-01-30 16:06:00 -0500] itwasntandy: chef_server_url          "https://api.opscode.com/organizations/ean"
[2012-01-30 16:06:00 -0500] itwasntandy: ^^ from mine
[2012-01-30 16:06:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: jamescarr: make sure your security group allows SSH connections from your local server
[2012-01-30 16:06:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: local machine*
[2012-01-30 16:06:00 -0500] itwasntandy: i suspect yours will be https too - and thus yes.
[2012-01-30 16:07:00 -0500] jamescarr: thanks
[2012-01-30 16:08:00 -0500] yfeldblum: lorin1, chef-server-api is an HTTP API; if you want encryption, you must set chef-server-api to listen on localhost and you must front the chef-server-api with a reverse HTTP proxy exposing HTTPS (such as Apache) with your trusted certificate
[2012-01-30 16:09:00 -0500] yfeldblum: lorin1, the opscode hosted chef already does that
[2012-01-30 16:09:00 -0500] jamescarr: flashmanbahadur, I'm a moron. I didn't save my security group ;)
[2012-01-30 16:09:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: i just had the same problem 5 minutes ago, happens to all of us
[2012-01-30 16:10:00 -0500] jamescarr: flashmanbahadur, granted, I didn't see the message that my changes had not yet been applied because the pane was too  low :)
[2012-01-30 16:14:00 -0500] lorin1: yfeldblum: Thanks. I'm not using hosted chef, so I'll need to set up the reverse proxy.
[2012-01-30 16:20:00 -0500] lorin1: yfeldblum: If I want to set up https on, say, port 4001, do I need to edit the chef_server_url in /etc/chef/server.rb, or should it still be http://localhost:4000?
[2012-01-30 16:26:00 -0500] jamescarr: hmmm... is there someway to see what costs you're racking up with amazon EC2?
[2012-01-30 16:26:00 -0500] jchome: you have the instance prices
[2012-01-30 16:26:00 -0500] jchome: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#pricing
[2012-01-30 16:29:00 -0500] yfeldblum: lorin1, i'm not sure ... perhaps someone else knows, or you could experiment with it
[2012-01-30 16:30:00 -0500] lorin1: yfeldblum: Thanks, I'll play with it.
[2012-01-30 16:31:00 -0500] jamescarr: hmmm... if I do the java quickstart and use t1.micro instances, but launch 5 instances, it is still free?
[2012-01-30 16:34:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: jamescarr: the free teir gives 1 months worth of instance hours
[2012-01-30 16:34:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: so if you ran 5 instances, you could presumable run them for 1/5th of a month
[2012-01-30 16:34:00 -0500] jamescarr: flashmanbahadur, ah!
[2012-01-30 16:35:00 -0500] jamescarr: that is good to know!
[2012-01-30 16:36:00 -0500] gmcinnes: hi chefs. Anyone around who was volunteering the nagios plugins for chef processes the other day?
[2012-01-30 16:37:00 -0500] jamescarr: flashmanbahadur, doh... how can I see a listing of the AMIs available for the t1.micro tier?
[2012-01-30 16:40:00 -0500] jamescarr: ugh... AMI 'ami-da0cf8b3' with an instance-store root device is not supported for the instance type 't1.micro'
[2012-01-30 16:42:00 -0500] cap10morgan: is there a way to see what the effective value of an attribute is for a particular node?
[2012-01-30 16:42:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: if you log in to the node, does ohai tell you cap10morgan?
[2012-01-30 16:43:00 -0500] cap10morgan: and bonus points if it can tell me where the value comes from (i.e. environment default, environment override, etc.)
[2012-01-30 16:43:00 -0500] cap10morgan: flashmanbahadur: not sure. how do i ask it?
[2012-01-30 16:43:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: ssh in, become root, type 'ohai'
[2012-01-30 16:43:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: itll print out the node values in json
[2012-01-30 16:43:00 -0500] cap10morgan: ah. yep, let's see here...
[2012-01-30 16:44:00 -0500] jamescarr: it'd be cool to modify the quick start examples with examples that use t1.micro instances so peeps can try it out for free :)
[2012-01-30 16:44:00 -0500] jamescarr: at least I just got the email back from our bosses on how much we can rack up on EC2 this week :)
[2012-01-30 16:44:00 -0500] cap10morgan: flashmanbahadur: no, it's missing these attrs entirely
[2012-01-30 16:45:00 -0500] cap10morgan: flashmanbahadur: they're set in the environment, and the node is in that environment
[2012-01-30 16:45:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: hmm, may need to investigate shef
[2012-01-30 16:45:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: it allows you to walk through those sorts of things, not too familiar with it myself
[2012-01-30 16:45:00 -0500] cap10morgan: ok
[2012-01-30 16:45:00 -0500] cap10morgan: thx
[2012-01-30 16:46:00 -0500] rogernolan: @gmcinnes - I was talking chef/nagios on friday but more trying to fix problems in my install
[2012-01-30 16:47:00 -0500] gmcinnes: someone mentioned at some point they had a plugin for reporting to nagios when a chef proc goes tits up.
[2012-01-30 16:47:00 -0500] gmcinnes: I should have buttonholed whoever it was then, but I was neck deep in something else :)
[2012-01-30 16:48:00 -0500] cap10morgan: ok, grabbing the attribute in shef gets the right value, but the recipe is not using it. hmm...
[2012-01-30 16:56:00 -0500] moos3: any one use aws_elastic_lb ?
[2012-01-30 16:57:00 -0500] jamescarr: this may again sound like a silly question... but does chef provide any good mechanism to sync data from a local database to the cloud instances I create?
[2012-01-30 16:57:00 -0500] jamescarr: My work with chef is part of an experiment to move our infrastructure to amazon :)
[2012-01-30 16:57:00 -0500] moos3: you could write something easily to do it
[2012-01-30 16:58:00 -0500] moos3: jamescarr i know the feeling D:
[2012-01-30 16:58:00 -0500] mattray: jamescarr: bulk copying archives or live data?
[2012-01-30 16:59:00 -0500] jamescarr: bulk copy of live data
[2012-01-30 16:59:00 -0500] jamescarr: basically, I want to export data for an initial population, keep it in sync, then eventually migrate over
[2012-01-30 16:59:00 -0500] mattray: nothing like that built into Chef, but lots of tooling in the space
[2012-01-30 16:59:00 -0500] gmcinnes: jamescarr: what kind of db
[2012-01-30 16:59:00 -0500] jamescarr: (of course it's all an experiment. Sometime this week I plan to try chef against our internal VSphere environment)
[2012-01-30 16:59:00 -0500] jamescarr: gmcinnes, haha. Oracle :)
[2012-01-30 17:00:00 -0500] gmcinnes: ah. my condolences.
[2012-01-30 17:01:00 -0500] moos3: jamescarr we are truely sorry for you
[2012-01-30 17:05:00 -0500] jtimberman: jamescarr: you could write a cookbook library that queries the database with some Ruby library and use that in a recipe.
[2012-01-30 17:05:00 -0500] jtimberman: jamescarr: I'm deliberately vague on the details because I don't know if there's ruby libraries for connecting to Oracle :)
[2012-01-30 17:06:00 -0500] jtimberman: You can get some ideas here: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Libraries
[2012-01-30 17:07:00 -0500] jamescarr: so my jtimberman eh, should be easy enough to write or use some tool to do it when the time comes :)
[2012-01-30 17:07:00 -0500] jamescarr: sorry, had something types before I sent that :)
[2012-01-30 17:09:00 -0500] yfeldblum: bulk copy of live data sounds like something that might want to be done outside of chef; perhaps chef can drop a cron job onto a box that does it?
[2012-01-30 17:12:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: agreed
[2012-01-30 17:12:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: chef is oriented towards setting a servers state
[2012-01-30 17:13:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: not doing something like that
[2012-01-30 17:13:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: its job would be to make sure that the process to do the transfer has everything in place, like ssh keys, any packages needed to run the job etc
[2012-01-30 17:16:00 -0500] jamescarr: yep
[2012-01-30 17:18:00 -0500] jamescarr: so the java web quickstart. With one instance it works GREAT... with 4 boxes I get a null pointer exception when accessing it through the web?
[2012-01-30 17:20:00 -0500] jamescarr: I guess I'll have to ssh into the box and check. I'm guessing connection details don't match up
[2012-01-30 17:26:00 -0500] miah: moin
[2012-01-30 17:31:00 -0500] JasonBox: hrm, how to have a subscriber fire before a resource?
[2012-01-30 17:31:00 -0500] JasonBox: Besides logically ordering it that way expressly?
[2012-01-30 17:31:00 -0500] JasonBox: But that's probably my answer anyway
[2012-01-30 17:34:00 -0500] sniperd: JasonBox: Yeah, You probably need to think about it the other way around
[2012-01-30 17:35:00 -0500] jamescarr:  nice! knife-vsphere does exist!
[2012-01-30 17:38:00 -0500] jamescarr: so if I want to setup chef for a complete internal setup, I'll need to install a chef server somewhere in our infrastructure, correct?
[2012-01-30 17:39:00 -0500] moos3: or use chef-solo
[2012-01-30 17:39:00 -0500] moos3: and kinfe-solo
[2012-01-30 17:40:00 -0500] miah: or use hosted-chef
[2012-01-30 17:42:00 -0500] jtimberman: jamescarr: If you want a Chef Server behind your firewall that you run and manage, yes, Open Source Chef Server. If you want one that you can call Opscode to help you support, you can use Opscode Private Chef (http://opscode.com/private-chef)
[2012-01-30 17:43:00 -0500] c_t: if you pay a little extra, you'll get a group of opscode employees singing "I'm your Private Chef-er, a Chef-er for money, do what you want me to do"
[2012-01-30 17:49:00 -0500] Damm: jtimberman, 25k a month min right?
[2012-01-30 17:49:00 -0500] Damm: ;)
[2012-01-30 17:51:00 -0500] Damm: j/k
[2012-01-30 18:03:00 -0500] brandoma: c_t i think you just ruined my next three meals with that image
[2012-01-30 18:04:00 -0500] jtimberman: Damm: I don't know what pricing is like :)
[2012-01-30 18:05:00 -0500] moos3: lol
[2012-01-30 18:05:00 -0500] moos3: anyone have a good way to add nodes to a aws elastic lb ?
[2012-01-30 18:10:00 -0500] Damm: jtimberman, oh I was just being silly
[2012-01-30 18:13:00 -0500] dchalloner: Is there anyway to set a chef variable with an HTTP or bash call?
[2012-01-30 18:14:00 -0500] dchalloner: erm, I know I can set it with the chef server API but I mean in the recipe at runtime
[2012-01-30 18:17:00 -0500] jtimberman: moos3: the latest aws cookbook in our github repository has an aws LB LWRP, but I haven't tested it.
[2012-01-30 18:18:00 -0500] jtimberman: http://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/tree/master/aws
[2012-01-30 18:18:00 -0500] moos3: jtimberman yeah i pulled it down and uploaded it to my chef server but i'm getting ATAL: NoMethodError: undefined method `aws_elastic_lb' for #<Chef::Recipe:0x2aaab12776b8>
[2012-01-30 18:19:00 -0500] moos3: and i can't figure out why or what is causing that, i'm including the recipe and when i do the role i'm including it there too
[2012-01-30 18:21:00 -0500] jtimberman: moos3: does the aws cookbook get cached by the client?
[2012-01-30 18:22:00 -0500] jtimberman: moos3: you may need to add depends 'aws' to the metadata of the cookbook where you're using the lwrp
[2012-01-30 18:22:00 -0500] moos3: jtimberman this is on knife ec2 bootstraping
[2012-01-30 18:22:00 -0500] moos3: k
[2012-01-30 18:23:00 -0500] moos3: i'll give that a go and see if that fixes that
[2012-01-30 18:26:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: anyone have success using a template to notify a custom LWRP?  keep having issues where it says it cannot find the resource
[2012-01-30 18:31:00 -0500] moos3: jtimberman http://pastie.org/3283819
[2012-01-30 18:31:00 -0500] moos3: jtimberman my recipe looks like this http://pastie.org/3283825
[2012-01-30 18:40:00 -0500] hcastro: moos3: i think what jtimberman was saying is that the ELB LWRP is on opscode/cookbooks master, but isn't pulled down by `knife cookbook site install aws`
[2012-01-30 18:43:00 -0500] moos3: hcastro yeah when i try that all i get is a tar.gz file for aws
[2012-01-30 18:43:00 -0500] moos3: it blows up
[2012-01-30 18:44:00 -0500] hcastro: if you look inside aws/providers, do you see elastic_lb.rb?
[2012-01-30 18:44:00 -0500] moos3: yea
[2012-01-30 18:44:00 -0500] moos3: thats what i'm not understanding, its def there
[2012-01-30 18:46:00 -0500] cwj: are you sure your node's environment definition is permitting it to retrieve the latest version of the aws cookbook?
[2012-01-30 18:47:00 -0500] moos3: should be, when i issue knife ec2 server create, i watch it and its pulling it down
[2012-01-30 18:47:00 -0500] hcastro: another potential issue is that you're using `=` to assign attributes to the ELB provider
[2012-01-30 18:47:00 -0500] moos3: what should i use
[2012-01-30 18:48:00 -0500] jamescarr: oh no... so it turns out my workplace uses Oracle VM, not VSphere. Is there anyway to knife bootstrap OVM instances>
[2012-01-30 18:48:00 -0500] jamescarr: ?
[2012-01-30 18:48:00 -0500] hcastro: moos3: should look like this: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Opscode+LWRP+Resources#OpscodeLWRPResources-aws
[2012-01-30 18:49:00 -0500] moos3: hcastro thanks
[2012-01-30 18:50:00 -0500] moos3: lets give it a go and see
[2012-01-30 18:51:00 -0500] rocky1: i'm getting this error when trying to install a jenkins cookbook - http://pastebin.com/E6iG0pKm - something about not finding a provider, anyone have a clue what i'm doing wrong or am missing?
[2012-01-30 18:52:00 -0500] geekbri: Is there a way to use the deploy_revision resource via an HTTPS deploy with git?
[2012-01-30 18:53:00 -0500] moos3: hcastro some reason i just thinks that aws_elastic_lb is a undefined method
[2012-01-30 18:53:00 -0500] moos3: :(
[2012-01-30 18:55:00 -0500] hcastro: i'd ssh into your target host and confirm that the ELB provider is on there
[2012-01-30 18:55:00 -0500] moos3: k
[2012-01-30 18:56:00 -0500] moos3: hcastro http://pastie.org/3283958
[2012-01-30 18:57:00 -0500] yfeldblum: flashmanbahadur, code?
[2012-01-30 18:58:00 -0500] hcastro: moos3: you're missing the corresponding ELB resource
[2012-01-30 18:58:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: yfeldblum: working around it now, I think the issue was that although the provider was defined in an included recipe i never had a block that specified :provider , If I cant get it shortly Ill post a gist, thnaks
[2012-01-30 19:07:00 -0500] dchalloner: G

[2012-01-30 19:09:00 -0500] bemu: You should build an IRC client on top of vim.
[2012-01-30 19:09:00 -0500] gmcinnes: dd for suggesting that :)
[2012-01-30 19:09:00 -0500] moos3: bemu thats emacs :D

[2012-01-30 19:14:00 -0500] erikh: use ConqueTerm
[2012-01-30 19:14:00 -0500] erikh: no need for the irc client then :)
[2012-01-30 19:16:00 -0500] segv: chef can do a "notifies" on a package resource no?

[2012-01-30 19:19:00 -0500] segv: erikh: cool, thought so
[2012-01-30 19:19:00 -0500] erikh: basically anything that can accept actions can accept notifies
[2012-01-30 19:19:00 -0500] erikh: well, any resources
[2012-01-30 19:19:00 -0500] erikh: I'm making this more complicated than it really is.

[2012-01-30 19:22:00 -0500] j-v-e: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Core+Components on the right side of this page
[2012-01-30 19:23:00 -0500] siezer: j-v-e I gave the same talk at scale10x, you can see the slides here: http://bit.ly/As83mQ
[2012-01-30 19:24:00 -0500] siezer: they'll be putting video up eventually too I think
[2012-01-30 19:24:00 -0500] jamescarr: anyone have a knife  example that uses a micro instance AMI?
[2012-01-30 19:27:00 -0500] jamescarr: argh... another question. How can I ssh into my boxes I create with chef? At least the java-web-start one?
[2012-01-30 19:27:00 -0500] siezer: j-v-e I fixed the link up too =)
[2012-01-30 19:29:00 -0500] j-v-e: thanks
[2012-01-30 19:30:00 -0500] j-v-e: I was hoping for something more technical, I guess the wiki is the right place them
[2012-01-30 19:30:00 -0500] j-v-e: then*
[2012-01-30 19:30:00 -0500] jamescarr: nvm. I figured it out
[2012-01-30 19:30:00 -0500] siezer: yep. the intro slides are high level overview of "heres wtf this tool can let you accomplish"
[2012-01-30 19:31:00 -0500] siezer: jamescarr knife ssh?
[2012-01-30 19:31:00 -0500] jamescarr: siezer, OH!
[2012-01-30 19:31:00 -0500] jamescarr: didnt know about knife ssh
[2012-01-30 19:31:00 -0500] jamescarr: I was sshing by hand
[2012-01-30 19:31:00 -0500] siezer: yep
[2012-01-30 19:31:00 -0500] siezer: knife ssh "search:terms" command
[2012-01-30 19:35:00 -0500] jamescarr: argh I am not getting the tomcat cookbook. How the heck do I configure jndi with it?
[2012-01-30 19:37:00 -0500] volker-: i'm playing around with shef but am kinda confused.
[2012-01-30 19:37:00 -0500] jamescarr: dude, I am totally confused. I dont think chef is typically used for java web apps
[2012-01-30 19:37:00 -0500] jamescarr: either that or the provided cookbook is just very basic ;(
[2012-01-30 19:38:00 -0500] volker-: everytime i ask for something (e.g. clients.all or nodes.all[2]) i get some strange objects back #<Chef...>, which don't seem to accept basic ruby options
[2012-01-30 19:38:00 -0500] volker-: be aware, I'm new to ruby ;-)
[2012-01-30 19:38:00 -0500] Otterley: what's the suggested paradigm for adding functions or libraries that are shared across cookbooks to a Chef repo?
[2012-01-30 19:40:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: yfeldblum: ok, I think I got it.  I had a misunderstanding about 'instantiating' the LWRP in my cookbook because in my mind it was a standalone server so I assumed it should just exist after I defined it in the LWRP cookbook.  Seems to be fine now, thanks for the help
[2012-01-30 19:42:00 -0500] moos3: hcastro that missing resource file was key, now shit is working prefect :D
[2012-01-30 19:46:00 -0500] siezer: jamescarr the cookbook is just very basic
[2012-01-30 19:47:00 -0500] jamescarr: siezer, yeah, looks like I'll need to modify it. Heavily
[2012-01-30 19:47:00 -0500] jamescarr: I'm thinking that I'll want to use databags for the jndi info
[2012-01-30 19:48:00 -0500] jamescarr: siezer, do you know how to use knife to create a micro instance? Everytime I try, I get this
[2012-01-30 19:49:00 -0500] jamescarr: ERROR: Fog::Service::Error: UnsupportedOperation => AMI 'ami-7000f019' with an instance-store root device is not supported for the instance type 't1.micro'.
[2012-01-30 19:49:00 -0500] jamescarr: :(
[2012-01-30 19:50:00 -0500] siezer: the AMI you're trying to use isn't compatible with a t1.micro apparently
[2012-01-30 19:50:00 -0500] siezer: what distro are you trying to use?
[2012-01-30 19:50:00 -0500] jamescarr: ubintu
[2012-01-30 19:50:00 -0500] jamescarr: *ubuntu
[2012-01-30 19:51:00 -0500] siezer: http://cloud.ubuntu.com/ami/ <-- pick an EBS backed one
[2012-01-30 19:51:00 -0500] siezer: 64 bit
[2012-01-30 19:51:00 -0500] erikh: micro instances are always ebs root
[2012-01-30 19:51:00 -0500] erikh: not instance root
[2012-01-30 19:51:00 -0500] Drewzar: They used to be.
[2012-01-30 19:52:00 -0500] siezer: huh
[2012-01-30 19:52:00 -0500] siezer: *shrug*
[2012-01-30 19:53:00 -0500] jamescarr: siezer, thanks
[2012-01-30 19:53:00 -0500] siezer: no prob
[2012-01-30 20:03:00 -0500] jamescarr: Okay, this might sound slightly retarded, but how the heck to I configure jndi to point to a database server that was just created dynamically?
[2012-01-30 20:04:00 -0500] jamescarr: or in a more general term, what if I wanted to configure /etc/hosts to have foo point to a newly provisioned chef client?
[2012-01-30 20:04:00 -0500] jamescarr: on another chef client
[2012-01-30 20:09:00 -0500] JasonBox: jamescarr: I always had hosts populated on a subsequent chef run
[2012-01-30 20:10:00 -0500] jtimberman: jamescarr: rather than customizing the existing cookbook, i'd write an app specific one that lets you do the things you need once tomcat is ready for your app
[2012-01-30 20:11:00 -0500] jtimberman: jamescarr: also, search is typically used for those kinds of things
[2012-01-30 20:11:00 -0500] jtimberman: jamescarr: hostlist = search(:node, "ipaddress:* AND hostname:*")
[2012-01-30 20:12:00 -0500] jtimberman: then pass hostlist into a template that renders as /etc/hosts
[2012-01-30 20:14:00 -0500] jamescarr: jtimberman, cool
[2012-01-30 20:14:00 -0500] jamescarr: thanks
[2012-01-30 20:16:00 -0500] jamescarr: jtimberman, another question, back to jndi. I could create a cookbook that adds jndi connections, but where would  "the right place" be to store the jndi info, such as username/password, etc
[2012-01-30 20:16:00 -0500] jamescarr: data bags?
[2012-01-30 20:16:00 -0500] bawt: data bags are http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Data+Bags or the real ultimate power!
[2012-01-30 20:16:00 -0500] jtimberman: jamescarr: as for the jndi stuff, i'd make sure the data base server is set up using a role and search for a node that has that role applied.
[2012-01-30 20:16:00 -0500] jtimberman: jamescarr: which is how the application::java recipe works :)
[2012-01-30 20:17:00 -0500] jtimberman: generally, data bags.
[2012-01-30 20:17:00 -0500] jtimberman: encrypted even, if you wish.
[2012-01-30 20:21:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: anyone have a good snippet for updating the hostname in /etc/hosts, or know of a good package? dont want to dive in to regex if I dont have to
[2012-01-30 20:21:00 -0500] jamescarr: jtimberman, hmmm... I still think it'd make sense for the default cookbook to support jndi
[2012-01-30 20:22:00 -0500] JasonBox: flashmanbahadur: someone just posted that on the ml, actually
[2012-01-30 20:22:00 -0500] arrowtoknee: flashmanbahadur: heres what i use  https://gist.github.com/41314e27e144a532ae01
[2012-01-30 20:22:00 -0500] JasonBox: https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/blob/master/dynect/recipes/ec2.rb#L59-61
[2012-01-30 20:22:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: thanks
[2012-01-30 20:23:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: ok, I must have gotten that posted earlier because that is pretty close to what I have
[2012-01-30 20:23:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: just need to tweak it to respect any existing defs in this case
[2012-01-30 20:23:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: thanks
[2012-01-30 20:25:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: actually, since I am ubuntu it stores the ones I dont want to overwrite in 127.0.1.1, so I should be fine to just set my 127.0.0.1 line
[2012-01-30 20:29:00 -0500] jamescarr: when I use node[:tomcat] in a template, does it resolve against databags too?
[2012-01-30 20:31:00 -0500] fujin: no
[2012-01-30 20:34:00 -0500] mattray: jamescarr: you'll need to pull up the data bag and the items in it http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Data+Bags
[2012-01-30 20:53:00 -0500] ranjibd: anybody around who has used chef via mcollective
[2012-01-30 21:11:00 -0500] jamescarr: so.. does anyone have a minute to help me with the java-quick-start?
[2012-01-30 21:11:00 -0500] ranjibd: jamescarr, sure
[2012-01-30 21:11:00 -0500] jamescarr: I got it running but just confused about how jndi works on the single instance but not the multiple instances
[2012-01-30 21:12:00 -0500] jamescarr: I mean, on the single instance it works and looks up the database connection via jndi/dbapp
[2012-01-30 21:12:00 -0500] jamescarr: on multiple instances, jdbc/dbapp returns null
[2012-01-30 21:17:00 -0500] ranjibd: null? nil you mean
[2012-01-30 21:18:00 -0500] jamescarr: well, not in chef. I mean in the java app that is deployed
[2012-01-30 21:18:00 -0500] jamescarr: my error occurs in the app on the running system, not in chef
[2012-01-30 21:18:00 -0500] jamescarr: I'm guessing a recipe or something doesn't get ran
[2012-01-30 21:18:00 -0500] jamescarr: but I cannot for the life of me figure out how jndi gets configured in the single instance
[2012-01-30 21:27:00 -0500] gmcinnes: hey all. Going to ask my boring question about nagios being alerted on failing chef runs again.  Anyone here done that?
[2012-01-30 21:28:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: gmcinnes: on the same server?
[2012-01-30 21:28:00 -0500] asg: gmcinnes: no but I imagine it would be easy to do with a chef report handler and NCSA
[2012-01-30 21:28:00 -0500] flashmanbahadur: you could always just check the timestamp of the chef stacktrace
[2012-01-30 21:29:00 -0500] gmcinnes: Ah. See. I think I need to learn about both of those. Someone popped up the other day who'd already done it though, so I was going to externalize my learning :)
[2012-01-30 21:29:00 -0500] gmcinnes: flashmanbahadur: No. Different servers. I'm already monitoring the chef process running, but it doesn't tell me if it's just puking every time.
[2012-01-30 21:31:00 -0500] moos3: in the chef open source dashboard how does one enable the status tab ?
[2012-01-30 21:32:00 -0500] Brad_K: gmcinnes: yeah, there are standard chef handlers for doing stuff like that.  some nice knife plugins for seeing when the last time a server checked in, too.
[2012-01-30 21:32:00 -0500] gmcinnes: oh. nice.
[2012-01-30 21:33:00 -0500] Brad_K: take a look at the "ohno" plugin for knife.  it will tell you all the nodes that haven't checked in for at least as many hours as you specify on the command line.  So, "knife ohno 6" will tell you all the nodes whose last checkin time was six hours ago or older.
[2012-01-30 21:33:00 -0500] ranjibd: jamescarr, whats the output of chef-run?
[2012-01-30 21:33:00 -0500] jamescarr: it completes
[2012-01-30 21:34:00 -0500] jamescarr: in fact, here's the single instance running: http://ec2-174-129-114-237.compute-1.amazonaws.com/products
[2012-01-30 21:34:00 -0500] gmcinnes: I'll check it out. I'm less worried about chef not checking in than it only getting halfway through the run list due to duncity on my part.  I'll look for NSCA stuff.
[2012-01-30 21:35:00 -0500] Brad_K: gmcinnes: if the chef run doesn't complete, then it doesn't do a node save, and you don't get a "checkin".
[2012-01-30 21:35:00 -0500] gmcinnes: *OH*. Awesome.
[2012-01-30 21:36:00 -0500] Brad_K: my recent duncity caused all our servers to go without checking in for more than 76 hours, because each and every one of them would fail during the chef run.  fortunately, we're not in production yet.
[2012-01-30 21:37:00 -0500] gmcinnes: well, you live and lean, eh? :)  Chefs use sharp knives.
[2012-01-30 21:37:00 -0500] Brad_K: and chain saws.
[2012-01-30 21:37:00 -0500] gmcinnes: It's great to be able to manage 76 servers at a time, but it also means you can fsck 76 servers at a time.
[2012-01-30 21:38:00 -0500] Otterley: "whatever can be done for you automatically can be done to you automatically"
[2012-01-30 21:38:00 -0500] gmcinnes: :)
[2012-01-30 21:39:00 -0500] Brad_K: tools like the "spork" plugin for knife help make it easier to keep from shooting yourself in the foot, but sometimes the techniques that work well for a large shop like etsy don't necessarily scale so well to a small shop like ours, where i'm really the only guy who's doing much work with chef.
[2012-01-30 21:41:00 -0500] ranjibd: gmcinnes, use the report /exception handler and use nsca
[2012-01-30 21:58:00 -0500] miah: strange that notifies doesn't seem to be triggering on a directory resource
[2012-01-30 22:05:00 -0500] jamescarr: help me understand.... I'm trying to create a vagrant instance for the java-web-quickstart and it seems to not like the roles
[2012-01-30 22:06:00 -0500] jamescarr: I get "TypeError: can't convert nil into String" when trying to run it
[2012-01-30 22:07:00 -0500] gmcinnes: jamescarr: when trying to run what?
[2012-01-30 22:08:00 -0500] jamescarr: vagrant up
[2012-01-30 22:08:00 -0500] jamescarr: nevermind... I found out why
[2012-01-30 22:12:00 -0500] miah: ah. my resource names weren't unique enough. makes sense. first major derp of the day. GO ME!
[2012-01-30 22:12:00 -0500] gmcinnes: s/unique enough/unique/
[2012-01-30 22:12:00 -0500] miah: hey, it was my joke to make :P
[2012-01-30 22:13:00 -0500] gmcinnes: :)
[2012-01-30 22:37:00 -0500] hippiehacker: with the 10.8 .msi on windows, when running chef-client -l debug, it hangs at DEBUG: Loading plugin windows::kernel
[2012-01-30 22:39:00 -0500] hippiehacker: https://gist.github.com/1707256 # windows chef-client run hangs....
[2012-01-30 22:47:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: I'm trying to run a "run_list remove" command based on a knife search
[2012-01-30 22:47:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: I'm pretty sure it can be done just not sure of the syntax
[2012-01-30 22:49:00 -0500] ctrabold: Hi! Is there a way to generate a dependency graph / graphviz based on a given role strucure?
[2012-01-30 22:49:00 -0500] erikh: node.run_list.delete(item)
[2012-01-30 22:50:00 -0500] erikh: I have a script that does this but I don't think I can share it
[2012-01-30 22:50:00 -0500] erikh: but the important part is above :)
[2012-01-30 22:51:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: so you use "knife exec -E"
[2012-01-30 22:51:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: scratch that
[2012-01-30 22:52:00 -0500] erikh: I just wrote a script that uses chef as a library.
[2012-01-30 22:53:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: I get it thanks. I'm wondering how I can do it from knife
[2012-01-30 22:53:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: but your way is prob easier
[2012-01-30 22:54:00 -0500] erikh: it's nice if you plan to use it a lot
[2012-01-30 22:54:00 -0500] erikh: that and I don't use knife exec -E so I don't think I can help you with that method.
[2012-01-30 22:55:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: I just renamed.reorged a bunch of roles and I'l looking to remove the old roles
[2012-01-30 22:55:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: no worries you have spun me in a diff direction
[2012-01-30 22:55:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: which may be good
[2012-01-30 22:59:00 -0500] erikh: yeah, I have some recipes intended to run once
[2012-01-30 22:59:00 -0500] erikh: so they remove themselves after converging
[2012-01-30 22:59:00 -0500] erikh: so the tool is nice for testing
[2012-01-30 22:59:00 -0500] erikh: (it appends instead of deletes)
[2012-01-30 23:00:00 -0500] jtimberman: ctrabold: https://github.com/jonlives/knife-plugin-role-viz
[2012-01-30 23:02:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: cool erikh that info will come in handy for something else I have cooking
[2012-01-30 23:03:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: if anyone interested to remove a role via a search try something like this
[2012-01-30 23:03:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: knife exec -E 'nodes.transform("hostname:*lamp*"){ |n| n.run_list.delete("role[zend_pep]")}'
[2012-01-30 23:03:00 -0500] ctrabold: jtimberman Awesome! Thanks! Strange I didn't find it through my google searches :-/
[2012-01-30 23:03:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: any hostname with "lamp"  (thanks erikh)
[2012-01-30 23:07:00 -0500] erikh: coolness
[2012-01-30 23:08:00 -0500] JasonBox: Yeah, knife is pretty awesome
[2012-01-30 23:15:00 -0500] jtimberman: ctrabold: it is pretty new :)
[2012-01-30 23:16:00 -0500] JasonBox: hrm, the mysql cookbook doesn't drop the test database, should it?
[2012-01-30 23:17:00 -0500] wdpro_kevin: run_list.delete is the method for removing what is the method to add? (btw run_list.add tossed an error)
[2012-01-30 23:19:00 -0500] JasonBox: would be cute if it was just <<
[2012-01-30 23:22:00 -0500] hippiehacker: is there a way to edit attributes in roles via knife? (versions of software to deploy?)
[2012-01-30 23:23:00 -0500] erikh: wdpro_kevin: it's just <<
[2012-01-30 23:23:00 -0500] geekbri: hippiehacker: knife role edit <role name> ?
[2012-01-30 23:23:00 -0500] geekbri: hippiehacker: knife role edit <role name> ?
[2012-01-30 23:23:00 -0500] geekbri: whoops didn't mean to do that twice, silly uparrow :)
[2012-01-30 23:24:00 -0500] hippiehacker: geekbri: yes, but progromatically
[2012-01-30 23:25:00 -0500] geekbri: hippiehacker: edit the role file then upload it to the chef server?
[2012-01-30 23:25:00 -0500] hippiehacker: knife role from file sorta works, but I wanted to write a something just to update an attribute
[2012-01-30 23:25:00 -0500] hippiehacker: on multiple roles
[2012-01-30 23:26:00 -0500] hippiehacker: (we have a role per pair of deployments into a cluster, we usually run the same version on groups of them, but not all the time)
[2012-01-30 23:26:00 -0500] fujin: i store versions of software to deploy in a databag
[2012-01-30 23:26:00 -0500] fujin: easier to edit it
