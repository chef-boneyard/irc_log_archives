[2012-01-13 10:37:00 -0500] shayes: Hi everyone
[2012-01-13 10:39:00 -0500] shayes: the hosted and private chef offers are hosted on amazon EC2 ?
[2012-01-13 10:53:00 -0500] iroller: shayes: % ping api.opscode.com                                                                                                                                        PING api.opscode.com (184.106.28.81 % whois 184.106.28.81                                                                                                                                           Rackspace Hosting RACKS-8-NET-4 (NET-184-106-0-0-1) 184.106.0.0 - 184.106.255
[2012-01-13 10:54:00 -0500] iroller: sorry, https://gist.github.com/6dc161644467dd638363
[2012-01-13 10:59:00 -0500] shayes: so it's opscode infrastructure ?
[2012-01-13 11:01:00 -0500] shayes: I don't know if they use it only for API
[2012-01-13 11:09:00 -0500] coderanger: shayes: Hosted Chef is run from a private cloud in a colo datacenter, Private Chef is an appliance so it runs on your hardware wheverever you want :)
[2012-01-13 11:11:00 -0500] shayes: ok thanks for the information coderanger
[2012-01-13 11:11:00 -0500] coderanger: We use both EC2 and Rackspace cloud for some ancillary functions, off-site monitoring for example
[2012-01-13 11:11:00 -0500] shayes: you don't have the choice on which operating system you want to run your virtual machines ?
[2012-01-13 11:12:00 -0500] coderanger: Any particular reason?
[2012-01-13 11:12:00 -0500] coderanger: Not like it really matters either way :-)
[2012-01-13 11:13:00 -0500] shayes: indeed
[2012-01-13 11:13:00 -0500] coderanger: We are mostly Ubuntu based
[2012-01-13 11:14:00 -0500] shayes: yeah debian base ;)
[2012-01-13 11:14:00 -0500] coderanger: But Private Chef runs on CentOS too, so we have test systems for that
[2012-01-13 11:14:00 -0500] coderanger: and Windows jenkins slaves
[2012-01-13 11:15:00 -0500] coderanger: Chef runs everywhere, so we have a little bit of everything here and there :)
[2012-01-13 11:15:00 -0500] shayes: i'm currently searching any informations about cloud automatisation offers for my school projects
[2012-01-13 11:17:00 -0500] shayes: i would like to provide a tool (web based) to automate everything "setup virtual machines (OS), installing applications with chef, monitoring, etc...)
[2012-01-13 11:18:00 -0500] shayes: vagrant is a good project but it's only use Virtualbox ;)
[2012-01-13 11:18:00 -0500] shayes: the scope of the project is "private cloud"
[2012-01-13 11:19:00 -0500] shayes: private chef is in the same field :p
[2012-01-13 11:20:00 -0500] drrk: shayes: have you looked at OpenNebula
[2012-01-13 11:20:00 -0500] drrk: http://opennebula.org/about:about
[2012-01-13 11:20:00 -0500] drrk: There is even a chef reciepe to install it, and then you can treat it like EC2
[2012-01-13 11:21:00 -0500] shayes: yeah :)
[2012-01-13 11:36:00 -0500] lflux_: ohai chefs
[2012-01-13 12:49:00 -0500] `brendan: morning.. happy friday!
[2012-01-13 13:52:00 -0500] drrk: It's not a happy friday for another 3hours when it is home time!
[2012-01-13 14:18:00 -0500] BryanWB: mattray: did u test spiceweasel w/ ruby 1.9.2?
[2012-01-13 14:19:00 -0500] mattray: yeah, that's my primary ruby per rvm
[2012-01-13 14:23:00 -0500] BryanWB: weird, am getting syntax errors
[2012-01-13 14:23:00 -0500] BryanWB: but it is probably me
[2012-01-13 14:29:00 -0500] mattray: the 1.0 version attempts to be more descriptive in the error messages
[2012-01-13 14:29:00 -0500] mattray: and use STDERR instead of stack traces :)
[2012-01-13 14:35:00 -0500] BryanWB: mattray: woof!
[2012-01-13 14:35:00 -0500] BryanWB: mattray: didn't know that yaml was whitespace-sensitive
[2012-01-13 14:35:00 -0500] BryanWB: mattray: indenting the individual data bag items fixes the issue i had
[2012-01-13 14:35:00 -0500] mattray: well, at least indentation-sensitive. Might I recommend emacs yaml-mode :)
[2012-01-13 14:36:00 -0500] BryanWB: the code on your blog doesn't show indentation
[2012-01-13 14:36:00 -0500] BryanWB: yaml-mode? sweet, that saves me from writing one ;)
[2012-01-13 14:36:00 -0500] mattray: hrm did the blog eat it?
[2012-01-13 14:36:00 -0500] mattray: crap, it did
[2012-01-13 14:36:00 -0500] BryanWB: ay
[2012-01-13 14:37:00 -0500] mattray: apparently <code> isn't as good as it used to be
[2012-01-13 14:37:00 -0500] yfeldblum: BryanWB, you know what's awesome? writing a knife plugin to permit showing, editing, and from-filing any object as YAML instead of JSON ;D
[2012-01-13 14:38:00 -0500] yfeldblum: because YAML is awesome
[2012-01-13 14:38:00 -0500] BryanWB: yfeldblum: i don't see the appeal of yaml, why can't we just use an xml-schema?
[2012-01-13 14:38:00 -0500] mattray: FFS, wordpress just eats it
[2012-01-13 14:40:00 -0500] mattray: <pre> it is. Apparently <code> is just for fonts :(
[2012-01-13 14:41:00 -0500] mattray: if someone wants XML support, fine by me. I didn't even want JSON initially. As long as it's as simple as adding JSON support I don't care
[2012-01-13 14:41:00 -0500] BryanWB: it burns!
[2012-01-13 14:41:00 -0500] BryanWB: but it is delicious!
[2012-01-13 14:48:00 -0500] yfeldblum: bah ... YAML is for human-editable data; JSON is for machine-readable/machine-writable data
[2012-01-13 14:48:00 -0500] yfeldblum: XML is for masochists
[2012-01-13 14:51:00 -0500] BryanWB: beat me!
[2012-01-13 14:52:00 -0500] lflux: YAMLs only problem is that it doesn't accept tabs for indenting
[2012-01-13 14:52:00 -0500] yfeldblum: i don't accept tabs for indenting either!
[2012-01-13 14:53:00 -0500] yfeldblum: anything whitespace-sensitive will have giant issues when it comes to mixed leading whitespace (mixtures between spaces and tabs leading one line, or spaces leading one line and tabs leading another line, etc)
[2012-01-13 14:54:00 -0500] yfeldblum: includes python, haskell, and yaml
[2012-01-13 14:54:00 -0500] yfeldblum: and make
[2012-01-13 14:54:00 -0500] lflux: my editor defaults to tabs, I don't like leaving fundamental-mode
[2012-01-13 14:54:00 -0500] yfeldblum: easiest possible solution is to demand one or the other, and forbid the mixture
[2012-01-13 14:54:00 -0500] lflux: but that's my only gripe with YAML, otherwise it's pretty nice.
[2012-01-13 14:55:00 -0500] yfeldblum: i am certainly used to tabs from C#
[2012-01-13 14:55:00 -0500] yfeldblum: in that world, there's a whole lot of tab going on
[2012-01-13 14:56:00 -0500] atomic-penguin: Related: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_%28programming_language%29
[2012-01-13 14:57:00 -0500] BryanWB: mattray, tks to indents, it is now working like a charm! tks for the awesome tool
[2012-01-13 14:57:00 -0500] mattray: my pleasure
[2012-01-13 14:58:00 -0500] BryanWB: i don't understand why it tries to access README.md.tar.gz
[2012-01-13 14:59:00 -0500] mattray: what's that?
[2012-01-13 15:02:00 -0500] BryanWB: it generates thsi cmd   `knife cookbook site download README.md  --file cookbooks/README.md.tgz `
[2012-01-13 15:02:00 -0500] BryanWB: then tars it up, then deletes it
[2012-01-13 15:02:00 -0500] BryanWB: gtg
[2012-01-13 15:04:00 -0500] mattray: was the README.md in the yaml?
[2012-01-13 15:26:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: Fucking chef.
[2012-01-13 15:26:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: Awesome.
[2012-01-13 15:26:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: I love it when a plan comes together.
[2012-01-13 15:26:00 -0500] bdha: yay?
[2012-01-13 15:26:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: mucho yay amigo.
[2012-01-13 15:27:00 -0500] bdha: Yay!
[2012-01-13 15:29:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: It's great to watch systems sing and dance.
[2012-01-13 15:51:00 -0500] youngjedi: i have a local rubygems mirror that i'm using because my chef node doesn't have public connectivity
[2012-01-13 15:51:00 -0500] youngjedi: on first chef run, i update /etc/gemrc with the proper mirrors list
[2012-01-13 15:51:00 -0500] youngjedi: however, chef doesn't pick this up until the second chef run
[2012-01-13 15:51:00 -0500] youngjedi: is there a way to "refresh" the gem mirrors list?
[2012-01-13 15:53:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: hmm. that seems weird.  As I understand it underneath it all, chef is just using 'gem'.  You would think gem would look at the new mirrors list.
[2012-01-13 15:54:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: Are you sure those things are happening in the order you expect, from the debug output?
[2012-01-13 15:55:00 -0500] lflux: chef uses the ruby API for gem in some places instead of just running the binary
[2012-01-13 15:55:00 -0500] yfeldblum: chef is using Gem, the Ruby API for rubygems, directly from the chef gem_package provider
[2012-01-13 15:55:00 -0500] hcastro: anyone else get this a lot? "yum-dump Locking Error! Couldn't obtain an exclusive yum lock in 10 seconds. Giving up."
[2012-01-13 15:56:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: oh. innneresting.
[2012-01-13 15:56:00 -0500] lflux: ... which made using a HTTP proxy interesting
[2012-01-13 15:56:00 -0500] lflux: hint: gem isn't well documented.
[2012-01-13 15:56:00 -0500] lflux: I ended up way down in the source to realize how to set the http proxy for the gem api
[2012-01-13 16:23:00 -0500] mkent_: hcastro, are you running yum-updatesd or otherwise triggering yum via cron?
[2012-01-13 16:24:00 -0500] hcastro: mkent_: no, typically it happens when i do a package install from a recipe
[2012-01-13 16:25:00 -0500] hcastro: or i should say, multiple package installs within separate recipes in a row
[2012-01-13 16:26:00 -0500] mkent_: hmm, well the only way you can get that is if yum is running elsewhere and holding the lock
[2012-01-13 16:27:00 -0500] wereHamster: I'm truing to use chef-solo + vagrant + data bags
[2012-01-13 16:27:00 -0500] wereHamster: it always fails with Chef::Exceptions::PrivateKeyMissing: I cannot read /etc/chef/client.pem, which you told me to use to sign requests!
[2012-01-13 16:28:00 -0500] hcastro: mkent_: possibly one package install from cookbook 1 is still occurring as another package install from cookbook 2 is starting?
[2012-01-13 16:30:00 -0500] mkent_: shouldn't, chef will block while yum runs, and it doesn't exit out until it's done. unless you have chef running as a daemon but you are running it in the foreground i suppose
[2012-01-13 16:31:00 -0500] mkent_: sure if you 'ps axuw | grep yum' there's no yum related daemons going?
[2012-01-13 16:32:00 -0500] hcastro: mkent_: yum-updatesd is running
[2012-01-13 16:33:00 -0500] mkent_: that'll do it
[2012-01-13 16:33:00 -0500] hcastro: what's the suggested approach to get around it?
[2012-01-13 16:34:00 -0500] mkent_: i've always removed it, you could probably accomplish what it does via a cron that runs less frequently - or one that could delay while chef is running
[2012-01-13 16:36:00 -0500] hcastro: mkent_: i'll look into disabling it during runs and enabling after or something -- thanks for helping to track it down
[2012-01-13 16:37:00 -0500] mkent_: np :)
[2012-01-13 16:55:00 -0500] miah: moin
[2012-01-13 17:13:00 -0500] statix: Is there an easy or standard way to capture the output from client package installs (to a file)? I'd like to see the exact apt-get output when stuff gets installed
[2012-01-13 17:14:00 -0500] statix: Also output from bash resources (compiling things)
[2012-01-13 17:15:00 -0500] kallistec: statix: you can see some of it when running w/ debug
[2012-01-13 17:16:00 -0500] kallistec: you should definitely see output from execute or script resources when running with info or higher and running chef in the foreground
[2012-01-13 17:20:00 -0500] statix: I seem to be at info level and am tail -f'ing the chef log, but it definitely doesn't give "native" output. I'm specifically installing with the community apache2 cookbook, and the info output only says "package[apache2] installed" -- it clearly installed other dependencies but there's no record of that. I will try debug
[2012-01-13 17:22:00 -0500] miah: statix: change you log level and restart chef-client
[2012-01-13 17:28:00 -0500] statix: Thanks
[2012-01-13 17:30:00 -0500] kallistec: statix: also some of the live output only shows up when running in the foreground since it's assumed you'll only want it if you're watching chef-client run
[2012-01-13 17:33:00 -0500] statix: Woah, now there's some mega-verbosity
[2012-01-13 17:33:00 -0500] statix: (thumbsup)
[2012-01-13 17:51:00 -0500] dajia: Hello, everyone.  Does anybody know if it's possible to execute a command in bash using chef and store the output in an attribute?
[2012-01-13 17:56:00 -0500] Dink: think depends on what you want to do. I am just starting to use chef but I think you can do it normally like x = `uname -a` or may be able to use ohai to do it.
[2012-01-13 17:59:00 -0500] jtimberman: dajia: its possible to do that in a recipe, but its better to write a custom ohai plugin for that.
[2012-01-13 18:04:00 -0500] thwop: i'm just starting to learn chef, and when i run `knife cookbook site install nginx` it runs into an error after switching to the branch of a dependency
[2012-01-13 18:05:00 -0500] thwop: the output looks like this: http://pastebin.com/yKG5NSFm
[2012-01-13 18:06:00 -0500] thwop: i can only assume that i'm doing something wrong, so what should i be doing when installing a cookbook to my chef-repo that has dependencies?
[2012-01-13 18:08:00 -0500] leifmadsen: afternoon all -- I'm writing a chef recipe, and in the default.rb file I'm trying to use a cookbook_file where the files are located in a subdir of files/default/ -- is this allowed/possible? I can't get the script to find the files.
[2012-01-13 18:10:00 -0500] dajia: leifmadsen:  If I understand you correctly, it shouldn't be that difficult
[2012-01-13 18:10:00 -0500] leifmadsen: ya that's what I thought.... but it seems to be failing on me, but I must be doing somethin stupid
[2012-01-13 18:11:00 -0500] cwj: thwop: try knife cookbook site install nginx -V
[2012-01-13 18:11:00 -0500] leifmadsen: my_files = [ "common/foo.txt", "common/bar.txt" ]
[2012-01-13 18:11:00 -0500] dajia: Did you do a chef-client -l debug yet?
[2012-01-13 18:11:00 -0500] jtimberman: leifmadsen: if you're putting the files in a subdir, you need to tell the resource what source to use
[2012-01-13 18:11:00 -0500] cwj: which should give you more verbose output
[2012-01-13 18:11:00 -0500] cwj: i am guessing it is failing to retireve the runit tarball for some reason
[2012-01-13 18:11:00 -0500] jtimberman: leifmadsen: source "subdir/myfile" would be cookbooks/your-cookbook/files/default/subdir/myfile
[2012-01-13 18:13:00 -0500] dajia: jtimberman:  I've had trouble with custom ohai plugins.  I followed the wiki, and was able to read the attribute via irb.  Also, when I ran ohai -f <file> I could see the output, when when I ran ohai with no arguments (or from within a chef run) I could not.
[2012-01-13 18:14:00 -0500] dajia: I did have the path set in client.rb as specified in the wiki
[2012-01-13 18:15:00 -0500] Dink: leifmadsen: just use source "filename"
[2012-01-13 18:15:00 -0500] leifmadsen: Dink: I don't understand how that would tell chef which subdir contains the files -- jtimberman's answer makes more sense
[2012-01-13 18:16:00 -0500] Dink: ohh sorry misread your question. Want  a subdir within files/default
[2012-01-13 18:16:00 -0500] leifmadsen: aye -- doing :  source "common" seems to be what I might have needed -- thanks all
[2012-01-13 18:20:00 -0500] thwop: cwj: that got me a bit further. it looks like it's getting the url and that part is working fine, but it's having issues in the process of writing the file http://pastebin.com/uGJsp37Q
[2012-01-13 18:20:00 -0500] leifmadsen: ok yep so that gets me once step further. The only other thing, is there a way I can use something like Dir["common/*"] or someway to say, "use all files in the 'foo' directory" ?
[2012-01-13 18:21:00 -0500] cwj: thwop: does /Users/Josh/Dropbox/Development/Repos/chef-repo/.chef/ exist? might it be a symlink?
[2012-01-13 18:23:00 -0500] thwop: it does exist in my master branch, but it does not exist in the chef-vendor-runit branch
[2012-01-13 18:24:00 -0500] cwj: ok, that sounds like a problem
[2012-01-13 18:24:00 -0500] thwop: cwj: should i also have a ~/.chef folder or should the chef-repo/.chef folder exist in all of the branches
[2012-01-13 18:24:00 -0500] cwj: i use ~/.chef myself
[2012-01-13 18:25:00 -0500] cwj: i believe knife looks for .chef in your repo before ~/.chef
[2012-01-13 18:25:00 -0500] cwj: sounds like you would need .chef under your repo root dir to exist in all branches in order for things to work correctly
[2012-01-13 18:25:00 -0500] cwj: or
[2012-01-13 18:26:00 -0500] cwj: remove .chef from your repo and add it to .gitignore, something like that
[2012-01-13 18:26:00 -0500] thwop: yeah i'll play around with it a bit
[2012-01-13 18:27:00 -0500] thwop: in your knife.rb in ~/.chef, do just have the cookbook_path with a full path to the repo?
[2012-01-13 18:27:00 -0500] thwop: so in my case something like /some/dirs/chef-repo/cookbooks
[2012-01-13 18:28:00 -0500] cwj: cookbook_path [ File.expand_path('~/chef-repo/cookbooks'), File.expand_path('~/chef-repo/site-cookbooks') ]
[2012-01-13 18:28:00 -0500] cwj: something like that
[2012-01-13 18:42:00 -0500] mconigliaro: jtimberman: you around?
[2012-01-13 18:43:00 -0500] jtimberman: thwop: generally if you only have one repository (e.g., only one server you're using), put your knife and certs and stuff in ~/.chef
[2012-01-13 18:43:00 -0500] jtimberman: thwop: if you have things you want to share with other people, like plugins, bootstrap templates, etc too, then use chef-repo/.chef for those
[2012-01-13 18:43:00 -0500] jtimberman: mconigliaro: somewhat, have a meeting shortly
[2012-01-13 18:43:00 -0500] mconigliaro: ok, cool. just have a quick question
[2012-01-13 18:44:00 -0500] mconigliaro: i was curious about whether it's actually preferred to install via packages when they're available
[2012-01-13 18:44:00 -0500] mconigliaro: is there a preference at all?
[2012-01-13 18:44:00 -0500] mconigliaro: i'm wondering if there's any benefit to using gems instead
[2012-01-13 18:44:00 -0500] mconigliaro: i've always gone with the ubuntu packages in the past
[2012-01-13 18:46:00 -0500] mconigliaro: the only thing that's missing in the gem version (i think) are the init scripts and config files, but that stuff is easy for me to create on my own
[2012-01-13 19:04:00 -0500] kallen: using shef (0.10.4), i'm looking at how to negate when using nodes.find. i've looked at help(:nodes) but don't see how to provide negation syntax. how do i do that?
[2012-01-13 19:04:00 -0500] kallen: e.g. how would i find notes that have name NOT "app*"?

[2012-01-13 19:07:00 -0500] kallen: the various syntaxes i'm trying are giving me syntax errors
[2012-01-13 19:07:00 -0500] kallen: gotta afk for company meeting.. i'll look back here when i can..

[2012-01-13 20:18:00 -0500] jtimberman: mconigliaro: sorry i had that meeting, then had to eat food or my mood would have been unfit for anything.
[2012-01-13 20:18:00 -0500] mconigliaro: ah, no problem
[2012-01-13 20:18:00 -0500] jtimberman: mconigliaro: generally, yes, use packages for software you need to install.
[2012-01-13 20:18:00 -0500] jtimberman: mconigliaro: particularly for binary packages that would take time to build from source.
[2012-01-13 20:19:00 -0500] mconigliaro: well, there seems to be some contention there when it comes to ruby stuff
[2012-01-13 20:19:00 -0500] mconigliaro: from what i've read
[2012-01-13 20:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: *we* don't in several of our recipes because a) we're not going to build packages for everything and host those repos, since thats not our game and b) not all the best and brightest versions are available in the distro packaging.
[2012-01-13 20:19:00 -0500] jtimberman: well, ruby is special :)
[2012-01-13 20:19:00 -0500] statix: So this just happened, not sure if it's a bug or not: http://pastebin.com/3ThhqrJy
[2012-01-13 20:19:00 -0500] mconigliaro: haha, so that's why i ask
[2012-01-13 20:20:00 -0500] mconigliaro: what really made me wonder is when i discovered the ruby-rvm package
[2012-01-13 20:20:00 -0500] jtimberman: mconigliaro: yeah, so, it depends.
[2012-01-13 20:21:00 -0500] jtimberman: mconigliaro: as far as chef is concerned, there's a variety of ways to go about installing ruby software and it depends on the context and why.
[2012-01-13 20:21:00 -0500] mconigliaro: and i know about the big argument between the ruby and debian folks about os packages for ruby stuff
[2012-01-13 20:21:00 -0500] jtimberman: while it would be awesome to have 'apt-get install chef' automatically work and use the distribution provided ruby and supporting packages, that isn't available on all distros.
[2012-01-13 20:21:00 -0500] mconigliaro: so i started to think maybe debian was moving towards a policy of just using gems
[2012-01-13 20:22:00 -0500] jtimberman: debian is moving to using 'gem2deb' for packaging ruby software.
[2012-01-13 20:22:00 -0500] statix: I was a bit dismayed to see that I needed 500MB+ of packages to install chef-server on Debian
[2012-01-13 20:22:00 -0500] jtimberman: statix: its good for you
[2012-01-13 20:22:00 -0500] jtimberman: what were you going to use that disk space for?
[2012-01-13 20:23:00 -0500] statix: That's a good point
[2012-01-13 20:23:00 -0500] mconigliaro: using disk space builds character, eh? ;-)
[2012-01-13 20:23:00 -0500] jtimberman: and, why do we have fast internet connections if not to download large bundles of software!
[2012-01-13 20:23:00 -0500] jtimberman: statix: part of that is all the java-related stuff just to use solr
[2012-01-13 20:23:00 -0500] jtimberman: because we're compliant with debian policy in the packaging, and it says use the packaged solr...
[2012-01-13 20:30:00 -0500] statix: These ones surprised me especially: mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev libaudio2 libqt4-sql-mysql
[2012-01-13 20:30:00 -0500] statix: Definitely don't need 3d graphics or audio on my server ;)
[2012-01-13 20:36:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: Hello everyone, I'm installing something from source, so nothing gets added to /etc/init.d and I can't use the service resource. So i put together a quick init.d script, but I'm wondering if chef provides any resources for adding it to init.d or if I need to execute the different commands for Ubuntu and Red Hat.
[2012-01-13 20:36:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: Thanks in advance
[2012-01-13 20:39:00 -0500] jtimberman: statix: yeah, the wonders of binary distributions pulling in dependencies (or recommends)
[2012-01-13 20:39:00 -0500] jtimberman: arthur_kalm: use a cookbook_file or template resource to drop off the file in /etc/init.d
[2012-01-13 20:40:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: Yes
[2012-01-13 20:43:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: jtimberman But after I do that, I guess I can use the service resource to start it? I guess enable will make it run at startup?
[2012-01-13 20:46:00 -0500] mkent_: arthur_kalm, that's correct
[2012-01-13 20:47:00 -0500] dyer: Anyone able to answer that question?
[2012-01-13 20:47:00 -0500] dyer: Question, if I have a node / client that does NOT exist on my server, and I run chef-client -j first-boot.json on that client, shouldnt it register the client and set the run list from that point forward as that initialy provided run list ?
[2012-01-13 20:48:00 -0500] mkent_: so long as the run finishes okay and the node saves i believe
[2012-01-13 20:51:00 -0500] jtimberman: arthur_kalm: yup
[2012-01-13 20:51:00 -0500] jtimberman: dyer: only if you copied over the validation key
[2012-01-13 20:51:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: Cool, thanks everyone
[2012-01-13 20:51:00 -0500] dyer: well the server is getting the right recipe initially
[2012-01-13 20:51:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: Really loving chef
[2012-01-13 20:52:00 -0500] dyer: but when I goto the ui the run list is empty
[2012-01-13 20:52:00 -0500] mkent_: dyer, does it finish the run okay, $? == 0 ?
[2012-01-13 20:53:00 -0500] dyer: yes
[2012-01-13 20:53:00 -0500] mkent_: strange
[2012-01-13 20:54:00 -0500] jdeamattson: Is there a library of bootstrap files anywhere?
[2012-01-13 20:55:00 -0500] jtimberman: jdeamattson: there's a directory in the chef gem / package that has a few :)
[2012-01-13 20:56:00 -0500] jtimberman: jdeamattson: i think there *might* be a page or note on the wiki, maybe the knife bootstrap page
[2012-01-13 20:56:00 -0500] mkent_: dyer, if you run with -l debug do you see 'DEBUG: Saving the current state of node' near the end of the output
[2012-01-13 20:56:00 -0500] jtimberman: jdeamattson: and we've talked about adding that kind of thing to the community site so they're easier to find.
[2012-01-13 20:56:00 -0500] jdeamattson: Have done some searching and haven't found anything that jumps out jtimberman
[2012-01-13 20:56:00 -0500] jdeamattson: jtimberman: I would vote for a bootstrap library page
[2012-01-13 20:57:00 -0500] jdeamattson: jtimberman: Would be a big help.
[2012-01-13 20:58:00 -0500] jdeamattson: jtimberman: Do you know if there is a bootstrap file for centos (Right Scale images) that deals with the fact that they are Ruby 1.8.5 :-)
[2012-01-13 20:58:00 -0500] mkent_: dyer, and obviously "INFO: Run List is []" in the output shows the right cookbooks/roles
[2012-01-13 20:59:00 -0500] dyer: mkent_, what do u mean?
[2012-01-13 21:01:00 -0500] jtimberman: jdeamattson: generally, the preference for a bootstrap template is to put the proper version of Ruby, RubyGems and Chef, whether that matches what is available from the distribution or not is another matter. For example, the `centos5-gems` bootstrap template will use bemu's aegisco yum repo to install ruby 1.8.7 instead of using the 1.8.5 in centos5.
[2012-01-13 21:01:00 -0500] mkent_: can you run: chef-client -j first-boot.json -l debug | egrep '(Run List is |Saving the current node)'
[2012-01-13 21:01:00 -0500] jdeamattson: Got you.
[2012-01-13 21:02:00 -0500] jdeamattson: jtimberman: That is what I would assume you would want.
[2012-01-13 21:02:00 -0500] jtimberman: jdeamattson: the ones that come with chef are intended to fit the general use case but can (and should?) be modified to fit your needs.
[2012-01-13 21:02:00 -0500] jdeamattson: jtimberman: Seeing how you do it in the centos5-gems.erb
[2012-01-13 21:03:00 -0500] patcon: quick Q folks: when require_recipe is present mid-recipe, does it insert the recipe resources in place, or just make sure it's run prior to the current recipe?
[2012-01-13 21:03:00 -0500] jtimberman: that said, our full stack installation packages will be the recommended way to go about this, using a new bootstrap template that will be default, slated for the next release (that tempalte is in opscode/chef master
[2012-01-13 21:03:00 -0500] jtimberman: patcon: in place
[2012-01-13 21:03:00 -0500] patcon: thanks jtimberman :)
[2012-01-13 21:03:00 -0500] jtimberman: patcon: so the resources in the included recipe will be added to the resource collection
[2012-01-13 21:04:00 -0500] jtimberman: patcon: incrementing their index accordingly, then it returns to the recipe where it included and continues on
[2012-01-13 21:05:00 -0500] brett_h: do I have to configure my "cookbook path" somewhere? I'm not sure why this cookbook isn't being found http://pastebin.com/eQEwLi1A
[2012-01-13 21:06:00 -0500] jdeamattson: jtimberman: Are you aware of a bootstrap template for Debian?
[2012-01-13 21:06:00 -0500] patcon: jtimberman: awesome. filed away. you think it'd be worthwhile for me to add the abbreviated version of that here: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Anatomy+of+a+Chef+Run
[2012-01-13 21:07:00 -0500] jtimberman: jdeamattson: the ubuntu10.04-gems and ubuntu10.04-apt should work

[2012-01-13 21:08:00 -0500] jtimberman: patcon: i think its mentioned in the recipes page

[2012-01-13 21:21:00 -0500] ssd7: brett_h: You can also see teh CONFIGURATION section of the man page, which you can accesses via the command: knife help knife
[2012-01-13 21:22:00 -0500] brett_h: ssd7: found what I needed: "cookbook_path", though I didn't find it in any docs
[2012-01-13 21:22:00 -0500] brett_h: just did a knife configure, apparently it defaults to blank and you have to hardcode your local repo path, weird
[2012-01-13 21:23:00 -0500] brett_h: figured it would check for cookbooks/ relative to runpath, too
[2012-01-13 21:25:00 -0500] jdeamattson: jtimberman: I just tried the centos5-gems bootstrap file with a Right Scale AMI ( ami-49e32320) and I hit a failure with the Ruby version when installing the chef client:

[2012-01-13 21:25:00 -0500] jtimberman: jdeamattson: looks like its not getting the right version of ruby installed
[2012-01-13 21:25:00 -0500] jdeamattson: Yes. Which was the problem I was having earlier in the day.
[2012-01-13 21:26:00 -0500] jdeamattson: Prior to using this bootstrap file jtimberman

[2012-01-13 21:27:00 -0500] jdeamattson: jtimberman: It is calling Yum, which on the RightScale images points at the standard repos which have Ruby 1.8.5 installed.
[2012-01-13 21:30:00 -0500] jtimberman: jdeamattson: the template should have a line that installs the aegisco repo. https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/knife/bootstrap/centos5-gems.erb#L7-8
[2012-01-13 21:31:00 -0500] jdeamattson: jtimberman: It does, but for some reason that seems be be ignored and the wrong version of Ruby is installed.
[2012-01-13 21:32:00 -0500] jdeamattson: Try running the following (with the appropriate roles and configuration substituted):
[2012-01-13 21:32:00 -0500] jdeamattson: knife ec2 server create -r 'role[numenta-worker]' -I ami-49e32320  -f m1.large -G default -d centos5-gems -i ~/.ssh/chef-knife.pem -S chef-knife --ssh-user root  --region us-east-1 -Z us-east-1d -VV

[2012-01-13 22:07:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: It works when I start it manually through sudo /etc/init.d/inspircd start, it starts fine
[2012-01-13 22:08:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: So the initd
[2012-01-13 22:09:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: Works fine...
[2012-01-13 22:10:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: ksheurs isn't just a data bag?
[2012-01-13 22:10:00 -0500] ksheurs: yea i just made a template for it
[2012-01-13 22:11:00 -0500] ksheurs: would a data bag be more appropriate?
[2012-01-13 22:11:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: jtimberman same thing I was asking before
[2012-01-13 22:11:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: ksheurs i think so yeah
[2012-01-13 22:11:00 -0500] ksheurs: cool thanks
[2012-01-13 22:12:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: I think it has all of that
[2012-01-13 22:12:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: Have you checked out the opscode apache cookbook
[2012-01-13 22:27:00 -0500] jamescase: arthur_kalm, make sure it starts when doing 'sudo service inspircd start' - the environment variables can be different when running it directly via a sudo
[2012-01-13 22:28:00 -0500] gmcinnes1: Have a great weekend chefs. Thanks for your helps!
[2012-01-13 22:28:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: jamescase yeah, that works too
[2012-01-13 22:29:00 -0500] jamescase: ah. just hoping it was something simple like PATH
[2012-01-13 22:30:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: The service call looks like this: https://gist.github.com/1609117
[2012-01-13 22:31:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: It's pretty standard
[2012-01-13 22:38:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: Probably needs more background, posted to the mailing list
[2012-01-13 22:38:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: jamescase thanks anyway
[2012-01-13 22:39:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: Anywho, have a great weekend everyone
[2012-01-13 22:39:00 -0500] jamescase: yeah, can't think what else would make it not work from inside chef while working outside.
[2012-01-13 22:39:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: jamescase very confusing
[2012-01-13 22:40:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: So, looks like doing a reboot works
[2012-01-13 22:41:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: I guess it needs a :start?
[2012-01-13 22:41:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: Hrm, that is there
[2012-01-13 22:41:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: Strange
[2012-01-13 22:41:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: Well, it looks like :enable worked
[2012-01-13 22:45:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: Anyway, gotta run
[2012-01-13 22:45:00 -0500] arthur_kalm: Take care everyone
