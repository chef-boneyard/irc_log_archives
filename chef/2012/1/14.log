[2012-01-14 08:08:00 -0500] mrtazz: anyone up for a quick test?
[2012-01-14 12:07:00 -0500] tolland: are they any plugins to extend the user authorization features? I would like to have users with environment only permissions
[2012-01-14 17:58:00 -0500] dwhsix: anybody from opscode in channel?  I'm getting some weird behavior from the hosted service wondering if there's a known issue
[2012-01-14 18:00:00 -0500] dwhsix: basically, my cookbook has a templates folder but that's not being brought down by chef-client
[2012-01-14 18:00:00 -0500] dwhsix: but it's there when I look at it thru chef UI
[2012-01-14 18:00:00 -0500] dwhsix: this just started happening
[2012-01-14 18:11:00 -0500] dwhsix: curiouser and curiouser knife cookbook download on that node brings down the right files but chef-client doesn't
[2012-01-14 18:11:00 -0500] dwhsix: wtf?
[2012-01-14 18:11:00 -0500] bawt: wtf is that about..
[2012-01-14 18:12:00 -0500] dwhsix: that's what I said ;-)
[2012-01-14 18:17:00 -0500] danryan: hey tolland, the hosted Chef option has much more granular authorization options
[2012-01-14 18:21:00 -0500] ssd7: dwhsix: Are your template files in cookbook_name/templates/ or cookbook_name/templates/default/?
[2012-01-14 18:22:00 -0500] dwhsix: default
[2012-01-14 18:22:00 -0500] dwhsix: but the whole templates subtree is not getting brought down
[2012-01-14 18:23:00 -0500] dwhsix: in /var/cache/chef/cookbooks there are all the other files+folders for the cookbook, just not templates
[2012-01-14 18:24:00 -0500] dwhsix: this was working fine last time I tried to do a deploy :-( - I did edit one of the templates, but that shouldn't have broken anything
[2012-01-14 18:25:00 -0500] ssd7: dwhsix: Hmm.  Mind sharing a debug log?
[2012-01-14 18:26:00 -0500] dwhsix: not at all
[2012-01-14 18:29:00 -0500] dwhsix: ssd7: https://gist.github.com/f7bd9e4652952110aa94
[2012-01-14 18:30:00 -0500] dwhsix: zmx_app cookbook is the one that template folder is not coming down for
[2012-01-14 18:33:00 -0500] ssd7: dwhsix: Taking a look.  I have a hunch but will let you know is a sec.
[2012-01-14 18:33:00 -0500] dwhsix: ssd7: much appreciated, I'm baffled
[2012-01-14 18:36:00 -0500] ssd7: dwhsix: IIRC, templates are only pulled down from the chef server right before they are actually needed.  That is, they aren't pulled down until a template resource is being processed.  It appears that your chef-client run is failing before zmx_app's template resources have a chance to be processed.
[2012-01-14 18:37:00 -0500] dwhsix: aha
[2012-01-14 18:37:00 -0500] dwhsix: okay, that would make sense I pulled down an apache config that was incorrect and so apache failed to start
[2012-01-14 18:38:00 -0500] dwhsix: which means it's now never getting to pulling down the right one
[2012-01-14 18:38:00 -0500] dwhsix: I probably have an error somewhere where apache is getting started/restarted too early, instead of it being a deferred restart
[2012-01-14 18:38:00 -0500] dwhsix: thanks, let me see if that's it
[2012-01-14 18:39:00 -0500] ssd7: dwhsix: No problem :)
[2012-01-14 18:41:00 -0500] dwhsix: ssd7: bingo
[2012-01-14 18:41:00 -0500] dwhsix: thx
[2012-01-14 18:47:00 -0500] ssd7: dwhsix: Sweet, glad to have helped.
[2012-01-14 19:20:00 -0500] kindkid: I have an after_restart block within my deploy_revision block the deploy_revision block sets environment variables, but they don't seem to be set when the bash script in my after_restart block runs. What might I be doing wrong?
[2012-01-14 19:39:00 -0500] ssd7: kindkid: Mind creating a gist or something similar with the relevant code.  It is likely that you are setting the environment variable in one child process and then trying to use it in another, which won't work.
[2012-01-14 19:46:00 -0500] kindkid: ssd7: https://gist.github.com/1612657  although I think I just fixed it by explicitly setting environment for the bash block too.
[2012-01-14 19:48:00 -0500] ssd7: kindkid: Yeah, explicitly setting the environment for the bash block should fix it I think.
[2012-01-14 19:49:00 -0500] kindkid: it works if I re-run chef-client -j /etc/chef/first-boot.json, but it was failing when I first started it up from knife.
[2012-01-14 19:49:00 -0500] kindkid: cool, on to the next problem :)
[2012-01-14 19:50:00 -0500] kindkid: thanks
[2012-01-14 20:46:00 -0500] labria: hey guys
[2012-01-14 20:46:00 -0500] labria: did anyone have weird JSON corruptions with chef 0.10.4?
[2012-01-14 21:43:00 -0500] tolland: I just noticed some chef-client runs failing, and its because one of the jobs deploys from a svn repository http://repo.local/projects/proj1/trunk/somedir but the user only has path permissions to trunk and below,
[2012-01-14 21:44:00 -0500] tolland: the subversion resource tries to query the root at projects, gets a 403 and fails the whole chef run
[2012-01-14 21:45:00 -0500] tolland: so q1 is there a way to make chef client less sensitive to cookbook failures, ie nothing else depends on my this custom cookbook, so it would be nice to ignore it if failed...
[2012-01-14 21:53:00 -0500] macros: tolland: You can't on a cookbook level but can on a resource ;eve;
[2012-01-14 21:54:00 -0500] macros: The ignore_fail and epic_fail directives on resources
[2012-01-14 21:57:00 -0500] tolland: macros: ooh, i hadnt seen those attributes, cheers
[2012-01-14 21:58:00 -0500] macros: epic_fail isn't documented afaik, can't remember what the difference is
[2012-01-14 22:12:00 -0500] Aengus: is there a method to refresh attributes during a node converge?
[2012-01-14 22:13:00 -0500] Aengus: for example, if you mount a disk I want to ensure the disk is available so I check node.filesystem.foo, but it isn't yet available. A second run will identify the disk is there.
[2012-01-14 22:16:00 -0500] macros: Aengus: There are essentially two phases to every chef run, compiling the resource list and then executing it
[2012-01-14 22:16:00 -0500] Aengus: yeah, I understand the order. I was curious if there was method to "refresh" midway through a run.
[2012-01-14 22:19:00 -0500] macros: Not really
[2012-01-14 22:19:00 -0500] macros: You can force things to run during compile which is a frequent pattern
[2012-01-14 22:20:00 -0500] macros: You can write to the node object as well
[2012-01-14 22:20:00 -0500] Aengus: ideally I could just refresh/reload the attributes to see the newly available disk.
[2012-01-14 22:21:00 -0500] Aengus: is there another approach that I should consider?
[2012-01-14 22:22:00 -0500] macros: You can use only_if/not_if blocks in the resources that depend on that disk being in place, those are executed at run time
[2012-01-14 22:22:00 -0500] macros: You can call ohai again during compile as well
[2012-01-14 22:23:00 -0500] Aengus: Right, it doesn't work like that. I am creating a disk, mounting it, and depending if that disk available I do certain actions.
[2012-01-14 22:24:00 -0500] macros: You can have the resources that do the action do 'action :nothing' and called explicitly from the resources that do the mounting
[2012-01-14 22:24:00 -0500] macros: Fairly common pattern to register a conditional resource
[2012-01-14 22:25:00 -0500] macros: That only get processed during a run if other conditions have occured
[2012-01-14 22:26:00 -0500] Aengus: macros: fair point, I have done so in the past. perhaps it hadn't consider it as I have the "disk" aspect in a separate recipe.
[2012-01-14 23:08:00 -0500] ssd7: Aengus: There is an ohai resource with a reload action that will reload all of the automatic attributes
[2012-01-14 23:10:00 -0500] Aengus: ssd7: that looks like what I am looking for exactly.
[2012-01-14 23:10:00 -0500] ssd7: :) Thanks!
