[2012-01-07 23:26:00 -0500] mrtazz: Trying to figure out what's the chef way to update (config) files from multiple cookbooks
[2012-01-07 23:27:00 -0500] mrtazz: so far I always did something like echo "foo" >> bar.conf not_if "grep foo"
[2012-01-07 23:27:00 -0500] mrtazz: which kind of leaves a bad feeling with me
[2012-01-07 23:28:00 -0500] yfeldblum: the chef way is that each config file should only be written to once in the whole run
[2012-01-07 23:33:00 -0500] mrtazz: and how would you manage things like .profile files or rc.conf when installing a new daemon?
