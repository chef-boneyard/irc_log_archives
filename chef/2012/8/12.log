[2012-08-12 01:44:58 -0400] gmcinnes: So, lets say I have a role .rb file and its run_list has a recipe that depends on a certain user, and I'm using fnichol's chef-user cookbook to manage users, and I'm defining the user to be added for that role in a 'users' array in the default_attributes for that role
[2012-08-12 01:45:16 -0400] gmcinnes: does that all get resolved so that the user gets created at the correct time etc?
