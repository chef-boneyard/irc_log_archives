[2012-08-19 05:18:01 -0400] Gurpartap: esp on EC2 instances
[2012-08-19 05:18:20 -0400] Gurpartap: Is it something we should find normal loading all that Ruby code?

[2012-08-19 11:12:05 -0400] kesor: how do I return just the cloud/public_ipv4 attribute in a knife search? "knife search node '*:*'" works, but when I add " -a public_ipv4 " its empty.
[2012-08-19 11:19:49 -0400] kesor: so how do I refer to nested attributes with knife "-a" parameter for knife node show, knife search node, knife ssh, etc  ?
[2012-08-19 12:00:13 -0400] ranjibd__: kesor, -a cloud.public_ipv4
[2012-08-19 12:01:42 -0400] ranjibd__: attribute_nesting is parent.child for accessing in recipe, parent_child for searching in solr, parent/child in ohai command line
[2012-08-19 12:01:56 -0400] ranjibd__: attribute_nesting?
[2012-08-19 12:02:26 -0400] ranjibd__: damn.. bawt is gone ?
[2012-08-19 12:03:15 -0400] kesor: thanks ranjibd__
[2012-08-19 12:24:50 -0400] jtimberman: ranjibd__: yeah, moving him to another home
[2012-08-19 12:26:05 -0400] trentster1: Hi all, I am battling to get omnibus to work on smartos, during the "build-fat-binary" step it gets to a certain point then gives an error "STDOUT: cd . && /bin/sh /root/omnibus/build/autoconf-2.63/build-aux/missing --run aclocal-1.10 -I m4"
[2012-08-19 12:26:17 -0400] trentster1: any idea?
[2012-08-19 12:45:23 -0400] ranjibd__: jtimberman, hey you whats up with nanite ? and the chef-agent ?
[2012-08-19 12:46:22 -0400] ranjibd__: jtimberman, looks like it wont be developed any further ?
[2012-08-19 15:03:33 -0400] railsraider: hi, my bundle install get skipped, and i have no idea why http://pastie.org/4550489
[2012-08-19 15:08:20 -0400] railsraider: bundle folder is there, debug log does not say anything simply ran succefuly but you can see that it never installed any gems
[2012-08-19 15:12:58 -0400] railsraider: found  the problem, my attribute doesn't pass through
[2012-08-19 15:23:31 -0400] ssd7: Ohai chefs!
[2012-08-19 15:51:42 -0400] lflux: ohai!
[2012-08-19 17:12:22 -0400] miah: moin
[2012-08-19 17:35:29 -0400] raz: is wiki.opscode.com broken for anyone else in chrome?
[2012-08-19 17:38:18 -0400] ssd7: raz: broken how?
[2012-08-19 17:38:19 -0400] raz: ah.. funny, after clearing the cookies it works
[2012-08-19 17:38:30 -0400] raz: ssd7: same issue as reported here http://likens.us/logs/2012/%23chef.07-25.12.log
[2012-08-19 17:38:33 -0400] raz: and same solution
[2012-08-19 17:38:34 -0400] ssd7: raz: Yeah, ongoing issue I've been tracking
[2012-08-19 17:38:46 -0400] raz: that's a strange thing to be triggered by a cookie
[2012-08-19 18:10:50 -0400] Yulya: hello guys
[2012-08-19 18:11:17 -0400] Yulya: is there any way to handle resource execution error with ruby begin\rescue block?
[2012-08-19 18:11:24 -0400] Yulya: like this http://paste2.org/p/2132013
[2012-08-19 19:08:06 -0400] miah: ive never seen anybody do that in a chef recipe
[2012-08-19 19:25:11 -0400] yfeldblum: convergence-time exceptions are handled by the failure handlers
[2012-08-19 19:38:29 -0400] miah: yfeldblum: how goes?
[2012-08-19 19:41:34 -0400] yfeldblum: miah, rubying it up
[2012-08-19 19:43:01 -0400] miah: hot
[2012-08-19 20:02:56 -0400] yfeldblum: miah, finding dumb issues in ruby database drivers
[2012-08-19 20:10:50 -0400] hoover_damm: oh that's normal
[2012-08-19 20:10:57 -0400] hoover_damm: database drivers are dumb by default
[2012-08-19 20:27:44 -0400] lflux: they should be tbh
[2012-08-19 20:28:06 -0400] hoover_damm: right
[2012-08-19 20:28:08 -0400] hoover_damm: they are drivers
[2012-08-19 20:28:21 -0400] hoover_damm: dumb is better in this regard :)
[2012-08-19 20:28:42 -0400] hoover_damm: opinionated drivers would drive me nuts
[2012-08-19 22:01:39 -0400] lflux: I swore I saw this earlier, but is there a variable with recipe names available to templates?
[2012-08-19 22:54:45 -0400] ssd7: lflux: node.recipes
[2012-08-19 23:12:24 -0400] erk: for postgresql cookbook node['postgresql']['password']['postgres'] =>   it said ti will generate one using openssl library. can i supply this value? can i put the hashed value in data bag? i want the most secure way possible so that my python app does not need to hard code password thanks
[2012-08-19 23:38:21 -0400] yfeldblum: erk, you can generate it, but you can't stick the hashed value in a data-bag item (because there's no way to recover the original, which is what you need, from the hashed value)
[2012-08-19 23:39:47 -0400] erk: yfeldblum: thanks friend. i heard in an old python talk, opscode said using chef we dont need to hardcode password in app anymore. how would my app know the password for this random generated thing?
[2012-08-19 23:41:23 -0400] yfeldblum: erk, when your chef recipe deploys the app (this is of course assuming you have chosen the strategy to have a chef recipe for deploying the app), the recipe can also generate settings files rather than relying on the settings files that are checked into version control in the app
[2012-08-19 23:42:07 -0400] erk: yfeldblum: but that password will be rendered into the settings file, for example, settings.py for django app.
[2012-08-19 23:42:42 -0400] yfeldblum: erk, yes, of course
[2012-08-19 23:43:09 -0400] yfeldblum: erk, the point is: the password doesn't need to be hardcoded into the app as the app exists in version control
[2012-08-19 23:43:51 -0400] yfeldblum: erk, because instead of keeping the password in the app in version control, you have an alternative strategy using chef for generating a settings file and, when deploying the app onto a server, deleting the original settings file and copying in the generated settings file
[2012-08-19 23:44:42 -0400] erk: yfeldblum: i see simply put, let chef generate it and dont add the config file to my app's version control...
[2012-08-19 23:45:38 -0400] erk: yfeldblum: thats cool. i get that part now. thanks a lot!
[2012-08-19 23:45:45 -0400] yfeldblum: erk, right
[2012-08-19 23:46:19 -0400] yfeldblum: erk, now of course there are many ways to do the chef part, and it's up to you how you would like to do it
[2012-08-19 23:47:07 -0400] erk: yfeldblum: well as for newbie like me probably have to drop these files for now... chef is really rich but definitely takes time to learn all the magics
[2012-08-19 23:47:10 -0400] erk: yfeldblum: haha
[2012-08-19 23:55:28 -0400] Jay_Levitt: The postgresql recipe has a default attribute which is in fact an array.  I want to modify one element of that array.  How do I do it?  override the whole attribute, changing the one array value on the fly?
