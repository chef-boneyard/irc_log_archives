[2012-08-24 00:07:05 -0400] d_ani: Hey we are having trouble installing chef server via chef solo

[2012-08-24 00:55:08 -0400] Guest___: Hey all - I've got an issue that I suspect comes down to not grocking the terminology, or thinking about doing things in a very un-chefy way. I've tried searching around, but not knowing quite what to search for, it's.. slow.
[2012-08-24 00:55:36 -0400] _molson: Simplifying my situation, I want to configure 2 servers at the same time - a database server which has to add a processing server to it's authorized-access configs, and then the processing server which has to add the DB server to it's config, and only be enabled once that config is set.
[2012-08-24 00:55:56 -0400] _molson: What concepts should I be looking for in the docs and guides?
[2012-08-24 01:07:08 -0400] williamherry: how to and environment to a node when bootstrap?
[2012-08-24 01:35:03 -0400] c_t: urk
[2012-08-24 01:35:10 -0400] c_t: mysterious 400 Bad Request is mysterious
[2012-08-24 01:38:01 -0400] c_t: well
[2012-08-24 01:38:10 -0400] c_t: updating chef-client fixed that
[2012-08-24 01:46:49 -0400] juliancdunn: williamherry: with the "-E" flag?
[2012-08-24 01:48:16 -0400] juliancdunn: _molson: that's a hard problem... nodes run independently of one another in chef. is there a way the processing server could poll the DB server for "readiness" before baking out its config?
[2012-08-24 01:51:58 -0400] _molson: Well, how about.. is there a way to poll using Search to see if the database has been set yet before continuing on with some configuration?
[2012-08-24 02:31:50 -0400] juliancdunn: _molson: yeah I guess that's a possibility
[2012-08-24 02:40:01 -0400] hoover_damm: _molson, coordination?
[2012-08-24 02:46:34 -0400] _molson: hoover_damn: using that, I found Ironfan, which looks promising at first blush
[2012-08-24 02:47:50 -0400] hoover_damm: _molson, http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/03/ad-hoc-configuration-coordination-and.html
[2012-08-24 02:48:00 -0400] hoover_damm: _molson, noah's pretty :) nice
[2012-08-24 02:49:32 -0400] _molson: thanks!
[2012-08-24 02:52:01 -0400] _molson: I've have to look at Noah some more and see how it'd fit in with our systems
[2012-08-24 02:52:31 -0400] hoover_damm: _molson, view noah just like ZK
[2012-08-24 02:52:44 -0400] hoover_damm: _molson, it'll fit in if you let it
[2012-08-24 02:53:45 -0400] hoover_damm: https://github.com/lusis/Noah/wiki/Example-Use-Cases
[2012-08-24 05:33:29 -0400] bagheera: my recipe runs fine but I'd like to understand why this message shows up in the debug log: DEBUG: Platform ubuntu not found, using all defaults. (Unsupported platform?). how can I make ubuntu be found?
[2012-08-24 05:36:46 -0400] cheeseplus: bagheera: is there anything in your metadata.rb for supported platforms?
[2012-08-24 05:40:31 -0400] cheeseplus: bagheera: or it could be this - http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3099
[2012-08-24 05:40:57 -0400] bagheera: cheeseplus: thanks. metadata it is.
[2012-08-24 05:49:40 -0400] bagheera: hmm, it doesn't go away with a supports 'ubuntu' in metadata.rb
[2012-08-24 05:57:00 -0400] flaccid_: bagheera: thats actually a misleading msg. search the bug tracker there is a bug on int
[2012-08-24 05:57:00 -0400] flaccid_: maybe its the one cheeseplus quoted
[2012-08-24 06:04:46 -0400] bagheera: flaccid_: yes that bug does mention it but I thought I was more about saying it once than many times. didn't realize the message itself is misleading. thanks
[2012-08-24 06:06:18 -0400] flaccid_: yeah i saw it heaps on archlinux and was like wtf
[2012-08-24 06:40:32 -0400] bagheera: I am spiking vagrant + chef-solo. my cookbook metadata.rb says version 1.1.2. my role has a run_list with recipe[first@2.0.0]. I was expecting vagrant provision to fail but it goes ahead just fine. Am I missing something?
[2012-08-24 07:29:29 -0400] bagheera: are Cookbook Versions in Run List Items supported by chef-solo?
[2012-08-24 07:37:19 -0400] Philipp_: I would like to have a mysql cookbook with two modes... single server and galera cluster... how can I store specific settings in 2 seperate attribute files?
[2012-08-24 08:50:18 -0400] a_a_g: is it possible to create a lightweight resource that inherits from another resource?
[2012-08-24 09:11:35 -0400] gyre007: what is the path to the ruby interpreter installed by Chef's omnibus install ??
[2012-08-24 09:56:44 -0400] Guest11759: hi I am trying to install chef server using chef solo on Oracle Enterprise Linux 5 however I get an error running the initial boot strap command sudo chef-solo -c /etc/chef/solo.rb -j ~/chef.json -r http://s3.amazonaws.com/chef-solo/bootstrap-latest.tar.gz
[2012-08-24 09:56:58 -0400] Guest11759:  FATAL: Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - /usr/lib64/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/chef-10.12.0/distro//etc/init.d/chef-solr
[2012-08-24 09:57:47 -0400] Guest11759: it looks like it's trying to find the distro type, in the distro folder, but I am not sure what command it's using to detect?
[2012-08-24 09:59:13 -0400] Guest11759: does anyone have any pointers or hints to help me out?
[2012-08-24 10:06:29 -0400] William_: does chef support to know all package that one node installed?
[2012-08-24 10:35:34 -0400] gyre007: omnibus install messed up recipes where you try to include gems via require
[2012-08-24 10:36:10 -0400] gyre007: unless those gems are installed for the same version of ruby or maybe there is some path mangling you need to do...im not sure but it sure is messy
[2012-08-24 10:39:15 -0400] Guest11759: @gyre007 - was that directed to me?
[2012-08-24 10:39:22 -0400] gyre007: no :)
[2012-08-24 10:39:31 -0400] gyre007: general observation...
[2012-08-24 10:39:46 -0400] gyre007: its a bit annoying
[2012-08-24 11:08:43 -0400] gyre007: mm and Chef installed via omnibus doesnt play well with RVM either :)
[2012-08-24 11:08:45 -0400] gyre007: interesting
[2012-08-24 11:12:04 -0400] gyre007: oh boy
[2012-08-24 11:20:06 -0400] _JamieD_: odd, I just got an error when running chef-client, it can't access mysql using the root password defined in node['mysql']['server_root_password']. this has worked on all the other runs
[2012-08-24 11:44:51 -0400] gyre007: what does this do ? search(:node, something)
[2012-08-24 11:45:03 -0400] gyre007: is it looking for a node named something
[2012-08-24 11:45:03 -0400] gyre007: ?
[2012-08-24 11:46:27 -0400] royh: gyre007: you say that you want to search in the node index. what you're searching for is defined by something. (iirc)
[2012-08-24 11:47:26 -0400] royh: eg: search(:node, "roles:webserver AND NOT roles:dbserver")
[2012-08-24 11:47:49 -0400] gyre007: i see
[2012-08-24 11:47:51 -0400] royh: that'll give you everything that has the webserver role in its run_list, but NOT the dbserver role
[2012-08-24 11:47:56 -0400] gyre007: cheers royh
[2012-08-24 11:48:02 -0400] royh: no problem :)
[2012-08-24 11:49:01 -0400] royh: btw, be very careful with those kind of searches
[2012-08-24 11:49:18 -0400] royh: it uses a lot of memory... the objects are humongous!
[2012-08-24 11:49:32 -0400] gyre007: if the search doesnt find anything it returns nil I take it ?
[2012-08-24 11:49:45 -0400] royh: after you've done a search use result.each and create a new list with the data you're really interested in
[2012-08-24 11:51:13 -0400] royh: gyre007: i don't know the return type if nothing is found. but i would assume it's an empty object, as opposed to just nil.
[2012-08-24 11:51:27 -0400] royh: gyre007: you could try it :)
[2012-08-24 12:03:35 -0400] vaq: Is it possible to copy a directory from a cookbook to the client, like with the cookbook_file distrubution
[2012-08-24 12:07:59 -0400] _JamieD_: when there is this code: define :nginx_site, :enable => true do, how to I call it and pass :enable => false? I tried nginx_site 'default', :enable => false and nginx_site :name = 'default', :enable => false but neither are working
[2012-08-24 12:08:33 -0400] _JamieD_: inside the definition it uses  params[:name] and params[:enable]
[2012-08-24 12:11:46 -0400] _JamieD_: ah, ok it takes a block as an argument
[2012-08-24 12:12:37 -0400] gyre007: royh, it looks like NIl is being returned
[2012-08-24 12:14:05 -0400] royh: gyre007: that's interesting. i thought something like the results at http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Search would pop up
[2012-08-24 12:15:02 -0400] royh: gyre007: I'm not saying you're doing it wrong, just that my expectations are probably wrong :)
[2012-08-24 12:22:17 -0400] Leitz: where can I find install docs for chef-solo? The opscode page that says it includes chef-solo only talks about chef-client.
[2012-08-24 12:23:02 -0400] flaccid__: Leitz: it comes with chef
[2012-08-24 12:27:28 -0400] Leitz: flaccid__, found it, thanks! Still trying to learn chef and some of the docs don't make it easy.
[2012-08-24 12:27:37 -0400] flaccid__: kk np
