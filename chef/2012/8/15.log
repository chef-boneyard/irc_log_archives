[2012-08-15 19:04:28 -0400] shillinm: did my last question just come through, re: nscd.conf file?
[2012-08-15 19:04:50 -0400] miah: no
[2012-08-15 19:05:23 -0400] shillinm: has anyone ever have an issue where chef will create a file from a template, but the service wont start (in my case, nscd) saying it cant read the config file.  I can cat the created file to a new file with NO changes, and rename it nscd.conf and it works fine
[2012-08-15 19:05:39 -0400] shillinm: permissions/ownership are the same
[2012-08-15 19:07:23 -0400] shillinm: crap I didnt notice the time.  if anyone has any suggestion - email shillinm@oclc.org I would appreciate it
[2012-08-15 19:10:53 -0400] birarda: I have a node that doesn't have an IP address when I tell  knife to show me the node info
[2012-08-15 19:11:00 -0400] birarda: how would I fix that?
[2012-08-15 19:14:27 -0400] cheeseplus: shillinm: I've used the nscd cookbook and not seen a issue, that seems more a system side thing than chef
[2012-08-15 19:14:50 -0400] cheeseplus: has to be something different/odd about the file
[2012-08-15 19:23:00 -0400] aspiers: where should ohai bugs be reported?
[2012-08-15 19:25:16 -0400] miah: tickets.opscode.com
[2012-08-15 19:34:39 -0400] gmcinnes2: Anyone familiar with fnichol's user cookbook: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/user ?
[2012-08-15 19:35:36 -0400] gmcinnes2: It says "The data bag recipe will iterate through a list of usernames defined in node['users'] (by default) and attempt to pull in the user's information from the data bag item"
[2012-08-15 19:36:29 -0400] gmcinnes2: I would have thought I could set up a node['users'] attribute by adding "users" => ['foo'] to the default_attributes hash in a role.  Is that not correct?
[2012-08-15 19:37:35 -0400] yfeldblum: gmcinnes2, that is correct
[2012-08-15 19:38:08 -0400] gmcinnes2: hmm. weird. perhaps its a vagrant issue.  It doesn't seem to be picking that up for some reason.
[2012-08-15 19:38:56 -0400] cheeseplus: gmcinnes2: half my issues are weird vagrant things
[2012-08-15 19:40:39 -0400] gmcinnes2: curse that infernal device!
[2012-08-15 19:40:44 -0400] gmcinnes2: still. better than the alternative.
[2012-08-15 19:45:29 -0400] CharlieSu: Is there any easy way to update a system that has a version of chef installed via Omnibus ?   I'd like to get to a newer version of chef..
[2012-08-15 19:52:31 -0400] unixguy: is the chef_json value necessary in the role's json file for the node to be associated with a role in it's properties?
[2012-08-15 19:53:08 -0400] unixguy: can't seem to figure out why my nodes have a blank entry for Role: in knife output, after runing chef-client -j role.json on them
[2012-08-15 19:54:32 -0400] srleod: yfeldblum, turning off shallow_clone fixes it, FWIW
[2012-08-15 19:54:43 -0400] cheeseplus: unixguy: I think the answer is that you are applying the role just for that run
[2012-08-15 19:54:55 -0400] cheeseplus: knife queries the server
[2012-08-15 19:58:18 -0400] Urocyon: unixguy: I believe it's a gem install, so updating the chef-server gem would do the trick.  But you would need to do it using the embedded ruby.
[2012-08-15 19:58:43 -0400] Urocyon: oops, I mean CharlieSu
[2012-08-15 19:59:05 -0400] CharlieSu: Urocyon: ok thanks.
[2012-08-15 19:59:22 -0400] Urocyon: CharlieSu: your gem executable for that is probably located here: /opt/opscode/embedded/bin/gem
[2012-08-15 20:00:53 -0400] Urocyon: I mean /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem
[2012-08-15 20:01:27 -0400] CharlieSu: Urocyon: got it..  thanks.  I'm trying this now
[2012-08-15 20:09:08 -0400] tehnef: anyone using chef for their windows env?
[2012-08-15 20:12:53 -0400] CharlieSu: Urocyon: worked perfectly..  thanks!
[2012-08-15 20:16:05 -0400] sascha_: ohai, I'm trying to remember how to use a node attribute as a variable when getting a second node attribute
[2012-08-15 20:16:05 -0400] sascha_: like this
[2012-08-15 20:16:21 -0400] sascha_: user = node['current_user']; group = node['passwd'][user]['gid']
[2012-08-15 20:16:22 -0400] sascha_: help?
[2012-08-15 20:17:08 -0400] dopacki: hi - wondering if anyone has a tip on how to fix-up the chef bootstrap code so that install.sh is fetched from a local server on my network
[2012-08-15 20:17:27 -0400] dopacki: or of the install server url is exposed somewhere as a config option
[2012-08-15 20:22:29 -0400] mattray: dopacki: make a modified chef-full.erb template https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/chef/lib/chef/knife/bootstrap/chef-full.erb
[2012-08-15 20:23:24 -0400] sascha_: oo, nvm it was user error
[2012-08-15 20:23:54 -0400] mattray: dopacki: and use -d when you bootstrap to use your custom installer
[2012-08-15 20:24:18 -0400] dopacki: o'rly?
[2012-08-15 20:25:08 -0400] dopacki: does the installer template just need to be in my path?
[2012-08-15 20:25:27 -0400] mattray: dopacki: you can keep custom bootstraps in your .chef/bootstrap/
[2012-08-15 20:25:36 -0400] mattray: dopacki: and use -d mycustom
[2012-08-15 20:25:41 -0400] mattray: or whatever you call it
[2012-08-15 20:26:22 -0400] dopacki: let's say its foo.erb - would I use "-d foo.erb" or just "-d foo"?
[2012-08-15 20:26:34 -0400] mattray: just foo
[2012-08-15 20:28:05 -0400] dopacki: cool. thx!
[2012-08-15 20:28:15 -0400] mattray: dopacki: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Custom+Knife+Bootstrap+Script
[2012-08-15 20:28:32 -0400] mattray: you can do pretty much whatever you want
[2012-08-15 20:40:17 -0400] dopacki: worked like a champ.

[2012-08-15 21:00:09 -0400] miah: CharlieSu: there is a omnibus-updater cookbook
[2012-08-15 21:00:27 -0400] miah: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/omnibus_updater
[2012-08-15 21:01:12 -0400] CharlieSu: miah: whoa!  Great idea.. I'll review it
[2012-08-15 21:23:13 -0400] Urocyon: The ruby cookbook looks a little data, only supporting up to 1.9.1
[2012-08-15 21:23:21 -0400] Urocyon: dated
[2012-08-15 21:24:10 -0400] Urocyon: I was hoping to install 1.9.3
[2012-08-15 21:26:16 -0400] jtimberman: Urocyon: in that it installs ruby1.9.1 package?
[2012-08-15 21:26:18 -0400] miah: use chef-rvm or chef-rbenv
[2012-08-15 21:26:32 -0400] jtimberman: that actually might install ruby 1.9.3 depending on what version is used by the distribution for the package.
[2012-08-15 21:28:38 -0400] Urocyon: I see.   So maybe we do want chef-rvm or chef-rbenv if we want to get ahead of the packaging.  (Which I surely do.. stuck on rhel 6 right now.
[2012-08-15 21:29:37 -0400] Urocyon: I was wanting to install a ruby for site wide use rather than having each user set up their own ruby.  Miah, which do you think would be better for that?
[2012-08-15 21:31:04 -0400] slam-: for a fresh install, omnibus is preferred over distribution packages, right ?
[2012-08-15 21:34:20 -0400] Urocyon: slam- that's my preference.   I'm using chef-full everywhere.
[2012-08-15 21:34:49 -0400] miah: Urocyon: you can still do that with rvm or rbenv
[2012-08-15 21:35:00 -0400] miah: though i prefer to leave 'system' ruby as it is
[2012-08-15 21:35:28 -0400] c_t: although for some reason using omnibus was giving me a devil of a time with ruby-shadow
[2012-08-15 21:35:39 -0400] crftr: Urocyon: I'm experimenting with rbenv right now for 1.9.3.  My first observation is that it can be a 10+ minute long operation
[2012-08-15 21:36:07 -0400] crftr: to perform: rbenv_ruby "1.9.3-p194"
[2012-08-15 21:36:10 -0400] Urocyon: c_t I ran into that soon.  Trick was to install it into the chef-full embedded ruby.
[2012-08-15 21:36:19 -0400] Urocyon: s/soon/also
[2012-08-15 21:37:42 -0400] slam-: i think i hit a problem after upgrading all my nodes to chef-client 10.12 while the server still is in 10.4
[2012-08-15 21:38:12 -0400] slam-: maybe its time to switch to a fresh omnibus install
[2012-08-15 22:00:07 -0400] jazzh: my chef server suddenly died and couchdb returns INFO: HTTP Request Returned 500 Internal Server Error: os_process_error
[2012-08-15 22:00:16 -0400] jazzh: ERROR: Server returned error for http://localhost:5984/chef/_design/id_map/_view/name_to_id?include_docs=true&key=[%22client%22,%22chef-validator%22], retrying 1/5 in 3s
[2012-08-15 22:00:29 -0400] jazzh: any ideas?
[2012-08-15 22:04:00 -0400] jtimberman: Urocyon crftr: I'd build a local package of ruby and host it on an internal mirror, rather than build it on ever system.
[2012-08-15 22:04:10 -0400] jtimberman: if you need ruby for things outside chef.
[2012-08-15 22:04:35 -0400] jtimberman: !botsnack
[2012-08-15 22:04:35 -0400] bawt: jtimberman: =D
[2012-08-15 22:04:37 -0400] Urocyon: good idea.
[2012-08-15 22:04:38 -0400] jtimberman: welcome back, bawt.
[2012-08-15 22:04:50 -0400] jtimberman: and i'd probably use jordan sissel's fpm to do it
[2012-08-15 22:05:14 -0400] crftr: jtimberman: after today's experiments, I think that's going to be my next attempt
[2012-08-15 22:05:28 -0400] Urocyon: fpm rocks!
[2012-08-15 22:05:57 -0400] crftr: hmm, this is the first time I've seen fpm
[2012-08-15 22:06:00 -0400] crftr: interesting
[2012-08-15 22:06:55 -0400] Urocyon: jtimberman: some documentation I'd like to see is something on setting up better testing with chef, like how to get a build server set up to push changes into your chef server instead of putting them in directly.
[2012-08-15 22:07:12 -0400] Urocyon: Then how to use that build server to do some basic integration testing. that sort of thing.
[2012-08-15 22:07:35 -0400] Urocyon: I want to do these things, but not having a lot of familiarity with the tools am not sure how.
[2012-08-15 22:07:36 -0400] jtimberman: working on that right now :)
[2012-08-15 22:07:50 -0400] Urocyon: I definitely want to get away from setup up servers by hand to test them.
[2012-08-15 22:09:28 -0400] Urocyon: I watched Jim Hopp's presentation from chef conf and was inspired, but starts from the assumption you already have a build server handling your changes.
[2012-08-15 22:11:13 -0400] Urocyon: Guess I need to learn me some Jenkins.
[2012-08-15 22:29:25 -0400] gilbert1: hi everyone
[2012-08-15 22:29:38 -0400] gilbert1: some quesitons regarding chef & git:
[2012-08-15 22:30:07 -0400] gilbert1: do you generally perform updates with knife, and then commit to git as a side process
[2012-08-15 22:30:21 -0400] gilbert1: or do you commit to git and let a post-commit hook update chef?
[2012-08-15 22:30:51 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, never do the first one
[2012-08-15 22:30:55 -0400] alop: personally, I like to edit files, commit in git, then do like "knife data bag from file..."
[2012-08-15 22:31:21 -0400] gilbert1: k. thought I was reading the doc wrong, but that's what I got from it
[2012-08-15 22:32:12 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, if you want do coordinate the two, always stick `knife cookbook upload` (or the other tasks) into a post-commit or post-receive or such hook, never the other way around
[2012-08-15 22:32:42 -0400] gilbert1: ok. would I need a hook for each of cookbook, roles, nodes, clients, etc?
[2012-08-15 22:32:43 -0400] alop: otherwise, it's real easy to lose state
[2012-08-15 22:33:00 -0400] gilbert1: or is there some magic command to update them all :)
[2012-08-15 22:34:10 -0400] gilbert1: forgive me if I'm asking some noob questions, been working with chef for about a week, and I'm just starting to play with git
[2012-08-15 22:34:44 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, i don't currently do that sort of automatic integration
[2012-08-15 22:35:47 -0400] gilbert1: so the most common use case is cookbooks only...
[2012-08-15 22:36:57 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, you lost me
[2012-08-15 22:38:14 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, but this tool may help: https://github.com/jkeiser/knife-essentials
[2012-08-15 22:38:39 -0400] gilbert1: thanks. let me try to clarify my situation too
[2012-08-15 22:39:30 -0400] gilbert1: I'll have multiple people managing chef ( including other teams) so we want to use git to keep track of versioning, who did what, the general stuff a SCM is supposed to do.
[2012-08-15 22:41:04 -0400] gilbert1: the question i'm really trying to answer is how to keep track of all the various parts of chef configs (clients, nodes, environments, etc) and keep chef up to date without those various people actually uploading through knife commands
[2012-08-15 22:44:50 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, i might suggest managing that just like you manage any other application in production
[2012-08-15 22:45:09 -0400] gilbert1: yeah, that's what I'm trying to setup :)
[2012-08-15 22:45:25 -0400] gilbert1: ok, it's apparent that I need to do some more reading.
[2012-08-15 22:45:28 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, each developer has his own copy of the application (in this case, his own chef-server, his own checkout, his own testing setup)
[2012-08-15 22:45:48 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, they communicate and coordinate through git
[2012-08-15 22:46:12 -0400] gilbert1: they'll have a copy of the chef repo, they won't have  a local test env.
[2012-08-15 22:46:55 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, i understand that's what most people happen to do with chef, but that's not what i'd recommend because that's not how anybody sane builds applications anymore (and really, nobody sane ever did that, even if many people did)
[2012-08-15 22:49:19 -0400] gilbert1: :) all we are currently using git and chef for is host configuration. We haven't brought our apps into the mix yet (probably wont for some time)
[2012-08-15 22:49:51 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, i'm not talking about the apps - i'm talking about working with chef as though it were an app itself
[2012-08-15 22:49:57 -0400] gilbert1: ah
[2012-08-15 22:50:43 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, you wouldn't have your app developers SSHing into the production boxes and editing application files in vim/emacs/nano/etc, right?
[2012-08-15 22:50:54 -0400] gilbert1: lol, no way
[2012-08-15 22:52:25 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, well, having all the ops guys on multiple teams writing to a single shared chef-server is kind of the same thing, isn't it?
[2012-08-15 22:53:19 -0400] gilbert1: agreed. however, i'm missing the part where I can get a local test environment for all the various roles
[2012-08-15 22:54:23 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, VMs? cloud?
[2012-08-15 22:54:33 -0400] gilbert1: i see
[2012-08-15 22:55:10 -0400] cheeseplus: vagrant
[2012-08-15 22:55:26 -0400] cheeseplus: as an additional option that is
[2012-08-15 22:55:32 -0400] cheeseplus: not accusing anyone of being a vagrant
[2012-08-15 22:55:44 -0400] yfeldblum: vagrant falling under the category of "VMs" :P
[2012-08-15 22:56:27 -0400] cheeseplus: indeed, I just like pointing it out specifically cause it's way more than _just_ a vm
[2012-08-15 22:56:44 -0400] cheeseplus: and it's perfect for testing out cookbooks
[2012-08-15 22:57:03 -0400] gilbert1: seems interesting, after a quick 10 second skim
[2012-08-15 23:00:02 -0400] gilbert1: anything like vagrant that works with vmware?
[2012-08-15 23:00:43 -0400] cheeseplus: gilbert1: vagrant is actually building in support for alternative backends
[2012-08-15 23:01:00 -0400] cheeseplus: I thought they had support for Fusion already
[2012-08-15 23:06:51 -0400] cheeseplus: gilbert1: apparently they are still working on fusion support in Vagrant
[2012-08-15 23:27:58 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, cheeseplus, can also script lxc, kvm, etc., and optionally do so with libvirt, and optionally do that via fog
[2012-08-15 23:28:14 -0400] erratic: The node's environment
[2012-08-15 23:29:28 -0400] cheeseplus: yfeldblum: yea, we use smartOS and scripts for kvm/zones
[2012-08-15 23:29:44 -0400] erratic: if you cant set that with knife how is it getting set with the webui
[2012-08-15 23:29:47 -0400] d2kagw: is there a good cookbook or best practice for Chef to manipulate the $PATH variable?
[2012-08-15 23:29:51 -0400] erratic: or by vagrant for that matter
[2012-08-15 23:30:05 -0400] yfeldblum: cheeseplus, perfectly valid approach for setting up temporary test infrastructures for testing the chef infrastructure
[2012-08-15 23:31:28 -0400] gilbert1: thanks guys
[2012-08-15 23:31:50 -0400] gilbert1: i really appreciate your input. i'll need to get some clearer requirements from the boss
[2012-08-15 23:33:05 -0400] erratic: nevermind
[2012-08-15 23:33:07 -0400] erratic: I figured it out.
[2012-08-15 23:33:12 -0400] erratic: okay!
[2012-08-15 23:33:14 -0400] erratic: fanx
[2012-08-15 23:38:56 -0400] erratic: root@ChefServer:/home/vagrant# EDITOR=nano knife node edit ChefServer -E "Development"
[2012-08-15 23:38:59 -0400] erratic: that works real good
[2012-08-15 23:39:07 -0400] miah: export EDITOR=$(which vim)
[2012-08-15 23:39:16 -0400] yfeldblum: gilbert1, you can look into toft toft and cucumber-chef, two different tools, for help with test infrastructure for testing your chef code
[2012-08-15 23:39:16 -0400] miah: =)
[2012-08-15 23:39:19 -0400] erratic: miah I was being sarcastic :)
[2012-08-15 23:39:25 -0400] miah: then never pass that EDITOR variable again!
[2012-08-15 23:39:40 -0400] yfeldblum: `knife node edit NODE -e vim`
[2012-08-15 23:39:41 -0400] erratic: the editor works thats not the problem
[2012-08-15 23:40:04 -0400] erratic: I think what I want to do is use sed ...
[2012-08-15 23:40:04 -0400] hoover_damm: the problem is between the keyboard and the chair?
[2012-08-15 23:40:04 -0400] miah: ya, but i put my EDITOR variable in my .bash_profile so im good to go
[2012-08-15 23:40:42 -0400] erratic: ideally I would be using this to change the environment of a node, not interactively
[2012-08-15 23:40:54 -0400] erratic: so an editor doesn't do me a lot of good
[2012-08-15 23:41:05 -0400] erratic: nor does that -E [environment] apparently
[2012-08-15 23:41:29 -0400] erratic: miah sorry for this awful link but: https://www.google.com/webhp?rlz=1C1SKPL_enUS485US485&sourceid=chrome-instant&ie=UTF-8&ion=1#hl=en&rlz=1C1SKPL_enUS485US485&sclient=psy-ab&q=knife+node+add+environment&oq=knife+node+add+environment&gs_l=serp.3..0i8i30j0i22.2867.6356.2.6858.21.17.4.0.0.0.159.1106.16j1.17.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.Bos8SkCK6eY&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&fp=b6fbdf4e16b0ea8&i

[2012-08-15 23:41:49 -0400] yfeldblum: erratic, write a simple knife plugin `knife node environment edit NODE NEW_ENVIRONMENT`
[2012-08-15 23:41:50 -0400] karsten: erratic: bit.ly or tinyurl.com
[2012-08-15 23:42:19 -0400] yfeldblum: erratic, fetch the node, change one item, save the node, done
[2012-08-15 23:43:03 -0400] jtimberman: erratic: you cna do it with knife exec
[2012-08-15 23:45:41 -0400] erratic: jtimberman haha I was going to try to do something to the effect of editor="sed .."
[2012-08-15 23:45:57 -0400] trobrock: What is best practice for setting up a chef client to auto run on a server to get updates from the chef server automatically?
[2012-08-15 23:46:05 -0400] yfeldblum: erratic, that would be :(
[2012-08-15 23:46:28 -0400] erratic: yfeldblum so would writing some crazy plugin xD
[2012-08-15 23:46:43 -0400] erratic: I dont know I dont like using plugins
[2012-08-15 23:47:02 -0400] erratic: and yeah I guess -exec isn't far off ..
[2012-08-15 23:47:05 -0400] erratic: hmmmmm
[2012-08-15 23:47:26 -0400] erratic: what if... I do a pull request later for it
[2012-08-15 23:48:00 -0400] erratic: because I don't want to be the one stuck maintaining it
[2012-08-15 23:48:38 -0400] yfeldblum: erratic, not really - i think everyone who uses chef ought to be forced to write knife plugins on a weekly basis
[2012-08-15 23:48:39 -0400] erratic: if its a plugin or an addition to knife or whatever
[2012-08-15 23:49:05 -0400] cheeseplus: trobrock: that is what it already does
[2012-08-15 23:49:05 -0400] jtimberman: erratic: knife exec -E 'nodes.transform("name:THINGONE") {|n| n.chef_environment("NEW_ENV")}'
[2012-08-15 23:49:17 -0400] erratic: yfeldblum me too, but I think they should have the luxury of knowing ahead of time whether or not its something that would be useful to other people if they care
[2012-08-15 23:49:25 -0400] cheeseplus: trobrock: chef client will get whatever the server has each time it converges
[2012-08-15 23:49:30 -0400] jtimberman: nodes.transform iterates over all the nodes matching the specified query and performs the block on them.
[2012-08-15 23:49:35 -0400] jtimberman: in that case, setting their environment
[2012-08-15 23:50:14 -0400] trobrock: cheeseplus: but I have to manually run sudo chef-client on the server to get those changes
[2012-08-15 23:50:34 -0400] miah: only if you are running chef-client manually and not as a daemon
[2012-08-15 23:50:38 -0400] cheeseplus: if you aren't running it as a daemn
[2012-08-15 23:50:46 -0400] cheeseplus: what miah said
[2012-08-15 23:50:47 -0400] yfeldblum: erratic, they don't have to be public knife plugins; indeed they can be highly specific to your infrastructure and to the types of ops tasks you particularly need to do in your infrastructure, and you don't need to share them or make them public
[2012-08-15 23:50:57 -0400] trobrock: ok so my question is what is the best method of running it as a daemon?
[2012-08-15 23:50:59 -0400] cheeseplus: if you don't want to run it as a daemon you can run as cron
[2012-08-15 23:51:26 -0400] cheeseplus: isn't the default as a daemon? or did I make that up
[2012-08-15 23:51:28 -0400] yfeldblum: erratic, but rather than write long, complex, error-prone scripts on the command-line time and time again, prefer to write simple knife plugins
[2012-08-15 23:51:41 -0400] erratic: yfeldblum my problem with that is what if I get hit by a bus and somebody has to figure out all the tribal stuff I have setup
[2012-08-15 23:51:55 -0400] cheeseplus: if you get hit by a bus you have bigger problems ;)
[2012-08-15 23:51:56 -0400] trobrock: cheeseplus: doesn't seem like it I ran knife bootstrap on the server and I don't see it running
[2012-08-15 23:52:01 -0400] erratic: lol
[2012-08-15 23:52:59 -0400] cheeseplus: trobrock: if not then something like "chef-client -i 3600 -s 600" in the startup script
[2012-08-15 23:53:18 -0400] cheeseplus: trobrock: that is just copied from the wiki: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Client btw
[2012-08-15 23:53:48 -0400] yfeldblum: erratic, then they'd be much more easily able to figure that out if they can read your chef-repo's knife plugins, than if they had to guess at what you have been typing on the command line these past few years
[2012-08-15 23:53:48 -0400] miah: you likely have a /etc/init.d/chef-client
[2012-08-15 23:54:08 -0400] trobrock: miah: no /etc/init.d.chef-client
[2012-08-15 23:54:15 -0400] trobrock: not .
[2012-08-15 23:54:27 -0400] miah: what distro are you on, and which version did you bootstrap?
[2012-08-15 23:54:43 -0400] yfeldblum: erratic, everyone has tribal stuff; the only question is: do you write it down and script it all? or does the tribal chieftan simply remember the tribal stuff?
[2012-08-15 23:55:05 -0400] erratic: I document
[2012-08-15 23:55:07 -0400] trobrock: miah: CentOS 6.3 chef version 10.12.0
[2012-08-15 23:55:09 -0400] cheeseplus: trobrock: you can also do it via cron, we do that on some servers that are tied to two different chef-servers but otherwise I'd just run it as a daemon
[2012-08-15 23:55:30 -0400] erratic: I document everything
[2012-08-15 23:55:44 -0400] cheeseplus: well then the bus problem is obviated
[2012-08-15 23:55:58 -0400] erratic: and i try to do as much research as possible into what will be the best long term solution
[2012-08-15 23:56:03 -0400] yfeldblum: erratic, but the best documentation is clear, working code :P
[2012-08-15 23:56:11 -0400] miah: are you certain the bootstrap completed without error?
[2012-08-15 23:56:38 -0400] trobrock: miah: believe so, let me try and find the logs
[2012-08-15 23:56:46 -0400] erratic: which I'm leaning towards is probably going to be a knife module because not too many people can look at sed and awk hacks and have the guts to try and figure them out in the man pages and google
[2012-08-15 23:58:01 -0400] trobrock: miah: dont see a log anywhere, but I remember it successfully running chef-client at the end
[2012-08-15 23:58:28 -0400] erratic: yfeldblum, jtimberman thanks yalls
[2012-08-15 23:58:30 -0400] cheeseplus: erratic: I love sed and awk but I'd prefer code for something like that
[2012-08-15 23:58:45 -0400] erratic: cheeseplus haha
[2012-08-15 23:58:47 -0400] erratic: yeah
[2012-08-15 23:58:59 -0400] erratic: regexp gets silly
[2012-08-15 23:59:41 -0400] miah: regexp - for when all problems look like a nail
