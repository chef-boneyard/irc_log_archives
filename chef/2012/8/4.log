[2012-08-04 04:48:36 -0400] Pavel: who wants to make $200 helping me with what I think is a simple Chef problem?
[2012-08-04 04:54:35 -0400] Pavel: paypal
[2012-08-04 04:54:46 -0400] Pavel: need some quick help guys
[2012-08-04 04:55:30 -0400] flaccid: helps if you ask the question
[2012-08-04 04:57:19 -0400] flaccid: mr Pavel
[2012-08-04 04:58:17 -0400] flaccid: guess i wasn't quick enough hehe
[2012-08-04 05:03:41 -0400] Pavel: haha
[2012-08-04 05:05:03 -0400] Pavel: so when i am in the Chef admin and click on any of the cookbooks i get this error "Connection refused - Connection refused connecting to chef.host.com:4000 for /cookbooks/php/1.1.14/files/64352bfdc70145ed42b9b278106d96c2, giving up"
[2012-08-04 05:05:34 -0400] Pavel: when the client connect to the chef server i see the same error in their client log
[2012-08-04 05:07:01 -0400] Pavel: ports are open, no ip tables, can telnet to the poirt, seems like weird error for what is happening
[2012-08-04 05:09:00 -0400] Pavel: Chris my man
[2012-08-04 05:09:21 -0400] Pavel: dont abandon me
[2012-08-04 05:14:05 -0400] flaccid: need to see the client.rb's i guess
[2012-08-04 05:14:42 -0400] flaccid: maybe solr died

I set up my workstation on windows... and now trying to "set EDITOR environment variable"... so I can edit a data bag contents before its encrypted... I tried useing "set EDITOR = path2notepad++".. tried setting a "enviromental varuable" in the system properties windows... (and rebooted) tried "export EDITOR" and just "EDITOR"... searched google, and found nothing about how
[2012-08-04 07:30:15 -0400] skidx: to do this in windows.. and checked the install windows page, and don't see anything there about it either... does anyone know how to do this on windows?
[2012-08-04 07:31:48 -0400] skidx: my overall goal is to run this command "knife data bag create --secret-file ~/.chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret secrets mysql"
[2012-08-04 08:32:05 -0400] schuckles: hi, is anyone awake?
[2012-08-04 10:39:54 -0400] Gurpartap: Is there an alternative to the spice gem?
[2012-08-04 10:40:01 -0400] Gurpartap: For accessing the Chef server API quickly?
[2012-08-04 10:40:20 -0400] Gurpartap: (ruby)
[2012-08-04 10:55:27 -0400] Gurpartap: When I query for api.opscode.com/clients with spice gem, which uses mixlib-authentication (part of chef) to sign headers, I get a 404.
[2012-08-04 10:55:34 -0400] Gurpartap: In fact, I get 404 for all requests.
[2012-08-04 10:56:15 -0400] Gurpartap: ah. i guess it's my client permissions
[2012-08-04 11:02:55 -0400] Gurpartap: Is there a way to add a manually added client to admins group?
[2012-08-04 11:02:57 -0400] Gurpartap: (hosted chef)
[2012-08-04 11:03:41 -0400] Gurpartap: (without adding a new user)
[2012-08-04 11:04:22 -0400] Gurpartap: Is it too early for working? ^_^
[2012-08-04 11:25:05 -0400] Gurpartap: umm. no luck yet
[2012-08-04 11:25:22 -0400] Gurpartap: still getting a 404
[2012-08-04 12:27:07 -0400] Gurpartap: i think it's the spice gem
[2012-08-04 12:27:09 -0400] Gurpartap: meh
[2012-08-04 12:54:53 -0400] Gurpartap: figured the problem with spice gem. it's that it's endpoints aren't considering the hosted chef's path (i.e. /organizations/ORGNAME)
[2012-08-04 14:02:09 -0400] magec: Hi all!, i've been using chef for quite a while and I'm very happy with it. The point is that now, Im writing some docu about my system and thought that it would be so nice to be able to generate the documentation based on the actual state of the system (something that chef knows about). Is there something like that? Wouldn't be nice to have a kind of wiki aside with some "chef docu resources" support so your documentation is always up to date? An
[2012-08-04 14:13:21 -0400] PapaSierra: if i have a chef recipe called default.rb and attributes file called default.rb can i infer that if i change the recipe to mydefault.rb then i also change attributes to mydefault.rb? or does it not work like that?
[2012-08-04 14:45:30 -0400] PapaSierra: using the mysql cookbooks chef is dying on mysql-install-privileges. if i paste bin can someone give me a hand?
[2012-08-04 15:52:38 -0400] PapaSierra: anyone there?
[2012-08-04 15:53:45 -0400] cheeseplus: PapaSierra: whats up?
[2012-08-04 15:54:41 -0400] cheeseplus: i see in srollback you are having issues with mysql, let me know the distro and gist/pastebin it so I can see the error
[2012-08-04 15:54:54 -0400] PapaSierra: cheeseplus thanks. i'm latest issue is: http://pastebin.com/GByYMAF2
[2012-08-04 15:55:14 -0400] PapaSierra: basically i'm using attributes file to set up two virtual hosts
[2012-08-04 15:55:27 -0400] PapaSierra: i'm don't know how to interpret this error
[2012-08-04 15:56:42 -0400] cheeseplus: well that error at least seems pretty straightforward, where is project::baset line 29 looking for templates?
[2012-08-04 15:57:52 -0400] PapaSierra: cheeseplus err... my line 29 is this: package "git-core"
[2012-08-04 15:58:55 -0400] cheeseplus: that likely isn't it, is there baset.rb in there?
[2012-08-04 15:59:45 -0400] PapaSierra: cheeseplus it really is reporting the wrong line number. but nevermind, please see here: http://pastebin.com/B7cFcky1
[2012-08-04 16:01:00 -0400] PapaSierra: ahhh i understand the error message now
[2012-08-04 16:03:17 -0400] PapaSierra: cheeseplus basically i didn't have a web_app.conf.erb file and my code tries to use it
[2012-08-04 16:03:31 -0400] cheeseplus: yea, that is what it seemed like
[2012-08-04 16:04:59 -0400] PapaSierra: right, so now my docroot will be /home/baset/production/public, but that dir doesn't exist yet, must i manually create it? how do i tell chef to create it if it doesn't exist?
[2012-08-04 16:06:38 -0400] cheeseplus: PapaSierra: I would always tell chef to create it
[2012-08-04 16:06:58 -0400] PapaSierra: ok, how do i do that?
[2012-08-04 16:07:06 -0400] PapaSierra: (sorry still quite new to this)
[2012-08-04 16:07:20 -0400] cheeseplus: directory "/tmp/something" do

[2012-08-04 16:07:45 -0400] PapaSierra: awesome. and if it already exists it won't override it right?
[2012-08-04 16:07:58 -0400] cheeseplus: correct, it's a "mkdir -p"
[2012-08-04 16:08:40 -0400] cheeseplus: er sorry, you can make it behave like mkdir -p with the "recursive true"
[2012-08-04 16:10:00 -0400] cheeseplus: PapaSierra: the file resource works similiarly, if it exists it won't create but will check that perms and such match the recipe
[2012-08-04 16:10:08 -0400] PapaSierra: awesome. is this it right syntax?    directory node[:app][:staging][:docroot] do
[2012-08-04 16:12:05 -0400] cheeseplus: PapaSierra: that should work just fine
[2012-08-04 16:13:09 -0400] PapaSierra: great. sorry but i'm still getting this issue: http://pastebin.com/8THuHuJd it seems to be looking for my web_app.conf.erb in the "wrong place"
[2012-08-04 16:13:41 -0400] PapaSierra: for me it's in cookbooks/project/templates/web_app_conf.erb.
[2012-08-04 16:15:29 -0400] _rc: PapaSierra: make that cookbooks/project/templates/default/web_app_conf.erb
[2012-08-04 16:15:36 -0400] PapaSierra: ahhhh
[2012-08-04 16:15:41 -0400] PapaSierra: just noticed that too
[2012-08-04 16:15:45 -0400] PapaSierra: thanks :)
[2012-08-04 16:19:23 -0400] PapaSierra: it flipping works! thanks so much _rc and cheeseplus for your help
[2012-08-04 16:19:32 -0400] cheeseplus: PapaSierra: glad to help
[2012-08-04 16:19:40 -0400] cheeseplus: now for breakfast!

[2012-08-04 16:40:08 -0400] Pavel: where are cookbooks stored in CouchDB by default?
[2012-08-04 18:41:02 -0400] df11: how can one check for the existence of a file in a recipe?  in a cookbook_file block i would like to use a particular source if a file exists in the cookbook and a different source if it doesn't.
[2012-08-04 18:59:31 -0400] df11: in similar context, is there a way to get a list of all files in the 'files' directory cookbook?
[2012-08-04 19:10:26 -0400] jtgiri_: Hey guys, I just chef-server and chef client but I see that knife command is not available, isn't that part of chef anymore ?

[2012-08-04 19:20:27 -0400] yfeldblum: knife is a CLI tool that ships with the "chef" gem
[2012-08-04 19:41:25 -0400] killfill: hi
[2012-08-04 19:42:22 -0400] killfill: newbie question: if there is a chef cookbook for X, and i wanto to deploy X in multiple OS's, can i do it with the same chef cookbook?
[2012-08-04 19:47:22 -0400] yfeldblum: killfill, some cookbooks are compatible with multiple OS's; others are written for only one OS; it differs on a cookbook-by-cookbook basis, so you should read the README or metadata.rb provided with each cookbook to find out
[2012-08-04 19:48:54 -0400] killfill: ok
[2012-08-04 20:09:09 -0400] df11: is there any way to access attribute method file_filenames in a recipe?  i would like to access it to get a list of files in a cookbook.  the cache_path on the system only has cached items so that won't work.  in shef, this works: cookbooks.show('cookbook_name').file_filenames.  any ideas?
[2012-08-04 20:49:54 -0400] jtgiri_: hello - i am getting this error ? http://pastebin.com/w919WAPy , it sounds like I can download the cookbook fine except it fails to download files , any ideas ?
[2012-08-04 20:52:42 -0400] df11: jtgiri_: that paste is from january, are you sure that is your error?

[2012-08-04 21:01:06 -0400] jtgiri_: it's like some process which serves files is not running or something
[2012-08-04 21:03:07 -0400] df11: are you by chance running an older version of chef, pre-0.9.0?
[2012-08-04 21:03:26 -0400] df11: i remember this bug, which looks similar to yours: CHEF-1336
[2012-08-04 21:03:57 -0400] df11: i see your client version, how about server?
[2012-08-04 21:05:00 -0400] jtgiri_: chef-server --version
[2012-08-04 21:05:00 -0400] jtgiri_: Chef Server (API) Version: 10.12.0
[2012-08-04 21:12:05 -0400] df11: is this node also the server?  i see 'Starting Chef Run for localhost' and normally localhost is the gqdn
[2012-08-04 21:12:10 -0400] df11: fqdn*
[2012-08-04 21:16:26 -0400] jtgiri_: all the clients are getting same error
[2012-08-04 21:17:14 -0400] jtgiri_: are the files stored on the file system on chef-server ?
[2012-08-04 21:22:41 -0400] hoover_damm: jtgiri_, couchdb not running?
[2012-08-04 21:22:52 -0400] jtgiri_: it is running
[2012-08-04 21:23:01 -0400] hoover_damm: ah yes it is
[2012-08-04 21:23:15 -0400] hoover_damm: but it's definetly having issues
[2012-08-04 21:23:23 -0400] hoover_damm: and that's where your problem likely is near
[2012-08-04 21:23:51 -0400] hoover_damm: cookbooks are stored in couchdb so if your having problems fetching cookbooks... verify that couchdb has compacted recently
[2012-08-04 21:23:55 -0400] hoover_damm: there's enough disk space
[2012-08-04 21:24:17 -0400] jtgiri_: Okay
[2012-08-04 21:24:22 -0400] hoover_damm: usually it's related to compaction and disk space
[2012-08-04 21:24:27 -0400] hoover_damm: occasionally you can get a buggy couchdb in the  mix
[2012-08-04 21:24:30 -0400] hoover_damm: or erlang
[2012-08-04 21:24:35 -0400] hoover_damm: but hopefully it's just a small disk space issue
[2012-08-04 21:24:51 -0400] jtgiri_: thanks - plenty of disk, let me troubleshoot couched

[2012-08-04 21:26:11 -0400] hoover_damm: might work for backing up and restoring the data
[2012-08-04 21:26:11 -0400] hoover_damm: not sure
[2012-08-04 21:26:50 -0400] hoover_damm: http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Frequently_asked_questions?action=show&redirect=FrequentlyAskedQuestions#how_replication
[2012-08-04 21:26:56 -0400] hoover_damm: worst case scenario you can replicate chef to chef2
[2012-08-04 21:26:58 -0400] hoover_damm: then delete chef
[2012-08-04 21:27:01 -0400] hoover_damm: rename chef2 to chef
[2012-08-04 21:27:02 -0400] hoover_damm: and restart
[2012-08-04 21:27:11 -0400] hoover_damm: usually ocuchdb replication fixes most couchdb issues
[2012-08-04 21:27:13 -0400] hoover_damm: amazingly
[2012-08-04 21:27:30 -0400] hoover_damm: can't wait for erlchef to drop in master
[2012-08-04 21:27:36 -0400] hoover_damm: so we can kick this couchdb thing out the door
