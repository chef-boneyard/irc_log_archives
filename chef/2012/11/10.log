[2012-11-10 00:02:58 -0500] j|: pretty opaque failure.
[2012-11-10 00:03:07 -0500] j|: a little bit frustrating to admin
[2012-11-10 00:03:46 -0500] miah: ah, chef-expander is what i meant.
[2012-11-10 00:03:56 -0500] miah: make sure its consuming items from rabbitmq and pushing them into solr
[2012-11-10 00:04:38 -0500] miah: solr is what serves the searches, so if it doesn't have your node data indexed it can't return results.
[2012-11-10 00:16:42 -0500] j|: yea...
[2012-11-10 00:16:47 -0500] j|: appreciated.
[2012-11-10 00:20:03 -0500] j|: and now after adding chef_server as its own client, it doesn't yet show up in the node searches
[2012-11-10 00:25:29 -0500] miah: ya. sounds like expander or solr is having a issue
[2012-11-10 00:25:49 -0500] miah: you're going to have to do more investigation than a ps. the services can be running but non-functional.
[2012-11-10 00:28:03 -0500] j|: yea, there's been issues all day
[2012-11-10 00:28:10 -0500] j|: I'm sure my fault
[2012-11-10 00:28:31 -0500] j|: its just frustrating
[2012-11-10 00:32:25 -0500] miah: ya. totally understand
[2012-11-10 00:49:27 -0500] sascha_d: hi chefs, if I'm using the http_request resource and I have a query string as part of the url, how might I encode it so that the url makes it out to the endpoint intact?
[2012-11-10 00:51:01 -0500] sascha_d: can I send it as a post with json data?  It's technically a get request, but I can flex
[2012-11-10 00:51:57 -0500] erikh: depends on the web service
[2012-11-10 00:52:32 -0500] erikh: so I swear there used to be a call in URI for this
[2012-11-10 00:54:03 -0500] sascha_d: I'm trying to get an answer back from Artifactory
[2012-11-10 00:54:08 -0500] sascha_d: on latest version I think
[2012-11-10 00:54:13 -0500] sascha_d: the url came from a dev team
[2012-11-10 00:55:50 -0500] sascha_d: but the query side of the url appears to be stripped during the run
[2012-11-10 00:57:08 -0500] erikh: something like this should work (call on the value while constructing the query): value.chars.map { |x| x.ord.to_s(16) }
[2012-11-10 00:57:17 -0500] erikh: err,
[2012-11-10 00:57:40 -0500] erikh: value.chars.map { |x| "%" + x.ord.to_s(16) }.join("")
[2012-11-10 00:57:42 -0500] erikh: anyhow
[2012-11-10 00:58:05 -0500] sascha_d: inside the http_request resource?
[2012-11-10 01:01:01 -0500] erikh: no. are you building the query string ahead of time?
[2012-11-10 01:02:55 -0500] sascha_d: Yes, the entire url was handed to me by a dev team who is trying to retrieve the latest version of their artifact from artifactory
[2012-11-10 01:03:24 -0500] erikh: heh, then ask your devs to encode it properly
[2012-11-10 01:03:43 -0500] sascha_d: https://dotcom.com/artifactory/api/search/latestVersion?g=com.app.search.content&a=DaaS&v=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT&repos=libs-snapshot-local
[2012-11-10 01:04:12 -0500] erikh: something else is going on there.
[2012-11-10 01:04:24 -0500] erikh: I don't think anything in there has to be encoded.
[2012-11-10 01:04:46 -0500] sascha_d: so the url is broken off after latestVersion when I test
[2012-11-10 01:05:31 -0500] sascha_d: when I use a browser, it returns a plain page with just this text: 0.0.1-20121109.221707.-216
[2012-11-10 01:05:41 -0500] erikh: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-HTTPRequest
[2012-11-10 01:05:47 -0500] erikh: what does your provider call look like?
[2012-11-10 01:06:19 -0500] sascha_d: I'm using shef to just run the http_request block
[2012-11-10 01:06:53 -0500] sascha_d: the debug looks like this: DEBUG: Sending HTTP Request via GET to some.url.com:443/artifactory/api/search/latestVersion
[2012-11-10 01:07:10 -0500] erikh: yeah
[2012-11-10 01:07:13 -0500] sascha_d: and then a formatters error
[2012-11-10 01:07:18 -0500] erikh: so these docs are a little convoluted
[2012-11-10 01:07:37 -0500] erikh: but what you want is something like this, I think
[2012-11-10 01:07:38 -0500] erikh: sec
[2012-11-10 01:08:01 -0500] sascha_d: There must be a way to do something here, so I was experimenting with a few things, including trying to format the query in the message
[2012-11-10 01:08:19 -0500] sascha_d: I caught the dev writing his own connection code, which is why I'm trying to figure this out
[2012-11-10 01:08:39 -0500] erikh: https://gist.github.com/fe9dd543c376e72db373
[2012-11-10 01:08:51 -0500] erikh: message is also the name attribute
[2012-11-10 01:09:02 -0500] erikh: so you override it in the resource definition in that hash
[2012-11-10 01:09:05 -0500] erikh: can you try that?
[2012-11-10 01:11:33 -0500] sascha_d: yeah, I was just going to go there next :)
[2012-11-10 01:14:57 -0500] sascha_d: so is the message attribute an actual hash?
[2012-11-10 01:15:06 -0500] sascha_d: that's not clear from the example
[2012-11-10 01:15:09 -0500] sascha_d: on the web site
[2012-11-10 01:15:22 -0500] sascha_d: or is it just a space separated set of key/values?
[2012-11-10 01:15:29 -0500] sascha_d: I should just go read the source code
[2012-11-10 01:18:14 -0500] sascha_d: message is whatever you want it to be
[2012-11-10 01:18:45 -0500] sascha_d: def message(args=nil, &block) . kind_of => Object
[2012-11-10 01:22:39 -0500] sascha_d: I think what I originally tried to should actually work. I'm going to have to go run it on an actual node and see what debug gives me there. Shef is not helping. Although to be fair, I could be doing something else wrong
[2012-11-10 02:04:51 -0500] maplebed: ok, so I'm trying to do the whole library/application cookbook paradigm using the nagios cookbook. I need to have custom NRPE checks, and the docs say "Client commands for NRPE can be modified by editing the nrpe.cfg.erb template.".
[2012-11-10 02:05:01 -0500] maplebed: Is there a way I can override the template from my app cookbook?
[2012-11-10 02:20:37 -0500] ssd7: Ohai Chefs!
[2012-11-10 02:23:44 -0500] maplebed: quiet here tonight.
[2012-11-10 02:24:38 -0500] erikh: friday evening in the US
[2012-11-10 02:35:40 -0500] ssd7: Indeed
[2012-11-10 02:48:03 -0500] jaimef: anyone use pry/rdebug on a remote server to test erb expansions?
[2012-11-10 03:08:11 -0500] j|: hrm.. anyone know where node['language']['ruby']['gems_dir'] is set from?
[2012-11-10 03:10:35 -0500] j|: apparently from Ohai
[2012-11-10 03:15:40 -0500] j|: ah, I see other people have this problem as well
[2012-11-10 03:54:51 -0500] sascha_d: opscode, why does apache hate your headers? It must be the headers
[2012-11-10 04:57:49 -0500] sascha_d: chefs, can someone check me? I'm getting sleepy and might be making dumb mistakes.  http_request has an :options action in docs and in the resource/http_request.rb
[2012-11-10 04:58:12 -0500] sascha_d: but when I run it, my stack trace tells me this: NameError: Cannot find a resource for action_options
[2012-11-10 04:58:34 -0500] sascha_d: when I look at the code, I can't find a def for it
[2012-11-10 04:58:48 -0500] sascha_d: in the provider
[2012-11-10 04:59:03 -0500] sascha_d: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/provider/http_request.rb
[2012-11-10 04:59:08 -0500] sascha_d: is there something I'm missing?
[2012-11-10 09:32:08 -0500] intinig: hello everyone
[2012-11-10 09:32:41 -0500] intinig: In a recipe for a php module I need to move stuff to the php extensions dir. On two different boxes that were supposed to be the same, that directory is different
[2012-11-10 09:33:09 -0500] intinig: How would you go in running php -i, getting the result in a variable and use that variable in the resource where you move stuff around?
[2012-11-10 09:48:33 -0500] intinig: how do I write something so it is run after the recipe is compiled
[2012-11-10 09:48:37 -0500] intinig: during execution?
[2012-11-10 09:49:16 -0500] intinig: I tried this
[2012-11-10 09:49:16 -0500] intinig: https://gist.github.com/ee3770e5f258418357d1
[2012-11-10 09:49:27 -0500] intinig: but it runs the proc during compilation
[2012-11-10 09:49:34 -0500] intinig: and it dies there
[2012-11-10 16:54:00 -0500] ssd7: Ohai Chefs
[2012-11-10 17:03:42 -0500] ssd7: Heh all, what sysctl cookbook are most people using these days.  I remember something from the summit but my notes seem to be missing in.
[2012-11-10 17:03:47 -0500] ssd7: Is it: https://github.com/spheromak/sysctl-cookbook.git ?
[2012-11-10 17:46:53 -0500] sascha_d: Hi chefs, I'm still battling http_request; I think I know my problem. Chef is sending a content-length header with a GET request and mod_security requests that it diaf
[2012-11-10 17:47:21 -0500] sascha_d: @ssd7 mebbe you know how I can override? I've been poking at the rest code in chef but not having much luck
[2012-11-10 17:48:44 -0500] sascha_d: mebbe I should ask in chef-hacking
[2012-11-10 17:58:36 -0500] julian: Quick question regarding http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/File+Distribution.  Lets say I am putting files in apache2/files/default  can I make a sub directory called sites-enabled in default? When I refer to it is it " -  source "mysite" - or - source "sites-enabled/mysite"
[2012-11-10 18:01:41 -0500] ssd7: julian: You can and you would refer to it via the latter I believe.
[2012-11-10 18:02:36 -0500] julian: Thanks much!
[2012-11-10 18:29:02 -0500] siezer: whats a handy example of an apache2 config for a php application?
[2012-11-10 18:34:30 -0500] masterkorp: siezer: i think apache2 cookbook has one
[2012-11-10 18:34:41 -0500] masterkorp: if not the php cookbook has
[2012-11-10 18:54:23 -0500] masterkorp: msonnabaum|afk: dont use that afk nickchange plase
[2012-11-10 19:11:07 -0500] emilsoman: How can I deploy certain revisions of code , when Chef client is running as a daemon , and I dont have ssh access into any of the client nodes ? ( I have access to the chef Server , though )
[2012-11-10 19:12:02 -0500] sascha_d: emilsoman can you set an attribute with your code revision?
[2012-11-10 19:12:15 -0500] sascha_d: and then pass it in as an override attribute? That would get picked up on the next chef run.
[2012-11-10 19:12:57 -0500] emilsoman: what would be the default attribute ?
[2012-11-10 19:13:45 -0500] emilsoman: i cannot keep "HEAD" , right ? That would change every now and then
[2012-11-10 19:14:09 -0500] sascha_d: in your cookbook that manages the app you might define an attribute that sets default['myapp'][release_version'] = ""
[2012-11-10 19:14:25 -0500] sascha_d: and then in you role override attributes define the actual revision you want
[2012-11-10 19:14:36 -0500] sascha_d: unless you are looking for a way to dynamically find the latest and deploy that?
[2012-11-10 19:16:10 -0500] sascha_d: this is easier if your code builds externally and creates an artifact (like a war, ear, tar, whatever) and puts it in a place where the client node can fetch it
[2012-11-10 19:25:29 -0500] emilsoman: sascha_d ,my override value needs to be HEAD ,  if I override the default attribute in the role , everytime the chef-client runs on the node with that role , won't it try to fetch the HEAD everytime it runs ? That's my doubt
[2012-11-10 19:26:52 -0500] sascha_d: Where do you do your application builds and run unit tests?
[2012-11-10 19:27:09 -0500] sascha_d: Sometimes an orchestration tool that isn't Chef might be needed
[2012-11-10 19:27:31 -0500] emilsoman: it's a rails app ...
[2012-11-10 19:30:26 -0500] emilsoman: Here , the deployment steps are the usual , fetch from git , run migrations , precompile assets , and restart , the same steps that chef supports well ..
[2012-11-10 19:30:27 -0500] sascha_d: there's a deploy resource for chef that looks like it's pretty rails-specific.  Maybe try reading up on that
[2012-11-10 19:31:56 -0500] emilsoman: Thanks for the pointer , sascha_d , I really appreciate your help  .. I read the doc on deploy resource , but I couldn't find anything regarding running deployments on a chef-client running as daemon
[2012-11-10 19:32:37 -0500] sascha_d: I'll have to bow out here. Most of my experience is in deploying versioned artifacts, so I don't know much about railsy/php deploys.
[2012-11-10 19:33:56 -0500] emilsoman: thanks for trying to help , anyway !
[2012-11-10 19:45:27 -0500] masterkorp: http://i.imgur.com/k5oBJ.jpg
[2012-11-10 19:50:03 -0500] mikeywaites: hey guys am i correct in thinking you can specify an environment when using chef-solo for provisioning vagrant vm's?
[2012-11-10 20:01:32 -0500] julian_: Hey guys, I am getting to the point where I need to figure out how to organize my files and recipes.  Is there a standard for this.  For example, for enabling apache sites, would someone put the files or recipes in apache or in a site specific cookbook that imports the apache recipe?
[2012-11-10 20:03:35 -0500] gchristensen: I'd create another cookbook
[2012-11-10 20:05:54 -0500] masterkorp: julian_: there is not a consence here
[2012-11-10 20:06:37 -0500] julian_: Hmmmmm.  Thanks for the input guys.  If you guys don't mind me asking, how do you organize site specific, files recipes, etc?
[2012-11-10 20:06:52 -0500] julian_: For services such as apache, mysql, etc?
[2012-11-10 20:06:55 -0500] pseudonymous: I'd very much like to know if anyone knows of a simple guide for chef, specifically for chef-solo use. I know ruby already, but checking out someoneone's cookbook through git is not my idea of an introduction...
[2012-11-10 20:07:13 -0500] gchristensen: julian_: I generally take existing cookbooks, and if I need to expand its functionality create one called <cookbook>-ext so then I can freely update the original
[2012-11-10 20:07:34 -0500] julian_: gchristensen: nice.
[2012-11-10 20:07:52 -0500] gchristensen: otherwise I'll create small cookbooks for other tasks I'm doing, like installing a bunch of dependencies I'll make one for those
[2012-11-10 20:08:35 -0500] gchristensen: but really I start one way and end up updating my approach whenever I find some better way. I try not to get married to a method, until I have really strong reasons
[2012-11-10 20:09:33 -0500] julian_: pseudonymous: the following is the pdf of the chef documentation.  I have put it on my ipad and have been reading through it.  It is pretty good: http://wiki.opscode.com/download/attachments/1179727/chef-170212-2137-12.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1329515989000
[2012-11-10 20:11:34 -0500] pseudonymous: I mean, is it worth it for say.. sub 5 servers ? I'd very much like to automate these things later on, but a 1k PDF is daunting to say the least.
[2012-11-10 20:12:30 -0500] pseudonymous: I was hoping for (a) A short introduction, creating an example cookbook and explaining what all this metadata, databag and assorted nonsense is --and-- (b) maybe a repo for grabbing other people's published cookbooks as a starting point for customisation
[2012-11-10 20:25:01 -0500] julian_: Yah.  I have not seen anything like that.  But...the dzonerefcardz on chef is really condensed and I have found it to be useful.
[2012-11-10 20:26:50 -0500] pseudonymous: Hmm, how ironic, Chef was made because they felt Puppet was too complex. And they then went about creating something which ends up seeming as complex to the layman, also. I get it, if I was a sysadm by trade, I'd learn this for sure, but as someone who "just" needs to manage a few servers having a different job and responsibilities on the side, the lack of a good entry leads me to think it failed its initial goal
[2012-11-10 20:32:10 -0500] masterkorp: pseudonymous: could not agree more
[2012-11-10 20:32:19 -0500] masterkorp: also new docs are being written
[2012-11-10 20:32:23 -0500] masterkorp: book-like
[2012-11-10 21:13:04 -0500] pseudonymous: it's been suggested that there's a repository for cookbooks to look at, is there an URL I should know. I'm sort of example-driven (once I've had a chance to acquaint myself with the terminology)
[2012-11-10 21:13:38 -0500] gchristensen: github.com/opscode-cookbooks
[2012-11-10 21:18:43 -0500] pseudonymous: gchristensen, great, thanks!
[2012-11-10 21:18:50 -0500] gchristensen: sure thing
