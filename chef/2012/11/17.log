[2012-11-17 00:01:50 -0500] edelschaedel: anyone ever have a problem where cookbook files are not being downloaded along with the cookbook?
[2012-11-17 00:02:00 -0500] edelschaedel: this is on hosted chef.
[2012-11-17 00:03:36 -0500] yfeldblum: edelschaedel, cookbook files are never downloaded along with cookbooks until a particular cookbook_file resource in a particular recipe references it
[2012-11-17 00:04:14 -0500] edelschaedel: hmm. maybe that's it.  checking.
[2012-11-17 00:05:36 -0500] gsymons-di: Does anybody know of an equivalent to the AWS cookbook that uses Fog instead of Right AWS?
[2012-11-17 00:06:53 -0500] cwj: gsymons-di: i'm not aware of one, what functions from the aws cookbook were you looking to use?
[2012-11-17 00:06:54 -0500] miah: i still havent tried to use fog.. only been using aws-sdk
[2012-11-17 00:07:14 -0500] miah: it would be nice if there were more generic versions of the aws cookbook though that worked across cloud providers via fog.
[2012-11-17 00:08:25 -0500] cwj: a fog cookbook
[2012-11-17 00:08:53 -0500] miah: there is a fog cookbook. but it has no relation to the fog we're speaking of.
[2012-11-17 00:08:54 -0500] gsymons-di: I need to attach to an ELB in a VPC, and RightAWS is using an older version of the API that doesn't support that.
[2012-11-17 00:09:14 -0500] miah: gsymons-di: fix it =)
[2012-11-17 00:09:41 -0500] gsymons-di: Though I haven't tested Fog, based on the way it works, I assume it's easier to keep up to date (and therefore is:)
[2012-11-17 00:10:33 -0500] gsymons-di: miah: I was hoping somebody already did:) I'm on a tight deadline, and can't really justify the distraction right now.
[2012-11-17 00:10:52 -0500] miah: ya
[2012-11-17 00:11:04 -0500] miah: i know how that goes. i haven't seen another cookbook similar to aws that uses fog. sorry :/
[2012-11-17 00:11:10 -0500] miah: i hate the rightaws gem as well
[2012-11-17 00:11:20 -0500] miah: have to work around silly things
[2012-11-17 00:13:22 -0500] cwj: gsymons-di: so you need api 2011-08-15 ?
[2012-11-17 00:13:33 -0500] red5|ryan: gsymons-di: I did that very lazily with fog the other day
[2012-11-17 00:13:47 -0500] red5|ryan: buts its not in a cookbook I can publish =[
[2012-11-17 00:14:04 -0500] cwj: looks like you need to go about this deep to change the API being used https://github.com/rightscale/right_aws/blob/master/lib/elb/right_elb_interface.rb#L65
[2012-11-17 00:14:12 -0500] cwj: api version rather
[2012-11-17 00:15:05 -0500] cwj: if you are in a position to package your own right aws gem that might be an easier work around
[2012-11-17 00:16:37 -0500] red5|ryan:  elb =  Fog::AWS::ELB.new(:aws_access_key_id => aws_access_key, :aws_secret_access_key => aws_secret_key, :region => aws_region)
[2012-11-17 00:16:37 -0500] red5|ryan:   elb.register_instances_with_load_balancer(instance_id, elb_name)
[2012-11-17 00:16:51 -0500] red5|ryan: make an empty cookbook. drop it in a provider with an empty resource.
[2012-11-17 00:18:55 -0500] red5|ryan: only tested it in vpc, but I assume its fine in ec2 as well
[2012-11-17 00:19:40 -0500] edelschaedel: gsymons-di: i noticed there's an updated right_aws gem in this aws branch.   maybe it also includes changes to how it handles ELBs.
[2012-11-17 00:19:42 -0500] edelschaedel: https://github.com/hectcastro/aws/tree/provisioned-iops
[2012-11-17 00:23:07 -0500] gsymons-di: red5|ryan: I'll probably do that eventually... for now we're actually OK with manually joining things to the ELB.
[2012-11-17 00:23:56 -0500] gsymons-di: cwj: We're not really a ruby shop, so I don't want to really deal with a gem server just yet
[2012-11-17 00:25:17 -0500] gsymons-di: edelschaedel: Looking on master of Right AWS, they're still using pretty much the same API version. There's a pull request to update it but it's not in master yet.
[2012-11-17 00:25:31 -0500] gsymons-di: Thanks for all the suggestions, though.

[2012-11-17 00:44:38 -0500] yfeldblum: davidmz, node.default["top-level-key"]["sub-key"]["sub-sub-key"] = "asdf1234qwertyuiop"
[2012-11-17 00:44:49 -0500] davidmz: it was done by mistake, sorry
[2012-11-17 00:45:14 -0500] davidmz: yfeldblum: which resource do I use to call this code
[2012-11-17 00:45:15 -0500] yfeldblum: chip-, you should typically use normal ruby code running at "compile time" for query-type stuff
[2012-11-17 00:45:42 -0500] yfeldblum: davidmz, you don't need a resource - you just write that code in a recipe, because recipes are just normal pure simple honest-to-goodness ruby code
[2012-11-17 00:45:51 -0500] davidmz: I want the attribute to be changed during the convergence
[2012-11-17 00:46:19 -0500] davidmz: I understand that there are difference what get's evaluated when
[2012-11-17 00:47:45 -0500] yfeldblum: davidmz, you typically don't want to change node attributes during convergence; sometimes when people think they need to, there's another better way to accomplish the overarching goal
[2012-11-17 00:47:46 -0500] chip-: yfeldblum: I was afraid someone would say that.
[2012-11-17 00:48:09 -0500] yfeldblum: chip-, s/afraid/hoping/ <---- i fixed it for you
[2012-11-17 00:48:17 -0500] chip-: thereyoubrokeit
[2012-11-17 00:49:01 -0500] chip-: Not a fear, I can go call mysql
[2012-11-17 00:49:19 -0500] yfeldblum: chip-, yep, that's probably what you should do!
[2012-11-17 00:49:53 -0500] yfeldblum: davidmz, so what's the overall goal here?
[2012-11-17 00:50:21 -0500] davidmz: well I want to share the domain name of the node cross different parts of the recipe but I acquire the domain name using a script resource, how can I share it with other templates that I have, this is my problem, so I thought that I would set the attribute for a domain name at the beginning of the recipe
[2012-11-17 00:51:15 -0500] yfeldblum: davidmz, typically what chef wants you to do is figure out what the data should be up-front ... *all* the data ... *all the way* up front ...
[2012-11-17 00:51:31 -0500] yfeldblum: davidmz, in this case figure out what the domain name should be during the "compile phase"
[2012-11-17 00:51:45 -0500] davidmz: I can't do that
[2012-11-17 00:51:50 -0500] yfeldblum: davidmz, why's that?
[2012-11-17 00:51:54 -0500] davidmz: the domain name is set by reverse dns of the node
[2012-11-17 00:52:23 -0500] davidmz: I want the node to figure out his own domain to automate a process I have
[2012-11-17 00:53:30 -0500] yfeldblum: davidmz, you can write ruby code in your recipe to perform the PTR lookup at "compile time" and set the default-level node attribute
[2012-11-17 00:54:35 -0500] davidmz: does the compile happens on the node?
[2012-11-17 00:54:54 -0500] davidmz: I am not sure I know all the jargon, when does the scrip compiles
[2012-11-17 00:55:02 -0500] yfeldblum: davidmz, yes it does
[2012-11-17 00:55:43 -0500] davidmz: ok, thats great, so what is the difference
[2012-11-17 00:55:50 -0500] chip-: yfeldblum: It's just much less likely that I'll do something dumb like forget to close a connection or a result object if I use the DSL, so I was hoping to just do that.
[2012-11-17 00:55:59 -0500] davidmz: can you point me to something I can read to understand this
[2012-11-17 00:56:15 -0500] davidmz: I am sure I can get the hang of the idea on my own
[2012-11-17 00:57:06 -0500] yfeldblum: davidmz, probably something like this: http://pastie.org/private/ifgt5dbxfnrhvzhs00ogq
[2012-11-17 00:58:10 -0500] davidmz: the only thing that is run duing donvergence are resources
[2012-11-17 00:58:25 -0500] davidmz: everything else is evaluated on compile
[2012-11-17 00:58:32 -0500] davidmz: Is that so?
[2012-11-17 00:59:30 -0500] yfeldblum: davidmz, "compile time" is when chef runs the ruby code in your recipes ... but note that ruby code which declares resources (script resources, file resources, service resources) doesn't actually create the underlying things (doesn't shell out, doesn't write files, doesn't restart services)
[2012-11-17 00:59:54 -0500] yfeldblum: davidmz, after all the recipes are finished running, then chef loops over all of the resources that were declared in all the recipes and runs those resources
[2012-11-17 01:00:04 -0500] yfeldblum: davidmz, that second step is "convergence"
[2012-11-17 01:00:42 -0500] davidmz: ok
[2012-11-17 01:00:52 -0500] davidmz: thanks
[2012-11-17 01:01:14 -0500] yfeldblum: chip-, if you forget to close a connection, what's the worst that can happen?
[2012-11-17 01:01:33 -0500] yfeldblum: chip-, and if you use the block forms of things (if things support block forms) you won't even need to remember
[2012-11-17 01:04:20 -0500] chip-: yfeldblum: Eh, this query code really belongs in a provider, so it's nbd.

[2012-11-17 10:46:28 -0500] spheromak: davidmz:  use node[:platform_family] and node[:platform]  there are many examples of conditional execution based on platform in opscode cookbooks.

[2012-11-17 10:47:31 -0500] spheromak: set an attribute with an array of packages for each platform
[2012-11-17 10:47:37 -0500] spheromak: then you can just loop your array and setup those packages

[2012-11-17 11:08:33 -0500] htam: and ohai
[2012-11-17 11:08:49 -0500] htam: while ohai (from debian) depends on ruby-yajl
[2012-11-17 11:09:16 -0500] htam: and both packges provides the same file so apt refuses to go on
[2012-11-17 11:09:28 -0500] htam: any help ?
[2012-11-17 11:09:55 -0500] htam: I would be glad to open an issue ticket if it could help fix this issue

[2012-11-17 11:12:42 -0500] erikh: and fwiw, weekends and evenings US Pacific time are a pretty bad time to get ahold of anyone at opscode, since most of them aren't working at that time.

[2012-11-17 11:29:46 -0500] stephenking: i'm writing my first LWRP (for mysql database + user creation)
[2012-11-17 11:30:04 -0500] stephenking: and I want to generate a password for that user. how can I do that?
[2012-11-17 11:30:09 -0500] stephenking: ::Chef::Recipe.send(:include, Opscode::OpenSSL::Password)
[2012-11-17 11:30:10 -0500] stephenking: new_password = secure_password
[2012-11-17 11:30:23 -0500] stephenking: doesn't work.. no resource secure_password found.
[2012-11-17 11:44:36 -0500] aruntomar: stephenking: there's already a cookbook for what you are trying to do
[2012-11-17 11:44:48 -0500] stephenking: do you have names? :)
[2012-11-17 11:45:14 -0500] aruntomar: stephenking: it's name is database
[2012-11-17 11:45:41 -0500] stephenking: I have that one :)
[2012-11-17 11:46:01 -0500] stephenking: I want to automatically create a user and a database with the same name
[2012-11-17 11:46:11 -0500] stephenking: a LWRP to combine both of them (+ granting rights)
[2012-11-17 11:46:38 -0500] aruntomar: stephenking: oh, ok. then you'll have to write the lwrp
[2012-11-17 11:47:00 -0500] stephenking: I will have a look, if the database cookbook would also generate the password for me
[2012-11-17 11:48:57 -0500] stephenking: aruntomar: looks like it can't generate the password..
[2012-11-17 11:49:22 -0500] stephenking: do I have to generate it in the recipe or do you know a way to really do this in the provider?
[2012-11-17 11:50:14 -0500] aruntomar: stephenking: readme says it can create the user and grant the permissions as well along with the password
[2012-11-17 11:53:32 -0500] aruntomar: stephenking: check out the example https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/blob/master/database/README.md
[2012-11-17 11:54:41 -0500] stephenking: yes, thanks. I've been reading this. it always passes 'super_secret' as password
[2012-11-17 11:55:00 -0500] stephenking: nothing where mysql_database_user generates the password itself
[2012-11-17 11:55:53 -0500] aruntomar: stephenking: super_secret is just an example, you can replace it with whatever value you want
[2012-11-17 11:56:02 -0500] stephenking: I understand that ;)
[2012-11-17 11:56:08 -0500] eltigre: hey, does anybody here use vagrant with chef?
[2012-11-17 11:56:18 -0500] stephenking: aruntomar: and I want to create the replacement in my own LWRP
[2012-11-17 11:56:29 -0500] stephenking: so that I don't have to do it in the recipes
[2012-11-17 11:56:39 -0500] eltigre: I'm a beginner with both topics, and I like to customize the nginx configuration, but I don't even know what or where to modify that
[2012-11-17 11:56:41 -0500] stephenking: eltigre: of course, "everybody" does I think
[2012-11-17 11:57:06 -0500] aruntomar: stephenking: afaik, mysql uses md5 to encrypt passwd
[2012-11-17 11:57:31 -0500] eltigre: currently I have a vagrantfile that installs some recipes that I cloned from opscode
[2012-11-17 11:57:42 -0500] aruntomar: stephenking: so you could use openssl passwd -1 <your password to encrypt> and store it an a variable and use it
[2012-11-17 11:58:35 -0500] stephenking: aruntomar: I'd say this doesn't matter ;) my point is: I'm not a rubyist and I'd prefer to use the Opscode::OpenSSL library.. which seems to be not possible as it is in recipes. so I'd like to know, if I have to call the command line (like you just suggested) or if I can access the lib in another way
[2012-11-17 11:59:15 -0500] eltigre: I'm trying to figure this out by reasding tutorials, but it's probably too obvious
[2012-11-17 11:59:56 -0500] aruntomar: stephenking: i've not used the library. whenever i needed to hash the passwd, i just use the openssl command.
[2012-11-17 12:00:41 -0500] stephenking: aruntomar: isn't this a bit "unclean" :)
[2012-11-17 12:00:51 -0500] stephenking: it works, I'm sure.. (on *nix)
[2012-11-17 12:01:30 -0500] aruntomar: stephenking: that's the suggested method on opscode wiki, if you've to create a *nix user and to provide a password to it.
[2012-11-17 12:03:04 -0500] eltigre: stephenking, so, do you have any suggestion for me?
[2012-11-17 12:03:39 -0500] stephenking: okay, thanks aruntomar
[2012-11-17 12:03:53 -0500] stephenking: eltigre: what exactly do you want to change?
[2012-11-17 12:04:09 -0500] stephenking: read about attributes.. nginx cookbook provides you ways to modify settings
[2012-11-17 12:04:30 -0500] eltigre: stephenking, I need to configure nginx to serve static files under a certain directory, listen for an application server and put nginx behind haprox
[2012-11-17 12:04:31 -0500] eltigre: y
[2012-11-17 12:04:53 -0500] stephenking: have you read the README of the nginx cookbook
[2012-11-17 12:04:54 -0500] stephenking: ?
[2012-11-17 12:05:33 -0500] eltigre: stephenking, yes but this all means nothing to me
[2012-11-17 12:05:49 -0500] stephenking: you want to write a cookbook that places the vhost files there
[2012-11-17 12:05:49 -0500] eltigre: there are dozens of config options, but I have no clue where to set them
[2012-11-17 12:05:57 -0500] stephenking: and has the required config for the vhost
[2012-11-17 12:06:12 -0500] stephenking: but I fear you have to learn some of the chef basics first
[2012-11-17 12:06:54 -0500] aruntomar: stephenking: https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/blob/master/database/libraries/provider_database_mysql_user.rb
[2012-11-17 12:07:06 -0500] eltigre: yes, but what I don't understand is that vagrantfile says  chef.add_recipe "nginx"
[2012-11-17 12:07:21 -0500] aruntomar: stephenking: in the cookbook they are not hashing the password, it's being done by mysql server
[2012-11-17 12:07:28 -0500] eltigre: so where do I need to put the cookbook I need to write?
[2012-11-17 12:07:44 -0500] stephenking: eltigre: into a folder called site-cookbooks/
[2012-11-17 12:07:59 -0500] stephenking: and then you add that recipe "myapp" (or how you call it) also to the vagrant file
[2012-11-17 12:08:06 -0500] stephenking: that chef executes it
[2012-11-17 12:08:09 -0500] eltigre: ok
[2012-11-17 12:08:45 -0500] eltigre: so I would remove the add nginx line from vagrant file and replace it with my own nginx-test cookbook??
[2012-11-17 12:09:42 -0500] stephenking: create an additional cookbook
[2012-11-17 12:09:48 -0500] stephenking: that uses the nginx cookbook
[2012-11-17 12:10:27 -0500] eltigre: hm I guess that makes sense
[2012-11-17 12:18:20 -0500] eltigre: stephenking, first of all is there some json configuration file that vagrant uses?
[2012-11-17 12:23:41 -0500] stephenking: you can pass attributes using json file, yes
[2012-11-17 12:23:44 -0500] stephenking: but you don't need this
[2012-11-17 12:23:48 -0500] stephenking: you can also define them in roles
[2012-11-17 16:16:37 -0500] goutam: hi

[2012-11-17 16:24:21 -0500] goutam: hey maku66
[2012-11-17 20:09:04 -0500] corp: anyone using erchef?
[2012-11-17 20:44:22 -0500] ssd7: corp: A bit, run into a problem?
[2012-11-17 20:44:49 -0500] corp: ssd7: Just wondering if anyone is using it yet. Wondering how the various processes are supposed to be run
[2012-11-17 20:45:45 -0500] corp: since this is the direction chef server is going, I'd like to get a head start. Do you know if the current client is compatible with it?
[2012-11-17 20:54:55 -0500] ssd7: corp: It should be.  There could be a few bugs but the goal is to be completely compatible with the current client
[2012-11-17 20:56:32 -0500] corp: ssd7: do you just run it with erchef start?
[2012-11-17 20:57:14 -0500] corp: i'm trying to find an example app.json config
[2012-11-17 20:58:54 -0500] ssd7: corp: Are you using the preview deb or trying to install from source?
[2012-11-17 20:59:33 -0500] corp: ssd7: trying from source (on os X)
[2012-11-17 20:59:49 -0500] corp: it build successfully. when i try to start, it's looking for an app.config.
[2012-11-17 20:59:58 -0500] corp: didn't know there was a preview deb. where's that?
[2012-11-17 21:00:05 -0500] ssd7: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+11+Server+Preview
[2012-11-17 21:00:37 -0500] ssd7: corp: Probably a bit easier to get started with if you are just trying it out.
[2012-11-17 21:01:53 -0500] corp: aah, who knew
[2012-11-17 21:02:57 -0500] corp: i see theres a vagrant demo too. that should work
[2012-11-17 21:03:17 -0500] corp: i just have a huge chef install coming up, wondering if it would be a bad idea to try this out :)
[2012-11-17 21:04:25 -0500] siezer: can we PLEASE stop writing all cookbooks to debian and ubuntu
[2012-11-17 21:04:54 -0500] chip-: Is there a way to use cookbook attributes as defaults for the resource when building an lwrp?
[2012-11-17 21:14:15 -0500] corp: i see chef 11 'breaking changes' says cookbook default attributes override those from roles in chef 10, but not 11. this works for me in chef 10 (role takes precedence)
[2012-11-17 21:15:16 -0500] corp: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Breaking+Changes+in+Chef+11
[2012-11-17 21:15:19 -0500] corp: maybe this is old
[2012-11-17 21:18:29 -0500] siezer: corp attribtues set in a recipe used to override those set from a role
[2012-11-17 21:18:34 -0500] siezer: er, currently
[2012-11-17 21:19:06 -0500] corp: siezer: i don't see that happening. i have lots of default attributes in roles overriding cookbooks
[2012-11-17 21:19:06 -0500] siezer: chef < 11 : attributes file -> roles -> environments -> recipes
[2012-11-17 21:19:28 -0500] corp: ah, recipes, not attributes files
[2012-11-17 21:19:31 -0500] siezer: yep
[2012-11-17 21:19:45 -0500] siezer: you can node.set directly in the compile phase in a recipe
[2012-11-17 21:19:47 -0500] corp: i never do that anyway, so i wouldn't have noticed
[2012-11-17 21:20:34 -0500] siezer: word
[2012-11-17 23:09:44 -0500] RJ2: what's the best way to pull in some config from a remote service when the recipe runs? i have a recipe that installs and configures some software, but i want to install/config it multiple times, to different dirs, for different users, based on a database of users that isn't stored in chef (comes from db or webservice)
[2012-11-17 23:10:05 -0500] RJ2: since the list of users is subject to change, i want each chef run to just install it for any new users that were added
[2012-11-17 23:48:35 -0500] RJ2: i'd like to do it by dynamically updating a data bag from the recipe and using that.. but that requires i make the client an admin i think, which is a shame
