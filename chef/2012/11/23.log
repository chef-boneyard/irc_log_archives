[2012-11-23 03:27:56 -0500] linuxanoop: Hi All
[2012-11-23 06:58:51 -0500] BryanWB_: ohai chefs!
[2012-11-23 06:59:03 -0500] BryanWB_: this talk from elon musk is an absolute must http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/videos/view/211
[2012-11-23 07:06:55 -0500] jtimberman: BryanWB_: ohai!
[2012-11-23 07:07:13 -0500] BryanWB_: jtimberman: hey :), srsly that talk from elon musk is a must
[2012-11-23 07:07:20 -0500] jtimberman: BryanWB_: deos he say "stop using cucumber if you're a technical person writing integration tests"?
[2012-11-23 07:07:26 -0500] jtimberman: because someone needs to
[2012-11-23 07:07:29 -0500] BryanWB_: ha
[2012-11-23 07:07:49 -0500] BryanWB_: i would say that :), u shouldn't write cucumber for yourself, u write cucumber to communicate w/ others
[2012-11-23 07:08:00 -0500] BryanWB_: y u write cucucmber??
[2012-11-23 07:08:31 -0500] jtimberman: I didn't write cucumber. :)
[2012-11-23 07:08:41 -0500] jtimberman: Someone else did, I'm maintaining it.
[2012-11-23 07:08:46 -0500] BryanWB_: i c
[2012-11-23 07:10:20 -0500] BryanWB_: i keep having weird problem where i get "bad decrypt" accessing an encrypted data bag a few hours after creating it
[2012-11-23 07:12:24 -0500] BryanWB_: weird, only happens when i use "-s" instead of "--secret-file"
[2012-11-23 07:13:05 -0500] jtimberman: interesting
[2012-11-23 07:13:15 -0500] jtimberman: going to sleep now though, cheers!
[2012-11-23 07:13:35 -0500] BryanWB_: jtimberman: gnite
[2012-11-23 08:24:33 -0500] bmcgee: ohai
[2012-11-23 08:26:03 -0500] bmcgee: is there any handy solutions for automatically registering servers with rackspace's DNS?
[2012-11-23 09:07:43 -0500] Virunga: Hi, is it correct that in the execute declared resource there's a current directory instruction (cwd) whereas there isn't in the compiled resource, and why? Because i get an error and i think it didn't execute the command where i want.
[2012-11-23 09:10:32 -0500] Virunga: Oh god, i think i get it, maybe because the dir is obtained through ruby code executed at compile time...
[2012-11-23 10:27:42 -0500] Grainger: 'morning all .-)
[2012-11-23 10:28:06 -0500] Grainger: I've just discovered docs.opscode.com. Looks really promising!
[2012-11-23 11:18:36 -0500] masterkorp: hello
[2012-11-23 11:21:00 -0500] erikh: ohai
[2012-11-23 11:37:30 -0500] masterkorp: http://i.imgur.com/umqqQ.png
[2012-11-23 11:37:33 -0500] masterkorp: LOL
[2012-11-23 12:00:21 -0500] andreacampi: does anybody run chef-server with big couch?
[2012-11-23 12:00:48 -0500] andreacampi: how do you do it, build from source? the cloudant debs insist on uninstalling chef :(
[2012-11-23 12:03:05 -0500] erikh: it's probably deb that's insisting that, not the packages
[2012-11-23 12:03:11 -0500] erikh: you could try repackaging them
[2012-11-23 12:16:13 -0500] andreacampi: yeah bit silly though
[2012-11-23 12:16:31 -0500] andreacampi: I'll be happy when 11 gets rid of couchdb
[2012-11-23 12:40:36 -0500] gyre007: is there any way how I can load some cookbook's library in chef shell ie in shef ?
[2012-11-23 12:42:04 -0500] BryanWB_: gyre007: y
[2012-11-23 12:42:40 -0500] gyre007: just stepping through the recipe and want to run lib function from shef...obviously need to have that lib loaded
[2012-11-23 12:42:43 -0500] BryanWB_: include Chef::include Chef::Mixin::LanguageIncludeRecipe
[2012-11-23 12:42:56 -0500] BryanWB_: include Chef::Mixin::LanguageIncludeRecipe
[2012-11-23 12:42:57 -0500] gyre007: let me see :)
[2012-11-23 12:43:07 -0500] BryanWB_: then ,   `include_recipe "foo"`
[2012-11-23 12:43:38 -0500] gyre007: ok ill give it a go now
[2012-11-23 12:44:27 -0500] gyre007: heh got exception straight after the first include :(
[2012-11-23 12:44:37 -0500] gyre007: NoMethodError: private method `include' called for Chef:Class
[2012-11-23 12:49:34 -0500] gyre007: actually BryanWB_ it's failing on include_recipe ... https://gist.github.com/4135476
[2012-11-23 12:51:06 -0500] BryanWB_: gyre007: try getting into recipe context 1st
[2012-11-23 12:51:12 -0500] BryanWB_: shef> recipe
[2012-11-23 12:51:17 -0500] gyre007: ah ok
[2012-11-23 12:51:52 -0500] BryanWB_: but am not sure, always best to just embed pry,  `require 'pry';binding.pry` right into your recipe
[2012-11-23 12:53:01 -0500] masterkorp: BryanWB_: http://i.imgur.com/xesBzh.jpg
[2012-11-23 12:53:08 -0500] masterkorp: BryanWB_: the recipe to hapiness
[2012-11-23 12:53:26 -0500] erikh: wow
[2012-11-23 12:53:33 -0500] erikh: I uh
[2012-11-23 12:53:36 -0500] erikh: wow
[2012-11-23 12:54:32 -0500] erikh: I mean, I have an in-law that drives his riding lawn mower to family events so he can get tore up and go back home without getting a DUI
[2012-11-23 12:54:54 -0500] erikh: but that's ... that's not even in the same category
[2012-11-23 12:55:05 -0500] masterkorp: that is genius
[2012-11-23 12:55:13 -0500] erikh: that's not quite how I'd phrase it
[2012-11-23 12:55:19 -0500] erikh: but it definitely is interesting
[2012-11-23 12:55:25 -0500] masterkorp: i must adopt that techinque
[2012-11-23 12:57:20 -0500] masterkorp: here people ride animals
[2012-11-23 12:57:36 -0500] masterkorp: you cant get ticket if you're riding animals
[2012-11-23 12:58:17 -0500] masterkorp: You often see a donkey with a man layed on top he is so drunk that he cant stay on top of it
[2012-11-23 12:58:31 -0500] masterkorp: the donkey knows the way home by himself
[2012-11-23 12:58:49 -0500] masterkorp: so his friends just tie him to the donkey and he goes home
[2012-11-23 12:58:52 -0500] masterkorp: genius
[2012-11-23 13:00:31 -0500] erikh: haha
[2012-11-23 13:00:37 -0500] erikh: ok, that is pretty damned awesome.
[2012-11-23 13:02:07 -0500] masterkorp: The animal must not be "towing" any veihile
[2012-11-23 13:02:18 -0500] masterkorp: then you can get ticket :p
[2012-11-23 13:03:23 -0500] erikh: haha
[2012-11-23 13:03:31 -0500] erikh: laws are so silly sometimes.
[2012-11-23 13:04:14 -0500] masterkorp: s/sometimes/most of the times/
[2012-11-23 13:11:10 -0500] jeekl: what emacs mode are you guys using for editing chef erb templates? Just something with some highlighting would be nice. Rinari the only way to go?
[2012-11-23 13:11:31 -0500] masterkorp: vim mode :p
[2012-11-23 13:11:48 -0500] masterkorp: jeekl: well you can just set the hl
[2012-11-23 13:12:01 -0500] masterkorp: either on the file, or your config
[2012-11-23 13:12:11 -0500] masterkorp: give it ruby hl and should be good
[2012-11-23 13:13:16 -0500] jeekl: masterkorp: that's what I'm doing right now, and it semi-works, but the highlighting kinda freaks out way too often. :-)
[2012-11-23 13:13:35 -0500] masterkorp: well sorry, works on my vim :p
[2012-11-23 13:13:47 -0500] BryanWB_: jeekl: damn i should be using something for my emacs setup but dunno
[2012-11-23 13:13:59 -0500] jeekl: hmm... maybe if I run vim from within emacs...
[2012-11-23 13:14:31 -0500] masterkorp: emacs is a good operative system, it only lacks a proper text editor
[2012-11-23 13:14:47 -0500] BryanWB_: but what an operating system!
[2012-11-23 13:14:54 -0500] Mithrandir: however, it is quite good at telling jokes, unlike lots of people.
[2012-11-23 13:14:56 -0500] masterkorp: indeed
[2012-11-23 13:15:22 -0500] gyre007: BryanWB_: that worked like charm ! THanks for the hint about shef ! :)
[2012-11-23 13:15:34 -0500] BryanWB_: gyre007: np
[2012-11-23 13:17:16 -0500] jeekl: BryanWB_: http://imgur.com/nQzZc ruby mode kind of chokes on alot of our templates in ruby-mode. (yeah, shouldn't put that much logic in a template, I know...)
[2012-11-23 13:18:43 -0500] erikh: jeekl: you can probably find a erb or eruby mode
[2012-11-23 13:18:47 -0500] erikh: check emacswiki
[2012-11-23 13:19:03 -0500] erikh: if you want to get really involved, check out mmm which can mix and match major modes
[2012-11-23 13:19:17 -0500] erikh: nice for doing javascript and html, etc.
[2012-11-23 13:20:21 -0500] jeekl: erikh: I still have nightmares from nxhtml that uses mmm-mode ;-)
[2012-11-23 13:20:54 -0500] erikh: hehe
[2012-11-23 13:20:58 -0500] erikh: well, it's an option I guess
[2012-11-23 13:21:26 -0500] jeekl: Yeah. I think that's what rinari uses If I'm not misstaken
[2012-11-23 13:21:38 -0500] jeekl: cool, I'll do some more digging then. thanks!
[2012-11-23 13:21:47 -0500] erikh: oog
[2012-11-23 13:21:49 -0500] erikh: http://emacswiki.org/emacs/RubyOnRails
[2012-11-23 13:21:53 -0500] erikh: outlook is not good
[2012-11-23 13:22:03 -0500] erikh: (it covers ERB near the top)
[2012-11-23 13:22:23 -0500] erikh: it's basically saying to do mmm with ruby-mode in the erb delimiters
[2012-11-23 13:22:30 -0500] erikh: which makes total sense, but is less than trivial to get going.
[2012-11-23 13:30:58 -0500] maruq: hey guys
[2012-11-23 13:31:13 -0500] maruq: just wondering what the general opinion on naming environments is?
[2012-11-23 13:31:47 -0500] maruq: do most people go with production, staging, dev, or do you name after git branch eg. fix/postgres
[2012-11-23 13:33:19 -0500] masterkorp: it depends on developing workflow
[2012-11-23 13:39:12 -0500] maruq: masterkorp: hmm okay.
[2012-11-23 13:39:41 -0500] maruq: knife environment delete will completely wipeout the environment (cookbooks, data, nodes) ?
[2012-11-23 13:40:00 -0500] maruq: well, not kill the nodes, but they won't get the updates?
[2012-11-23 13:40:31 -0500] maruq: if so, git branches probably make more sense - then devs can just destroy the envs when done
[2012-11-23 13:48:57 -0500] maruq: does an environment fall back to _default if it can't find something?
[2012-11-23 13:49:36 -0500] maruq: just created a new env, booted a server in the env & for some reason it can find cookbooks (i never uploaded to that env)
[2012-11-23 13:49:45 -0500] maruq: or am I misunderstanding things?
[2012-11-23 13:53:12 -0500] zts: maruq: environments do not contain cookbooks - they just (optionally) say which version of a cookbook should be used in that environment
[2012-11-23 13:53:53 -0500] zts: maruq: if an environment doesn't have a version constraint for a particular cookbook, it will just use the most recent version
[2012-11-23 13:54:11 -0500] maruq: ah, so what if coworker & I both want to develop the cookbook at the same time?
[2012-11-23 13:54:25 -0500] maruq: do we use different version ids?
[2012-11-23 13:54:49 -0500] zts: yeah, if you're both loading your work-in-progress to the same chef server for testing, you'll need to use different version IDs
[2012-11-23 13:55:05 -0500] maruq: I know generally you should develop using chef-solo & vagrant, but some stuff (eg. ec2, node lookups, etc) don't quite work unless uploaded to server
[2012-11-23 13:55:20 -0500] zts: maruq: if you haven't seen it, I'd highly recommend watching this presentation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSnJCJiZDDU&noredirect=1
[2012-11-23 13:55:40 -0500] maruq: zts: ah awesome
[2012-11-23 13:56:05 -0500] zts: it's not all about that exact problem (two people developing the same cookbook), but is all lessons that Etsy have learned about using Chef
[2012-11-23 13:56:38 -0500] maruq: zts: yeah, etsy do some awesome stuff in that space. hadn't seen the presentation yet.
[2012-11-23 13:56:50 -0500] maruq: I'll give that a bash for 30mins or so ;)
[2012-11-23 13:56:54 -0500] zts: cool :)
[2012-11-23 13:56:56 -0500] maruq: thanks
[2012-11-23 13:57:02 -0500] zts: no problem
[2012-11-23 14:01:55 -0500] andreacampi: in all this time running Chef this is the first time I try to set it up fully clustered and oh boy, it's a PITA
[2012-11-23 14:02:05 -0500] andreacampi: the Chef server that is
[2012-11-23 14:02:20 -0500] masterkorp: andreacampi: the deb way is easy
[2012-11-23 14:02:55 -0500] andreacampi: is there a deb for a clustered couchdb, dbdb, pacemaker and all?
[2012-11-23 14:03:14 -0500] maruq: anderacampi: yeah, installing from ubuntu's apt repo is pretty straight-forward. set your hostname first & you should be good
[2012-11-23 14:03:38 -0500] masterkorp: andreacampi: why not couchdb ?
[2012-11-23 14:04:02 -0500] masterkorp: do you have on another server ?
[2012-11-23 14:04:15 -0500] masterkorp: i have a couchdb just for chef
[2012-11-23 14:04:23 -0500] andreacampi: serverS, I need sub-second failover in case a server crashes
[2012-11-23 14:05:12 -0500] masterkorp: that share the same couch ?
[2012-11-23 14:05:41 -0500] andreacampi: the same *cluster* of at least 2 couchdb servers, yes
[2012-11-23 14:06:18 -0500] andreacampi: and that's just one part. chef server also stores stuff in files, hence drbd
[2012-11-23 14:06:42 -0500] andreacampi: also, I don't want a load balancer in front, so I'm planning to use pacemaker to migrate a cluster IP address for chef-server
[2012-11-23 14:07:20 -0500] andreacampi: there is a howto for private chef
[2012-11-23 14:10:51 -0500] yfeldblum: andreacampi, just use mongodb - it's web scale
[2012-11-23 14:11:06 -0500] andreacampi: mongodb for chef-server?!
[2012-11-23 14:11:22 -0500] masterkorp: yfeldblum: wait, can we use that ??
[2012-11-23 14:11:24 -0500] andreacampi: since when, I thought chef-server depended on couchdb
[2012-11-23 14:11:31 -0500] masterkorp: doc/link please
[2012-11-23 14:12:10 -0500] andreacampi: even erchef is mysql / postgresql AFAIK
[2012-11-23 14:12:47 -0500] masterkorp: well postgresql all the way for me :)
[2012-11-23 14:13:18 -0500] andreacampi: masterkorp me too
[2012-11-23 14:13:46 -0500] masterkorp: i would trade coucf
[2012-11-23 14:13:59 -0500] masterkorp: *couchdb by mongo if possivle
[2012-11-23 14:15:17 -0500] andreacampi: masterkorp I think "yfeldblum headdesk" means he realized he misunderstood the question ;)
[2012-11-23 14:15:51 -0500] andreacampi: I too wish we could use mongodb 
[2012-11-23 14:16:06 -0500] andreacampi: either way, my customer can't wait for erchef, so couchdb it is, for now
[2012-11-23 14:16:13 -0500] andreacampi: either that or they buy private chef ;)
[2012-11-23 14:25:30 -0500] masterkorp: oh :(
[2012-11-23 15:00:49 -0500] BryanWB_: man, i m slow, it is taking me a while to figure out how to use mocks and stubs to test chef source
[2012-11-23 15:02:01 -0500] df11: hi fellow chefs, having an issue with the execute resource not running a command.  tried both the creates and not_if attributes and both are not working.  running with debug options doesn't point to anything, just says ran successfully.  tried running shef with tracing but it is a bit hard to tell where it is at in the output (a bit too verbose).  small pastie here if anyone has a sec: http://pastie.org/5423413
[2012-11-23 15:04:35 -0500] gyre007: df11: does that file already exist ?
[2012-11-23 15:04:54 -0500] gyre007: if it does then chef will not run the resource
[2012-11-23 15:05:00 -0500] df11: gyre007: yes, ah, you know what, both are corrupted!  good call, thanks.
[2012-11-23 15:05:11 -0500] df11: adding a sha/md5 check on it.
[2012-11-23 15:31:26 -0500] frank_: hi all
[2012-11-23 15:31:38 -0500] frank_: is there a way to prevent chef-client from saving the runlist the server?
[2012-11-23 15:32:27 -0500] frank_: eg: want to run chef-client with very specific runlist, but not save that enw runlist
[2012-11-23 15:36:41 -0500] zts: frank_: you may want the --override-runlist option
[2012-11-23 15:37:50 -0500] zts: frank_: chef-client will run once with the runlist you set with that option, but it won't change the default.
[2012-11-23 15:49:47 -0500] Virunga: Could you help with this weird error? http://ideone.com/eiJUo6
[2012-11-23 15:51:07 -0500] Virunga: Oh...
[2012-11-23 15:51:33 -0500] Virunga: So block do is mandatory .
[2012-11-23 15:52:52 -0500] frank_: zts: oh great. i assumed that saved as well
[2012-11-23 15:59:54 -0500] zts: frank_: it does record it, and a timestamp, somewhere on the node (from memory, node.override_runlists) so you have a record, but it'll definitely leave the default one alone
[2012-11-23 16:01:41 -0500] Xiol: hello guys, I'm getting a syntax error when using the chef-client cookbook straight from git on a CentOS 6 node running Rub 1.8.7 - ...service.rb:87: syntax,error unexpected ')'
[2012-11-23 16:02:28 -0500] Xiol: The code at that line looks sensible enough, but i'm not completely up to scratch with ruby yet to be 100% sure. as it's from the chef site i suspect it's valid though
[2012-11-23 16:03:16 -0500] Xiol: the offending line is https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-client/blob/master/recipes/service.rb#L87
[2012-11-23 16:03:20 -0500] slivabox: hi everybody
[2012-11-23 16:07:23 -0500] slivabox: i'm wondering is there a way to automatic delete user's account which was created with http://pastebin.com/4aUbyNXt
[2012-11-23 16:07:46 -0500] slivabox: I mean if I add such code to some recipe account will be created
[2012-11-23 16:08:19 -0500] slivabox: but how to delete this account after this was removed from recipe
[2012-11-23 16:08:25 -0500] tknerr: ohai!
[2012-11-23 16:09:13 -0500] tknerr: anybody an idea how to encrypt a databag locally (i.e. in a chef_solo/vagrant setup)?
[2012-11-23 16:09:44 -0500] tknerr: i'm writing a recipe which reads from an encrypted databag
[2012-11-23 16:10:06 -0500] tknerr: now i'm trying to create a databag for testing
[2012-11-23 16:10:25 -0500] tknerr: but i don't know how to encrypt it :-/
[2012-11-23 16:11:05 -0500] tknerr: with chef server i would do `knife data bad edit bag item --secret-file <secret>`
[2012-11-23 16:11:19 -0500] tknerr: but how would i do that without chef server?!?
[2012-11-23 16:12:12 -0500] maxmanders: Various methods for storing data for Chef, attributes with various specificities, data bags, encrypted data bags... Can anyone suggest best practice about when to choose one data store over another?
[2012-11-23 16:12:51 -0500] frank_: is there a way to reload ohai data in a run?
[2012-11-23 16:13:18 -0500] frank_: eg: create a user during and then have node[:etc][:passwd] correct later on
[2012-11-23 16:14:46 -0500] frank_: it seems ohai reload does that
[2012-11-23 16:14:46 -0500] masterkorp: frank_: wow, you want to set the passwd of a user ???
[2012-11-23 16:15:07 -0500] masterkorp: frank_: just have the users cookbook and use ssh keys
[2012-11-23 16:15:32 -0500] frank_: masterkorp: no, [:etc][:passwd] gives you info that's in /etc/passwd (eg homedir, weather a user exists etc)
[2012-11-23 16:16:24 -0500] masterkorp: what's the final propose ?
[2012-11-23 16:17:22 -0500] frank_: during one run: create a user + execute some stuff if that users exists lateron
[2012-11-23 16:18:06 -0500] masterkorp: why do you check if the users exists ?
[2012-11-23 16:22:25 -0500] yfeldblum: andreacampi, it might be more cost-effective to spring for private-chef
[2012-11-23 16:32:11 -0500] andreacampi: yfeldblum probably :) that would be my favorite outcome, actually
[2012-11-23 16:32:34 -0500] yfeldblum: andreacampi, on the other hand, it might be more fun to NIH
[2012-11-23 16:33:10 -0500] andreacampi: that said, I just performed a failover of chef-server and solr, mere seconds after adding a node and search shows the new node on the other server too :)
[2012-11-23 16:33:39 -0500] yfeldblum: andreacampi, you could build your own multitenant chef-server in nodejs and back it with cassandra
[2012-11-23 16:33:46 -0500] andreacampi: now I just have to find the courage to kill one of the nodes in bigcouch cluster and see how *that* one holds up
[2012-11-23 16:34:09 -0500] andreacampi: ha. that sounds like plenty of fun and a hell of a lot of work
[2012-11-23 16:35:57 -0500] zts: Xiol: I suspect the problem is the comma at the end of the line before the )  (it shouldn't be there)
[2012-11-23 17:02:00 -0500] masterkorp: Can i have an LWRP attribute that can take a bool and an integer [0,1] values ?
[2012-11-23 17:02:08 -0500] masterkorp: s/and/or
[2012-11-23 17:02:23 -0500] julian: Hey guys, I am trying to set a variable in a chef recipe from inside a ruby_block.  Is this possible?
[2012-11-23 17:02:33 -0500] yfeldblum: masterkorp, lightweight resources are *just normal ruby classes* and you can do whatever you like with them
[2012-11-23 17:02:52 -0500] yfeldblum: julian, no
[2012-11-23 17:03:18 -0500] masterkorp: yfeldblum: yeah, can the kind_of be Boolen or Integer ?
[2012-11-23 17:05:13 -0500] yfeldblum: masterkorp, maybe; but you don't need to use the `:kind_of =>` and you don't need to use the #attribute method to declare an attribute
[2012-11-23 17:06:30 -0500] masterkorp: Well, i wanted if possible, just for readability
[2012-11-23 17:10:37 -0500] yfeldblum: masterkorp, yes you can do `:kind_of => [TrueClass, FalseClass, Integer]`
[2012-11-23 17:10:44 -0500] yfeldblum: masterkorp, https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/resource/directory.rb#L51
[2012-11-23 17:11:39 -0500] masterkorp: what does that mean ?
[2012-11-23 17:12:16 -0500] yfeldblum: masterkorp, what does what mean?
[2012-11-23 17:12:25 -0500] masterkorp: oh, its Boolean ?
[2012-11-23 17:12:40 -0500] masterkorp: TrueClass/FalseClass
[2012-11-23 17:13:10 -0500] yfeldblum: masterkorp, `true` is an instance of the class `TrueClass` and `false` is an instance of the class `FalseClass`
[2012-11-23 17:16:01 -0500] masterkorp: why can't it just be [ Boolean, Integer ] ?
[2012-11-23 17:16:57 -0500] yfeldblum: masterkorp, because that would be wishful thinking, where you wish for something and then ask why you can't do it
[2012-11-23 17:17:03 -0500] yfeldblum: masterkorp, there is no class Boolean
[2012-11-23 17:17:18 -0500] yfeldblum: masterkorp, in Ruby, there is TrueClass and there is FalseClass
[2012-11-23 17:17:45 -0500] masterkorp: yfeldblum: oh sorry, my C++ head is oversteping this one
[2012-11-23 17:17:54 -0500] masterkorp: did not know that about ruby
[2012-11-23 17:19:18 -0500] yfeldblum: masterkorp, and nil is an instance of class NilClass
[2012-11-23 17:36:10 -0500] frank_: hmmm ohai reload doesn't work in a ruby_block?
[2012-11-23 17:39:56 -0500] gyre007: Im calling Chef::log () in a cookbook library but it looks like the lib cant recognize it...is there any way to log anything from within cookbook library ?
[2012-11-23 17:42:41 -0500] yfeldblum: gyre007, Chef::Log.info("my string") or Chef::Log.debug("my string")
[2012-11-23 17:46:52 -0500] gyre007: cheers yfeldblum
[2012-11-23 18:16:43 -0500] jtimberman: frank_: using the ohai resource? no, it should be a resource on its own in the recipe.
[2012-11-23 18:23:19 -0500] breckognize: Could someone please explain/point me to documentation about how attributes are merged in the event that two roles define conflicting attributes?
[2012-11-23 18:26:28 -0500] frank_: jtimberman: can you give quick example? i have recipeA that creates a user and want to do a "  next unless node[:etc][:passwd][vhost["user"]]
[2012-11-23 18:26:35 -0500] frank_: in recipeB
[2012-11-23 18:27:21 -0500] frank_: but I can't seem to reload enough of ohai to get node[:etc][=passwd] filled again
[2012-11-23 18:29:58 -0500] davidmz: Will the Directory :create action override a folder that is already exists
[2012-11-23 18:38:43 -0500] jtimberman: frank_: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_ohai.html
[2012-11-23 18:38:56 -0500] jtimberman: that includes an example of a new user :)
[2012-11-23 19:42:20 -0500] ssd7_: Ohai Chefs!
[2012-11-23 20:03:20 -0500] jtimberman: ssd7: ohai!
[2012-11-23 20:04:41 -0500] ssd7: How's it going jtimberman?
[2012-11-23 20:05:06 -0500] jtimberman: ssd7: decent, things considering.
[2012-11-23 20:06:11 -0500] jtimberman: ssd7: wondering why, when chef-client runs in runit on this system, ipaddress is nil
[2012-11-23 20:06:49 -0500] jtimberman: but it works fine when i run it from the commandline.
[2012-11-23 20:07:04 -0500] ssd7: jtimberman: Hrmmm. That is pretty odd.
[2012-11-23 20:08:23 -0500] jtimberman: i wonder if its fucking dash.
[2012-11-23 20:08:29 -0500] jtimberman: /bin/sh being dash
[2012-11-23 20:09:49 -0500] yfeldblum: jtimberman, then i guess it's time to back to running your infrastructure from a collection of bash scripts
[2012-11-23 20:11:36 -0500] ssd7: jtimberman: Is it jus the ipaddress attribute that is wrong?  That is, is the network attribute otherwise properly populated?
[2012-11-23 20:13:12 -0500] jtimberman: ssd7: I haven't investigated that far.
[2012-11-23 20:13:41 -0500] jtimberman: ssd7: its failing in the djbdns attributes file which does a split on node['ipaddress'], and since that's nil, it fails the run, and doesn't save the node data.
[2012-11-23 20:13:59 -0500] jtimberman: my other node using the exact same cookbook is fine O.o
[2012-11-23 20:15:27 -0500] ssd7: jtimberman: I see. Unfortunately the ohai networking plugins have reached a level of complexity where it is hard to just skim the code and say "Oh maybe it's this!"
[2012-11-23 20:15:50 -0500] jtimberman: ssd7: Right.
[2012-11-23 20:16:17 -0500] jtimberman: ssd7: And its not really ohai's fault that network device and informatin discovery is a fucking shitshow on every platform :)
[2012-11-23 20:16:34 -0500] jtimberman: they all have different tools with different output.
[2012-11-23 20:16:52 -0500] ssd7: Yup.
[2012-11-23 20:35:09 -0500] jtimberman: sweet, seems to be working with --fork
[2012-11-23 21:06:12 -0500] rtl: :tabnew
[2012-11-23 21:06:15 -0500] rtl: erp.
[2012-11-23 21:28:22 -0500] rtl: erp.
[2012-11-23 21:43:13 -0500] frank_: jtimberman: thanks. so trick is to put everything that needs the "refreshed" node[:etc][:passwd] in a ruby_block then
[2012-11-23 22:43:25 -0500] carlw2_: hi all, I've got a question about Berkshelf and accessing it from ruby rather then the cli. When I call it from ruby it installs any package that has a git url but any other package it complains that it can't find it.
