[2012-11-03 00:39:12 -0400] Majost: I am not sure what is wrong with this statement: current_checksum = IO.read("#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/myfile.war.sha1")
[2012-11-03 00:39:21 -0400] Majost: but chef doesn't seem to like it
[2012-11-03 00:44:07 -0400] gchristensen: Majost: try assigning Chef::Config[:file_cache_path] to a local variable and passing that in?
[2012-11-03 00:44:10 -0400] erkules: in which way does chef rely on the versioning feature of couchdb?
[2012-11-03 00:49:41 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, understanding how couchdb exists might help better solidfy that
[2012-11-03 00:49:50 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, but also keep in mind couchdb is short of being gone
[2012-11-03 00:49:58 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, chef 11 uses sql
[2012-11-03 00:51:58 -0400] erkules: hoover_damm: oha! that sounds great
[2012-11-03 00:52:52 -0400] erkules: but how does couchdb exists?
[2012-11-03 00:53:22 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, couchdb versions the document... and when you compact you only keep the last version
[2012-11-03 00:53:48 -0400] erkules: hoover_damm: ahh ok thats I know. I was wondering if chef uses that feature
[2012-11-03 00:54:15 -0400] erkules: coze it **** on performance
[2012-11-03 00:54:31 -0400] thom: Majost: when you say "chef doesn't seem to like it" it'd be helpful to see the exact error
[2012-11-03 00:54:56 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, in scaling chef that's one of the small issues
[2012-11-03 00:56:12 -0400] erkules: hakunin: thats my approach to the problems, as Im used to be a dba:) So sql sounds great. Any special backend in mind or will it a genric aproach?
[2012-11-03 00:56:20 -0400] erkules: hoover_damm: ^^
[2012-11-03 00:56:46 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, feel free to take a look at the chef 11 virtualbox test drive
[2012-11-03 00:56:59 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/08/31/test-drive-the-chef-11-server-preview/
[2012-11-03 00:57:02 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, there is no webui
[2012-11-03 00:57:36 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, stores cookbooks in bookshelf (github.com/opscode/bookshelf)
[2012-11-03 00:57:47 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, uses postgres, and it has the new omnibus server install :)
[2012-11-03 00:58:13 -0400] hoover_damm: so the end users don't have to suffer so much on dependencies
[2012-11-03 00:59:45 -0400] erkules: hehe they all head to postgres
[2012-11-03 00:59:58 -0400] hoover_damm: yes
[2012-11-03 01:00:02 -0400] hoover_damm: postgres is the safest path
[2012-11-03 01:00:28 -0400] hoover_damm: your perfectly welcome to replace postgres with mysql (i believe)
[2012-11-03 01:00:34 -0400] erkules: great
[2012-11-03 01:00:50 -0400] hoover_damm: as it's sql unless it's using syntax that mysql can't cope with
[2012-11-03 01:00:52 -0400] hoover_damm: you should be fine
[2012-11-03 01:01:30 -0400] hoover_damm: I wonder if mysql vs postgresql is more of a marketing thing at this point
[2012-11-03 01:01:34 -0400] hoover_damm: then technological reasons
[2012-11-03 01:02:14 -0400] erkules: depends ..
[2012-11-03 01:04:40 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, basically i've pushed mysql and postgres equally as far... and basically other then the people who care about the scheduler
[2012-11-03 01:04:59 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, they are both good database servers that can provide rock solid performance regardless of what your inner opinion is
[2012-11-03 01:06:08 -0400] hoover_damm: I know the rails community has pretty much given the bird to mysql and told everyone to move over to postgresql
[2012-11-03 01:06:19 -0400] hoover_damm: but I always find those to be opinions
[2012-11-03 01:06:21 -0400] hoover_damm: not facts
[2012-11-03 01:06:58 -0400] gchristensen: one big concern on mysql is Oracle's intentions with it. there are good forks of it though, so nothing too drastic could happen.
[2012-11-03 01:07:04 -0400] erkules: that explains it
[2012-11-03 01:08:14 -0400] erkules: the bad thing with oraggle is there doing a damn good job on MySQL. That makes it harder for i.e. MariaDB :/
[2012-11-03 01:09:05 -0400] gchristensen: not really... MySQL did a great job with it :) Sun did a fairly okay job with it, and now Oracle has stopped giving proper changelogs and providing new tests which used to get shipped with it.
[2012-11-03 01:09:17 -0400] gchristensen: they just haven't mucked it up too much yet
[2012-11-03 01:09:56 -0400] gchristensen: (I reckon that's just my humble opinion)
[2012-11-03 01:10:07 -0400] hoover_damm: gchristensen, others would share your opinion
[2012-11-03 01:10:25 -0400] hoover_damm: gchristensen, the first release with a security update without any information to what it fixes, or what the security hole was..
[2012-11-03 01:10:32 -0400] hoover_damm: gchristensen, pretty much put most people over the edge
[2012-11-03 01:10:40 -0400] gchristensen: yeah. scary times :/
[2012-11-03 01:11:22 -0400] erkules: ack, technically 5.6 is going to be great. Especially regarding InnoDB and replication
[2012-11-03 01:11:42 -0400] erkules: you gonna find all that features in MariaDB 10 anyway ;)
[2012-11-03 01:11:55 -0400] gchristensen: I hope so :P we still need MySQL
[2012-11-03 01:12:02 -0400] gchristensen: its not going to be a great time moving away
[2012-11-03 01:12:31 -0400] erkules: MySQL still rocks. Especially Galera
[2012-11-03 01:12:39 -0400] gchristensen: yeah it does
[2012-11-03 01:13:19 -0400] erkules: ok erlang@ubuntu 12.04 is too old to compile then
[2012-11-03 01:13:54 -0400] hoover_damm: use esl
[2012-11-03 01:14:03 -0400] erkules: esl?
[2012-11-03 01:14:10 -0400] hoover_damm: https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp
[2012-11-03 01:14:20 -0400] hoover_damm: i can provide a diff of our erlang cookbook if you want
[2012-11-03 01:14:24 -0400] hoover_damm: it's just a ppa
[2012-11-03 01:14:31 -0400] erkules: ahh ok thx
[2012-11-03 01:14:33 -0400] hoover_damm: provides the latest and greatest erlang with only the hipe flag
[2012-11-03 01:14:36 -0400] hoover_damm: so nothing too janky
[2012-11-03 01:15:28 -0400] hoover_damm: https://gist.github.com/5eea007584cda4e4b60f
[2012-11-03 01:15:36 -0400] hoover_damm: last i checked that worked
[2012-11-03 01:20:38 -0400] erkules: hoover_damm: Im not into chef :) Im having a look at it. And recognising chef uses couchdb I was asking :)
[2012-11-03 01:21:42 -0400] hoover_damm: ah
[2012-11-03 01:21:49 -0400] hoover_damm: if your into chef why are you here?
[2012-11-03 01:22:15 -0400] erkules: to learn and use
[2012-11-03 01:22:56 -0400] hoover_damm: I earned that answer I guess... :/ I need to stop asking dumb questions
[2012-11-03 01:23:05 -0400] erkules: :)
[2012-11-03 01:24:51 -0400] erkules: We are thinking about configuration management. We need it! And now Im allowed to play with different tools to get an idea which to use.
[2012-11-03 01:29:23 -0400] hoover_damm: sounds dangerously fun
[2012-11-03 01:33:12 -0400] erkules: it is and I was hoping to have couchdb as showstopper, to make decision  easier. But fail! :)
[2012-11-03 01:33:46 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, i think honestly with the way CM is now... it's also more of testing it
[2012-11-03 01:33:53 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, so how you test your changes and deploy them
[2012-11-03 01:34:35 -0400] erkules: hoover_damm: better not tell
[2012-11-03 01:35:44 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, why? it's a proper evolution from hitting enter and praying it works
[2012-11-03 01:36:30 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, it's the evolution of systems engineering to an art form
[2012-11-03 01:38:20 -0400] erkules: hoover_damm: it is not that big of an issue. I do packaging and ssh.
[2012-11-03 01:39:13 -0400] erkules: and weve got (too much) things in fai
[2012-11-03 01:39:20 -0400] hoover_damm: poor thing
[2012-11-03 01:39:21 -0400] hoover_damm: fai
[2012-11-03 01:39:54 -0400] erkules: similar to crowbar
[2012-11-03 01:39:59 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, give yourself a year and you'll see the point
[2012-11-03 01:40:04 -0400] hoover_damm: i have experience with fai
[2012-11-03 01:40:05 -0400] erkules: but this is setting up and no configuration
[2012-11-03 01:40:12 -0400] hoover_damm: well sure it does
[2012-11-03 01:40:13 -0400] erkules: oh ok
[2012-11-03 01:40:16 -0400] hoover_damm: if you want a copy of the server
[2012-11-03 01:40:17 -0400] hoover_damm: LOL
[2012-11-03 01:40:21 -0400] erkules: :)
[2012-11-03 01:40:36 -0400] hoover_damm: fai is provisioning
[2012-11-03 01:40:41 -0400] erkules: ack
[2012-11-03 01:41:04 -0400] hoover_damm: as you split the hairs the engineering hair
[2012-11-03 01:41:20 -0400] hoover_damm: you can subdivide a lot of the mundane duties we do into categories and subcategories
[2012-11-03 01:41:21 -0400] erkules: but having fai you got the freedom to choose what to use for configuration management
[2012-11-03 01:41:32 -0400] hoover_damm: trying to find tools or people to specialize in those
[2012-11-03 01:41:36 -0400] erkules: opposite to crowbar :)
[2012-11-03 01:41:49 -0400] hoover_damm: yeah i've opted out of of provisioning management due to that issue
[2012-11-03 01:42:03 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm pure pxe with a rest endpoint to do a little love
[2012-11-03 01:42:18 -0400] hoover_damm: kind of painful on scale
[2012-11-03 01:42:32 -0400] hoover_damm: so I need to hire someone to either take my duties, or hire someone to create something
[2012-11-03 01:42:37 -0400] hoover_damm: lol
[2012-11-03 01:42:41 -0400] erkules: :)
[2012-11-03 01:42:57 -0400] hoover_damm: because basically everything coming out currently is sexy, but way too opininated for me
[2012-11-03 01:43:33 -0400] hoover_damm: if you don't host on x, don't use xen, don't use this
[2012-11-03 01:43:37 -0400] erkules: yeah Im a dba in first place but there is too much to play with
[2012-11-03 01:43:44 -0400] hoover_damm: and I think to myself god... how much would I have to rip out
[2012-11-03 01:43:46 -0400] hoover_damm: to make this work?
[2012-11-03 01:45:10 -0400] erkules: another question. Does chef protokoll changes. I.e. I define a file and the file was changed? some kind of compliance thing?
[2012-11-03 01:47:40 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, like paper trail compliance?
[2012-11-03 01:49:18 -0400] erkules: hoover_damm: don't know that wording
[2012-11-03 01:50:04 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, if you define file "/bob" do content "foo" end
[2012-11-03 01:50:27 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, it will write to /bob with the content of foo... now is your goal for compliance to know of said change?
[2012-11-03 01:51:22 -0400] erkules: yeah I would like to know if in the next run the content was changed
[2012-11-03 01:51:43 -0400] erkules: as I told we do a lot of ssh
[2012-11-03 01:51:46 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, well there is a report handler that does report the changes
[2012-11-03 01:51:57 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, you could configure that report handler to write to something else
[2012-11-03 01:51:57 -0400] erkules: good
[2012-11-03 01:52:04 -0400] hoover_damm: or write to both
[2012-11-03 01:52:10 -0400] hoover_damm: currently it writes to the chef-server
[2012-11-03 01:52:18 -0400] erkules: thats sufficient
[2012-11-03 01:52:23 -0400] hoover_damm: my hosted account doesn't have that feature
[2012-11-03 01:52:32 -0400] hoover_damm: so i've only seen pictures of it heh
[2012-11-03 01:52:37 -0400] erkules: :)
[2012-11-03 01:53:23 -0400] erkules: the point is, when switching to i.e. chef we should stop using ssh and configuring the server by hand.
[2012-11-03 01:53:40 -0400] erkules: whith that feature we can identify bad habbits :)
[2012-11-03 01:53:52 -0400] hoover_damm: oh yes it will notify you if it changes the file
[2012-11-03 01:54:17 -0400] hoover_damm: and you should likely put in the header of those files don't modify this, it's under central revision control if you need to modify it see internal policy guide a
[2012-11-03 01:54:18 -0400] erkules: thx
[2012-11-03 01:54:57 -0400] erkules: good idea
[2012-11-03 01:59:48 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, and don't be afraid to hire consultants to help you with some of the best practices
[2012-11-03 02:00:16 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, I would suggest as I like to evaluate everything before I commit to it... to talk with them first at length before committing to anything
[2012-11-03 02:00:41 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, but ideally they could help you get to your goals safely in a decent timeframe
[2012-11-03 02:02:51 -0400] erkules: hoover_damm: agree on that
[2012-11-03 02:04:26 -0400] hoover_damm: having used chef now since basically it was released I can say it's a learning curve that can take a bit to get to
[2012-11-03 02:04:43 -0400] erkules: I like to go to conferences too, to get the best out of it. capable people and a lot of usecases
[2012-11-03 02:04:56 -0400] hoover_damm: so scaling how to use chef well is a internal thing
[2012-11-03 02:04:58 -0400] erkules: and that scares me
[2012-11-03 02:05:18 -0400] erkules: Im not even a ruby guy
[2012-11-03 02:05:36 -0400] hoover_damm: well you should change that if you want to be profecient
[2012-11-03 02:05:36 -0400] erkules: Perl++ like every good sysadmin
[2012-11-03 02:05:45 -0400] erkules: :)
[2012-11-03 02:05:53 -0400] hoover_damm: regardless of what language you prefer
[2012-11-03 02:06:13 -0400] gchristensen: erkules: it took me 3 projects to feel real comfortable working within chef, not real projects, just experiments
[2012-11-03 02:06:19 -0400] hoover_damm: but when it comes to this kinda stuff personal stuff should be tossed out the door
[2012-11-03 02:06:39 -0400] hoover_damm: at least it made it easier for me
[2012-11-03 02:06:53 -0400] erkules: hoover_damm: you don't know the local perlmongers in my hometown :)
[2012-11-03 02:07:02 -0400] erkules: they gonna kill me!
[2012-11-03 02:07:07 -0400] hoover_damm: erkules, don't care for them or about them
[2012-11-03 02:07:23 -0400] erkules: hoover_damm: don't say that
[2012-11-03 02:07:26 -0400] erkules: :(
[2012-11-03 02:07:37 -0400] hoover_damm: i'm trying to rid myself of it
[2012-11-03 02:08:38 -0400] erkules: ahh thats a technician approach ;)
[2012-11-03 02:09:45 -0400] hoover_damm: basically what works works... use python, ruby, clojure, haskell, shell
[2012-11-03 02:10:05 -0400] hoover_damm: the evolution of a single language person is ending
[2012-11-03 02:10:16 -0400] hoover_damm: and the polyglot's requirement is becoming larger
[2012-11-03 02:11:11 -0400] hoover_damm: about banality in engineering
[2012-11-03 02:11:37 -0400] hoover_damm: and the trolls and people coming out doing whatever they can to stem the tide because they are just too afraid of the change
[2012-11-03 02:13:56 -0400] gchristensen: yeah, a coworker of mine is about to be ... let go ... for being too stuck in his ways, unwilling to look at anything else
[2012-11-03 02:15:58 -0400] gchristensen: moving to chef required basically having it done already before he recognized that any sort of config management is a good idea (previously he had a lot of job security there.)
[2012-11-03 02:22:00 -0400] hoover_damm: gchristensen, yep I saw it with my father when I was young and how it tore him up when he realized he was 'out of date'
[2012-11-03 02:22:16 -0400] hoover_damm: gchristensen, so as a child who saw his father beaten down I resolved to never let myself go stale
[2012-11-03 02:22:47 -0400] gchristensen: as far as I'm concerned, its too boring to *not* keep learning.
[2012-11-03 02:22:57 -0400] gchristensen: also - that's rough :(
[2012-11-03 02:24:22 -0400] hoover_damm: Oh indeed it was.  There was a period where he was loosing the job the same day he got it
[2012-11-03 02:24:23 -0400] rhodee: why would setting json_class /chef_type result in NoMethodError - undefined method `delete'  on the node? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13181226/chef-solo-run-list-error-with-json
[2012-11-03 02:24:46 -0400] rhodee: I've been struggling with this problem and can't find anything on the web that would point me in the right direction.
[2012-11-03 02:24:49 -0400] gchristensen: hoover_damm: oh god!
[2012-11-03 02:24:54 -0400] hoover_damm: he was a PDP-11 programmer who stuck to the PDP-11 world until it was dead... Storage Tek was nice to him and let him learn C and C++
[2012-11-03 02:24:58 -0400] hoover_damm: and try and keep up in the windows world
[2012-11-03 02:25:01 -0400] hoover_damm: and he did
[2012-11-03 02:25:27 -0400] hoover_damm: but a test engineer who worked with PDP-11's and knew C++ :( over the hill and trying to find a new job
[2012-11-03 02:25:41 -0400] gchristensen: :(
[2012-11-03 02:25:46 -0400] hoover_damm: I can honestly say thankfully he is safe and secure NOW
[2012-11-03 02:25:59 -0400] hoover_damm: but that was my lesson
[2012-11-03 02:26:10 -0400] gchristensen: "don't get stuck"
[2012-11-03 02:27:45 -0400] hoover_damm: indeed

[2012-11-03 02:33:34 -0400] gchristensen: oy, I have never had a good time with systemd
[2012-11-03 02:34:01 -0400] hoover_damm: well basically i'm tired of sysv and upstart never did it for me
[2012-11-03 02:34:15 -0400] hoover_damm: and i'm looking to add to the table in my brain
[2012-11-03 02:34:28 -0400] hoover_damm: so systemd seems like a good thing to add to the plate
[2012-11-03 02:34:30 -0400] gchristensen: fair enough
[2012-11-03 02:34:51 -0400] gchristensen: upstart seems pretty young yet
[2012-11-03 02:35:01 -0400] hoover_damm: honestly systemd's blog posts
[2012-11-03 02:35:03 -0400] hoover_damm: won me over
[2012-11-03 02:35:09 -0400] gchristensen: not enough examples. etc.

[2012-11-03 02:39:08 -0400] hoover_damm: basically it's different, some of the basic logic really makes sense
[2012-11-03 02:39:38 -0400] hoover_damm: and if nothing else you can with knowledge deal with systemd lovers or haters in the future :)
[2012-11-03 02:39:53 -0400] gchristensen: haha, I look forward to many a heated debate :)

[2012-11-03 09:52:10 -0400] superbaloo: dear chef users, what is the easiest way to trigger a resource at end of run ? (like, always at end of run, https://gist.github.com/38001f23dd324d41d1d2)
[2012-11-03 09:55:08 -0400] Axsuul: Wow what.. node['something'] doesn't retrieve the value anymore?
[2012-11-03 09:55:44 -0400] Axsuul: nm im dumb
[2012-11-03 11:23:17 -0400] masterkorp: superbaloo: a notifies ?
[2012-11-03 12:08:24 -0400] superbaloo: masterkorp: like ? the one in place ?
[2012-11-03 13:08:49 -0400] masterkorp: yeah
[2012-11-03 13:09:21 -0400] masterkorp: superbaloo: your notifies does not look correct
[2012-11-03 13:09:36 -0400] superbaloo: yeah :delayed
[2012-11-03 13:09:41 -0400] superbaloo: you get the point
[2012-11-03 13:10:08 -0400] superbaloo: the thing i asked was more about foo = template "bar" do stuff end
[2012-11-03 13:10:23 -0400] superbaloo: may i use foo to trigger a dele
[2012-11-03 13:10:33 -0400] superbaloo: delayed execution after ?
[2012-11-03 13:10:46 -0400] masterkorp: you can, as long its a resource
[2012-11-03 13:10:57 -0400] superbaloo: how ?
[2012-11-03 13:11:11 -0400] masterkorp: with notifies
[2012-11-03 14:51:51 -0400] masterkorp: i hate bundler
[2012-11-03 15:39:56 -0400] aruntomar: i bootstraped a centos server with omnibus, then ran a cookbook which install rvm and then when i try to run chef-client again, it gives the following error https://gist.github.com/4007676. has anyone else faced this issue
[2012-11-03 15:48:19 -0400] yfeldblum: masterkorp, why?
[2012-11-03 15:59:34 -0400] masterkorp: yfeldblum: one bigh overcomplicated layer pos
[2012-11-03 16:22:35 -0400] yfeldblum: masterkorp, it all depends on how you're dealing with it
[2012-11-03 16:24:23 -0400] masterkorp: Well, for my packaging should be done at OS level
[2012-11-03 16:24:34 -0400] masterkorp: any decent OS has a package manager
[2012-11-03 16:24:56 -0400] masterkorp: anyways i am out for a drive
[2012-11-03 16:25:06 -0400] masterkorp: see ya
[2012-11-03 16:39:11 -0400] jtimberman: its rather unreasonable to expect operating system distribution packagers and maintainers to keep up with the rapid state of change in individual projects that have plugins, libraries or their own full package management system.
[2012-11-03 16:39:57 -0400] matti: jtimberman: Unless you like to curse Debian all the time :)
[2012-11-03 17:24:54 -0400] masterkorp: ah
[2012-11-03 17:25:06 -0400] masterkorp: that's why i use arch on my computer
[2012-11-03 17:25:12 -0400] masterkorp: perfect dev system
[2012-11-03 17:50:02 -0400] emanuelez: hello. chef noob here. I'm trying to setup a couple of clients with hosted chef, but it looks like i cannot authenticate
[2012-11-03 17:50:42 -0400] emanuelez: i tried regenerating the key and copying it over to the client but it does not seem to work
[2012-11-03 17:52:55 -0400] emanuelez: apparently this can be caused either by wrong validation key or wrong username and i double checked both
[2012-11-03 17:55:42 -0400] emanuelez: i think i misunderstand something about the orgname-validator... should that be used by every client?
[2012-11-03 18:17:09 -0400] masterkorp: bougyman: sup bougs
[2012-11-03 18:17:15 -0400] bougyman: heya
[2012-11-03 18:17:30 -0400] bougyman: working on a tcc chef cookbook
[2012-11-03 18:20:21 -0400] masterkorp: sweet
[2012-11-03 18:20:30 -0400] masterkorp: i am working on the icinga cookbook
[2012-11-03 18:43:25 -0400] yfeldblum: masterkorp, bundler considers gems to be part of the application, not part of the system, in its --deployment mode
[2012-11-03 18:45:55 -0400] masterkorp: still sucks
[2012-11-03 20:19:34 -0400] matti: Can anyone recommened good Zookeeper cookbook?
[2012-11-03 20:54:07 -0400] gchristensen: hi, I'm bootstrappingi Ubuntu 12.04 servers on AWS, and would like to use Chef to remove the default Ubuntu user, but the first run is going to be run as the ubuntu user. is there any way to have that user be deleted on the second run?
[2012-11-03 20:55:04 -0400] masterkorp: gchristensen: have a recipe that checks if all your users are setted up, then remove ubuntu
[2012-11-03 20:55:27 -0400] gchristensen: and run it ahead of the recipes that creat ethe users. good idea.
[2012-11-03 21:04:25 -0400] gchristensen: so I've been installing 10.16.2 lately, and am getting "Setting attributes without specifying a precedence is deprecated" errors, but I don't know where they are coming from: https://gist.github.com/c20bca76686f2e52c697 is this an error from chef? or one of my cookbooks?
[2012-11-03 21:05:20 -0400] masterkorp: gchristensen: it says there
[2012-11-03 21:05:33 -0400] masterkorp: gchristensen: you should subscribe to the chef mailing list
[2012-11-03 21:05:45 -0400] gchristensen: sounds reasonable to me
[2012-11-03 21:08:08 -0400] masterkorp: let me find the thread
[2012-11-03 21:10:10 -0400] agoddard: anyone using knife-openstack with folsom and unable to run `knife openstack server delete` successfully?
[2012-11-03 21:11:22 -0400] agoddard: IDs switched to UUIDs, so I'm guessing it's a bug introduced
[2012-11-03 21:12:38 -0400] masterkorp: gchristensen: http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2012-10/msg00427.html

[2012-11-03 21:20:27 -0400] hoover_damm: might work
