[2012-11-24 03:05:59 -0500] Datumrich_: Apologies in advance new to chef, mainly working with FreeBSD clients was wondering if anyone had recommended reading or pitfalls for working with Chef and Free
[2012-11-24 07:38:33 -0500] ravikp79: Is it possible to progress of each recipe run to external handler
[2012-11-24 07:39:13 -0500] ravikp79: Instead at the end of the run like report handler
[2012-11-24 07:45:29 -0500] ssd7: ravikp79: No built-in way at the moment, but I think that if you wanted to build something like that, you can do so pretty easily now with some of the work that was done for doc formatters
[2012-11-24 07:45:33 -0500] ssd7: s/doc/output/
[2012-11-24 07:48:29 -0500] ravikp79: This feature would be extremely useful what do you guys think?
[2012-11-24 07:50:19 -0500] ravikp79: Lets say if we enhance the system to bring in this capability when can it go live, I mean in which version that would be available
[2012-11-24 07:52:22 -0500] ravikp79: Currently we wrote custom recipe what execute before and after the actual runlist
[2012-11-24 09:48:01 -0500] bmcgee: FYI if you're new to iptables I recommend https://github.com/dcrosta/cookbook-simple-iptables instead of the opscode iptables cookbook
[2012-11-24 14:53:08 -0500] Mic92: I get the following error while running knife bootstrap:
[2012-11-24 14:53:09 -0500] Mic92: INFO: HTTP Request Returned 404 Not Found: No routes match the request: /reports/nodes/mars/runs
[2012-11-24 15:05:54 -0500] killfill: When i use execute to execute a command.. how do i check whats the gome-directory of the user im running it as?
[2012-11-24 15:07:59 -0500] killfill: home i mean..
[2012-11-24 15:32:05 -0500] Mic92: killfile HOME?
[2012-11-24 15:40:07 -0500] killfill: Mic92: its not available when execugin the command.. :S  anyway, ill just set it myself.
[2012-11-24 15:41:03 -0500] Mic92: The other alternative is passwd ...
[2012-11-24 15:41:19 -0500] Mic92: /etc/passwd
[2012-11-24 15:47:05 -0500] killfill: true.. :)
[2012-11-24 16:32:29 -0500] jflowers: anyone know how I would go about writting an osx provider for the env resource?
[2012-11-24 16:33:58 -0500] jflowers: do I just create a cookbook with this file in it?
[2012-11-24 16:35:23 -0500] jflowers: .../provider/env/macosx.rb
[2012-11-24 16:43:06 -0500] erikh: yfeldblum: just ported gecode to run on mingw
[2012-11-24 16:43:24 -0500] erikh: interested in trying it out after I get dep_selector and a binary gem up? probably later today.
[2012-11-24 17:16:13 -0500] cwj: jflowers: if you are trying to add a "heavyweight" provider i think you'd need to put that in a cookbook's libraries directory, but i could be wrong
[2012-11-24 17:18:14 -0500] cwj: like if you are going to extend Chef::Provider::Env with an additional class, and you want to do it in a cookbook, i dont know if it would get loaded correctly from the providers directory
[2012-11-24 19:04:01 -0500] ssd7: Ohai Chefs!
[2012-11-24 19:06:02 -0500] mikeywaites: http://dpaste.com/835982/ anyone able to tell me whats going wrong here using this cookbook https://github.com/gchef/nginx-cookbook
[2012-11-24 19:06:39 -0500] mikeywaites: seems to work ok on my local vagrant machine but not on the server?
[2012-11-24 19:09:58 -0500] ssd7: mikeywaites: Can you run with debug logging and paste the output.  It should output the standard error and standard out of the failing command
[2012-11-24 19:11:48 -0500] ssd7: mikeywaites: Also, do you get any errors running apt-get update on that machine?
[2012-11-24 19:13:14 -0500] mikeywaites: ssd7:  hey thanks for the answer ill try with debug now update runs fun outside of chef
[2012-11-24 22:00:43 -0500] mikeywaites: any one got any ideas what on earth this could be ?
[2012-11-24 22:00:44 -0500] mikeywaites: http://dpaste.com/836049/
[2012-11-24 22:01:06 -0500] mikeywaites: noticed my box is running at 10.9 load average
[2012-11-24 22:01:20 -0500] mikeywaites: ps auxf | grep chef show all that stuff
[2012-11-24 22:12:40 -0500] meineerde: mikeywaites: these are so called zombie processes. they have effectively finished. it's just that their parent process haven't yet read their exit status (most often because it is stuck waiting on some blocking io)
[2012-11-24 22:13:37 -0500] meineerde: mikeywaites: the child processes don't take any resources anymore (besides their pid and some tiny amount of kernel memory)
[2012-11-24 22:14:03 -0500] mikeywaites: meineerde:  right
[2012-11-24 22:14:21 -0500] mikeywaites: the memory on this box is siiting almost at 100% consumption
[2012-11-24 22:14:35 -0500] meineerde: mikeywaites: well, it's not because of these processes :)
[2012-11-24 22:14:39 -0500] mikeywaites: cant figure out what the hell is going on
[2012-11-24 22:16:51 -0500] mikeywaites: the load average on the box has dropped after a reboot but its still sitting around 5.0
[2012-11-24 23:11:16 -0500] masterkorp: yfeldblum: hey when you have time, can you re-link me that gist link with an LWRP and Library example
[2012-11-24 23:11:36 -0500] yfeldblum: masterkorp, https://gist.github.com/d85be145f3ff824ccc07
[2012-11-24 23:12:47 -0500] masterkorp: thank you sit
[2012-11-24 23:13:03 -0500] masterkorp: just as I finished greping the logs
