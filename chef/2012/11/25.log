[2012-11-25 01:40:07 -0500] Afterglow: I'm getting an error trying to build omnibus chef with fpm unable to find a file - https://gist.github.com/4142046 anyone any ideas?
[2012-11-25 06:57:43 -0500] harrisony: anyone here familar with the knife-openstack plugin? I'm getting openstack_server_create.rb:218:in `run': undefined method `push' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
[2012-11-25 07:01:08 -0500] bmcgee: ohai. I remember seeing a debate on here before about specifying dependent recipes in the run list or using include_recipe
[2012-11-25 07:01:54 -0500] bmcgee: regardless, i'm trying to use include_recipe to specify everything i need in one place but it doesn't seem to be including the dependencies. I've specified them in the metadata btw
[2012-11-25 07:02:03 -0500] bmcgee: anyone else encounter issues with this?
[2012-11-25 11:08:45 -0500] mikeywaites: https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/tree/master/sudo im using this cookbook but im a little confused about where i should add the json or ruby? i thought i could just add it to the default_attributes on an environment?
[2012-11-25 11:09:32 -0500] mikeywaites: set the attributes above on the node via a role or the node object itself. In a role.rb could someone explain this for me?
[2012-11-25 11:09:57 -0500] ajaeger: hey guys, i there a way in which u can refernce an attribute by another in a lwrp? something like: attribute :name, :kind_of => String, :name_attribute => true
[2012-11-25 11:09:57 -0500] ajaeger: attribute :work_dir_prefix,  :kind_of => String, :default => "/usr/local/src/#{name}"
[2012-11-25 11:13:39 -0500] ajaeger: or somehow to do:
[2012-11-25 11:13:39 -0500] ajaeger: {provider}
[2012-11-25 11:13:40 -0500] ajaeger: new_resource.work_dir_prefix = "/usr/local/src/#{new_resource.name}"
[2012-11-25 11:13:40 -0500] ajaeger: {provider}
[2012-11-25 11:13:40 -0500] ajaeger: {recipe}
[2012-11-25 11:13:40 -0500] ajaeger: r = bla_lwrp 'jetty'
[2012-11-25 11:13:40 -0500] ajaeger: log(r.work_dir_prefix)
[2012-11-25 11:13:41 -0500] ajaeger: # returns: /usr/local/src/jetty
[2012-11-25 11:13:41 -0500] ajaeger: {recipe}
[2012-11-25 11:17:05 -0500] ajaeger: @mikeywaites: have you check that the node your trying to update is in the environment you specified the attributes in?
[2012-11-25 11:22:10 -0500] ajaeger: anyone who knows something about lwrp?
[2012-11-25 11:55:52 -0500] bmcgee: This might be a stupid question but if I'm using Berkshelf and I specify dependent cookbooks in Berksfile do I then have to specify them again in metadata.rb before running berks upload?
[2012-11-25 11:56:08 -0500] bmcgee: I ask because I'm getting a dependency error with my cookbook
[2012-11-25 12:12:11 -0500] spheromak: bmcgee: you should do it the other way. Spec deps  in metadata and only spec the things that aren't site or server pulled in your berksfile
[2012-11-25 12:12:34 -0500] spheromak: the server wont give the node the reight cooks unless the metadata is complete
[2012-11-25 12:12:55 -0500] bmcgee: ah ok
[2012-11-25 12:13:23 -0500] spheromak: the berksfiles' "metadat" command will ref that
[2012-11-25 12:13:43 -0500] spheromak: site :opscode
[2012-11-25 12:13:45 -0500] spheromak: metadata
[2012-11-25 12:13:56 -0500] spheromak: will get you all your deps from metadaa assuming they are on the community site
[2012-11-25 12:14:19 -0500] bmcgee: so anything i'm pulling from github or locally goes in berksfile, anything else metadata
[2012-11-25 12:14:20 -0500] bmcgee: ?
[2012-11-25 12:14:57 -0500] spheromak: if your cookbook depends on it you should call it out in metadata. If the source is not opscode then you add to berkshelf as well.
[2012-11-25 12:15:35 -0500] bmcgee: ah k
[2012-11-25 12:43:09 -0500] mikeywaites: can anyone point me to a way debug why i keep getting 500 error when trying to create a client with knife
[2012-11-25 12:44:19 -0500] mikeywaites: i seem to get a 500 then subsequent requests return a 409 - it seems like it creates the client looking at the webui but never returns successfully
[2012-11-25 17:00:52 -0500] fromonesrc: when will the chef bundled ruby use 1.9 instead of 1.8?
[2012-11-25 17:01:11 -0500] fromonesrc: is this a planned change?
[2012-11-25 17:05:53 -0500] countdigi: anyone using chefspec?
[2012-11-25 17:06:46 -0500] countdigi: i am trying it and when a log expectation fails (might be others) it prints out the entire chef_run object saying it doesnt match - which can fill a screen or two - is this default behavior?
[2012-11-25 17:35:11 -0500] jtimberman: fromonesrc: in the 'omnibus' package? it has been using 1.9.x all along. it's currently 1.9.3p286
[2012-11-25 17:43:10 -0500] fromonesrc: jtimberman why does it not respect 1.9 style hash syntax in recipes? I was using chef 10.14.2
[2012-11-25 17:43:30 -0500] fromonesrc: I thought I saw 1.8.7 when I checked the ruby version too
[2012-11-25 17:45:09 -0500] jtimberman: fromonesrc: What do you mean it doesn't respect 1.9 style hash syntax?
[2012-11-25 17:45:36 -0500] jtimberman: chef:recipe > myhash = { this: "that" } => {:this=>"that"}
[2012-11-25 17:46:48 -0500] jtimberman: I personally wouldn't use that syntax as it *is* incompatible with other versions of Ruby, and I've been using the "old" syntax for 5 years in Ruby, and similar syntax in other languages longer than that. :).
[2012-11-25 17:52:14 -0500] fromonesrc: this: "that" was throwing ruby syntax errors
[2012-11-25 17:52:36 -0500] fromonesrc: I'll see if I can find more info about what was happening
[2012-11-25 19:14:12 -0500] rafaelmagu: Anyone got a definitive guide for moving a Chef server to new hardware?
[2012-11-25 19:14:22 -0500] rafaelmagu: Or at least backing up and restoring everything
[2012-11-25 19:20:21 -0500] cheesepl_: rafaelmagu: there isn't a definitive guide that I am aware of but there is http://fnichol.github.com/knife-server/
[2012-11-25 19:20:25 -0500] cheesepl_: which makes it pretty easy
[2012-11-25 19:20:50 -0500] rafaelmagu: cheesepl_: ooh, nice
[2012-11-25 19:20:55 -0500] rafaelmagu: Will check that out
[2012-11-25 19:21:16 -0500] cheesepl_: fnichol makes a lot of awesome stuff
[2012-11-25 19:42:19 -0500] WPsites: quick question: I've already bootstrapped a few nodes using knife and I'm now looking at my local chef-repo and I've got no roles listed (even though I have 2 roles created/active) is there anyway for me to get this info in my local repo?
[2012-11-25 19:42:45 -0500] WPsites: sort of like "knife role from file FILE" but in reverse?
[2012-11-25 19:43:45 -0500] cheesepl_: knife role show -f json role > file.json
[2012-11-25 19:44:11 -0500] cheesepl_: if you have knife-essentials there is a download function added to knife iirc
[2012-11-25 19:46:02 -0500] WPsites: knife-essentials sounds interesting, I've seen it mentioned elsewhere. I'm just realising I need to have things in json files so that I can back stuff up better!
[2012-11-25 19:46:36 -0500] cheesepl_: the show command with the format flag will get you the info from the server and you can pop it into a file
[2012-11-25 19:46:55 -0500] cheesepl_: but essentials is a good gem to have that makes it that much easier
[2012-11-25 19:47:05 -0500] WPsites: what about the actual nodes is that stored anywhere? or do I keep a not of that in a data bag somewhere?
[2012-11-25 19:47:57 -0500] cheesepl_: node information is stored on the server
[2012-11-25 19:48:02 -0500] jtnz: Does anyone know how to backup clients and users on a Chef server?
[2012-11-25 19:48:39 -0500] WPsites: how do I back that up? in git like with the other stuff?
[2012-11-25 19:49:06 -0500] cheesepl_: one option is http://fnichol.github.com/knife-server/
[2012-11-25 19:49:13 -0500] cheesepl_: that will pull all the stuff
[2012-11-25 19:49:48 -0500] cheesepl_: ideally you aren't doing anything terribly special with the node data though, you usually want that in the cookbooks or roles
[2012-11-25 19:50:17 -0500] cheesepl_: nothing wrong with doing it but a few chef folks would likely discourage that pattern
[2012-11-25 19:50:19 -0500] jtnz: cheesepl_, that plugin still can't backup clients though...
[2012-11-25 19:50:32 -0500] cheesepl_: jtnz: I know, that was answering two questions
[2012-11-25 19:50:35 -0500] cheesepl_: ;)
[2012-11-25 19:51:09 -0500] jtnz: I've got a feeling I'm going to have to do db stuff to do it
[2012-11-25 19:51:10 -0500] jtnz: :(
[2012-11-25 19:51:18 -0500] rafaelmagu: Using knife-server now
[2012-11-25 19:51:26 -0500] cheesepl_: jtnz: why backing up the clients?
[2012-11-25 19:51:45 -0500] cheesepl_: I'd just bootsrap new boxes
[2012-11-25 19:51:46 -0500] rafaelmagu: Sadly, my chef-server install seems to be botched
[2012-11-25 19:51:53 -0500] jtnz: cheesepl_, so I don't need to re-bootstrap them on the new server
[2012-11-25 19:53:47 -0500] cheesepl_: jtnz: I'm thinking that the keys (validation and client) would change with a new server anyway
[2012-11-25 19:54:19 -0500] cheesepl_: since they are seeded with the unique machine info (I could be totally wrong here)
[2012-11-25 19:54:44 -0500] cheesepl_: they opscode open source to hosted migration still has you rebootstrapping them: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Migrating+to+Hosted+Chef+from+an+Open+Source+Chef+Server+implementation
[2012-11-25 19:55:50 -0500] cheesepl_: running out of power, time to track down someplace in jfk that has both decent power and wifi
[2012-11-25 19:58:33 -0500] jtimberman: cassianoleal: https://gist.github.com/4145087 - use the 'cookbook' parameter to the definition
[2012-11-25 19:59:25 -0500] WPsites: So knife-server : I've got my local dev machine setup to manage stuff what if I want to automate the backup. Do I install knife and then knife-server on a separate web machine and then create a cron job to do the knife-server backup??
[2012-11-25 19:59:59 -0500] WPsites: or install knife-server on the chef server?
[2012-11-25 20:00:27 -0500] pkircher: knifeserver so it says it to manage chef-server ..
[2012-11-25 20:00:33 -0500] pkircher: bootstrap and administrate it
[2012-11-25 20:00:36 -0500] WPsites: and run a cron from there
[2012-11-25 20:01:37 -0500] WPsites: I've already got a chef server. Do I really want to create a bootstrapped one?
[2012-11-25 20:01:49 -0500] pkircher: probably not
[2012-11-25 20:01:50 -0500] pkircher: :)
[2012-11-25 20:02:12 -0500] cassianoleal: jtimberman: thanks a lot, that did it! :)
[2012-11-25 20:02:22 -0500] pkircher: "An Opscode Chef knife plugin to manage Chef Servers. Bootstrap a new Chef Server on Amazon's EC2 or a standalone server. Backup and restore your Chef Server or Hosted Chef's node, role, data bag, and environment JSON data."
[2012-11-25 20:04:10 -0500] WPsites: ok thanks - I'll look further at knife-server
[2012-11-25 20:24:36 -0500] cassianoleal: jtimberman: another question about the apache2 cookbook  how do I make sure that 000-default is never enabled by default?
[2012-11-25 20:29:08 -0500] cassianoleal: jtimberman: nevermind, I should've RTFM before asking. :) setting "default['apache']['default_site_enabled'] = false" did it
[2012-11-25 20:34:15 -0500] jtnz: For an open source Chef server, are the apt repo's the recommended way to go (Ubuntu server)?
[2012-11-25 20:36:52 -0500] rafaelmagu: knife status returns no results, but knife node list shows all my nodes. Where should I start looking? Solr?
[2012-11-25 20:52:46 -0500] jtimberman: rafaelmagu: yeah, solr, and the expander
[2012-11-25 20:54:18 -0500] rafaelmagu: jtimberman: hmm, I think I have hosed my expander install, then. Gonna try and stand up another server on EC2 and see if I can restore all
[2012-11-25 20:56:11 -0500] jtimberman: rafaelmagu: good luck!
[2012-11-25 20:56:20 -0500] rafaelmagu: Thanks
[2012-11-25 21:02:43 -0500] pkircher: jtnz: i did it with the APT repo .
[2012-11-25 21:02:45 -0500] pkircher: works fine
[2012-11-25 21:10:03 -0500] jtnz: pkircher, I think that's what I'm going to go with at this stage
[2012-11-25 21:10:20 -0500] pkircher: worked for me
[2012-11-25 21:10:27 -0500] pkircher: but as soon as you reboot
[2012-11-25 21:10:36 -0500] pkircher: couple of the services wont start automaticaly
[2012-11-25 21:10:42 -0500] pkircher: .. probably permissions
[2012-11-25 21:10:50 -0500] pkircher: so you have to start them on your own
[2012-11-25 21:10:54 -0500] pkircher: best to test in a local VM box
[2012-11-25 21:10:56 -0500] pkircher: or so
[2012-11-25 22:37:39 -0500] Xiol: Is it possible to run a shell command if, and only if, a file resource changes?
[2012-11-25 22:40:37 -0500] ssd7: Xiol: Yes, create an execute or bash resource with action :nothing and then use a notification to run it anytime the file resource changes
[2012-11-25 22:41:01 -0500] ssd7: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_common.html#notifications
[2012-11-25 22:46:11 -0500] Xiol: ssd7: Thanks! That's what I was looking for, I just couldn't find it in the docs (think I'm using the older wiki.opscode.com docs)
[2012-11-25 22:48:47 -0500] ssd7: Xiol: No problem. We recently started moving over to docs.opscode.com so the stuff at wiki.opscode.com is still useful just hard to navigate.
[2012-11-25 22:56:04 -0500] irocksu: hi
[2012-11-25 22:56:49 -0500] irocksu: i am trying to install the wordpress cookbook with vagrant. and currently i always get: an error while executing apt-get -q -y install mysql-client=5.1.63-0ubuntu0.10.04.1
[2012-11-25 22:57:21 -0500] irocksu: the return code is 100 and 0 was expected
[2012-11-25 22:57:43 -0500] irocksu: i tried to install the package manually, but even after apt-get clean and apt-get update it does not work
[2012-11-25 22:57:59 -0500] irocksu: where does this strange mysql-client version come from?
[2012-11-25 23:00:31 -0500] irocksu: i event tried to execute the apt cookbook before mysql, but i get the same problem
[2012-11-25 23:02:25 -0500] rafaelmagu: irocksu: this is usually caused by an APT repository that has been added by the cookbook but hasn't yet been refreshed using apt-get update
[2012-11-25 23:02:47 -0500] rafaelmagu: irocksu: although, in your case, it could be something else since you already did apt-get update. Did you try installing after apt-get update?
[2012-11-25 23:04:35 -0500] rafaelmagu: jtimberman: both solr and expander aren't showing any errors, yet knife status still returns no results. Is there a way that Solr would get out of sync? Chef runs still work fine.
[2012-11-25 23:05:45 -0500] irocksu: rafaelmagu: it seems to work after i apt-get update.
[2012-11-25 23:06:09 -0500] ssd7: rafaelmagu: If you tail the expander log during your chef run, do you see the node update in the logs?
[2012-11-25 23:06:11 -0500] rafaelmagu: irocksu: yeah, it's a long-standing issue, it seems. I see the same happen with most cookbooks that add their own repos.
[2012-11-25 23:06:29 -0500] irocksu: rafaelmagu: what is a good fix for this?
[2012-11-25 23:06:52 -0500] irocksu: just apt-get update manually?
[2012-11-25 23:06:54 -0500] rafaelmagu: irocksu: i made my own versions of some cookbooks and forced apt-get update
[2012-11-25 23:07:05 -0500] rafaelmagu: ssd7: looking at it now
[2012-11-25 23:07:38 -0500] irocksu: rafaelmagu: could i just make a custom cookbook that does only apt-get update and include that before the others?
[2012-11-25 23:08:02 -0500] rafaelmagu: irocksu: yes, but you actually need to apt-get update after every new APT repo is added
[2012-11-25 23:08:10 -0500] rafaelmagu: So your suggestion wouldn't really work
[2012-11-25 23:08:22 -0500] rafaelmagu: You shouldn't need to run the same Chef run twice to get the output you desire
[2012-11-25 23:09:02 -0500] irocksu: rafaelmagu: ok. can you point me to some site to lean how to include the apt-get update to the cookbooks?
[2012-11-25 23:09:11 -0500] irocksu: i am new to chef.
[2012-11-25 23:09:20 -0500] rafaelmagu: irocksu: there's an apt cookbook in the community site
[2012-11-25 23:09:28 -0500] rafaelmagu: irocksu: everyone seems to be using that
[2012-11-25 23:09:47 -0500] rafaelmagu: ssd7: no updates, only three searches for roles (used in some recipes)
[2012-11-25 23:10:16 -0500] irocksu: rafaelmagu: thanks.
[2012-11-25 23:12:28 -0500] ssd7: rafaelmagu: Depending on the log level that the expander is logging at you should see the node update in those logs.  If nothing is showing up there, try looking at rabbitmq or the chef server logs
[2012-11-25 23:12:45 -0500] rafaelmagu: what's the log level to get debugging?
[2012-11-25 23:12:57 -0500] rafaelmagu: brb lunch
[2012-11-25 23:13:00 -0500] ssd7: rafaelmagu: The general path of a node update is chef-server-api -> rabbit-mq -> chef-expander -> solr
[2012-11-25 23:13:13 -0500] rafaelmagu: ssd7 cool, will investigate
[2012-11-25 23:58:44 -0500] rafaelmagu: Cool! Finally got it to work. Thanks ssd7 for the tip. RabbitMQ password was incorrect.
