[2012-12-24 08:48:43 -0500] lehrblogger: hi, i have a pretty basic question, but im having trouble finding the answer anywhere
[2012-12-24 08:49:37 -0500] lehrblogger: i'm setting a path with a default attribute defined in my environment, and i want to set a path in a cookbook attribute relative to the environment attribute
[2012-12-24 08:49:43 -0500] lehrblogger: .. what's the syntax for that?
[2012-12-24 09:01:56 -0500] lehrblogger: when i do what i think should work
[2012-12-24 09:02:09 -0500] lehrblogger: something like "#{default['source_dir']}" in my attribute file
[2012-12-24 09:02:16 -0500] lehrblogger: where source_dir is the environment attribute
[2012-12-24 09:02:44 -0500] lehrblogger: im getting a cookbook attribute that looks like
[2012-12-24 09:02:45 -0500] lehrblogger: #<Chef::Node::Attribute:0x00000001a04898>
[2012-12-24 09:03:33 -0500] lehrblogger: is that related to http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-1433? i hope not :-/

I made the dir and it seemed to have installed ok...

[2012-12-24 12:24:13 -0500] yann2: hello! is it possible to have recipes for a cookbook organised in different subfolders?
[2012-12-24 12:34:40 -0500] c00p: yann2: I don't believe so
[2012-12-24 12:34:51 -0500] yann2: mmmh :(

[2012-12-24 15:15:25 -0500] ssd7: bubuz: If you use debug logging you should get a stack trace that gives you the line number of the error

[2012-12-24 15:30:54 -0500] cheeseplus: I feel like the nginx cookbook is trolling me
[2012-12-24 15:31:45 -0500] cheeseplus: it can't run the nxensite resource because the file it is supposed to be creating doesn't exist
[2012-12-24 15:40:33 -0500] ssd7: bubuz: So, it looks like you want to look at line 8 of the mydrive_dashboard cookbook
[2012-12-24 15:40:36 -0500] cheeseplus: or maybe the docs say it will get created from a template but it actually doesn't
[2012-12-24 15:55:09 -0500] aruntomar: cheeseplus: u need to create a template for the vhost that you want to create and then enable it via the resource provided by nginx.
[2012-12-24 15:55:51 -0500] cheeseplus: aruntomar: thanks, I figure that out - lots of examples out there seem to indicate that you can call the template from inside the nginx_site definition
[2012-12-24 15:55:58 -0500] cheeseplus: s/figure/figured/
[2012-12-24 15:56:24 -0500] aruntomar: cheeseplus: ok
[2012-12-24 15:58:19 -0500] cheeseplus: once I looked at the code it became clear that nginx_site only enables/disables
[2012-12-24 16:50:36 -0500] jtimberman: cheeseplus: the part where the helper definitions only manage the symlinks, rather than managing the existence of the sites-available file?
[2012-12-24 16:50:48 -0500] cheeseplus: yup
[2012-12-24 16:51:14 -0500] cheeseplus: I'd seen an example using template inside of the nginx_site and was confused for a bit
[2012-12-24 16:51:34 -0500] cheeseplus: I thought I was doing something wrong
[2012-12-24 16:52:02 -0500] jtimberman: aye. the apache2 cookbook's 'web_app' definition has management of the -available template, and then calls apache_site
[2012-12-24 16:52:11 -0500] jtimberman: i'd really like to refactor all that stuff into LWRPs
[2012-12-24 16:52:51 -0500] cheeseplus: jtimberman: yea, this is my first encounter with the nginx cookbook but I was expecting similar behavior to apache2
[2012-12-24 16:53:02 -0500] cheeseplus: er the web_app definition that is
[2012-12-24 16:57:04 -0500] yann2: mmh - with chef, can I use a template from one cookbook in another cookbook?
[2012-12-24 17:01:07 -0500] ssd7: yann2: Yes, the template resource has a cookbook attribute: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_template.html
[2012-12-24 17:02:02 -0500] yann2: sweeeeeeet sweet sweet :) thanks!
[2012-12-24 17:02:04 -0500] ssd7: You can use it to use the template from another cookbook.  Be careful with that pattern though, it makes it harder to change one cookbook without thinking about the other.
[2012-12-24 17:02:40 -0500] yann2: I understand - my idea is, I don't want to use very site-specific templates in a cookbook whose goal is to be "generi"
[2012-12-24 17:03:04 -0500] yann2: so I want to distribute my cookbooks with templates that work 95% o the time, and allow overriding when it doesn't fit
[2012-12-24 18:16:37 -0500] lehrblogger: hi, i asked this last night, but no one was around, perhaps someone is now?
[2012-12-24 18:16:52 -0500] lehrblogger: i'm trying to use an environment attribute to define a cookbook attribute, but am getting values that look like "#<Chef::Node::Attribute:0x0000000295d088>", rather than the expected string. what's the right syntax for this?
[2012-12-24 18:17:21 -0500] sethvargo: lehrblogger: can you post a gist/code?
[2012-12-24 18:17:34 -0500] lehrblogger: yeah, sure, one sec
[2012-12-24 18:22:21 -0500] lehrblogger: sethvargo: https://gist.github.com/4370273, let me know if you need more info
[2012-12-24 18:23:45 -0500] sethvargo: right, that's a pointer to default['source_dir']
[2012-12-24 18:24:09 -0500] sethvargo: that's the behavior I always experience
[2012-12-24 18:24:36 -0500] lehrblogger: ok
[2012-12-24 18:24:49 -0500] lehrblogger: is there a way to get the value of the attribute there, rather than a pointer to it?
[2012-12-24 18:25:39 -0500] sethvargo: .to_s
[2012-12-24 18:25:41 -0500] lehrblogger: i've tried a few things from http://rubydoc.info/gems/chef/0.8.16/Chef/Node/Attribute, but not everything
[2012-12-24 18:25:42 -0500] lehrblogger: ah
[2012-12-24 18:25:55 -0500] sethvargo: but be warned, there are going to be side effects
[2012-12-24 18:26:11 -0500] sethvargo: as in, it will ALWAYS be the default attribute, even if you override it later in the stack
[2012-12-24 18:26:22 -0500] sethvargo: that's why it's saved as a pointer (think of it like a proc), rather than the string
[2012-12-24 18:27:22 -0500] lehrblogger: ah, interesting
[2012-12-24 18:27:54 -0500] lehrblogger: and it makes sense why it will always have that value, since the cookbook isn't reloaded later
[2012-12-24 18:28:12 -0500] lehrblogger: i think that wont be a problem for me in this case, but is there a better way to do what i'm doing?
[2012-12-24 18:29:25 -0500] sethvargo: why do you need the actual value and not the pointer?
[2012-12-24 18:31:25 -0500] lehrblogger: im not sure  is there a way to have it wait to evaluate that path attribute until run time?
[2012-12-24 18:32:06 -0500] sethvargo: it does or it should work with the behavior you have specified
[2012-12-24 18:33:25 -0500] jtimberman: i wonder why 0.8.16's doc page for attributes comes up. That code has been significantly refactored since 0.8.16.
[2012-12-24 18:34:16 -0500] lehrblogger: jtimberman: oh! i hadn't noticed the version was wrong, sigh. i found that a couple pages deep in the google results
[2012-12-24 18:34:31 -0500] jtimberman: lehrblogger: i got that same result on a google search recently too
[2012-12-24 18:37:45 -0500] lehrblogger: sethvargo: hm, #{default[:source_dir].to_s} is still giving me the pointer
[2012-12-24 18:38:00 -0500] lehrblogger: updated the gist, https://gist.github.com/4370273
[2012-12-24 18:41:15 -0500] sethvargo: I'm still a little confused.. what *isn't* working besides the fact that it's displayed incorrectly in the mgmt console? It will work correctly if used in a recipe
[2012-12-24 18:42:35 -0500] rayrod2030: anybody else dealing with the Moneta 0.7.0 bug?
[2012-12-24 18:43:21 -0500] itwasntandy: it bit me earlier
[2012-12-24 18:43:58 -0500] itwasntandy: forcing version < 0.7.0 works for me
[2012-12-24 18:44:28 -0500] lehrblogger: sethvargo: oh, i didn't realize that what was displayed in the management console would differ from the value when used in a recipe
[2012-12-24 18:44:47 -0500] lehrblogger: hm, but it's failing when it tries to checkout a git repo to that dir,
[2012-12-24 18:44:59 -0500] lehrblogger: [2012-12-24T18:42:06+00:00] INFO: Processing git[#<Chef::Node::Attribute:0x00000001601db8>/mycookbook] action sync (mycookbook::default line 43)
[2012-12-24 18:45:18 -0500] lehrblogger: and then i get a Chef::Exceptions::MissingParentDirectory, since that's not the dir i created
[2012-12-24 18:46:07 -0500] jtimberman: chef 10.16.4.rc.1 up on rubygems.org now. includes CHEF-3672, CHEF-3632, CHEF-3597, CHEF-3574, CHEF-3564, CHEF-3577, CHEF-3721. please test it an report back in #chef-hacking
[2012-12-24 18:46:10 -0500] jtimberman: per btm
[2012-12-24 18:46:30 -0500] sc077: can anyone tell me the difference between:
[2012-12-24 18:46:30 -0500] sc077: subscribes :delete, template["bar"']   # vs
[2012-12-24 18:46:30 -0500] sc077: subscribes :delete, resources(:template => "bar")
[2012-12-24 18:46:55 -0500] sc077: s/\'//
[2012-12-24 18:47:04 -0500] jtimberman: sc077: in the first, you'd want "template[bar]"
[2012-12-24 18:47:28 -0500] jtimberman: sc077: however, for *subscribes* I don't think that notation actually works, only on notifies.
[2012-12-24 18:48:03 -0500] jtimberman: sc077: resources(:template => "bar") looks at the Resource Collection for a template resource named bar.
[2012-12-24 18:48:28 -0500] jtimberman: it can only find resources that were declared prior in the recipe, or in another recipe in teh run list
[2012-12-24 18:48:48 -0500] jtimberman: whereas "template[bar]" doesn't have to appear before in the recipe or other recipe in the run list
[2012-12-24 18:49:00 -0500] abstrusenick: anyone know smtp settings for zoho mail?
[2012-12-24 18:49:43 -0500] sc077: jtimberman: cool, thanks for that explanation!
[2012-12-24 18:49:44 -0500] sethvargo: lehrblogger: that's really strange. I have the exact same situation and it works fine https://github.com/sethvargo-cookbooks/deployer/blob/master/attributes/default.rb
[2012-12-24 18:51:08 -0500] jtimberman: rayrod2030: ^^ 10.16.4.rc.1 should resolve the moneta version change
[2012-12-24 18:52:30 -0500] lehrblogger: sethvargo: huh, ok. what do the corresponding environment attributes look like?
[2012-12-24 18:53:15 -0500] lehrblogger: sethvargo: nm, reading the README for that
[2012-12-24 18:54:55 -0500] sethvargo: lehrblogger: it works as expected
[2012-12-24 18:57:08 -0500] rayrod2030: jtimberman: thanks
[2012-12-24 18:58:09 -0500] miah: hi
[2012-12-24 18:58:16 -0500] sethvargo: HI MIAH!
[2012-12-24 18:58:19 -0500] miah: hullo
[2012-12-24 18:58:27 -0500] miah: merry consumerist eve!
[2012-12-24 18:59:16 -0500] ssd7: :) Heya Miah!
[2012-12-24 19:01:06 -0500] miah: ive been lost in video games and ruby studies this weekend
[2012-12-24 19:02:48 -0500] rayrod2030: I'm assuming the moneta bug is not encountered when using the omnibus installer correct?
[2012-12-24 19:03:22 -0500] sc077: jtimberman: one more question... do you know how can one call a resource: directory "#{my_file_join_module(path)}" via something like: subscribes :delete, "directory[my_file_join_module(path)]"
[2012-12-24 19:04:36 -0500] miah: sc077: notifies
[2012-12-24 19:04:57 -0500] miah: and just make the directory resource perform action :nothing by default
[2012-12-24 19:05:18 -0500] sc077: how can I get it to expand the return value
[2012-12-24 19:05:18 -0500] miah: that way the resource is defined and present in during the chef run and is only triggered at the appropriate time
[2012-12-24 19:05:30 -0500] miah: oh
[2012-12-24 19:05:39 -0500] miah: what does my_file_join_module do?
[2012-12-24 19:05:49 -0500] sc077: File.join
[2012-12-24 19:06:30 -0500] miah: fwiw, you can just do 'directory File.join("/path/#{derp}"'
[2012-12-24 19:06:39 -0500] miah: er, missing trailing )
[2012-12-24 19:07:03 -0500] miah: but notifies subscribes should work fine for that
[2012-12-24 19:12:46 -0500] lehrblogger: sethvargo: not sure if you're still around, but thanks for looking at this with me, i'll come back to it later
[2012-12-24 19:23:15 -0500] sc077: So using this syntax:  notifies :create, "directory[my_module(params)]" I get directory[my_module(params)] not found in the resource collection.  If I add #{} around it, I get undefined method
[2012-12-24 19:28:36 -0500] miah: sc077: you  have to define the resource before you can notify it
[2012-12-24 19:28:55 -0500] miah: #{} is just doing string interpolation. you don't need to do that
[2012-12-24 19:30:15 -0500] sc077: well, to call the module method inside the "directory[]" resource, I did
[2012-12-24 19:30:38 -0500] miah: you need to create a resource for each of your file(modules) before you can notify it
[2012-12-24 19:30:41 -0500] sc077: I got it to work by including the module in Chef::Resource::Template
[2012-12-24 19:34:17 -0500] miah: sounds like the hole your digging is not only deep, but wide.
[2012-12-24 19:40:05 -0500] tamouse__: better to catch all the hephalumps
[2012-12-24 19:48:49 -0500] sc077: miah: perhaps?  https://gist.github.com/9f69723e76c45a621ca3
[2012-12-24 20:14:26 -0500] Glace: Hey guys, i made the switch from open source to hosted for one of my project and I am getting a 403 on that call
[2012-12-24 20:14:38 -0500] Glace: a post on that /environments/:environment_id/cookbook_versions
[2012-12-24 20:15:07 -0500] Glace: any idea what permissions I need.. I tried everything.. im trying to add a node to an environment and role from chefcc-lient in the s shell
[2012-12-24 20:18:51 -0500] tamouse__: glace: are you using knife?
[2012-12-24 20:19:15 -0500] tamouse__: or chef-client?
[2012-12-24 20:19:17 -0500] Glace: no.. chef-client
[2012-12-24 20:19:28 -0500] tamouse__: i'm still a complete n00b at this
[2012-12-24 20:19:37 -0500] Glace: chef-client -E environment_name -j roles.json
[2012-12-24 20:19:39 -0500] tamouse__: but i use knife to create/edit the node
[2012-12-24 20:19:59 -0500] tamouse__: and upload cookbooks, environments, etc
[2012-12-24 20:20:00 -0500] Glace: hehe ok.. thats fine but I use cloudformation .. I use chef-solo and then chef-client
[2012-12-24 20:20:09 -0500] tamouse__: ok
[2012-12-24 20:20:16 -0500] Glace: its weird.. from the UI.. if I add the roles and environment to the node it works
[2012-12-24 20:20:26 -0500] tamouse__: wasn't sure what you meant by going from opensource to hosted
[2012-12-24 20:20:27 -0500] Glace: but from chef-client.. I get a 403.. some kind of permissions error
[2012-12-24 20:20:31 -0500] tamouse__: we're hosted at opscode
[2012-12-24 20:20:34 -0500] Glace: never had that problem with open source chef
[2012-12-24 20:20:56 -0500] Glace: yes.. now I used Hosted chef at opscode which has a bunch of ACL compared to open source chef
[2012-12-24 20:21:03 -0500] tamouse__: i only use chef-client to deploy
