[2012-12-08 00:08:50 -0500] chip-: Is it possible to have a resource send a notification only on particular actions? If so, any examples?
[2012-12-08 01:21:13 -0500] jonathanmickle: hi is anyone having problems with route53
[2012-12-08 01:21:25 -0500] jonathanmickle: with their chef scripts>
[2012-12-08 04:13:38 -0500] Lunbox: I'm very new to Chef.  I am hoping to use it for automating my rails env.  Does anyone put their Chef-Repo inside of their rails project?
[2012-12-08 04:21:29 -0500] aruntomar: Lunbox: everyone's deployment requirement/strategy may vary. but best option is to look at community cookbooks. if they suite your need use them. if not, create one that suits you.
[2012-12-08 04:27:45 -0500] cwj: Lunbox: personally i suggest keeping your chef repo in a separate repo
[2012-12-08 04:28:20 -0500] cwj: Lunbox: if you use git you could make the chef repo a submodule, if that suits your purposes
[2012-12-08 04:29:30 -0500] Lunbox: cwj: thanks, i like your submodule idea
[2012-12-08 04:29:49 -0500] cwj: depending on how you use chef, you will probably at some point find that you are writing code that should be reused across parts of your infrastructure which aren't directly related to that rails app
[2012-12-08 04:33:03 -0500] Lunbox: cwj: while i agree, how would one customize the environments per app?  often times i find my self tuning settings related to nginx or apache depending on the app, such as the number of workers, etc.  how would one customize settings like this if there is one shared repo for all of my server environments
[2012-12-08 04:33:51 -0500] cwj: Lunbox: a lot of people solve that using roles
[2012-12-08 04:34:28 -0500] cwj: so they write a cookbook which deploys their app, and wire up attributes in that cookbook which control the app's settings
[2012-12-08 04:34:44 -0500] cwj: then the attributes can be overridden at both the role and environment level
[2012-12-08 04:35:38 -0500] cwj: i know there's an 'application' cookbook which many people use for deploying rails apps, but i dont have much experience with that myself
[2012-12-08 04:36:42 -0500] Lunbox: so if i had two different rails apps i was maintaining, i could have 2 different roles, say "MY_GREAT_APP" & "MY_OTHER_GREAT_APP"
[2012-12-08 04:36:48 -0500] cwj: yes
[2012-12-08 04:37:08 -0500] Lunbox: i see, the roles could be specific to my app
[2012-12-08 04:37:45 -0500] Lunbox: thanks a lot
[2012-12-08 04:38:08 -0500] cwj: right, and if you have an environment (e.g. qa or dev) where you need to turn something on or off, you can override the role's settings on a per-environment basis as well
[2012-12-08 04:39:02 -0500] Lunbox: whew, this is quite the learning curve.  luckily i'm already familiar with ruby and git... couple less things to learn
[2012-12-08 04:39:18 -0500] cwj: yeah it can be a bit much
[2012-12-08 04:39:41 -0500] cwj: i didnt know git nor ruby when i started with chef
[2012-12-08 04:39:52 -0500] cwj: and i hadn't used any other configuration management software
[2012-12-08 04:40:27 -0500] cwj: have leveled up a lot :)
[2012-12-08 04:40:52 -0500] Lunbox: for sure.  what chef version do you use mostly?  solo?
[2012-12-08 04:41:05 -0500] cwj: we use chef-client with hosted chef
[2012-12-08 04:41:55 -0500] cwj: i sometimes use solo when developing cookbooks in a vagrant vm
[2012-12-08 04:42:06 -0500] Lunbox: i am getting started with chef-solo.  we use amazon aws for environment, so i am looking into knife-ec2 to bootstrap
[2012-12-08 04:42:45 -0500] cwj: yeah use that all the time myself
[2012-12-08 04:44:18 -0500] Lunbox: can you customize the ruby install knife-ec2 uses?  i've used rvm in the past for my ruby installs.
[2012-12-08 04:46:26 -0500] cwj: you can completely customize the bootstrap scripts used by knife when starting ec2 instances
[2012-12-08 04:46:46 -0500] cwj: https://github.com/opscode/chef/tree/master/lib/chef/knife/bootstrap
[2012-12-08 04:47:40 -0500] cwj: the chef-full template will use the omnnibus installer
[2012-12-08 04:47:57 -0500] cwj: which installs its own ruby environment into /opt/chef
[2012-12-08 04:48:32 -0500] cwj: so you dont have to worry about changes to system ruby for chef
[2012-12-08 04:48:58 -0500] cwj: then you can look at some of the existing cookbooks for rvm
[2012-12-08 04:49:08 -0500] cwj: and see if they meet your needs for setting up rvm for your app
[2012-12-08 04:49:34 -0500] Lunbox: looks great!  thanks!
[2012-12-08 04:50:12 -0500] cwj: https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm
[2012-12-08 04:51:54 -0500] cwj: also, since you are just getting started with your chef repo, might be worth having a gander at http://berkshelf.com/
[2012-12-08 04:52:01 -0500] cwj: its like bundler but for cookbooks
[2012-12-08 04:52:53 -0500] Lunbox: i've also heard of librarian?  is one any better?
[2012-12-08 04:53:04 -0500] cwj: yeah i use librarian also
[2012-12-08 04:53:12 -0500] cwj: at my day job we use it rather
[2012-12-08 04:53:31 -0500] cwj: its fine, but i use berkshelf on my personal projects and i think i like it better
[2012-12-08 04:58:15 -0500] Lunbox: it looks promising.  i didn't see berkshelf in my earlier research
[2012-12-08 05:00:19 -0500] cwj: i don't think you can go wrong either way, they both make managing a chef repo much more sane
[2012-12-08 11:46:23 -0500] WPsites: When you have a number of servers what is the best way to store/manage the IP addresses, both the public facing, pivate service net and VPN (so 3 IPs on each server)
[2012-12-08 11:47:54 -0500] WPsites: need them all in an accessible place so that the services can easily use the correct IP depending upon where the traffic needs to travel (Public, Internal, VPN)
[2012-12-08 11:51:16 -0500] aruntomar: WPsites: ohai keeps a track of all the network interfaces and their ip address etc on the system.
[2012-12-08 11:52:03 -0500] WPsites: I thought they might be somewhere but couldn't see where. I tried showing the node thinking it would be associated to the node but I saw nothing there. How do I access this info?
[2012-12-08 11:52:59 -0500] aruntomar: WPsites: but if you want to store the ip separately, then you can pull the data out of ohai or nodes and push it to a data bags or csv /format of your choice. you can use databags to configure your ip address also.
[2012-12-08 11:54:02 -0500] aruntomar: WPsites: chef > node.network.interfaces.keys
[2012-12-08 11:54:02 -0500] aruntomar:  => ["lo", "eth0", "eth1", "eth2", "br0", "br1", "vnet0", "vnet1", "vnet2", "wlan0", "vnet4", "vnet5", "tun0"]
[2012-12-08 11:54:16 -0500] aruntomar: WPsites: i ran the above command on shef
[2012-12-08 11:54:29 -0500] WPsites: Having that info available on the node seemed like the best thing to me? (but I'm not exactly a pro)
[2012-12-08 11:54:45 -0500] WPsites: you ran the command on Chef?
[2012-12-08 11:55:51 -0500] aruntomar: WPsites: shef is the console for chef, like irb is for ruby
[2012-12-08 11:56:22 -0500] WPsites: can I get at that info using knife on my workstation?
[2012-12-08 11:59:18 -0500] aruntomar: WPsites: yes. knife node show <node name> -l
[2012-12-08 12:00:39 -0500] WPsites: ahhh, thank you very much. I was missing the -l so I got hardly any info! What you just gave me shows everything.
[2012-12-08 12:01:37 -0500] aruntomar: WPsites: :)
[2012-12-08 12:02:15 -0500] WPsites: One further question. Say I wanted to get access to the network->default_gateway of another node, from a recipe running on a different node, how would I access/search that info?
[2012-12-08 12:02:27 -0500] WPsites: By say role
[2012-12-08 13:20:45 -0500] aruntomar: WPsites: if you are running your recipe on a workstation, then you'll have access to all the nodes and their attributes
[2012-12-08 13:38:14 -0500] WPsites: aruntomar: thanks, I think I've got things sorted now. Just need to decide if I should create a data bag for the VPN network info or if I should try and make it all happen automatically based on roles
[2012-12-08 16:03:13 -0500] ssd7: Ohai Chefs
[2012-12-08 16:04:17 -0500] ashp: Alright, today I am going to try and port over a puppet module to chef and see what the fuss is about, wish me luck :)
[2012-12-08 16:10:54 -0500] mattt: ohai
[2012-12-08 16:36:29 -0500] cheflevelramen: Hi guys. Quick question. I'm starting to find that a few of the opscode cookbooks have some yum package dependencies, and that I'd also like to install specific yum packages. So my question is, should I just throw all yum packages into a single cookbook, or should each package be in its own cookbook?
[2012-12-08 16:39:15 -0500] aruntomar: cheflevelramen: in my opinion, if you just need to install the packages eg: supporting libraries etc and don't need to configure them, then by all means throw them in a single cookbook.
[2012-12-08 16:39:52 -0500] cwj: i think its a pretty common pattern to have a 'base' cookbook which installs whatever packages one considers to be "standard equipment"
[2012-12-08 16:42:37 -0500] cheflevelramen: Cool, that's what I figured. Thanks guys
[2012-12-08 19:14:35 -0500] ashp: So far my chef experimentation is going pretty well.  Knife ec2 is light years ahead of how puppet is doing cloud provisioning, I like this so far.
[2012-12-08 22:24:12 -0500] makmanalp: BryanWB__: hey, you wrote chef-rewind, right?
[2012-12-08 22:38:46 -0500] makmanalp: Does anyone know how to get rid of notifications on resources?
[2012-12-08 22:39:01 -0500] makmanalp: like when you define them a second time and it inherits the properties of the first
[2012-12-08 22:39:06 -0500] makmanalp: I want the notifications to disappear
[2012-12-08 23:56:36 -0500] WPsites: I can't search using knife or from within recipes for some reason. Knife keeps saying:    knife search failed: I don't know how to search for data objects   - any ideas?
