[2012-12-02 00:03:07 -0500] siezer: ssd7 hrmm.. actually no
[2012-12-02 00:03:16 -0500] siezer: vagrant in chef-solo mode
[2012-12-02 00:03:17 -0500] siezer: https://gist.github.com/4c89cb74ddbecc3b70b1
[2012-12-02 00:04:30 -0500] ssd7: hrmm
[2012-12-02 00:04:48 -0500] siezer: sec playing around with it
[2012-12-02 00:05:19 -0500] ssd7: I believe there is a -s for solo mode, might be closer to what you need than -z
[2012-12-02 00:15:38 -0500] siezer: no dice. =\
[2012-12-02 00:15:50 -0500] siezer: maybe I should bite the bullet and learn me ruby
[2012-12-02 00:17:21 -0500] gchristensen: its not difficult
[2012-12-02 00:17:44 -0500] siezer: yea I've just been holding out in solidarity with my fellow neckbeards
[2012-12-02 00:18:24 -0500] gchristensen: you can remain a neckbeard and know ruby :) I know a few who have done it successfully
[2012-12-02 00:18:32 -0500] gchristensen: though the rest were wrecked. Shaved it all off.
[2012-12-02 00:18:38 -0500] gchristensen: Got skinny jeans.
[2012-12-02 00:18:56 -0500] siezer: I know more than enough to *use* chef, its just extending chef and using the console where I get a little confused still
[2012-12-02 00:19:07 -0500] siezer: what with all the mixins and junk
[2012-12-02 00:20:27 -0500] siezer: for example: current problem: trying to get chef-solo / vagrant to load cookbook resources / providers so I can debug somebody else's LWRP.
[2012-12-02 00:20:41 -0500] siezer: not really documented, so its code-diving time
[2012-12-02 00:21:09 -0500] siezer: er, sorry shef -s not chef-solo
[2012-12-02 00:47:52 -0500] ssd7: siezer: Yeah, just digging into that code, looks like a bug in solo mode
[2012-12-02 00:48:45 -0500] ssd7: might be wrong, still looking
[2012-12-02 01:45:22 -0500] jtran: i've set an override attribute in my environment  for 'network_interfaces' = 'eth0'.   The default was 'bond0'.   however, from the recipe when it access the node[foo][network_interfaces] , it sees  eth0 AND bond0 in an array
[2012-12-02 01:46:00 -0500] jtran: is there a way to override so that the default value simply is overwritten instead?
[2012-12-02 02:23:58 -0500] juliancdunn: jtran: nope, because those are automatic attributes collected by Ohai and they have the highest precedence
[2012-12-02 03:24:14 -0500] flowersj: anyone on that knows about test kitchen?
[2012-12-02 03:27:39 -0500] flowersj: trying to get a test windows box going
[2012-12-02 03:27:52 -0500] flowersj: that is a guest windows test instance
[2012-12-02 03:29:07 -0500] flowersj: currently getting this error in a kitchen test run:

[2012-12-02 03:39:41 -0500] flowersj: ooh I forgot some settings to make in the vagrant file
[2012-12-02 03:39:50 -0500] flowersj: now I get this error:

[2012-12-02 03:49:03 -0500] flowersj: anyone know how to turn on log level debug for vagrant in a test kitchen execution?
[2012-12-02 05:38:49 -0500] rgarver: is there a chef approved way to setup / as noatime (eg: remount with the new option and update fstab if the setting needs to be changed)?
[2012-12-02 05:41:04 -0500] rgarver: the mount resource appears to not remount with options properly
[2012-12-02 05:42:26 -0500] alex__: how can I create, edit and delete databags from a ruby script? I have a rake task that needs to be able to create a databatg. thanks
[2012-12-02 06:51:27 -0500] mio: chef does not update attributes after I modify a role. What am i missing?
[2012-12-02 13:11:18 -0500] pattersonc: i'm getting this error after installing system-wide ruby using rbenv with bundler specified: No such file or directory - bundle install --deployment
[2012-12-02 13:11:48 -0500] pattersonc: however, when i ssh into the machine the cmd runs fine. is there anything i need to do to make the rbenv installation available while chef is running?
[2012-12-02 13:12:05 -0500] pattersonc: im using fnichol's rbenv cookbook
[2012-12-02 13:18:09 -0500] pattersonc: i'm guessing I need to reload the shell but not sure exactly how
[2012-12-02 13:58:23 -0500] shija03: Hi all
[2012-12-02 14:00:49 -0500] shija03: Question - I am a newbee and I am trying to get started with chef :) - but I am rather confused as to which documentation to use - there is the http://docs.opscode.com and there is also the http://wiki.opscode.com, and many times the code on wikiopscode.com makes reference that the doc has moved to docs.opscode.com, yet, I have just signed up for the hosted chef trial, and the doc jumps you to the wikiopscode.com - so which is the doc to 
[2012-12-02 14:32:37 -0500] z: shija03: they're both valid
[2012-12-02 14:32:48 -0500] z: shija03: docs.opscode.com is new and stuff is still being put into it
[2012-12-02 14:37:04 -0500] pattersonc: i guess I can try to exec /etc/profile.d/rbenv.sh before running bundle install
[2012-12-02 14:37:37 -0500] pattersonc: i imagine that's whats setting up rbenv on subsequent logins
[2012-12-02 14:39:46 -0500] pattersonc: shija03: there is a quickstart section in the documentation
[2012-12-02 14:40:50 -0500] ssd7: pattersonc: You'll want to source rather than exec if you go that route.
[2012-12-02 14:44:36 -0500] pattersonc: ssd7: I'm wondering why this is not done by default? will execute "source ..." do the trick?
[2012-12-02 14:45:29 -0500] pattersonc: if someone is provisioning a server with rbenv and setting default or systemwide rubies, I would think it would go ahead and load the rbenv functions for immediate usage
[2012-12-02 14:54:40 -0500] ssd7: pattersonc: I think it would violate a lot of people's expectations if we did too much modification to the environment we get by default
[2012-12-02 14:56:38 -0500] pattersonc: ssd7: by that approach some of the LWRP that are documented in the cookbook will not work unless the user manually sources rbenv.sh
[2012-12-02 14:57:15 -0500] pattersonc: for context im using https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rbenv
[2012-12-02 14:58:31 -0500] pattersonc: it is working perfectly for setting up system wide ruby but if i want to use a 'rbenv_script' it doesn't work by default
[2012-12-02 14:58:57 -0500] pattersonc: it complains that it doesn't know about rbenv because the env is not setup
[2012-12-02 14:59:30 -0500] ssd7: pattersonc: We don't maintain that cookbook, and looking at the issues on github for it, it appears that this bug has been filed with the upstream maintainer.
[2012-12-02 15:01:08 -0500] pattersonc: ssd7: amazing. i swear i was looking to see if this issue was reported bc it didn't make sense to me. i guess i shouldn't be working on a sunday!
[2012-12-02 15:01:58 -0500] ssd7: pattersonc: The difference you are seeing when you log in versus running Chef via other means is likely the difference between interactive login shells and non-interactive or non-login shells.  Depending on your shell, you could also modify the cookbook to make sure rbenv's setup is included in the environment of every type of shell.
[2012-12-02 15:04:43 -0500] pattersonc: ssd7: yep. there is a work around detailed in the issue. I am going to give that a try.
[2012-12-02 15:08:29 -0500] pattersonc: ssd7: thanks for pushing me in the right direction
[2012-12-02 15:40:05 -0500] pattersonc: i can't seem for find anything on how to source a file in chef - anyone have an example?
[2012-12-02 17:09:57 -0500] jhayden: a quick question for any master chefs online today
[2012-12-02 17:10:41 -0500] jhayden: does anyone know how to give nodes in auto scale groups their names through chef?
[2012-12-02 17:11:58 -0500] jhayden: ie: a group has a min or 3 and a max of 6 servers, the first 3 at least should have node names of foo-001 foo-002 and foo-003
[2012-12-02 17:12:31 -0500] jhayden: this is the node name and not the name tag
[2012-12-02 17:49:59 -0500] subsume: I kinda need some provisioning help, anyone available for hire for some linode chef scripts?
[2012-12-02 19:35:01 -0500] pattersonc: is there anyway to source a file to reload env changes from within a chef recipe?
[2012-12-02 19:41:48 -0500] bsdguru: how are template supposed to work in ruby_blocks?
[2012-12-02 19:42:04 -0500] bougyman: bsdguru: what do you mean/
[2012-12-02 19:42:19 -0500] bougyman: you'd have to manually parse it using ERB calls, if you were in a ruby_block
[2012-12-02 19:42:33 -0500] bsdguru: I need to delay running some commands to obtain some variables.  The scripts only get installed on a chef run so they don't exist before the first run.
[2012-12-02 19:42:49 -0500] bougyman: chicken and egg redux
[2012-12-02 19:43:29 -0500] bougyman: what kind of variables? can you make them attributes or data bags or something external to the run's flow itself?
[2012-12-02 19:43:55 -0500] bougyman: pattersonc: I use chpst for that.
[2012-12-02 19:44:08 -0500] bougyman: chpst -e ./env command <args>
[2012-12-02 19:44:10 -0500] bsdguru: else one has to manually do stuff like (cd /var/chef/cookbooks/sharecell && /root/bin/z usr-local-xzy && cd svcadm clear chef-solo)
[2012-12-02 19:44:18 -0500] bougyman: or envdir does the same.
[2012-12-02 19:44:19 -0500] bsdguru: and rinse and repeat
[2012-12-02 19:44:29 -0500] bougyman: envdir is part of daemontools, chpst part of runit
[2012-12-02 19:45:55 -0500] pattersonc: bougyman: im using the rbenv cookbook to setup a systemwide ruby but it uses an init script to setup the environment. there seems to be an issue where that script is not run on the initial convergance
[2012-12-02 19:46:32 -0500] bsdguru: https://gist.github.com/ba65c273538f34cd2d0a is what I'm trying to get working
[2012-12-02 19:46:37 -0500] bsdguru: to reduce issues
[2012-12-02 19:46:38 -0500] bougyman: hah, i'm right there with you both, been fighting both of these problems this week.
[2012-12-02 19:46:51 -0500] bsdguru: I still have 60-odd zones to finish chef runs on
[2012-12-02 19:47:19 -0500] bougyman: but i've been finding ways to workaround them. probably bad practice, but setting node attributes in recipes has helped a bunch, and I created a couple LWRP to abstract other stuff way.
[2012-12-02 19:47:54 -0500] pattersonc: bougyman: have you found a workable solution? i have had to hardcode some paths in my conf files. very ugly.
[2012-12-02 19:48:12 -0500] bougyman: bsdguru: that seems like a lot of work to turn it into a fancy Chef::Resource::Template instead of just the 3 lines it would take to use ERB yourself.
[2012-12-02 19:49:00 -0500] bougyman: but is it not working or what?
[2012-12-02 19:49:55 -0500] bsdguru: not working since I moved it to a ruby_block (for the scripts that don't exist)
[2012-12-02 19:50:00 -0500] bsdguru: on first chef-run
[2012-12-02 19:50:07 -0500] bsdguru: which causes chef to bail out
[2012-12-02 19:50:44 -0500] bougyman: and see, bsdguru i'd put those scripts as individual execute blocks which set node variables.
[2012-12-02 19:50:59 -0500] bougyman: then just use a standard template block
[2012-12-02 19:51:29 -0500] bougyman: you can do only_if "file /path/to/script" in those execute blocks to avoid chicken and egg
[2012-12-02 19:53:07 -0500] bsdguru: requires two chef-run - which takes over three hours on first run (the pkgin command slows down like crazy when installing packages once I get over 300+ packages)
[2012-12-02 20:08:08 -0500] ssd7: There was an article floating around last week that compared various testing packges for Chef.  Anyone happen to have a  link?
[2012-12-02 20:13:42 -0500] redblacktree: using chef-solo with vagrant.  I can install Python successfully; now I want to use the python_pip LWRP, but I seem to be missing something obvious. I tried adding part of the example from here http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/python, but I get: "undefined method `python_pip' for"
[2012-12-02 20:14:43 -0500] redblacktree: This is my role file: http://pastebin.com/ALhGsTC4
[2012-12-02 20:15:37 -0500] redblacktree: guess I'll need a new password. :)
[2012-12-02 20:15:53 -0500] ssd7: redblacktree: So, just to be clear, you have the python_pip resource in the role's definition itself?
[2012-12-02 20:16:41 -0500] ssd7: redblacktree: If so, that won't work.  What you'll want to do is make a cookbook with a recipe that includes that resource.  roles are just a run_list with some attributes
[2012-12-02 20:17:05 -0500] redblacktree: ah, now I understand your quesiton.
[2012-12-02 20:17:18 -0500] redblacktree: yeah, I have it in the role's definition.
[2012-12-02 20:17:39 -0500] redblacktree: ok, I guess I need to learn how to make a cookbook.
[2012-12-02 20:19:45 -0500] redblacktree: thanks, ssd7
[2012-12-02 20:20:38 -0500] ssd7: redblacktree: No problem!
[2012-12-02 20:31:25 -0500] jmickle_: hello can anyone make me feel stupid for a minute? :-P
[2012-12-02 20:32:51 -0500] jmickle_: having problems formatting one of the json sections in a role
[2012-12-02 20:35:09 -0500] gchristensen: jmickle_: look up a json formatter, it might give you some good help (my go-to is jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com )
[2012-12-02 20:35:29 -0500] jmickle_: ok ty
[2012-12-02 20:35:42 -0500] gchristensen: you're welcome
[2012-12-02 20:35:50 -0500] jmickle_: 'servers' => [{'port' => '6379'}, {'port' => '6380'}]
[2012-12-02 20:35:56 -0500] jmickle_: that should be an array in json right?
[2012-12-02 20:36:04 -0500] jmickle_: using the redisio recipe
[2012-12-02 20:39:34 -0500] redblacktree: I'm trying to follow this guide (http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Workstation+Setup+for+Mac+OS+X) to create my first cookbook, but I'm using chef-solo with vagrant.  I'm not sure what to do when I get to the section "Create a Configuration Folder" -- it has choices for the hosted/private vs. open-source servers, but nothing about chef-solo.
[2012-12-02 20:40:41 -0500] redblacktree: Can I just skip that section altogether?
[2012-12-02 20:42:40 -0500] jmickle_: i think you can just skip it redblacktree
[2012-12-02 20:43:13 -0500] redblacktree: jmickle_: Ok, thanks.  It looks like I'll still want to create the directory and run "knife configure" -- does that sound right?
[2012-12-02 20:43:46 -0500] jmickle_: well you will want to create a configuration folder that holds your boostrap items
[2012-12-02 20:43:51 -0500] jmickle_: and general configs
[2012-12-02 20:44:02 -0500] jmickle_: i think what you will skip is creating a knife.rb file for a server
[2012-12-02 20:44:06 -0500] jmickle_: i could be wrong though
[2012-12-02 20:44:55 -0500] redblacktree: jmickle_: Ok, so I'll just create the .chef folder and move on for now
[2012-12-02 20:45:06 -0500] jmickle_: yeah try that
[2012-12-02 20:45:16 -0500] jmickle_: you can always back up if it fails
[2012-12-02 20:45:36 -0500] redblacktree: It's a little annoying to ignore this warning, but I'll get over it: "WARNING: No knife configuration file found"
[2012-12-02 20:46:49 -0500] jmickle_: i found this on google
[2012-12-02 20:46:50 -0500] jmickle_:  https://gist.github.com/1501318
[2012-12-02 20:47:18 -0500] jmickle_: i haven't actually used chef-solo so I'm not sure
[2012-12-02 20:47:23 -0500] jmickle_: i always run a server
[2012-12-02 20:47:26 -0500] redblacktree: jmickle_: Awesome.  Thanks for that.
[2012-12-02 20:48:02 -0500] redblacktree: jmickle_: My high-level goal is to create a vagrant setup.  Learning chef is a nice bonus, but is secondary to that.
[2012-12-02 20:48:13 -0500] jmickle_: yeah
[2012-12-02 20:48:27 -0500] jmickle_: thats my next goal is to get vagrant setup :-P
[2012-12-02 20:49:39 -0500] redblacktree: jmickle_: I can't wait.  I've got a couple of novice developers on the team, and it's nightmare to make sure everyone's environments work.  Now I can configure it once any time I need a new package, etc.
[2012-12-02 20:50:15 -0500] jmickle_: :-) yeah my team has done some pretty awesome things with chef already as well
[2012-12-02 20:52:32 -0500] tknerr: ohai guys
[2012-12-02 20:53:17 -0500] ssd7: ohai
[2012-12-02 20:54:26 -0500] tknerr: anybody using the minitest-handler cookbook?
[2012-12-02 20:54:57 -0500] tknerr: i'm gettings loads of error output when I have the minitest-handler cookbook in the runlist
[2012-12-02 20:55:05 -0500] tknerr: like this: https://gist.github.com/4191017
[2012-12-02 20:55:27 -0500] redblacktree: thanks again, jmickle_ That gist was exactly what I needed.
[2012-12-02 20:56:02 -0500] jmickle_: no worries
[2012-12-02 20:56:03 -0500] tknerr: can't imagine that this is the normal behaviour for minitest-handler, is it?
[2012-12-02 21:01:28 -0500] tknerr_: oops disconnected
[2012-12-02 21:22:35 -0500] ssd7: tknerr_: Actually, from what I can see that is the normal behavior.  I was actually just going to sit down to see if there was anything we could do about it.
[2012-12-02 21:22:42 -0500] ssd7: It makes test-kitchen output confusing
[2012-12-02 21:24:15 -0500] tknerr_: @ssd7: weird - since the minitest tests in each cookbook's files directory are optional, i would not expect such a big error trace when they are not present
[2012-12-02 21:24:31 -0500] tknerr_: @ssd7: a log WARN should be enough there
[2012-12-02 21:28:15 -0500] ssd7: Indeed
[2012-12-02 21:34:47 -0500] tknerr_: got to go
[2012-12-02 21:34:49 -0500] tknerr_: cu!
[2012-12-02 21:39:08 -0500] redblacktree: Thanks again, ssd7, jmickle_.  I've got vagrant building my machine with python and some python packages through pip.
[2012-12-02 21:39:09 -0500] jmickle_: whats the *%w mean in front of a [ on run_list?
[2012-12-02 21:41:08 -0500] cwj: its a shorthand way of creating an array of strings
[2012-12-02 21:41:12 -0500] cwj: %w[ foo bar ] == ['foo','bar']
[2012-12-02 21:41:26 -0500] cwj: the %w separates at word boundaries
[2012-12-02 21:43:11 -0500] cwj: also a number of different symbols can be used instead of square brackets, e.g. %w( ), %w{ }, %w! !
[2012-12-02 21:46:15 -0500] jmickle_: ty
[2012-12-02 21:46:41 -0500] jmickle_: I'm having hard time getting a role working
[2012-12-02 21:46:53 -0500] jmickle_: saying this is bad json
[2012-12-02 21:46:56 -0500] jmickle_: default_attributes({
[2012-12-02 21:46:57 -0500] jmickle_:   'redisio' => {

[2012-12-02 21:47:01 -0500] jmickle_: })
[2012-12-02 21:48:09 -0500] jmickle_: any idea?
[2012-12-02 21:52:50 -0500] cwj: well thats not json at all
[2012-12-02 21:52:57 -0500] cwj: is your file named .rb or .json?
[2012-12-02 21:53:49 -0500] cwj: the content you pasted is ruby, so if the role file is named with a .json suffix you will probably have problems uploading it
[2012-12-02 21:54:05 -0500] jmickle_: heres what I'm converting it to so far
[2012-12-02 21:54:14 -0500] jmickle_:   "default_attributes": {
[2012-12-02 21:54:15 -0500] jmickle_:    'redisio': {

[2012-12-02 21:54:31 -0500] cwj: btw please use gist.github.com or pastebin instead of pasting directly into irc
[2012-12-02 21:54:39 -0500] jmickle_: ok sorry
[2012-12-02 21:54:46 -0500] cwj: otherwise your formatting gets lost or things get cut off etc

[2012-12-02 21:56:40 -0500] cwj: so your first problem is that you are trying to put key value pairs inside an array
[2012-12-02 21:57:07 -0500] cwj: e.g. in servers and default_settings
[2012-12-02 21:57:14 -0500] cwj: [ ] are arrays, {} are hashes
[2012-12-02 21:57:39 -0500] jmickle_: oh dangit
[2012-12-02 21:58:16 -0500] cwj: jsonlint.com is a very helpful tool, btw
[2012-12-02 21:58:40 -0500] cwj: or you can probably install jshon pretty easily if you want something to run locally
[2012-12-02 21:58:50 -0500] cwj: http://kmkeen.com/jshon/
[2012-12-02 21:59:10 -0500] jmickle_: ok
[2012-12-02 21:59:11 -0500] jmickle_: ty
[2012-12-02 21:59:16 -0500] cwj: np
[2012-12-02 21:59:29 -0500] jmickle_: so those ['s should just be {
[2012-12-02 21:59:34 -0500] jmickle_: right?
[2012-12-02 21:59:41 -0500] jmickle_: or do i have to go back to the =>
[2012-12-02 21:59:53 -0500] jmickle_: well no => is the ruby
[2012-12-02 22:00:25 -0500] jmickle_: (i suck at json)
[2012-12-02 22:02:46 -0500] cwj: => is ruby
[2012-12-02 22:02:56 -0500] cwj: known as the hashrocket
[2012-12-02 22:04:41 -0500] jmickle_: yeah i realized that after i said it lol
[2012-12-02 22:07:37 -0500] cwj: http://pastebin.com/YWp1bnNC
[2012-12-02 22:07:57 -0500] cwj: thats json for the ruby you initially pasted
[2012-12-02 22:16:44 -0500] jmickle_: ah thank you so much cwj
[2012-12-02 22:17:00 -0500] jmickle_: i see where i went wrong now
[2012-12-02 22:19:13 -0500] cwj: no problem, glad to help
[2012-12-02 22:20:05 -0500] jmickle_: any good references to lean json better?
[2012-12-02 22:21:35 -0500] cwj: i believe json.org is the definitive source for the specification
[2012-12-02 22:21:47 -0500] cwj: you can experiment with ruby and json via irb
[2012-12-02 22:21:51 -0500] jmickle_: ok
[2012-12-02 22:21:53 -0500] jmickle_: ty
[2012-12-02 22:22:24 -0500] cwj: e.g. require 'json' ; some_hash = { "foo" : [ 'bar', 'baz', 'derp' ] } ; some_hash.to_json
[2012-12-02 22:22:29 -0500] cwj: bbiab
[2012-12-02 23:25:09 -0500] WPsites: I'm trying to edit a role and it's got a grok pattern in the json which is making the json invalid   "pattern": '<%{POSINT:syslog_pri}>%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:syslog_timestamp} %{SYSLOGHOST:syslog_hostname}
[2012-12-02 23:25:30 -0500] WPsites: how do I make that valid? I think it's the <
[2012-12-02 23:26:55 -0500] cwj: well json expects double quotes around both keys and values
[2012-12-02 23:27:10 -0500] cwj: looks like your pattern might be single quoted?
[2012-12-02 23:27:30 -0500] WPsites: ok well I've tried that but that didn't help. I started with it double and then tried single when it didn't work
[2012-12-02 23:29:34 -0500] WPsites: hmmm, false alarm. I must have had a spare comma at the end of the line initially that caused it to be invalid then prob put that right without thinking about it and then was looking for other issues. So it works find using the double again
[2012-12-02 23:41:13 -0500] redblacktree: Using vagrant and chef-solo. Help me identify the error?  I can't seem to find the relevant parts.  Here's the output from "vagrant up": http://pastebin.com/G2DGQK0c  And the stack trace it references:  http://pastebin.com/ajs8z25U
[2012-12-02 23:42:05 -0500] redblacktree: The error is with installing this cookbook http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/postgresql
[2012-12-02 23:49:42 -0500] cwj: redblacktree: not a lot of actionable information there, running chef-solo at debug log level might reveal more
[2012-12-02 23:50:23 -0500] cwj: theres probably some yum command that is exiting with a non-zero return code
