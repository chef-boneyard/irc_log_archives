[2012-12-01 00:07:59 -0500] masterkorp: Aww my cousin is making some cool stuff in computercraft
[2012-12-01 00:08:05 -0500] masterkorp: and it uses vim
[2012-12-01 00:14:58 -0500] ranjibd: weekend is here. lets get drunk
[2012-12-01 00:15:40 -0500] ranjibd: im new in Bay area.. and tried the IPA dirty bustards last friday.. man it was something :-/
[2012-12-01 00:20:54 -0500] jhunter: hey, so like.. what's the proper way to make an API call for a particular role?
[2012-12-01 00:21:14 -0500] jhunter: using shef
[2012-12-01 00:21:15 -0500] jhunter: chef > puts api.get("/roles/")
[2012-12-01 00:21:18 -0500] jhunter: lists 'em all
[2012-12-01 00:21:32 -0500] jhunter: but taking one from the output yields
[2012-12-01 00:21:33 -0500] jhunter: chef > puts api.get("/roles/cacti")
[2012-12-01 00:21:34 -0500] jhunter: role[cacti] => nil
[2012-12-01 00:21:34 -0500] jhunter: chef >
[2012-12-01 00:21:39 -0500] jhunter: wtfsies
[2012-12-01 00:25:05 -0500] yfeldblum: jhunter, https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/role.rb#L180-L196
[2012-12-01 00:25:22 -0500] jhunter: aha
[2012-12-01 00:25:28 -0500] jhunter: chef > puts api.get("/roles/cacti").env_run_lists
[2012-12-01 00:25:32 -0500] jhunter: kk.. thx sie
[2012-12-01 00:25:36 -0500] yfeldblum: jhunter, role_names = Chef::Role.list ; first_role = Chef::Role.load(role_names.first)
[2012-12-01 00:25:37 -0500] jhunter: sir* (or madam)
[2012-12-01 00:43:13 -0500] jwcarman: After doing "gem install berkshelf", I do not have a "berks" command on my PATH.  Is that supposed to be there?
[2012-12-01 00:46:30 -0500] jwcarman: The directions seem to assume I'll have a "berks" command
[2012-12-01 00:52:08 -0500] spox: jwcarman: indeed, it does provide a berks command
[2012-12-01 01:09:08 -0500] jwcarman: spox: I wonder why it's not on my path?
[2012-12-01 01:09:21 -0500] jwcarman: I'm trying again without using rvm
[2012-12-01 01:09:32 -0500] spox: how did you install?
[2012-12-01 01:10:13 -0500] spox: if you are using rvm installed in your homedir, and you sudo'd the install, it may have thrown it into the system ruby or something
[2012-12-01 01:12:08 -0500] jwcarman: I removed rvm and just installed it with the "system" ruby and it worked fine
[2012-12-01 01:12:14 -0500] jwcarman: Now I'm berkshelfing like a champ
[2012-12-01 01:17:29 -0500] maplebed: anybody here using the nagios cookbook and the nrpe LWRP?
[2012-12-01 02:48:58 -0500] tolland: any issues with the community cookbooks site atm?
[2012-12-01 03:52:19 -0500] andg: so I'm trying to work through a provisioning tier for linux and windows systems and was wondering if anyone had a good blog link to read
[2012-12-01 03:54:55 -0500] andg: I guess I should ask a question.  How do I define services in a way that they are connected to other resources.  I would like advice how to be able to deploy mongo, redis, and a unicorn/rails instance in a way that I can configure if they are on one node or split amung replica sets and or even multiple instances on a single server.
[2012-12-01 23:01:24 -0500] flowersj: I have created a windows base box with veewee and would like to use it with test kitchen
[2012-12-01 23:01:32 -0500] flowersj: how do I add it to test kitchen?
[2012-12-01 23:02:10 -0500] flowersj: do I edit test-kitchen-0.6.0/config/Kitchenfile?
[2012-12-01 23:17:24 -0500] ssd7: flowersj: You can add a custom Kitchenfile to your cookbook that include the configuration for that new box
[2012-12-01 23:37:49 -0500] siezer: using Vagrant, how would I load the local cookbooks with shef so I can test an LWRP?
[2012-12-01 23:39:39 -0500] cnf: the terminology for this stuff sucks! :/
[2012-12-01 23:39:49 -0500] siezer: ?
[2012-12-01 23:39:55 -0500] siezer: what terminology
[2012-12-01 23:40:08 -0500] cnf: googling for chef kitchen file is just meh :P
[2012-12-01 23:40:14 -0500] siezer: tack "opscode" on it
[2012-12-01 23:40:42 -0500] cnf: tsp to ruin a good rant!
[2012-12-01 23:42:21 -0500] siezer: =)
[2012-12-01 23:51:45 -0500] ssd7: siezer: If you start shef in client mode with shef -c /etc/chef/client.rb -z you should get all the necessary cookbooks loaded
[2012-12-01 23:52:31 -0500] ssd7: If you want to load their run lists, see
[2012-12-01 23:52:32 -0500] ssd7: node.run_list.expand(node.chef_environment).recipes.each do |r| include_recipe r
[2012-12-01 23:52:32 -0500] ssd7: end
[2012-12-01 23:52:38 -0500] ssd7: err, bad paste
[2012-12-01 23:52:44 -0500] ssd7: hopefully you get the gist
[2012-12-01 23:55:26 -0500] siezer: thanks
