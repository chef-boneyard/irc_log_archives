[2012-12-29 04:55:23 -0500] pauln415: hello, does anyone know whether you can decrypt an encrypted data bag json file?
[2012-12-29 05:02:09 -0500] tamouse__: yes
[2012-12-29 05:02:14 -0500] tamouse__: you need the data key
[2012-12-29 05:02:18 -0500] pauln415: i have it
[2012-12-29 05:02:34 -0500] pauln415: i uploaded the wrong data to the chef server
[2012-12-29 05:03:01 -0500] pauln415: i need to revert by decrypting the previous encrypted databag.json
[2012-12-29 05:03:08 -0500] pauln415: how do you do it?
[2012-12-29 05:03:10 -0500] tamouse__: knife data bag edit secure ENV --secret-file PATH/TO/Data_Key
[2012-12-29 05:03:33 -0500] tamouse__: where ENV is whatever is in your secure data bag
[2012-12-29 05:04:07 -0500] pauln415: can ENV be the encrypted databag json file?
[2012-12-29 05:04:20 -0500] tamouse__: i think that's it
[2012-12-29 05:04:31 -0500] tamouse__: the one i work with, forex, is "qa"
[2012-12-29 05:04:50 -0500] tamouse__: and it's the creds i need when running my qa tests
[2012-12-29 05:05:25 -0500] tamouse__: anyway, when i run that, the unencrypted json is splatched to my $EDITOR
[2012-12-29 05:05:48 -0500] pauln415: what's the secure keyword?
[2012-12-29 05:06:00 -0500] tamouse__: after i update it and save/close the file in the $EDITOR, it gets saved back up
[2012-12-29 05:06:05 -0500] tamouse__: that's one of our data bags
[2012-12-29 05:06:15 -0500] tamouse__: you can list them with knife data bag list
[2012-12-29 05:07:09 -0500] pauln415: it doesn't seem to work.
[2012-12-29 05:07:20 -0500] pauln415: saying no routes match request
[2012-12-29 05:07:23 -0500] tamouse__: i'm just guessing right now (still a n00b) but the items in secure correspond to our environments
[2012-12-29 05:07:50 -0500] pauln415: i'm trying to decrypt an encrypted data bag json on the filesystem
[2012-12-29 05:07:58 -0500] tamouse__: if you just do knife data bag list, what do you get?
[2012-12-29 05:08:03 -0500] tamouse__: oh
[2012-12-29 05:08:08 -0500] tamouse__: not in the server?
[2012-12-29 05:08:15 -0500] pauln415: no
[2012-12-29 05:08:23 -0500] tamouse__: oh crikey, sorry, i misunderstood
[2012-12-29 05:08:42 -0500] pauln415: that's my problem, i uploaded the wrong data, i'm now trying to restore from previous encrypted data bag json file
[2012-12-29 05:09:14 -0500] tamouse__: do you have the gpg keys it's encrypted with?
[2012-12-29 05:09:28 -0500] pauln415: i have the secret
[2012-12-29 05:09:38 -0500] pauln415: secret-file
[2012-12-29 05:10:46 -0500] pauln415: thanks
[2012-12-29 05:10:46 -0500] tamouse__: i am not at work, sadly
[2012-12-29 05:10:57 -0500] tamouse__: or i could look and see
[2012-12-29 07:02:11 -0500] pauln415: is it possible to load an encrypted data bag json file to a chef server using 'knife data bag from file'
[2012-12-29 07:59:53 -0500] cwj: pauln415: yes, add --secret-file /path/to/encryption/key
[2012-12-29 08:00:32 -0500] cwj: oh you have the data already encrypted?
[2012-12-29 08:00:37 -0500] pauln415: cwj: yeah
[2012-12-29 08:00:59 -0500] pauln415: i'm trying to revert to a previous version which is already encrypted
[2012-12-29 08:01:38 -0500] cwj: well when you upload using --secret-file it is encrypting only the values
[2012-12-29 08:01:46 -0500] pauln415: i think the typical process is to input a unencrypted json, using secret-file, which will encrypt the data and place it on the server
[2012-12-29 08:01:50 -0500] cwj: yeah
[2012-12-29 08:01:56 -0500] pauln415: i don't have the previous unencrypted file
[2012-12-29 08:02:14 -0500] cwj: if your file just has encrypted values i would think you can upload it without --secret-file
[2012-12-29 08:02:17 -0500] cwj: but i have never tried that
[2012-12-29 08:03:14 -0500] pauln415: yeah, me neither.  i'm wondering if i could create a new data bag, and upload the encrypted json to the server without secret-file.
[2012-12-29 08:04:04 -0500] pauln415: then download that and unencrypt it using 'knife data bag show -Fj'
[2012-12-29 08:05:25 -0500] pauln415: cwj: would this be syntax? knife data bag from file databag_name encrypted.json
[2012-12-29 08:05:35 -0500] cwj: yep
[2012-12-29 08:07:15 -0500] pauln415: from the docs, it doesn't include databag_name
[2012-12-29 08:07:17 -0500] pauln415: knife data bag from file DATA_BAG_NAME_or_PATH
[2012-12-29 08:19:37 -0500] pauln415: doesn't look like i can do it
[2012-12-29 08:19:55 -0500] pauln415: getting this: ERROR: Yajl::ParseError: lexical error: invalid character inside string.

[2012-12-29 16:02:38 -0500] rajdeep_: hi i  am new to chef. Just wanted to know the best way to get started with taking up chef and using in my current infrastructure
[2012-12-29 16:11:45 -0500] mattt: jblaine: :(
[2012-12-29 16:12:21 -0500] mattt: rajdeep_: i've been using a combo of http://wiki.opscode.com and http://docs.opscode.com
[2012-12-29 16:13:35 -0500] mattt: rajdeep_: there are also chef summit videos on http://confreaks.com that i've found interesting

[2012-12-29 16:16:50 -0500] rajdeep_: mattt: thanks for the links
[2012-12-29 16:17:27 -0500] mattt: rajdeep_: np, i'm just starting out too, so can't offer much more insight than that :P
[2012-12-29 16:20:58 -0500] rajdeep_: mattt: so I just started with puppet very basic not much fancy but my new company has already got chef in place so starting with chef
[2012-12-29 16:25:12 -0500] mattt: rajdeep_: give it a shot on some cloud instances, VMs, or something
[2012-12-29 16:25:24 -0500] mattt: it feels quite a bit different to puppet

[2012-12-29 19:57:35 -0500] cheflevelramen: Hi guys, quick question. I'm trying to use a resource inside a ruby block, and I'm not sure how to call the resource. I need to access a call, but I'm not sure of the location since I believe chef generates the class at compile time.
[2012-12-29 19:57:44 -0500] cheflevelramen: Basically, I'm trying to do this:

[2012-12-29 19:58:32 -0500] cheflevelramen: I need to do this for the aws/ebs_volume.rb provider
[2012-12-29 19:58:52 -0500] cheflevelramen: Could someone with more programming/chef experience give me an example of how I would do that?
[2012-12-29 19:59:16 -0500] cheflevelramen: *access a class
[2012-12-29 20:20:00 -0500] cheflevelramen: Nevermind, figured it out. I found out how to turn on 'tracing on' in shef, and from there I was able to find this class: Chef::Resource::AwsEbsVolume
[2012-12-29 23:33:59 -0500] derks: is it possible to 'include' anything in a knife.rb?
[2012-12-29 23:34:58 -0500] derks: as in, i'm using knife-block... but want to have all the common stuff in one file that all the other knife-XXX files can include
