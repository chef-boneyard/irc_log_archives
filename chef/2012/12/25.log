[2012-12-25 10:08:07 -0500] poseid: I am playing with chef-solo and some basic packages... does it make sense to run omnibus updater with chef-solo ?
[2012-12-25 10:08:30 -0500] poseid: right now, I repeat vagrant provision often, because some apt-get update might have problems...
[2012-12-25 10:14:05 -0500] poseid: also I run into problems when using: libsqlite3-dev
[2012-12-25 10:14:31 -0500] poseid: Depends: libsqlite3-0 (= 3.7.9-2ubuntu1) but 3.7.9-2ubuntu1.1

[2012-12-25 13:00:25 -0500] yann2: hello!  Can I call a library from a cookbook without including the cookbook specifically?
[2012-12-25 13:00:35 -0500] yann2: like cookbook:library ?
[2012-12-25 15:46:26 -0500] aruntomar: yann2: you need to add the cookbook as a dependency in metadata.rb and then you can use the libraries or resources etc from that cookbook.
[2012-12-25 16:28:40 -0500] yann2: aruntomar, oh, good to know. thanks.
