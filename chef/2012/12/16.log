[2012-12-16 01:42:24 -0500] WPsites: what is the easiest way for me to change the boot order of the apache service?
[2012-12-16 12:51:30 -0500] kesor: can I run chef-client with just one role, so that it will not change the node role list?
[2012-12-16 16:30:48 -0500] spheromak: kesor what version of chef ?
[2012-12-16 16:31:03 -0500] kesor: 0.16.2
[2012-12-16 16:31:08 -0500] kesor: 10.16.2
[2012-12-16 16:31:35 -0500] spheromak: --override-runlist does exactly that
[2012-12-16 16:31:45 -0500] spheromak: or "-o"
[2012-12-16 16:31:47 -0500] kesor: but it changes the node's role list
[2012-12-16 16:32:02 -0500] kesor: question is how to override, without messing up the role list of the node.
[2012-12-16 16:33:00 -0500] spheromak: not how its supposed to work
[2012-12-16 16:33:33 -0500] kesor: when I later used the search api, the node only has the overriden roles and not the ones it had on bootstrap.
[2012-12-16 16:35:23 -0500] spheromak: but the run_list of the node is the saem ?
[2012-12-16 16:35:41 -0500] spheromak: as the original state right ?  i think theres an open ticket for the behavior your talking about
[2012-12-16 16:37:27 -0500] spheromak: i.e. using knife node show  that nodes run_list is the same as it was before using the -o yea ?
[2012-12-16 16:37:45 -0500] spheromak: but searches against said not sow thte roles that were used in the override
[2012-12-16 16:37:48 -0500] spheromak: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3506
[2012-12-16 16:38:12 -0500] spheromak: no solution aaik
[2012-12-16 16:38:15 -0500] spheromak: *afaik
[2012-12-16 16:38:40 -0500] kesor: :(
[2012-12-16 16:38:45 -0500] kesor: oh well. thanks.
[2012-12-16 19:23:41 -0500] Lrrr: Is there a surefire way to shrink the CouchDB database of Chef when running Couch 0.11??
[2012-12-16 19:26:25 -0500] Lrrr: I have a multi-gigabyte database for a server managing a dozen node
[2012-12-16 20:43:46 -0500] jhayden: can someone tell me how a client identifies itself to the chef server after it has been created?
[2012-12-16 20:44:34 -0500] jhayden: I have clients that get created ok but when they check in later are getting Failed to Authenticate errors
[2012-12-16 20:45:16 -0500] jhayden: they are checking in with the internal dns name but this name shows up neither in the client or node list
[2012-12-16 20:45:23 -0500] jhayden: is this the problem?
[2012-12-16 21:01:02 -0500] silk: What name is in the client.rb file?
[2012-12-16 21:05:13 -0500] jhayden: there is no name in the client.rb, should there be?
[2012-12-16 21:07:36 -0500] masterkorp: http://i.imgur.com/ulcmE.jpg
[2012-12-16 21:08:18 -0500] silk: try adding: node_name "name_of_node_at_server" to the client.rb file
[2012-12-16 21:09:29 -0500] jhayden: I have been setting it via chef-client -N node_name
[2012-12-16 21:10:02 -0500] silk: and does the node_name that you have set, match the systems hostname?
[2012-12-16 21:10:04 -0500] jhayden: but your implying that it needs to be in client.rb also?
[2012-12-16 21:10:12 -0500] jhayden: no
[2012-12-16 21:10:40 -0500] silk: so, im guessing that the node name you have set, is registered with the chef server, but the client doesnt actually know who it is
[2012-12-16 21:10:49 -0500] silk: I would try addign it to the client.rb file and seeing how you go
[2012-12-16 21:11:24 -0500] jhayden: good idea, I'll give it a try
[2012-12-16 21:14:54 -0500] silk: so, it looks like the node_name is set as follows:  name = Chef::Config[:node_name] || ohai[:fqdn] || ohai[:hostname]
[2012-12-16 21:15:26 -0500] silk: so it will be node_name if set in the config file, otherwise it will try to determine its name via ohai.
[2012-12-16 21:33:53 -0500] rafaelmagu: Anyone using Berkshelf getting an error like "Cookbook 'nginx' not found in any of the default locations" when doing a berks upload <cookbook> ?
[2012-12-16 21:34:19 -0500] rafaelmagu: Happens any time I try to upload an internal cookbook that references another internal cookbook
[2012-12-16 21:34:36 -0500] rafaelmagu: But if I issue 'berks upload' without specifying the cookbook, it works fine
[2012-12-16 21:48:13 -0500] redgetan: hello how do i use pry to inspect attributes of a node?
[2012-12-16 21:56:03 -0500] siezer: rafaelmagu berks will try and grab cookbooks from the community site if it doesn't find them in the Berksfile
[2012-12-16 21:56:33 -0500] rafaelmagu: siezer: I have a Berksfile configured in the root of my chef-repo
[2012-12-16 21:56:39 -0500] siezer: k
[2012-12-16 21:56:48 -0500] rafaelmagu: I also have custom cookbooks inside chef-repo/vendor/cookbooks
[2012-12-16 21:56:57 -0500] rafaelmagu: From the chef-repo root, doing berks upload works
[2012-12-16 21:57:06 -0500] rafaelmagu: But berks upload <cookbook> fails
[2012-12-16 21:57:25 -0500] rafaelmagu: It seems berks doesn't read the main chef-repo berksfile if I specify a custom cookbook to upload
[2012-12-16 21:57:31 -0500] siezer: hrm... might be a bug
[2012-12-16 21:57:33 -0500] rafaelmagu: Had to create a berksfile inside the specific cookbook as well
[2012-12-16 21:57:48 -0500] rafaelmagu: I thought it would have some inheritance
[2012-12-16 21:57:52 -0500] rafaelmagu: But it doesn't
[2012-12-16 21:58:25 -0500] siezer: I guess just use knife to do indy cookbook uploads for now, and maybe file a bug against it on github/riotgames/berkshelf
[2012-12-16 21:58:46 -0500] siezer: they're super responsive and will probably cut a new release for you within a day
[2012-12-16 21:59:35 -0500] siezer: ( I cant promise you they'll do anything, naturally, but I speak from experience)
[2012-12-16 22:15:30 -0500] rafaelmagu: siezer: yeah, I know they're pretty good
[2012-12-16 22:15:38 -0500] rafaelmagu: I'll file a bug at some point
[2012-12-16 22:15:50 -0500] rafaelmagu: I believe it's more of a workflow issue than anything else
[2012-12-16 22:15:55 -0500] rafaelmagu: Just need to figure out the mindset for it
