[2014-04-28 00:00:22 -0400] iroller: coderanger: yes I see them all in node['roles']. Here's what I'm doing: https://gist.github.com/iroller/9555ee966db932da4e9a
[2014-04-28 00:01:17 -0400] coderanger: iroller: You are still using an array, you need to change the commands to a hash too
[2014-04-28 00:01:18 -0400] rayrod2030: coderanger: to role or not to role.  That is the question.
[2014-04-28 00:01:35 -0400] coderanger: iroller: Just never put arrays in node attrs, evarrrrr
[2014-04-28 00:02:46 -0400] pipework: coderanger: As a rubyist, I'm confused why that would be something one should not do.
[2014-04-28 00:02:54 -0400] iroller: coderanger: I tried changing [cmd1, cmd11] and [cmd2, cmd22] to {cmd1: true, cmd11: true} and {cmd2: true, cmd22: true}. And I got {cmd2:true, cmd22:true} as the result, still missing first two commands
[2014-04-28 00:03:14 -0400] coderanger: pipework: Nothing to do with Ruby, deep merging arrays has no usefully definable semantics
[2014-04-28 00:04:13 -0400] pipework: coderanger: Do you mean with respect towards the indices any given item is located at after the merge?
[2014-04-28 00:04:20 -0400] pipework: What do you mean by deep merging arrays?
[2014-04-28 00:04:26 -0400] coderanger: pipework: No, I mean merging at all
[2014-04-28 00:04:40 -0400] coderanger: iroller: If you have all the arrays converted to hashes, it should work :)
[2014-04-28 00:04:54 -0400] holms: coderanger: any ideas why app is not found?
[2014-04-28 00:04:56 -0400] coderanger: pipework: Node attrs are built by recursively merging roles+envs+cookbooks
[2014-04-28 00:05:08 -0400] coderanger: pipework: you can't recursively merge an array though, it has no meaning
[2014-04-28 00:05:18 -0400] pipework: Oh I see.
[2014-04-28 00:06:10 -0400] coderanger: iroller: I note that your second one has invalid JSON in it (you have some Ruby syntax in there), maybe it failed to upload?
[2014-04-28 00:06:58 -0400] iroller: coderanger: I'll try it once again, but I'm pretty sure it was uploaded just fine. It's just a typo in gist
[2014-04-28 00:07:57 -0400] pipework: coderanger: surely though, for an unordered set/array, it shouldn't be a problem though?
[2014-04-28 00:10:23 -0400] coderanger: pipework: Ruby doesn't have though though
[2014-04-28 00:10:28 -0400] coderanger: Nor does JSON
[2014-04-28 00:10:35 -0400] pipework: coderanger: doesn't have though though?
[2014-04-28 00:10:46 -0400] coderanger: "those though"
[2014-04-28 00:11:01 -0400] pipework: coderanger: Sorry, I meant an array or set where I don't really care about the order.
[2014-04-28 00:11:06 -0400] pipework: It's just a collection.
[2014-04-28 00:11:47 -0400] coderanger: pipework: Yes, but there is no way for Chef to know that
[2014-04-28 00:11:58 -0400] coderanger: because there is no syntax for "unordered set"
[2014-04-28 00:12:13 -0400] pipework: coderanger: Well, I haven't dug into the source, but I've made such things in ruby.
[2014-04-28 00:12:30 -0400] pipework: It isn't necessarily a syntax, mostly a gotcha turned into a feature.
[2014-04-28 00:12:47 -0400] pipework: If you don't care about the actual order, use it, otherwise beware.
[2014-04-28 00:14:09 -0400] coderanger: pipework: Again, thats fine in the abstract, but node attributes (and JSON, etc) lack the semantic info to do it usefully :)
[2014-04-28 00:14:24 -0400] coderanger: So you have to pick one behavior for all arrays, either merging or not merging
[2014-04-28 00:14:30 -0400] coderanger: or be liuke chef and use _both_
[2014-04-28 00:14:40 -0400] coderanger: (in different places and unpredictably)
[2014-04-28 00:17:07 -0400] rburton-: I'm not having any success with RVM + Chef to get 2.0.0 Ruby installed
[2014-04-28 00:17:25 -0400] rburton-: curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash  -s -- --branch stable --version <version> fails everytime
[2014-04-28 00:18:08 -0400] holms: lol so it had to be app:app not app:application. why then it's :application in here https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/master/examples/supervisor.conf
[2014-04-28 00:18:10 -0400] pipework: rburton-: I think there was a problem earlier. Are you on RHEL?
[2014-04-28 00:18:10 -0400] holms: hrrr
[2014-04-28 00:18:28 -0400] rburton-: debian 12.x
[2014-04-28 00:18:29 -0400] coderanger: rburton-: Is this for a workstation or a server?
[2014-04-28 00:18:30 -0400] pipework: coderanger: I mean, you can't pick one or the other because it's a fixed behaviour of the system.
[2014-04-28 00:18:33 -0400] rburton-: server
[2014-04-28 00:18:56 -0400] coderanger: rburton-: Are you trying to use rvm for chef-client or to install it with chef-client?
[2014-04-28 00:19:08 -0400] rburton-: chef-solo
[2014-04-28 00:19:16 -0400] coderanger: rburton-: same differece
[2014-04-28 00:19:29 -0400] rburton-: I was just trying to be specific.
[2014-04-28 00:19:46 -0400] coderanger: holms: the thing after that : is the variable name of the WSGI callable in your module
[2014-04-28 00:19:53 -0400] coderanger: rburton-: Sure, but which are you trying to do :)
[2014-04-28 00:20:02 -0400] rburton-: my web.json https://gist.github.com/rburton/11358829
[2014-04-28 00:20:29 -0400] rburton-: cookbook 'rvm', github: 'fnichol/chef-rvm'
[2014-04-28 00:20:35 -0400] coderanger: rburton-: Okay, so you have working chef and are trying to install ruby 2.0 to be used with your app
[2014-04-28 00:20:46 -0400] rburton-: Correct
[2014-04-28 00:20:47 -0400] coderanger: rburton-: Use poise-ruby
[2014-04-28 00:20:57 -0400] coderanger: rvm has no business being on servers :)
[2014-04-28 00:21:59 -0400] holms: coderanger: thanks now i can go sleep in piece ))
[2014-04-28 00:22:00 -0400] rburton-: Okay let me try that
[2014-04-28 00:23:48 -0400] coderanger: rburton-: I have builds up for debian 7 and 6 I think
[2014-04-28 00:24:36 -0400] pipework: coderanger: Oh also, chefdk was trying to install debugger with 2.1.1, and it was breaking hard. It also uses a shitton of threads whenever it tries to bootstrap the system, so it tries to install debugger on each of those threads, I believe.
[2014-04-28 00:25:11 -0400] coderanger: pipework: I've not used chefdk and probably will never, so I would recommend filing a bug on jira
[2014-04-28 00:25:36 -0400] pipework: coderanger: Ah so you don't work for the company then?
[2014-04-28 00:25:41 -0400] coderanger: pipework: Nope
[2014-04-28 00:25:44 -0400] pipework: gotcha.
[2014-04-28 00:26:20 -0400] pipework: Unfortunately I live right next to puppet labs office and not opscode. Puppet isn't as interesting to me. :(
[2014-04-28 00:27:56 -0400] coderanger: I think there are a few employees in Portland
[2014-04-28 00:28:47 -0400] pipework: Sometimes I glare out my window at their office.
[2014-04-28 00:31:01 -0400] rburton-: coderanger so it doesn't se the path by default?
[2014-04-28 00:32:02 -0400] coderanger: rburton-: What doesnlt?
[2014-04-28 00:32:10 -0400] rburton-: posie-ruby
[2014-04-28 00:32:10 -0400] coderanger: (I really can't type today)
[2014-04-28 00:32:15 -0400] rburton-: it installs ruby at /opt/ruby-200/bin/ruby
[2014-04-28 00:32:17 -0400] coderanger: No, it just installs a package
[2014-04-28 00:32:24 -0400] gchristensen: I wonder if chef will have trouble with http://www.chefdk.com/
[2014-04-28 00:32:31 -0400] coderanger: Linux has no unified way to set system-wide path changes
[2014-04-28 00:32:34 -0400] coderanger: so I don't try
[2014-04-28 00:32:48 -0400] rburton-: $PATH=...?
[2014-04-28 00:33:22 -0400] coderanger: rburton-: Not sure what you mean, but I can say pretty authoritatively there is no unified way to do it :)
[2014-04-28 00:33:47 -0400] rburton-: setting it in the PATH will make it visible via the shell
[2014-04-28 00:34:14 -0400] coderanger: There is no "the PATH"
[2014-04-28 00:34:18 -0400] ctracey: rburton-: that is not system-wide ;)
[2014-04-28 00:34:18 -0400] coderanger: Not centrally anyway
[2014-04-28 00:34:43 -0400] rburton-: right, but to be able to set it for a given user would be useful
[2014-04-28 00:34:45 -0400] pipework: gchristensen: lul, probably not.
[2014-04-28 00:34:46 -0400] coderanger: Debian-oids have /etc/environment which is sourced most of the time
[2014-04-28 00:34:59 -0400] coderanger: rburton-: A system package can't alter a user's shell rcs
[2014-04-28 00:35:07 -0400] rburton-: ah
[2014-04-28 00:35:40 -0400] coderanger: But yeah, this is just a systemic problem with Linux, one I love to note that Windows has had solved for decades
[2014-04-28 00:36:13 -0400] rburton-: watching this show about North Korea, man these people are mindfucked
[2014-04-28 00:36:52 -0400] iroller: coderanger: whew, got it working with hashes, thanks again.
[2014-04-28 00:37:55 -0400] coderanger: iroller: :)
[2014-04-28 01:09:14 -0400] jidar: because it's a distro problem, not a kernel problem
[2014-04-28 01:12:34 -0400] coderanger: jidar: Kind of, env vars _are_ a kernel construct
[2014-04-28 01:12:48 -0400] jidar: you mean, for the shell?
[2014-04-28 01:12:51 -0400] coderanger: jidar: and the limitations on how they are set have become unhelpful
[2014-04-28 01:13:24 -0400] coderanger: jidar: Env vars like in kernel space, they are part of a process struct
[2014-04-28 01:13:57 -0400] jidar: env vars live in the shell
[2014-04-28 01:14:01 -0400] coderanger: No, they don't
[2014-04-28 01:14:11 -0400] coderanger: shell vars live in the shell
[2014-04-28 01:14:12 -0400] jidar: if I start a new shell, it inherits it from whatever he was told to
[2014-04-28 01:14:21 -0400] coderanger: env vars live in the kernel
[2014-04-28 01:14:25 -0400] jidar: zsh and bash might look at different places
[2014-04-28 01:14:32 -0400] coderanger: this is why set != export
[2014-04-28 01:14:43 -0400] jidar: set and export are both shell constructs
[2014-04-28 01:14:49 -0400] coderanger: No, they really aren't
[2014-04-28 01:14:58 -0400] coderanger: getenv and setenv are syscalls
[2014-04-28 01:16:05 -0400] coderanger: bash just happens to call them for you
[2014-04-28 01:16:13 -0400] coderanger: but bash is just another userspace process
[2014-04-28 01:16:21 -0400] coderanger: it has no magic when it comes to things like fork()
[2014-04-28 01:18:13 -0400] coderanger: The only way to pass env vars to a child proc is via the parent
[2014-04-28 01:18:26 -0400] coderanger: this means they can't be centrally managed without a userspace shim
[2014-04-28 01:18:34 -0400] coderanger: which sucks
[2014-04-28 01:20:25 -0400] coderanger: hah, TIL POSIX defines a "secure_getenv"
[2014-04-28 01:20:54 -0400] jidar: http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0508.2/0666.html
[2014-04-28 01:21:07 -0400] jidar: I found this interesting
[2014-04-28 01:21:21 -0400] jidar: while not providing a solution of course
[2014-04-28 01:22:43 -0400] coderanger: jidar: Yeah, if you tried to fix it by declaring global stuff like PATH in pid0, you would have to reboot to change them :-(
[2014-04-28 01:23:05 -0400] jidar: so it sort of goes back to what I said though
[2014-04-28 01:23:41 -0400] jidar: but I hear what you're saying too, I just feel like it's still solved via shell variables or process variables
[2014-04-28 01:23:46 -0400] coderanger: jidar: The nicest fix would be for the kernel to read a config of some kind (note: they will never do this) on env vars to set after every fork
[2014-04-28 01:23:50 -0400] jidar: not directly from the kernel
[2014-04-28 01:24:04 -0400] coderanger: jidar: Try doing this, ssh <some server> env
[2014-04-28 01:24:10 -0400] mjuszczak: I have a question about environments.  Are they meant to be environments for configuration management code, or environments for application code, or both?  For instance, if I have a "production" and "development" environment inside chef, is that meant for production and/or development chef cookbooks, or meant for servers that live in my product's production and development environments?
[2014-04-28 01:24:12 -0400] jidar: blank?
[2014-04-28 01:24:20 -0400] coderanger: You'll notice most shell-set variables aren't there, since no shell was ever run :)
[2014-04-28 01:24:35 -0400] jidar: yea, env isn't going to set variables
[2014-04-28 01:24:36 -0400] jidar: hahah
[2014-04-28 01:24:37 -0400] coderanger: mjuszczak: Up to you
[2014-04-28 01:24:44 -0400] jidar: ahhh, but I do see how this could benifit chef
[2014-04-28 01:24:44 -0400] coderanger: jidar: No, it will print them
[2014-04-28 01:25:06 -0400] coderanger: jidar: If you did ssh <some server> bash -c 'env', you'll see likely different output
[2014-04-28 01:25:07 -0400] jidar: so you'd like to see the need for the shell to go away for bootstrapping or chef runs?
[2014-04-28 01:25:26 -0400] jidar: rather than bash->chef, just chef
[2014-04-28 01:25:27 -0400] coderanger: Ditto on init scripts, which don't involve a shell
[2014-04-28 01:25:40 -0400] jidar: er, ssh->bash->chef
[2014-04-28 01:25:54 -0400] coderanger: mjuszczak: All envs give you is a way to control which cookbooks are in use
[2014-04-28 01:26:01 -0400] jidar: ditto on the learning something new everyday
[2014-04-28 01:33:43 -0400] coderanger: jidar: Env vars are a bit of a weird bit of magic, up there with how file descriptors work. They blur the line between kernel space and userspace
[2014-04-28 01:54:00 -0400] ctracey: mjuszczak: can you clarify?
[2014-04-28 02:52:26 -0400] mjuszczak: coderanger: Still around?
[2014-04-28 02:53:29 -0400] mjuszczak: coderanger: In a base cookbook, per your method and the berkshelf model, would SSH keys go inside attributes/, to be called by recipes/keys.rb (or something similar)?
[2014-04-28 05:50:43 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: you there?
[2014-04-28 05:51:44 -0400] brucelee_: nevermind, found the solution :p
[2014-04-28 05:51:58 -0400] brucelee_: was wondering how to resolve cookbooks that are not from opscode's repo
[2014-04-28 05:57:45 -0400] stensonb: @brucelee, if you use berkshelf, you can define where other cookbooks can be found (it's the "bundler" of cookbooks)
[2014-04-28 06:05:28 -0400] JensOfSweden: Anyone here know ruby pretty well who could perhaps help me with an issue im having? =)
[2014-04-28 06:16:58 -0400] mhenrixon: JensOfSweden: pretty sure that's me
[2014-04-28 06:17:39 -0400] JensOfSweden: mhenrixon: Ok, i have to try to present my case then since i see myself as a ruby beginner =)
[2014-04-28 06:19:45 -0400] JensOfSweden: mhenrixon: I have a csv file (unix passwd like file with userinfo i want to read into a databag). I use CSV.foreach to read the file and put the values into a hash with the username as a key. Now for my case, it works great but i want the loop not to read the lines with the shell /bin/false into the hash. How do i do that in ruby?
[2014-04-28 06:20:31 -0400] mhenrixon: mjuszczak: yes don't complicate it too much though and stay away from data bags if you can. I find myself simplifying as much as I possibly can to speed things up. attributes is better than data bags unless you need them.
[2014-04-28 06:23:04 -0400] mhenrixon: you get an array of column values right? just do next if line.include?('/bin/false')
[2014-04-28 06:23:12 -0400] mhenrixon: JensOfSweden:
[2014-04-28 06:23:35 -0400] iverson0881: hi, is it possible to knife diff between two version of a cookbook
[2014-04-28 06:23:49 -0400] iverson0881: it seems to always want to diff between the version i specify and what's currently the latest on the chef server
[2014-04-28 06:24:06 -0400] iverson0881: I tried specifying cookbookversion multiple times, but that doesn't seem to take effect
[2014-04-28 06:25:09 -0400] mhenrixon: JensOfSweden: or you can do a select of only the lines where that column value does not exist using ruby enumerable. I usually prefer the next version myself though.
[2014-04-28 06:25:35 -0400] meladiv: Were can I post a remote job for devops with chef experience?
[2014-04-28 06:26:25 -0400] mhenrixon: JensOfSweden: not 100% on CSV. If you are still stuck at 9am I will be with my computer then. on iPhone now :)
[2014-04-28 06:28:45 -0400] JensOfSweden: mhenrixon:  http://pastebin.com/BjJXuYVZ here is the actual code
[2014-04-28 06:29:50 -0400] JensOfSweden: mhenrixon: so basicly for this users[row.shift] = row line i need it not to read in the /bin/false into the hash in the loop =)
[2014-04-28 06:31:36 -0400] JensOfSweden: mhenrixon: found it "next if row[6].match %r(/bin/false)"
[2014-04-28 06:39:26 -0400] mhenrixon: JensOfSweden: great stuff! :)
[2014-04-28 06:39:47 -0400] JensOfSweden: mhenrixon: now i only have to work on the poor data quality of the file =)
[2014-04-28 06:40:22 -0400] mhenrixon: JensOfSweden: sounds like a n interesting job :)
[2014-04-28 06:41:14 -0400] JensOfSweden: mhenrixon: When im done with this (openstack and adding devusers trough chef with the new instances in openstack) im gonna swtich to kerberos authentication and authorization instead =)
[2014-04-28 07:25:33 -0400] mjuszczak: mhenrixon: OK, awesome. Thanks!  And those would go inside attributs files, not inside the recipes themselves right?
[2014-04-28 07:31:11 -0400] mhenrixon: mjuszczak thats what I would do but in all honesty it is easier to just start with everything in the recipe and then move into attributes when you see everything is working, then if you need to override or whatever based on environment you do that. Don't be afraid of creating a mess in the beginning. Everything is refactorable.
[2014-04-28 07:57:09 -0400] mjuszczak: mhenrixon: Makes sense :) Thanks!
[2014-04-28 09:16:57 -0400] mhenrixon: How do you guys manage system and package updates?
[2014-04-28 10:10:03 -0400] mosez: hum, why did chef 10.x get an update but not chef-solr? http://rubygems.org/gems/chef-solr i cant use that with the newest 10.x chef version -.-
[2014-04-28 10:10:15 -0400] mosez: the hard runtime dependencies are sucking pretty hard
[2014-04-28 10:11:35 -0400] mosez: i need a chef 10 version compatible to json 1.8. the only compatible gem should be chef 10.32, but this is not compatible to chef-solr, shef-server-api, chef-server-webui, chef-server and chef-expander -.-
[2014-04-28 10:13:16 -0400] mosez: lol, it's updated within github but not published on rubygems.org
[2014-04-28 10:17:32 -0400] joelmoss: Hi all! Can anyone shed any light on how you are managing branch development and testing of cookbooks?
[2014-04-28 10:17:59 -0400] joelmoss: especially, in a team of eople who may or may not be developing more than one branch of the same cookbook
[2014-04-28 10:18:29 -0400] joelmoss: It seems to me that semver is somewhat of a hurdle to this
[2014-04-28 10:18:54 -0400] joelmoss: would be great if I could lock a node or environment to a cookbook branch
[2014-04-28 10:19:07 -0400] joelmoss: but to do that, I have to maintain version numbers
[2014-04-28 10:20:06 -0400] joelmoss: which is a ball ache
[2014-04-28 10:20:17 -0400] joelmoss: I would love to know how others are managing this
[2014-04-28 10:25:22 -0400] mosez: joelmoss: version numbers are fine.
[2014-04-28 10:25:36 -0400] joelmoss: is that what you use?
[2014-04-28 10:26:03 -0400] mosez: when my custom cookbooks go into production usage, yes
[2014-04-28 10:26:53 -0400] joelmoss: Im talking about development and testing of cookbook branches
[2014-04-28 10:28:47 -0400] mosez: i cant see any problem
[2014-04-28 10:29:39 -0400] mosez: master branch is "stable", development branch is the work in progress and add feature branches for each new feature. like on git-flow. with berkshelf you can define git repos and branches.
[2014-04-28 11:04:51 -0400] zeroXten: how do people feel about having client/server recipes in a cookbook, vs splitting up into separate client and server cookbooks?
[2014-04-28 11:06:15 -0400] Guest10389: Hey guys, I have an already provision node which I want to get chef-client running on. The node has my client.rb, validation.pem and first-boot.json on it. What else do I need?
[2014-04-28 11:13:30 -0400] subraminion: giving it a bootstrap for any simple cookbook should add it automatically

[2014-04-28 12:35:29 -0400] whiteadam: k, is the -%> a typo by chance?

[2014-04-28 12:38:46 -0400] whiteadam: stupid computers
[2014-04-28 12:38:50 -0400] mc_fail: i can't get why it going this way

[2014-04-28 12:41:55 -0400] whiteadam: what irc client do you guys use?
[2014-04-28 12:42:24 -0400] Er00: irssi
[2014-04-28 12:43:34 -0400] whiteadam: Er00: That's what I'm installing now... I was using a Chrome addon, but it's pissing me off
[2014-04-28 12:43:53 -0400] Er00: irssi is the best :)
[2014-04-28 12:44:12 -0400] Er00: I've been IRCing for ~13 years, used to use mIRC but been on irssi for maybe 10 years or so now

[2014-04-28 13:35:01 -0400] erichs: hi! does anyone have experience vendoring gems for use in a library, like in Seth Vargo's post: https://sethvargo.com/using-gems-with-chef/ ?
[2014-04-28 14:03:52 -0400] chrisahhh: hello
[2014-04-28 14:28:59 -0400] clayb: vendoring gems?
[2014-04-28 14:29:34 -0400] clayb: Er, to erichs, vendoring gems?
[2014-04-28 14:39:19 -0400] clayb: erichs Ah; very cool way to package the gem. I'd previously tried compiling gems but that proved a nightmare.
[2014-04-28 14:41:16 -0400] Popsikle: is there a way to run a cookbook provider inside of knife exec?
[2014-04-28 14:41:18 -0400] erichs: clayb, I think this is elegant, too. I'm having an issue with getting it working with Hosted Chef. Was wondering if anyone else had gotten the technique to work?
[2014-04-28 14:42:09 -0400] alop: is it possible to send an arbitrary notification? e.g. inside an if statement?
[2014-04-28 14:43:45 -0400] clayb: erichs I'm still questioning how libraries would be packaged in this approach -- I'm not much of a Rubyist. What is your hang-up trying this?
[2014-04-28 14:47:09 -0400] erichs: clayb: I found that the files/default/vendor dir wasn't being synchronized to the client node. Seth Vargo, in a PM, kindly pointed out that those files are only synched if required in a recipe. So, it seems I need to do that.
[2014-04-28 14:49:55 -0400] clayb: Oh interesting, the files structure seems to have some magic I didn't understand in that case.
[2014-04-28 14:50:20 -0400] erichs: clayb: Chef tries to be smart about bandwidth usage in this case. Yes.
[2014-04-28 14:57:11 -0400] rayrod2030: is a berkshelf-way environment cookbook equivalent to a role cookbook + a chef environment tag?
[2014-04-28 15:00:40 -0400] stormerider: erichs: do you know if that's also the case with templates?
[2014-04-28 15:22:40 -0400] erichs: stormerider: I don't know definitively, but the same logic would seem to hold: you wouldn't want to download large amounts of data from the Chef server unnecessarily.
[2014-04-28 15:22:54 -0400] stormerider: thanks.
[2014-04-28 16:01:45 -0400] mrj: the top component link here is out of date; http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbooks.html

[2014-04-28 16:23:30 -0400] stormerider: nkts: not sure that that's been defined, but RAM is definitely a major factor
[2014-04-28 16:27:06 -0400] gleam: i use 2gb for ~100 nodes and it's always been fine
[2014-04-28 16:30:11 -0400] nkts: stormerider: yes, but will it fit into 512mb or 1gb ?
[2014-04-28 16:30:35 -0400] stormerider: anything below 1g will run pretty crappily, i believe.

[2014-04-28 17:00:04 -0400] mjuszczak: Is 14.04 stable enough yet to launch a new chef deployment on it, including running chef server?
[2014-04-28 17:05:49 -0400] programmerq: mjuszczak: I'd say that it probably is pretty stable. Canonical is pretty good at what they do.
[2014-04-28 17:06:11 -0400] programmerq: as long as chef server targets it, you should be good (that I don't know the status on just yet)
[2014-04-28 17:16:26 -0400] mjuszczak: programmerq: Sorry, I more meant on the chef side.  Whether or not a new chef deployment is a good idea on 14.04 yet.
[2014-04-28 17:16:31 -0400] programmerq: ah
[2014-04-28 17:18:33 -0400] programmerq: mjuszczak: it looks like 14.04 isn't yet an option in the dropdowns for the chef server download page.
[2014-04-28 17:18:48 -0400] programmerq: I'm not sure who at chef would know
[2014-04-28 17:21:39 -0400] mjuszczak: gotcha, thanks!
[2014-04-28 17:22:39 -0400] mjuszczak: programmerq: Curious, how do you use environments?
[2014-04-28 17:23:16 -0400] programmerq: mjuszczak: I prefer isolation, so I go for separate open source chef server instances, or I go for separate orgs in hosted chef
[2014-04-28 17:23:39 -0400] programmerq: because the chef server is an essential part of any given stack (like production, for example)
[2014-04-28 17:23:50 -0400] programmerq: if I have that same server accepting updates for non-prod stacks
[2014-04-28 17:23:54 -0400] programmerq: I'm putting prod at risk
[2014-04-28 17:23:57 -0400] programmerq: so I separate it out
[2014-04-28 17:26:04 -0400] mjuszczak: that makes sense.  So then you're considering environments in chef to be product environments: IE, these are the servers that serve production code to my customers, living in a production environment, and then these are servers that my developers use to test code and stage code, living in a staging environment.
[2014-04-28 17:26:20 -0400] programmerq: yeah
[2014-04-28 17:26:34 -0400] mjuszczak: Does anyone use environments within Chef to reference the stage at which cookbooks are living? For instance, this cookbook is a new version, let's "stage" it and then move it to production
[2014-04-28 17:27:09 -0400] programmerq: if I used one open source chef server for everything, and depended on environments for cookbook versioning and such, the answer ends up being "don't make a mistake when you're doing staging deploys"
[2014-04-28 17:27:15 -0400] programmerq: mjuszczak: I have also done the cookbook version pinning
[2014-04-28 17:27:38 -0400] programmerq: you just pin the versions in the environment, run chef on your staging servers, like what you see, repeat for prod environment/servers
[2014-04-28 17:27:43 -0400] mjuszczak: yeah, that's a good idea
[2014-04-28 17:28:05 -0400] programmerq: I'm not a fan of having to check code in as part of a deploy though-- seems weird.
[2014-04-28 17:28:07 -0400] mjuszczak: but then you run into the case where your staging servers are there to test your product in a production-like environment, so you'd probably want to be running production-like modules in that environment.

[2014-04-28 18:07:35 -0400] programmerq: agrajag: I've found it beneficial to do a cookbook for yum repos
[2014-04-28 18:07:47 -0400] programmerq: I don't necessarily do one per repo, but I do one per logical group for sure.
[2014-04-28 18:08:06 -0400] programmerq: like if I have 4 repos in my corporate datacenter, I'll do one cookbook for all 4
[2014-04-28 18:08:20 -0400] programmerq: but if I want some other dude's random repo, I'll try to separate it out
[2014-04-28 18:09:48 -0400] craig_: hello! has anyone else run into an issue where chef leaves behind a zombie process when running one particular recipe?
[2014-04-28 18:10:23 -0400] double_p: craig_: and that one is?
[2014-04-28 18:10:25 -0400] craig_: i'm trying to use the chef-splunk recipe to install Splunk, but when I do it leaves behind a zombie
[2014-04-28 18:11:02 -0400] craig_: which, when coupled with Scalr, means that the Scalr init script never sees that the node is initialized and eventually times out
[2014-04-28 18:11:08 -0400] double_p: craig_: dont know that one, but a lot of shit commercial relies on working DNS
[2014-04-28 18:11:47 -0400] craig_: i don't THINK dns is the issue, as it's only using publicly available hostnames
[2014-04-28 18:12:00 -0400] craig_: i'll check a couple things down that road though
[2014-04-28 18:12:54 -0400] craig_: i'm pretty new to chef though so I didn't know if zombies were a normal thing or not
[2014-04-28 18:13:43 -0400] double_p: craig_: a zombie is never "normal"

[2014-04-28 19:25:21 -0400] coderanger: armendonigian: They just come along with the cookbook
[2014-04-28 19:25:50 -0400] coderanger: Embalmed: Possibly the wrong channel? I'm not sure to what you refer
[2014-04-28 19:26:12 -0400] Embalmed: you are unfamiliar with encrypted data bags/
[2014-04-28 19:26:14 -0400] Embalmed: ?
[2014-04-28 19:26:52 -0400] Embalmed: in order to grant access to use the edb key you have to add the grant for a node
[2014-04-28 19:27:06 -0400] Embalmed: if nobody has access to give the node grant... what then?
[2014-04-28 19:28:46 -0400] coderanger: Oh, heh
[2014-04-28 19:28:56 -0400] coderanger: Haven't heard that abbreviation
[2014-04-28 19:29:21 -0400] coderanger: So no, encrypted bags have no ACLs
[2014-04-28 19:29:43 -0400] coderanger: Enterprise Chef does support them for bags in general, but its at the item level, not per key
[2014-04-28 19:29:58 -0400] Embalmed: uh
[2014-04-28 19:30:11 -0400] Embalmed: we apply our edb grants per system
[2014-04-28 19:30:16 -0400] Embalmed: do this every day
[2014-04-28 19:30:25 -0400] Embalmed: but one of our key/bags nobody has access to grant anymore
[2014-04-28 19:30:31 -0400] coderanger: Which grants do you mean?
[2014-04-28 19:30:48 -0400] Embalmed: knife edb grant databag key nodename
[2014-04-28 19:31:19 -0400] coderanger: I don't know that is
[2014-04-28 19:31:26 -0400] coderanger: Sounds like an internal plugin?
[2014-04-28 19:31:46 -0400] Embalmed: could be..  probably this  https://github.com/stephenpearson/knife-edb
[2014-04-28 19:32:15 -0400] coderanger: Looks vaguely similar to chef-vault
[2014-04-28 19:32:42 -0400] coderanger: but its entirely different from chef's encrypted data bag system so I'm afraid I don't know much about it
[2014-04-28 19:32:50 -0400] Embalmed: makes sense
[2014-04-28 19:33:11 -0400] Embalmed: i think they just engaged opscode so i'll let them handle it
[2014-04-28 19:33:19 -0400] Embalmed: but figured i'd at least ask here
[2014-04-28 19:33:26 -0400] Embalmed: i didn't realize it was a custom plugin
[2014-04-28 20:23:53 -0400] jskains: ANyone here know where I could get support for the Nagios cookbook? It's documentation is lacking in many areas.
[2014-04-28 20:28:12 -0400] laurent\: jskains: its github page
[2014-04-28 21:17:45 -0400] randingo: maybe more of a VM question.  I have a ubuntu host running VirtualBox, and a window2008 guest that is appending the DNS suffix to the host name.  Network is set to NAT, is there any way to disable the guest from appending the suffix??
[2014-04-28 21:35:21 -0400] randingo: i'm not sure if something needs to change in the guest to disable it or in the settings of the Virtualbox instance to limit the awareness.  thoughts?
[2014-04-28 21:50:07 -0400] Majost:  Does anyone know how to test guard expressions with chefspec?
[2014-04-28 21:52:20 -0400] Majost: For example, I have a guard on  an execute block
[2014-04-28 21:52:51 -0400] Majost: and a test like this:expect(chef_run).not_to run_execute('exec-foo').with(not_if: ::Dir.exists?('this_should_fail'))
[2014-04-28 21:53:00 -0400] Majost: but it always seems to pass, when it should not
[2014-04-28 23:56:46 -0400] otakup0pe: hey so are there common caveats when creating a lwrp ?
[2014-04-28 23:57:00 -0400] otakup0pe: i've made a custom lwrp in a private cookbook i use in another private cookbook
[2014-04-28 23:57:02 -0400] otakup0pe: and it can't find the lwrp
[2014-04-28 23:57:18 -0400] otakup0pe: both are in chef, both show up in the 'cookbook list', and the metadata.rb's seem rigbht
[2014-04-28 23:57:44 -0400] otakup0pe: comparing to some of the opscode lwrp's i'm doing it right
[2014-04-28 23:57:55 -0400] otakup0pe: or i'm blind
