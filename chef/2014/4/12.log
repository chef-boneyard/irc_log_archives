[2014-04-12 00:54:26 -0400] icarus: hello all
[2014-04-12 00:54:37 -0400] icarus: can anyone help me diagnose this knife error:
[2014-04-12 00:54:37 -0400] icarus: /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/dependency.rb:247:in `to_specs': Could not find chef (>= 0) amongst [bundler-1.6.1, bundler-unload-1.0.2, executable-hooks-1.3.1, gem-wrappers-1.2.4, rake-10.2.2, rubygems-bundler-1.4.3, rvm-1.11.3.9] (Gem::LoadError) from /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/dependency.rb:256:in `to_spec'

[2014-04-12 03:18:11 -0400] flaccid: saturday chef and a glass of wine
[2014-04-12 03:47:42 -0400] flaccid: wow love how travis CI tests when you do a release and notifies you result
[2014-04-12 04:00:13 -0400] flaccid: any Chef employees around? someara the community site doesn't seem to respond once upload of cookbook is complete
[2014-04-12 04:09:21 -0400] someara: what'd you upload
[2014-04-12 04:11:47 -0400] flaccid: someara: a new version of system cookbook
[2014-04-12 04:12:09 -0400] someara: 0.2.3?
[2014-04-12 04:13:07 -0400] flaccid: 0.3.2
[2014-04-12 04:13:46 -0400] flaccid: ok, i don't think it can handle it when doing it with chef-repo method with rake because it includes all the directories including .git etc.
[2014-04-12 04:15:57 -0400] flaccid: someara: updated the mail thread with yourself and support
[2014-04-12 04:16:44 -0400] someara: thanks
[2014-04-12 04:16:50 -0400] someara: gotta run =\
[2014-04-12 04:16:55 -0400] peretZ: o/
[2014-04-12 04:16:55 -0400] flaccid: okies
[2014-04-12 04:20:38 -0400] flaccid: that cookbook is pretty tidy now with that new release. now to spend some time with openvpn cookbook
[2014-04-12 04:52:35 -0400] flaccid: whats the right way to have test kitchen run apt-get update as a pre strap ?
[2014-04-12 04:53:48 -0400] flaccid: i guess suites/run_list but wouldn't that be a problem if not debian family?
[2014-04-12 05:47:21 -0400] _sp0k_: hello, how to subscribe one cookbook recipe resource to another cookbook recipe resource? e.g. restart a service in cookbookA::recipeA if cookbookB::recipeB resource.updated_by_last_action?
[2014-04-12 06:02:19 -0400] juliancdunn: flaccid: each platform clause can have a run_list of its own
[2014-04-12 06:34:37 -0400] hakunin: for a long time now running commands like: knife search node "tags:cron", lists all nodes, even without said tag. Is that a bug somewhere?
[2014-04-12 06:35:16 -0400] hakunin: i mean i think this is happening forever. However, searches happening inside recipes of deployed cookbooks seem to work right
[2014-04-12 07:40:12 -0400] flaccid: juliancdunn: i can put run_list in platforms instead of suites?
[2014-04-12 07:55:38 -0400] flaccid: juliancdunn: seems to work. hopefully they merge run_list from platforms and suites
[2014-04-12 13:36:33 -0400] zenith: Hi I'm getting a RedirectLimitExceeded exception when synchronizing cookbooks. Any ideas how to fix it.
[2014-04-12 13:37:06 -0400] zenith: I'm able to ping the client/node from the server and back
[2014-04-12 15:17:44 -0400] juliancdunn: flaccid: they do.
[2014-04-12 16:57:45 -0400] doughboy: I've got a nice install of chef on AWS, but it's not acting properly
[2014-04-12 22:36:34 -0400] rankine: if I were to manage an sshd_config file with a template, how could I reload ssh after that file change? something like: notifies :restart, 'service[ssh]'?
[2014-04-12 23:16:58 -0400] someara: rankine something like this: https://gist.github.com/someara/be749d8408f7ea9f2e4e
[2014-04-12 23:20:59 -0400] rankine: thank you so much someara, that makes more sense
