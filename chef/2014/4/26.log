[2014-04-26 00:21:08 -0400] _indigo: good evening, has somebody a hint what a syntax for a pg_hba.conf array is? I would like configure a pg_hba.conf from the postgres cookbook from my .kitchen.yml. can somebody shed some syntax light how to configure a pg_hba.conf array in  a .kitchen.yml file? http://paste2.org/DOKEf85n
[2014-04-26 00:21:57 -0400] coderanger: _indigo: So you need to use YAML syntax, not Ruby
[2014-04-26 00:24:20 -0400] coderanger: _indigo: http://hastebin.com/ahatibaqev.yml like that
[2014-04-26 00:25:16 -0400] _indigo: cool thx should help
[2014-04-26 00:27:32 -0400] _indigo: coderanger: indentation matters right?
[2014-04-26 00:27:37 -0400] coderanger: Yes
[2014-04-26 00:52:31 -0400] gazarsgo: i have uploaded and downloaded a cookbook to verify its contents on my chef server, but when a client goes through its runlist it does not use the cookbook that i have uploaded.... any ideas ?
[2014-04-26 00:54:02 -0400] coderanger: gazarsgo: What does it use?
[2014-04-26 00:54:15 -0400] gazarsgo: a previous copy of the same version
[2014-04-26 00:54:24 -0400] _indigo: coderanger: it works thanks for help
[2014-04-26 00:55:00 -0400] coderanger: gazarsgo: Check for constraints in the chef environment file or dependencies from other cookbooks
[2014-04-26 00:57:29 -0400] gazarsgo: i'm using the default environment ... and i don't know what dependency might be at play, this is a straight up template ... aww jeeze
[2014-04-26 00:57:50 -0400] gazarsgo: there is a template and a cookbook_file and i changed the template and the recipe calls for the cookbook_file ...
[2014-04-26 00:57:59 -0400] gazarsgo: thanks coderanger
[2014-04-26 00:58:09 -0400] coderanger: gazarsgo: You can see the version solution manually, sec
[2014-04-26 00:58:25 -0400] coderanger: gazarsgo: https://gist.github.com/coderanger/9198932
[2014-04-26 00:58:26 -0400] coderanger: Use that
[2014-04-26 00:58:57 -0400] gazarsgo: nice snippet
[2014-04-26 01:15:15 -0400] diego_r: according to the chef  partial_search cookbook, chef partial_search has been integreated since 11.10.0 , but when I try to do a partial_search  in the chef-shell -z  (version 11.12.2), it says that the method doesnt exist
[2014-04-26 01:16:19 -0400] diego_r: is partial_search not built in to chef-shell after version 11.10.0 ?
[2014-04-26 01:16:29 -0400] coderanger: diego_r: That never actually happened
[2014-04-26 01:16:39 -0400] coderanger: The cookbook readme is in error
[2014-04-26 01:17:03 -0400] diego_r: Oo ok thanks, I was wondering if I was doing something wrong
[2014-04-26 01:17:19 -0400] coderanger: diego_r: I thought it was removed from the readme actually
[2014-04-26 01:17:24 -0400] coderanger: yeah, I don't see it in there anymore
[2014-04-26 01:17:47 -0400] diego_r: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/partial_search
[2014-04-26 01:17:49 -0400] coderanger: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/partial_search/commit/30fb8ff1f9bb212aecd39d43233ca03e15b9f88a removed two months ago
[2014-04-26 01:18:11 -0400] diego_r: its on the community site still though, not on the master github branch
[2014-04-26 01:18:29 -0400] coderanger: Indeed, someara ^^
[2014-04-26 01:21:02 -0400] gazarsgo: ugh does runit_service not support overriding the default timeout on service start/stop/restart ?
[2014-04-26 01:21:15 -0400] coderanger: gazarsgo: sv_timeout
[2014-04-26 01:42:52 -0400] gazarsgo: one more -- how do i modify the FQDN that shows in knife node show ?
[2014-04-26 01:43:01 -0400] gazarsgo: doesn't appear when i try to edit the node's json ...
[2014-04-26 01:43:38 -0400] gazarsgo: ugh nevermind, found my mistake
[2014-04-26 02:13:08 -0400] Majost_: How do I mock a directory in chefspec such that I can validate a guard is working properly
[2014-04-26 02:48:51 -0400] Majost_: better yet, is it possible to check if the resource receives a true/false based on the guard
[2014-04-26 02:49:27 -0400] Majost_: it seems like this would be the way to do it -- but I am not sure from where the message would be delivered
[2014-04-26 04:05:50 -0400] wdpro_kevin1: coderanger: thanks for the reply git_repository not doing much of anything but also I still get the same error when removing it.
[2014-04-26 04:06:05 -0400] wdpro_kevin1: trying a few other things to try and get it working
[2014-04-26 10:46:00 -0400] PapaSierra: so this line of code look ingenious! but how do i use it? https://github.com/elasticsearch/cookbook-elasticsearch/blob/master/recipes/search_discovery.rb#L5
[2014-04-26 13:57:10 -0400] Falieson: hello - I'm following this tutorial on setting up a django dev environment -> http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/setup-a-django-vm-with-vagrant-virtualbox-and-chef/ but hit a  name error 'uninitialized constant Chef::Resource::LWRPBase' http://pastebin.com/Ux5PLdjG
[2014-04-26 15:08:42 -0400] BryanWB: hey windows chefs, how can i determine what kind of installer a windows exe is?
[2014-04-26 15:12:09 -0400] rayrod2030: anyone working with chef the way airbnb are doing it?  no chef server, storing attributes in zookeeper and bootstrapping nodes with chef-solo and stemcell?
[2014-04-26 15:13:15 -0400] rayrod2030: just curious.  I'm starting a brand new infra very soon and I want to look into as many workflows/cm approaches as possible.
[2014-04-26 15:15:01 -0400] BryanWB: rayrod2030: i personally favor that approach, tho i am more in favor of using consul.io, even tho it is very alpha
[2014-04-26 15:15:17 -0400] BryanWB: as consul.io is likely a much simpler stack than what airbnb have
[2014-04-26 15:15:59 -0400] rayrod2030: so consul for storing node attribute data
[2014-04-26 15:16:22 -0400] rayrod2030: and you get the benefits of discovery, concensus etc..
[2014-04-26 15:16:25 -0400] rayrod2030: hmm
[2014-04-26 15:16:38 -0400] rayrod2030: so many choices!  :)
[2014-04-26 15:39:29 -0400] gazarsgo: rayrod2030: hey hey ... i was real skeptical of consul until i saw their jepsen output :) still think zookeeper has better client lib support though for now
[2014-04-26 17:48:50 -0400] coderanger: jkeiser: Around?
[2014-04-26 17:48:57 -0400] jkeiser: ish :)
[2014-04-26 17:49:20 -0400] coderanger: jkeiser: Want to take a quick look at https://github.com/coderanger/knife-solve? Just about to push it up to rubygems for the 1.0
[2014-04-26 18:03:00 -0400] coredump: sorting of searched nodes, someone has a quick way?
[2014-04-26 18:03:17 -0400] coderanger: coredump: in the generic case, not possible. What are you trying to do?
[2014-04-26 18:03:35 -0400] coredump: nah, just trying to make a dns zone file cute
[2014-04-26 18:03:39 -0400] coredump: not a big deal
[2014-04-26 18:08:42 -0400] coderanger: coredump: If you don't mind buffering it all in RAM, you can just do search().sort_by{|n| n.name}
[2014-04-26 18:08:45 -0400] coderanger: or similar
[2014-04-26 18:09:00 -0400] coderanger: You probably want to use partial_search though to avoid blowing up your RAM usage
[2014-04-26 18:13:25 -0400] coredump: hm
[2014-04-26 18:13:43 -0400] coderanger: Depends on how many nodes you have I suppose :)
[2014-04-26 18:13:52 -0400] coredump: nah, nothing gigantic
[2014-04-26 18:24:08 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: good morning :p
[2014-04-26 18:24:29 -0400] coderanger: Alo
[2014-04-26 18:25:24 -0400] brucelee_: hey i installed chef dk, after my berkshelf 2.0 / vagrant 1.5 / macbook air environment seems to have messed up
[2014-04-26 18:25:42 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: now after installign the chefdk pkg, berks is nowhere to be found..
[2014-04-26 18:25:53 -0400] brucelee_: care to help troubleshoot? :p
[2014-04-26 18:26:03 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: Check your path, make sure the chefdk bin folder is on it
[2014-04-26 18:30:54 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: my path seems fine, but heres what it is
[2014-04-26 18:31:15 -0400] brucelee_: http://hastebin.com/epubarumoq.sm
[2014-04-26 18:33:01 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: You don't have chefdk on there
[2014-04-26 18:33:58 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: It installs to /opt/chefdk, not /opt/chef
[2014-04-26 18:34:08 -0400] brucelee_: oh hmm, weird
[2014-04-26 18:34:15 -0400] brucelee_: maybe the chefdk installation failed
[2014-04-26 18:35:02 -0400] brucelee_: im running a chef verify
[2014-04-26 18:35:03 -0400] brucelee_: pasting in a few
[2014-04-26 18:35:20 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: No, you need to do the path changes yourself AFAIK
[2014-04-26 18:35:30 -0400] brucelee_: ah
[2014-04-26 18:35:44 -0400] brucelee_: thats the link i have
[2014-04-26 18:35:44 -0400] brucelee_: http://www.getchef.com/downloads/chef-dk/mac/
[2014-04-26 18:35:45 -0400] coderanger: You can also call it directly /opt/chefdk/bin/berks
[2014-04-26 18:35:50 -0400] brucelee_: i see
[2014-04-26 18:36:00 -0400] brucelee_: they need to have some docs :p
[2014-04-26 18:36:43 -0400] coderanger: No comment
[2014-04-26 18:36:52 -0400] brucelee_: haha
[2014-04-26 18:37:01 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: what are you up to? hows balanced
[2014-04-26 18:37:14 -0400] coderanger: Same ol' same ol'
[2014-04-26 18:37:26 -0400] brucelee_: still interesting? or is everything dialled in
[2014-04-26 18:37:46 -0400] coderanger: I don't really work on balanced-specific stuff, I just do my usual cookbook dev and community wrangling
[2014-04-26 18:38:01 -0400] coderanger: So its basically as interesting as I want ot make it
[2014-04-26 18:38:06 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: ever worked with ansible? its pretty neat, push-based instead of "pull" based like chef
[2014-04-26 18:38:15 -0400] coderanger: 1) no it isn't
[2014-04-26 18:38:24 -0400] coderanger: 2) It is cute but useless beyond ~5 nodes
[2014-04-26 18:38:34 -0400] ctracey_: ++
[2014-04-26 18:38:35 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: i used it to push a chef clients to a bunch of servers that didnt have chef
[2014-04-26 18:38:36 -0400] coderanger: 3) yaml is a terrible programming lang
[2014-04-26 18:38:55 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: well how would you push chef-client like 50 nodes that dont have it :p
[2014-04-26 18:38:58 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: ansible is exactly as "push-based" as knife ssh is
[2014-04-26 18:39:17 -0400] bdha: knife bootstrap..?
[2014-04-26 18:39:21 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: rundeck + fabric is my orchestration weapon of choice
[2014-04-26 18:39:29 -0400] coderanger: but I bake chef-client into my AMIs
[2014-04-26 18:39:33 -0400] bdha: (or bake it into your image)
[2014-04-26 18:39:33 -0400] bdha: Heh.
[2014-04-26 18:39:47 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger:  yeah for any new AMIs or VMs, set it to up have chef-client in the first place
[2014-04-26 18:40:04 -0400] brucelee_: but theres a huge part of the community whose just trying to incorporate chef into their existing infrastructure :p
[2014-04-26 18:40:15 -0400] ctracey_: coderanger: also love fabric orch. Also cloud-init handle chef client install.
[2014-04-26 18:40:37 -0400] brucelee_: but lets say you have like 50 nodes, and you just want to change an apache.conf on all of them
[2014-04-26 18:40:57 -0400] ctracey_: Fabric + fabtools
[2014-04-26 18:41:01 -0400] brucelee_: like some heartbleed fix, you want to roll out a new httpd.conf, due to some new 'heartbleed'type thing
[2014-04-26 18:41:12 -0400] brucelee_: ill have to check that out
[2014-04-26 18:41:13 -0400] brucelee_: :p
[2014-04-26 18:41:47 -0400] rayrod2030: coderanger: how do you feel about chef based solutions that don't depend on a chef server.  Like airbnb using zk to store attribute data via optica and bootstrapping nodes with chef-solo via stemcell which uses a git repo as the cookbook source of truth?
[2014-04-26 18:42:01 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: just curious, why did you say its useless beyond 5 nodes btw... does it have inherent problems?
[2014-04-26 18:42:14 -0400] rayrod2030: coderanger: I know you aren't opinionated but thought I'd ask. ;)
[2014-04-26 18:42:26 -0400] ctracey_: I use ansible regularly. Just as coderanger points out, it is fine for simple use cases... Anything more complex, not so much.
[2014-04-26 18:43:07 -0400] brucelee_: like for example, a quick firewall change on iptables for like 50 nodes that dont have chefclient or puppetclient...
[2014-04-26 18:43:14 -0400] brucelee_: maybe fabric can do this
[2014-04-26 18:43:16 -0400] brucelee_: but i'd have to check it out
[2014-04-26 18:43:24 -0400] brucelee_: all i know is ansible saved me a lot of time doing that :p
[2014-04-26 18:43:30 -0400] brucelee_: i didnt do it with 50 nodes, more like 6-10
[2014-04-26 18:43:54 -0400] brucelee_: but it didnt seem useless in 5+ node setup :p
[2014-04-26 18:44:04 -0400] brucelee_: i would be able to do the same thing to 100+ in the same way right?
[2014-04-26 18:44:43 -0400] jkeiser: coderanger: oop, I forgot to mention, knife-solve looks like it does the right thing--was there anything you were particularly worried about?
[2014-04-26 18:45:43 -0400] coderanger: jkeiser: Just if theres any other thing you would want on the CLI options
[2014-04-26 18:47:58 -0400] jkeiser: coderanger: the only places you can put runlists and dependencies are in nodes, roles and cookbooks, and I think the CLI options + arguments cover all of them
[2014-04-26 18:48:08 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: installing chef on a machine that doesn't have it consists of installing a package and copying over the validation key, thats about it
[2014-04-26 18:48:15 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: Super easy to write in just about anything
[2014-04-26 18:48:22 -0400] jkeiser: coderanger: -z will cover looking at local roles and cookbooks without uploading to the server ...
[2014-04-26 18:48:38 -0400] jkeiser: coderanger: can't think of any other things I would want offhand
[2014-04-26 18:48:44 -0400] coderanger: jkeiser: heh, though that kind of defeats the point until zero and server are using the same solver
[2014-04-26 18:48:53 -0400] jkeiser: a good point :)
[2014-04-26 18:48:59 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: yeah but i mean going to 50 nodes and manually doing that would suck, and for that, using ansible would be good
[2014-04-26 18:49:10 -0400] jkeiser: in that case, "tell me what my local cookbooks WOULD solve to" seems like an important question
[2014-04-26 18:49:17 -0400] coderanger: rayrod2030: I think its promising, most features of chef-server are outright dangerous
[2014-04-26 18:49:39 -0400] coderanger: rayrod2030: Storing state in ZK is definitely an improvement, but needs a lot of tooling support
[2014-04-26 18:49:46 -0400] jkeiser: But I can see why that might be too big to chew right now :)
[2014-04-26 18:50:08 -0400] coderanger: rayrod2030: buuuut you still need chef-server for managing cookbook releases locally
[2014-04-26 18:50:35 -0400] coderanger: jkeiser: Yeah, I don't think I can support that, and berks would be a better tool there
[2014-04-26 18:50:39 -0400] ctracey_: I know someone that added a chef client time to ansible's galaxy. They removed it bc it was chef... That should tell you all you need to know about how the community operates.
[2014-04-26 18:50:47 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: No, you use fabric or rundeck (or both) to do it
[2014-04-26 18:51:03 -0400] ctracey_: Time = role
[2014-04-26 18:51:12 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: Seriously, Ansible's benefits in this area are marketing spin in most cases :)
[2014-04-26 18:51:26 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: they have substantially backpeddled on agentless mode
[2014-04-26 18:52:04 -0400] coderanger: Also I'm still mad about ansible vault
[2014-04-26 18:52:14 -0400] coderanger: they managed to make something even worse than chef's encrypted bags
[2014-04-26 18:52:19 -0400] coderanger: which is impressive
[2014-04-26 18:53:45 -0400] brucelee_: hah
[2014-04-26 18:53:48 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: :p
[2014-04-26 18:54:05 -0400] brucelee_: still running the chef verify ...
[2014-04-26 18:54:21 -0400] brucelee_: it seems the installation just failed, or something with my system is really fucked
[2014-04-26 18:54:49 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: hey, when yous aid you do "community wrangling" what do you mean
[2014-04-26 18:54:57 -0400] brucelee_: balanced pays you to reach out to community to use it
[2014-04-26 18:54:58 -0400] brucelee_: ?
[2014-04-26 18:56:32 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: No, Chef community wrangling, like talking in here
[2014-04-26 18:56:48 -0400] coderanger: and also tracking development in the chef ecosystem and such
[2014-04-26 18:56:54 -0400] rayrod2030: coderangering
[2014-04-26 18:59:07 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: chef pays you for that? or balanced
[2014-04-26 18:59:13 -0400] brucelee_: because you mentioned you dont work for chef anymore
[2014-04-26 18:59:20 -0400] brucelee_: so i guess you still do? :p
[2014-04-26 18:59:21 -0400] rayrod2030: coderanger: hey so in regards to the elasticsearch cookbook keeping aws keys in node attribs aside from not supporting encrypted data bags I realized that it's pretty bad practice however the aws keys used in elasticsearch are only need for looking up nodes in security groups which can be set as a read-only permission with a policy.  Still sucks but if you do least priviledge it's better than exposing keys with admin acce
[2014-04-26 18:59:21 -0400] rayrod2030: ss.
[2014-04-26 18:59:59 -0400] rayrod2030: uses the keys to do discovery in ec2 because it can't use multi-cast.
[2014-04-26 19:01:41 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: balanced does, its kind of an odd arrangement
[2014-04-26 19:02:30 -0400] coderanger: rayrod2030: You can, how much you want to bet most people use their own admin-level creds?
[2014-04-26 19:02:44 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: kind of wierd, the chef verify is HUGE
[2014-04-26 19:02:55 -0400] brucelee_: at the end it just says everything failed
[2014-04-26 19:02:56 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: Isn't that just running pedant?
[2014-04-26 19:03:04 -0400] brucelee_: not sure t
[2014-04-26 19:03:05 -0400] rayrod2030: coderanger: everybody. :)
[2014-04-26 19:03:05 -0400] brucelee_: :p
[2014-04-26 19:03:24 -0400] brucelee_: cant even hastebin it
[2014-04-26 19:03:28 -0400] brucelee_: document exceeds length
[2014-04-26 19:03:30 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: What command did you run?
[2014-04-26 19:03:34 -0400] brucelee_: "chef verify"
[2014-04-26 19:03:45 -0400] brucelee_: i didnt even go into chefdk folder
[2014-04-26 19:03:57 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: I know nothing of the chefdk commands, and still object to it existing
[2014-04-26 19:04:26 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: well, chef-dk was just an attempt to unfuck my environment
[2014-04-26 19:04:41 -0400] brucelee_: but the core of the problme is, vagrant/berkshelf has some odd stuff going on
[2014-04-26 19:04:45 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: It looks from the code like that just runs the test suites for all subprojects
[2014-04-26 19:05:00 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: chefdk is fine, just ignore the "chef" binary
[2014-04-26 19:05:07 -0400] coderanger: It does nothing important :)
[2014-04-26 19:06:36 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: i just installed it so berkshelf would work properly
[2014-04-26 19:07:11 -0400] brucelee_: i want to be able to test cookbooks with vagrant, but i want berkshelf to automatically upload the cookbooks to my vagrant vm
[2014-04-26 19:07:20 -0400] brucelee_: and i cant get that part to work
[2014-04-26 19:07:53 -0400] lrr: brucelee_: vagrant berkshelf plugin is broken
[2014-04-26 19:07:57 -0400] brucelee_: thats another drawback about config management in general, so many different tools to wrangle together
[2014-04-26 19:08:03 -0400] coderanger: Oh hey, ansible finally fixed Vault
[2014-04-26 19:08:05 -0400] coderanger: good for them
[2014-04-26 19:08:14 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: Did you fix your path?
[2014-04-26 19:08:24 -0400] coderanger: lrr: It works fine for me
[2014-04-26 19:08:25 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: ill add the path now...
[2014-04-26 19:08:43 -0400] lrr: coderanger: well, it's no longer being developed and will slowly start breaking due to deps
[2014-04-26 19:08:48 -0400] coderanger: lrr: No
[2014-04-26 19:08:54 -0400] lrr: i'd suggest looking into test kitchen
[2014-04-26 19:08:56 -0400] coderanger: lrr: It is actively developed
[2014-04-26 19:09:09 -0400] lrr: coderanger: berkshelf is, the vagrant berkshelf plug isn't
[2014-04-26 19:09:14 -0400] lrr: plugin*
[2014-04-26 19:09:15 -0400] coderanger: lrr: You are incorrect
[2014-04-26 19:09:27 -0400] coderanger: lrr: If you cite seth's blog post I will lol ;-)
[2014-04-26 19:09:35 -0400] lrr: heh
[2014-04-26 19:09:42 -0400] coderanger: lrr: It even had a release 6 days ago
[2014-04-26 19:09:50 -0400] lrr: hmm
[2014-04-26 19:09:56 -0400] coderanger: lrr: It _might_ be deprecated _some time in 2015_
[2014-04-26 19:10:06 -0400] lrr: i know i've had ruby gem dep issues with the vagrant berkshelf plugin
[2014-04-26 19:10:17 -0400] coderanger: But vagrant 1.5 fixed a lot of the compat issues with plugins
[2014-04-26 19:10:21 -0400] lrr: an because of that, i switched to test kitchen
[2014-04-26 19:10:24 -0400] coderanger: (at the cost of breaking APIs to do it which sucked, but still)
[2014-04-26 19:10:54 -0400] lrr: on a fresh workstation install
[2014-04-26 19:10:57 -0400] coderanger: lrr: You need to use the mostly-undocumented Gemfile support in Vagrant to make it work well
[2014-04-26 19:11:18 -0400] coderanger: lrr: Just pretend vagrant plugin install doesn't exist
[2014-04-26 19:11:26 -0400] lrr: coderanger: lol
[2014-04-26 19:11:56 -0400] coderanger: lrr: That said, writing automated tests is waaaay better so there is nothing wrong with using TK instead :)
[2014-04-26 19:11:58 -0400] lrr: i will say after having used heavily vagrant + vagrant-berkshelf, and then spending about a day learning/setting up/testing test kitchen, i prefer test kitchen
[2014-04-26 19:12:15 -0400] lrr: especially when trying to ssh to the vm
[2014-04-26 19:12:22 -0400] lrr: it was much faster
[2014-04-26 19:13:12 -0400] coderanger: The main problem with TK is difficulty dealing with multi-VM setups
[2014-04-26 19:13:21 -0400] lrr: true
[2014-04-26 19:13:28 -0400] coderanger: So for example I still use Vagrant for development in my jenkins cluster cookbooks
[2014-04-26 19:23:06 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: so im still confused on the standard cookbook creation/testing workflow. What i do is i do "vagrant init", then i enable berksplugin in Vagrantfile, create the VM, and then i do berks cookbook my_cookbook_1, go in my_cookbook_1/recipes/default.rb and type in something simple like 'yum_package "mlocate" do action :install end'
[2014-04-26 19:23:25 -0400] brucelee_: then i add that cookbook into Vagrantfile and it works fine
[2014-04-26 19:24:06 -0400] brucelee_: but when i try to add some other stuff, for example some iptables rules using a cookbook on the opscode cookbook repository like simple_iptables or something
[2014-04-26 19:24:10 -0400] brucelee_: it wouldnt work
[2014-04-26 19:24:19 -0400] brucelee_: do i add that into Berksfile?
[2014-04-26 19:24:35 -0400] brucelee_: or do i add that into Vagrantfile, or do i have to use berksfile to download it first, and then add it into Vagrantfile
[2014-04-26 19:27:14 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: Vagrant has nothing to do (directly) with standard workflow for most people
[2014-04-26 19:27:30 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: Your standard workflow should be based around test-kitchen and berkshelf in most cases
[2014-04-26 19:27:40 -0400] alexbst_: brucelee_ - kitchen makes more sense as the place to drive vagrant.. :-)
[2014-04-26 19:27:55 -0400] alexbst_: dupe dupe :-)
[2014-04-26 19:27:55 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: https://github.com/poise/cookiecutter-cookbook is my standard layout, for example
[2014-04-26 19:28:25 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: thanks
[2014-04-26 19:28:37 -0400] brucelee_: coderanger: to drive the entire process using berkshelf though
[2014-04-26 19:28:48 -0400] brucelee_: lets say i do berks cookbook my_cookbook_a
[2014-04-26 19:30:11 -0400] brucelee_: so i go into recipes/default.rb and add the yum stuff, and then include_recipe 'simple_iptables', and then i guess i run vagrant up from ~/my_cookbook_a ? :p
[2014-04-26 19:30:51 -0400] coderanger: brucelee_: I wouldn't, I would write some tests using serverspec and run them via test-kitchen
[2014-04-26 19:31:21 -0400] brucelee_: looks like everyones pushing testkitchen :p
[2014-04-26 19:31:24 -0400] brucelee_: to drive teh entire process
[2014-04-26 19:31:28 -0400] coderanger: Yes
[2014-04-26 19:31:30 -0400] brucelee_: ok
[2014-04-26 19:31:32 -0400] brucelee_: ill use that then
[2014-04-26 19:31:35 -0400] brucelee_: forget about berkshelf
[2014-04-26 19:32:13 -0400] coderanger: berks is a dependency solver, just like bundler or pip
[2014-04-26 19:33:57 -0400] rayrod2030: coderanger: no rubocop in the cookiecutter??
[2014-04-26 19:34:22 -0400] coderanger: rayrod2030: No, I'm more of an asshole about style than any linter
[2014-04-26 19:34:41 -0400] coderanger: and I've not spent the requisite 8 hours to come up with a rubocop config I don't hate :)
[2014-04-26 19:34:48 -0400] coderanger: some day I will
[2014-04-26 19:37:54 -0400] rayrod2030: at my old place rubocop saved me alot of embarassing code reviews.
[2014-04-26 19:38:06 -0400] rayrod2030: mostly because I make the same stupid style mistakes over and over again.
[2014-04-26 19:59:18 -0400] coderanger: rayrod2030: Like I said, my brain is better at that than any linter I've used :)
[2014-04-26 19:59:32 -0400] coderanger: rayrod2030: and sublime does basic syntax checks already
[2014-04-26 20:12:55 -0400] bubu: yo, how can you unfreeze a cookbook once frozen?
[2014-04-26 20:19:13 -0400] coderanger: bubu: Use --force to reupload it without the freeze flag
[2014-04-26 20:20:46 -0400] bubu: coderanger: yeah but do I have to do that forever? :/
[2014-04-26 20:21:06 -0400] coderanger: bubu: Not sure honestly, just bump the version :P
[2014-04-26 20:21:18 -0400] bubu: heh good idea
[2014-04-26 20:42:41 -0400] ichilton: Does chef always load all attribute files in the cookbook, or only the one matching the recipe name?
[2014-04-26 20:43:03 -0400] ichilton: I thought it was the latter, but i'm looking at a cookbook here which has an extra attribute file and I can't work out how it's getting loaded...
[2014-04-26 20:45:41 -0400] coderanger: ichilton: All of them
[2014-04-26 20:45:56 -0400] coderanger: ichilton: having more than one attribute file is kind of pointless
[2014-04-26 20:46:14 -0400] coderanger: sometimes nice if you have a ton of attributes, but as you've noticed they all always load
[2014-04-26 20:46:29 -0400] coderanger: ichilton: If you want conditional attributes, look at how poise-appenv works
[2014-04-26 20:47:38 -0400] ichilton: ahh, ok - thanks
[2014-04-26 20:47:54 -0400] ichilton: I thought it only loaded ones with the same name as the recipe, and default
[2014-04-26 22:03:28 -0400] brucelee_: :p
[2014-04-26 23:48:30 -0400] Falieson: @coderanger are you around?
[2014-04-26 23:48:36 -0400] coderanger: Vaguely
[2014-04-26 23:48:41 -0400] Falieson: schweet!
[2014-04-26 23:48:42 -0400] Falieson: haha
[2014-04-26 23:49:21 -0400] Falieson: coderanger: i was using JOliver the other night -> http://pastebin.com/Ux5PLdjG
[2014-04-26 23:49:58 -0400] coderanger: Falieson: Your chef-client is too old, most opscode cookbooks require a recent chef 11 release
[2014-04-26 23:50:25 -0400] Falieson: haha - alright, that's easy enough for me to figure out
[2014-04-26 23:50:26 -0400] Falieson: thanks
[2014-04-26 23:50:55 -0400] coderanger: Falieson: You want to use the vagrant-omnibus plugin
[2014-04-26 23:51:02 -0400] coderanger: that will install the correct version
[2014-04-26 23:51:17 -0400] jkline: I'm including a thirdparty cookbook that frequently fails. How can I catch and ignore errors in that cookbook?
[2014-04-26 23:51:33 -0400] coderanger: jkline: You can't that I know of
[2014-04-26 23:52:05 -0400] jkline: oh
[2014-04-26 23:52:15 -0400] jkline: thanks!
[2014-04-26 23:56:04 -0400] Falieson: jeeez..... I remember building jail hosts in freeBSD - building environments today is ridiculously eays
