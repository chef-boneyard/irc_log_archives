[2014-04-20 00:03:17 -0400] jtran: iis there a quicker way to determin if a role has an empty members list other than having to do a search(:node, "role:rolename").empty?
[2014-04-20 00:03:37 -0400] jtran: i can't find any attrs for role['rolename'] that have a list of members
[2014-04-20 00:04:52 -0400] ranjib: jtran, search is the way. roles are assigned against nodes. \
[2014-04-20 00:05:00 -0400] jtran: kk thanks ranjib
[2014-04-20 01:29:35 -0400] kaz0358: is the changelog for ark ( https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/ark/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md ) fairly complete on the changes from one version to the next?
[2014-04-20 03:34:39 -0400] elejia: graaahhh openstack!
[2014-04-20 03:35:05 -0400] lrr: ?
[2014-04-20 03:35:58 -0400] elejia: :) enjoying building out a wee cloud.
[2014-04-20 03:36:05 -0400] lrr: heh
[2014-04-20 03:36:10 -0400] lrr: i'm inthe same boat
[2014-04-20 03:39:48 -0400] elejia: i made the mistake of trying to use rabbit instead of the default. that didn't go as nicely as i'd hoped.
[2014-04-20 03:56:03 -0400] rpad: I'm seeing "Uploading chef encrypted data bag secret key" on vagrant up, but I'm not seeing the key anywhere else other than /vagrant. Where's that guy normally go? wasn't in /etc/chef
[2014-04-20 04:03:30 -0400] alexbst: rpad - check your node data for where it gets set, as long as the location is valid (matching an actual key) it's fine.
[2014-04-20 04:13:44 -0400] jchauncey: https://github.com/RallySoftware-cookbooks/cookbook_profiler - cookbook that allows you get the profiling information from the chef-handler
[2014-04-20 04:14:29 -0400] jchauncey: it uses an already existing gem but i turned it into a cookbook for easy consumption for test-kitchen runs and debugging on the fly (adding code to a recipe that i may forget to take out seemed crazy)
[2014-04-20 06:08:57 -0400] CADBOT: Hi on the into to enterprise it doesn't talk about pem setup
[2014-04-20 06:09:11 -0400] CADBOT: It seemed to imply it came with the starter kit
[2014-04-20 06:09:15 -0400] CADBOT: but it doesn't
[2014-04-20 17:41:03 -0400] breckognize: I'm trying to migrate from hosting my own chef instance to enterprise chef (Windows). When I run "knife upload /" I get the following error: ERROR: NotImplementedError: symlink() function is unimplemented on this machine.  Note that I've already run "knife download /" on this same machine.
[2014-04-20 17:41:16 -0400] breckognize: Any ideas?
[2014-04-20 19:03:46 -0400] jessemdavis: hi, I'm attempting to start working through the "Test-driven Infrastructure with Chef" book
[2014-04-20 19:04:09 -0400] jessemdavis: i've downloaded one of the Vagrant hosts with the chef provisioner already on it, but it's at 10.18
[2014-04-20 19:04:33 -0400] jessemdavis: is the recommended way to update Chef to 11.10 is just to run the omnibus installer over top of what's on the box already?
[2014-04-20 19:17:10 -0400] jessemdavis: nm, going to just try using vagrant-omnibus
