[2014-04-10 00:18:06 -0400] doomviking: evve1: assuming you upgraded
[2014-04-10 01:04:53 -0400] xorl: does knife upload / upload the data bags directory as well?
[2014-04-10 01:15:15 -0400] evve: doomviking:  Yup restarted chef and nginx
[2014-04-10 01:16:08 -0400] evve: Just like the docs said to chef-server-ctl restart
[2014-04-10 01:16:30 -0400] xorl: take a look at the nginx servers config
[2014-04-10 01:16:54 -0400] xorl: if that applies to the problem, lots of join/quits

[2014-04-10 02:00:44 -0400] xorl: it doesn't even show any output with knife upload / -VVV

[2014-04-10 02:28:58 -0400] someara_: a13x212 I wrote it, what's up?
[2014-04-10 02:32:18 -0400] tjr9898_: hey someara_, is there a summarizer of ohai data
[2014-04-10 02:34:29 -0400] someara_: summarizer?
[2014-04-10 02:35:05 -0400] someara_: "knife node show" will only show you the "vital statistics"
[2014-04-10 02:37:23 -0400] tjr9898_: I think of how to summarize all my servers like what versions different things are running
[2014-04-10 02:37:51 -0400] tjr9898_: They could very well be a better tool, but I was like hmm ohai has most of the data i'm interested in
[2014-04-10 02:38:57 -0400] someara_: knife node search '*:*' -a attribute.youre.looking.for
[2014-04-10 02:41:23 -0400] tjr9898_: yeah I'm thinking of get all the data and make some pretty pie charts
[2014-04-10 02:41:33 -0400] tjr9898_: pipe dream maybe
[2014-04-10 02:54:41 -0400] someara_: tjr9898 try https://github.com/sethvargo/chef-api
[2014-04-10 02:54:49 -0400] someara_: and the partial search API
[2014-04-10 02:55:18 -0400] someara_: aaand http://d3js.org/
[2014-04-10 02:57:22 -0400] tjr9898_: yeah, I was thinking of doing something with ridley but I hadn't ever looked at chef-api
[2014-04-10 02:57:37 -0400] tjr9898_: Thanks for your time
[2014-04-10 03:00:14 -0400] a13x212: someara_, anyway to easily change the mysql server package that gets installed?
[2014-04-10 03:02:46 -0400] someara_: a13x212 the mysql_service resource has a version parameter. check PLATFORMS.md for what versions are supported where
[2014-04-10 03:08:14 -0400] a13x212: someara_, i'm trying to install from the MySQL Yum Repository so the package name is different, mysql-community-server
[2014-04-10 03:08:36 -0400] someara_: ah. yea that's not supported yet
[2014-04-10 03:08:59 -0400] someara_: what platform are you on
[2014-04-10 03:10:15 -0400] a13x212: centos 6
[2014-04-10 03:14:30 -0400] someara_: yea right now it'll do on 6 is 5.1
[2014-04-10 03:16:24 -0400] someara_: made myself a ticket for it: https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-4537
[2014-04-10 03:19:15 -0400] someara_: 5.6 works on smartos and omnios https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql/blob/master/PLATFORMS.md
[2014-04-10 03:25:45 -0400] a13x212: thanks someara_
[2014-04-10 04:03:00 -0400] jtran: hi anyone still awake?
[2014-04-10 04:03:25 -0400] zanshin: Certainly. :)
[2014-04-10 04:03:33 -0400] jtran: i still can't figure out how to set chef-client http_proxy so that all resources that do external call (such as python::pip when it does install pip) will use http_proxy
[2014-04-10 04:04:15 -0400] jtran: i tried the settings here http://docs.opscode.com/config_rb_client.html but apparently that's strictly for allowing chef-client to connect to chef-server over http_proxy , and not necessarily for all child resources that need to connect externally (such as python::pip install pip)
[2014-04-10 04:05:39 -0400] zanshin: Not sure this is what you are after, but: http://serverfault.com/questions/498683/one-off-use-of-http-proxy-in-a-chef-remote-file-resource
[2014-04-10 04:48:10 -0400] chef987: hi
[2014-04-10 04:48:28 -0400] chef987: i am getting error while installing sensu-client using recipe
[2014-04-10 04:50:03 -0400] chef987: Here is more information about error:http://www.pastebin.ca/2693750
[2014-04-10 04:50:23 -0400] chef987: my chef client is centos 6.4
[2014-04-10 04:57:59 -0400] chef987: any idea why it's failing
[2014-04-10 05:24:32 -0400] xorl: chef987 have you tried installing it manually on said host?
[2014-04-10 05:24:51 -0400] xorl: probably another package blocking it
[2014-04-10 05:35:02 -0400] PapaSierra: when a cookbook installs an upstart job, the machine is already started, so that job will never receive an event to say that the machine has started unless you manually restart it. clearly this must be something that upstart has thought of, so i'm just wondering what i'm missing
[2014-04-10 05:38:47 -0400] xorl: there a fix coming out for that data_bag  double encryption cruft?
[2014-04-10 05:39:02 -0400] xorl: having the knife[:secret_file] keeps double encrypting my already encrypted data bag json
[2014-04-10 05:50:32 -0400] northrup: I have what will probably be a 'noob' question if anyone is around... please
[2014-04-10 05:52:48 -0400] Durzo: i am around, and i please. your welcome
[2014-04-10 05:52:53 -0400] Durzo: next
[2014-04-10 05:53:11 -0400] northrup: I want to hace chef-client run as a service on my nodes
[2014-04-10 05:53:29 -0400] northrup: I have added the chef-client cookbook to my chef server using berkshself
[2014-04-10 05:53:45 -0400] northrup: in that respect it is untouched.
[2014-04-10 05:53:51 -0400] Durzo: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-client
[2014-04-10 05:54:09 -0400] northrup: Yes, well - I got it deployed and working
[2014-04-10 05:54:15 -0400] Durzo: adding the cookbook to your chef server without using it or declaring options will accomplish nothing
[2014-04-10 05:54:16 -0400] northrup: however it dies after a single run
[2014-04-10 05:54:42 -0400] Durzo: take a look at the Usage section
[2014-04-10 05:55:03 -0400] northrup: Durzo: checking
[2014-04-10 05:56:50 -0400] northrup: Durzo: I am good with all of that, and using it on an unbuntu node the init method should be the default method for implimentation (which it is)
[2014-04-10 05:57:19 -0400] northrup: however, when it runs at the first scheduled interval, upon the end it issues a restart on the node
[2014-04-10 05:57:28 -0400] northrup: and it never comes back
[2014-04-10 05:58:06 -0400] Durzo: did you set node[:chef_client][:init_style] ?
[2014-04-10 06:00:11 -0400] northrup: Durzo: no, I has assumed (perhaps quite wrongly) that the default init style would be used based upon the platform that chef-client was installed on (based upon my understandings of the code)
[2014-04-10 06:00:45 -0400] Durzo: ok, the default is 'init' for ubuntu (debian)
[2014-04-10 06:01:09 -0400] northrup: Durzo: right - which is why I thought i was OK not specifying that
[2014-04-10 06:01:45 -0400] northrup: Durzo: and indeed after running a sudo chef-client to have the node process the role that tells it to install chef-client, chef-client starts
[2014-04-10 06:02:17 -0400] Durzo: ok
[2014-04-10 06:02:29 -0400] Durzo: so can you see chef-client running in a process list?
[2014-04-10 06:02:42 -0400] northrup: but after the checkin interval, I see this in the log
[2014-04-10 06:02:44 -0400] northrup: http://pastebin.com/z3XMPyNq
[2014-04-10 06:03:05 -0400] northrup: Durzo: yes, I can see it running as a process, until it kicks off again and then throws this error
[2014-04-10 06:04:29 -0400] Durzo: hmm
[2014-04-10 06:04:36 -0400] northrup: yeaaahh...
[2014-04-10 06:04:55 -0400] Durzo: i dont use that cookbook, but reading the manual it seems to read such that you should only use chef-client::init as a bootstrap recipe, not part of the usual runlist
[2014-04-10 06:05:48 -0400] Durzo: "Use this recipe on systems that should have a chef-client daemon running, such as when Knife bootstrap was used to install Chef on a new system"
[2014-04-10 06:07:01 -0400] northrup: Hmm.. maybe I have grossly overlooked something.  I was taking this approach because I was trying to get *to* that state of having the chef-client daemon running
[2014-04-10 06:08:11 -0400] ufk__: is chef client enough to test scripts or I must have chef server installed ?
[2014-04-10 06:16:06 -0400] northrup: Durzo: my dumb fault... I was calling the recipe wrong
[2014-04-10 06:16:18 -0400] Durzo: how?
[2014-04-10 06:16:20 -0400] northrup: Durzo: it should be: 'recipe[chef-client::service]',
[2014-04-10 06:16:34 -0400] Durzo: what were you doing?
[2014-04-10 06:16:45 -0400] northrup: Durzo: instead of just 'recipe[chef-client]',
[2014-04-10 06:16:50 -0400] Durzo: hmmm
[2014-04-10 06:16:54 -0400] Durzo: no that should be the same
[2014-04-10 06:16:55 -0400] northrup: Durzo: which you were right, runs it just for a bootstrap
[2014-04-10 06:17:08 -0400] Durzo: recipe[chef-client] will run default recipe
[2014-04-10 06:17:24 -0400] Durzo: which is a 1 line recipe: include_recipe 'chef-client::service'
[2014-04-10 06:17:34 -0400] Durzo: so its the same
[2014-04-10 06:18:05 -0400] northrup: that's strange... because if I call it plain, the service will start the first time and then die upon the next interval
[2014-04-10 06:18:22 -0400] northrup: start it with "::service" and so far i've passed three service intervals
[2014-04-10 06:18:33 -0400] Durzo: hmmm
[2014-04-10 06:18:39 -0400] northrup: (drastically reduced time to make sure it was working correctly)
[2014-04-10 06:19:12 -0400] northrup: I'm looking at what you're looking at, and yes - I agree from what I can see, they should be the same thing.
[2014-04-10 06:19:37 -0400] m4rcu5: chefs, does the regeneration of the chef-server ssl cert impact client operations?
[2014-04-10 06:19:41 -0400] Durzo: are you sure the node defaults are being in herited ?
[2014-04-10 06:19:59 -0400] Durzo: attributes/default.rb might not be hooked in if you call ::service directly (im not sure?)
[2014-04-10 06:20:28 -0400] Durzo: m4rcu5, depends if your chef clients are set to verify the certificate or not
[2014-04-10 06:21:39 -0400] m4rcu5: Durzo: depends what the default is for 11.10.0
[2014-04-10 06:21:57 -0400] Durzo: 11.10 should default to not verify
[2014-04-10 06:22:20 -0400] Durzo: in which case you can mess your ssl certs all you like
[2014-04-10 06:22:32 -0400] m4rcu5: Durzo: thanks!
[2014-04-10 06:45:59 -0400] ufk__: how can i install chef on gentoo ? there is an old version of chef in portage and there is no gentoo or generic in the download page
[2014-04-10 06:47:18 -0400] m4rcu5: ufk__: you might want to try the omnibus package, but it not sure
[2014-04-10 06:47:25 -0400] m4rcu5: let me know though, im on gentoo as well :D
[2014-04-10 06:47:50 -0400] ufk__: heh.. where can i find omnibus package ?
[2014-04-10 06:49:22 -0400] m4rcu5: ufk__: curl -L https://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh | sudo bash
[2014-04-10 06:49:51 -0400] m4rcu5: thats the most generic way of installing the client
[2014-04-10 06:50:17 -0400] ufk__: that's awesome thanks
[2014-04-10 06:51:07 -0400] ufk__: Unable to determine platform version!

[2014-04-10 06:52:13 -0400] ufk__: gentoo
[2014-04-10 06:55:09 -0400] northrup: ufk__: got me on that one, I would have thought the omnibus would have worked :-/

[2014-04-10 12:37:31 -0400] PleasureTown: fretb: Perhaps your Ohai issue is related to this: http://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/04/09/release-chef-client-11-12-2/
[2014-04-10 12:40:33 -0400] rivimey: Hi
[2014-04-10 12:41:05 -0400] rivimey: Is there a way to record as available a cookbook I have on github?
[2014-04-10 12:41:06 -0400] fretb: PleasureTown: I think the message is a general warning. Since you are in a Vagrant environment, you have no client.rb.
[2014-04-10 12:41:07 -0400] phutchins: btm: yep
[2014-04-10 12:41:16 -0400] fretb: I think you can ignore that.
[2014-04-10 12:41:31 -0400] PleasureTown: fretb: thanks. just making sure since I hadn't seen it before
[2014-04-10 12:41:49 -0400] phutchins: btm: its breaking at gconvert.c:66 GNU libiconv not in use but included iconv.h is from libiconv
[2014-04-10 12:41:54 -0400] fretb: And yeah, I saw that release, and upgraded the chef client version to the new one, but I'm stell getting the error.
[2014-04-10 12:42:24 -0400] rivimey: I created a new cookbook for making openvpn client setups which is available at 'rivimey/openvpnc' on github.
[2014-04-10 12:42:55 -0400] PleasureTown: rivimey: where do you want it to be available?
[2014-04-10 12:43:36 -0400] rivimey: I don't want to move it, just to make it more visible, and wondered if some sort of entry on the opscode community site would be the way.
[2014-04-10 12:43:55 -0400] PleasureTown: ohhh, yeah
[2014-04-10 12:44:17 -0400] rivimey: ?
[2014-04-10 12:44:25 -0400] PleasureTown: rivimey: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks
[2014-04-10 12:44:34 -0400] PleasureTown: There's an "Add a New Cookbook" button on the right
[2014-04-10 12:44:59 -0400] rivimey: I saw that, and clicked, and the first thing it does is ask for a tarball.
[2014-04-10 12:46:46 -0400] ocholetras: does anyone knows a good explanation about when the hell attributes of the recipes are loaded? Is in runlist order? is on compile phase or on the convergence one?
[2014-04-10 12:47:29 -0400] CPS: is it possible to declare a variable in one recipe of a cookbook and have it be visible in another recipe within the same cookbook?
[2014-04-10 12:47:40 -0400] ocholetras: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_nodes_chef_run.html ---> Here says: "All attributes in the rebuilt node object are reset. All attributes from  recipes, roles, environments, Ohai and attribute files are loaded. All  attributes in the rebuilt node object are updated with the attribute  data according to attribute precedence. When all of the attributes are  updated, the rebuilt node object is complete."
[2014-04-10 12:48:39 -0400] rivimey: PleasureTown: Am I misunderstanding the need for a tarball?  I don't want to upload the cookbook elsewhere really.
[2014-04-10 12:48:57 -0400] PleasureTown: rivimey: I think I get what you mean, you just want your repo visible
[2014-04-10 12:49:03 -0400] rivimey: Yep
[2014-04-10 12:51:18 -0400] CPS: ocholetras: on the topic of node attributes, i'm seeing some behavior where attributes set in an attributes file in client.rb are not removed when the attributes file is removed
[2014-04-10 12:51:32 -0400] CPS: is there a way to force it to remove old attributes?
[2014-04-10 12:52:41 -0400] PleasureTown: rivimey: I'm not sure. I think the point of the OpsCode site is to upload a set version of the cookbook and not a "working" version
[2014-04-10 12:53:07 -0400] PleasureTown: rivimey: I'm actually curious of the same question though, it seems like most of us are more interested in cookbooks that are still in progress.
[2014-04-10 12:53:59 -0400] rivimey: ok
[2014-04-10 12:54:11 -0400] rivimey: PleasureTown: thanks anyway.
[2014-04-10 12:54:28 -0400] PleasureTown: rivimey: No problem. Maybe someone else knows the answer...
[2014-04-10 12:54:36 -0400] ocholetras: CPS: that is because those attributes are defined as normal attributes.
[2014-04-10 12:54:54 -0400] ocholetras: CPS: to remove that attributes you have to do it explicitly with knife
[2014-04-10 12:55:15 -0400] CPS: is there a way I can format the attributes file to define the attributes differently?
[2014-04-10 12:55:26 -0400] CPS: i'd like to be able to change/remove this attribute often
[2014-04-10 12:56:29 -0400] rivimey: Just for the record, the point of the cookbook is not to replace the existing 'openvpn' one but to provide a way to configure openvpn differently. The existing openvpn cookbook is based on the assumption that it is configuring a server of 'road warriors'; we needed a configuration where a webserver was contacting a remote openvpn server to access remote services, and that is what the new cookbook implements.
[2014-04-10 12:57:10 -0400] rivimey: It would probably be possible to merge the two back into one given enough knowledge and time, but I am new to chef and somewhat lacking in time as well :-)
[2014-04-10 12:57:11 -0400] someara: the community site is meant to function like CPAN or rubygems.org
[2014-04-10 12:57:39 -0400] someara: it has a flat namespace, so "the existing openvpn cookbook" just means somebody beat you to the namespace
[2014-04-10 12:58:14 -0400] someara: you could share your openvpn cookbook by giving it a different name
[2014-04-10 13:01:49 -0400] someara: better yet, would be to have "the openvpn" cookbook just manage the running service and let the consumer add their own configuration
[2014-04-10 13:02:16 -0400] someara: re-useable patterns etc
[2014-04-10 13:09:57 -0400] fretb: I don't get it, I updated my chef version, using omnibus so ohai 7, and still my chef run fails due to ohai unknown attribute passwd
[2014-04-10 13:10:02 -0400] fretb: all i do is
[2014-04-10 13:10:08 -0400] fretb: ohai "reload passwd"
[2014-04-10 13:10:09 -0400] fretb:   action :nothing
[2014-04-10 13:10:09 -0400] fretb:   plugin "passwd"
[2014-04-10 13:10:10 -0400] fretb: end
[2014-04-10 13:10:28 -0400] fretb: shoudln't be an issue since passwd also is a v7 plugin, am I right?
[2014-04-10 13:23:22 -0400] epcim: Does anybody has experience to run berkshelf 3 -> berkshelf-api server directly on Chef-Server (open source) installed by opscode cookbook?
[2014-04-10 13:46:47 -0400] notromda: morning (central time) chefs!   I have a question about chef-vault that's not quite clear to me  once something is encrypted and stored, and a new host needs to be added to the access, do I have to have a local copy of the unecrypted data in order to regenerate it, or does it automatically decrypt and recrypt with the new host key?
[2014-04-10 13:52:36 -0400] CPS: what is the purpose of json_attribs in client.rb? it seems like anything you put in there gets applied once and never removed if that option is turned off
[2014-04-10 14:04:20 -0400] notromda: ROFL:
[2014-04-10 14:04:21 -0400] notromda: DEPRECATION WARNING: knife decrypt is deprecated. Please use knife vault decrypt instead.
[2014-04-10 14:04:22 -0400] notromda: DEPRECATION WARNING: knife vault decrypt is deprecated. Please use knife vault show instead.
[2014-04-10 14:05:07 -0400] rayrod2030: what's everyone using for hadoop cookbooks these days?
[2014-04-10 14:06:42 -0400] bmhatfield: Is anyone else's chef-client double logging everything with 11.12?
[2014-04-10 14:06:56 -0400] bmhatfield: At first I was afraid there were two clients
[2014-04-10 14:07:04 -0400] bmhatfield: but it appears to be one client, logging everything exactly twice.
[2014-04-10 14:16:44 -0400] bmhatfield: apparently this upgrade broke the force-logger option
[2014-04-10 14:17:20 -0400] bmhatfield: Actually, it seems like all of logging might be different
[2014-04-10 14:36:59 -0400] notromda: WHat happens on chef vault if I have a chef user and node with the same name?
[2014-04-10 14:37:18 -0400] notromda: It looks like the keys databag may have a conflict
[2014-04-10 14:41:43 -0400] bmhatfield: Ugh this logging change is totally backwards incompatible
[2014-04-10 15:01:51 -0400] PapaSierra: i'm reading about the cron resource http://docs.opscode.com/chef/resources.html#cron and i can't work out if this is what i'm meant to use for ongoing add/edit/remove of jobs
[2014-04-10 15:02:56 -0400] srenatus: PapaSierra: I don't understand the question ;) who tells you what to do?
[2014-04-10 15:03:20 -0400] srenatus: PapaSierra: have a look at "cron_d", it's a littler nicer
[2014-04-10 15:04:01 -0400] srenatus: PapaSierra: it lets you manage files in /etc/cron.d/ that are more convenient to handle with chef (i.e. one file per job, just delete one instead of rewrite the file, ...)
[2014-04-10 15:04:32 -0400] srenatus: cron_d is part of the cron cookbook: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/cron
[2014-04-10 15:05:06 -0400] PapaSierra: srenatus: what do you mean "who tells you what to do"?. i'm looking for the right way to manage my cron jobs in source control, so as my code evolves and i decide i need to add another job i can enter it somewhere (cron resource? cron_d?) and then reprovision and it will be there. however, the ability to remove is equally important
[2014-04-10 15:05:54 -0400] PapaSierra: ok, taking a look now...
[2014-04-10 15:26:25 -0400] tehnef: someara: BTW, there were 3 instances of "understated". Only the first one got fixed. I apologize for my pedantry :)
[2014-04-10 15:27:55 -0400] dangerousdave: any tips to stop my souffl from collapsing?
[2014-04-10 15:28:35 -0400] CPS: watch it like a hawk
[2014-04-10 15:28:41 -0400] jbz_: scaffolding
[2014-04-10 15:28:50 -0400] someara: I think you for your pedantry. Passing this along =)
[2014-04-10 15:29:01 -0400] someara: 's/think/thank/'
[2014-04-10 15:30:10 -0400] lurraca: I have a question, I need to install a package/library on my server for my apps to run, this library is postgresql-libs. How I can achieve that without installing a whole posgresql cookbook?
[2014-04-10 15:30:32 -0400] juliancdunn: lurraca: just write a package statement somewhere in a recipe?
[2014-04-10 15:30:44 -0400] juliancdunn: package 'postgresql-libs'
[2014-04-10 15:37:06 -0400] shlant: anyone know if I can use encrypted data bags in a definition?
[2014-04-10 15:37:33 -0400] PierreRambaud: Anyone already have a problems with data bags and vagrant? For example I create the crypted key on my host with openssl, and send it to vagrant, I can use knife to retrieve data values but can't do the same command on the remote host :/
[2014-04-10 15:37:34 -0400] PapaSierra: srenatus: so i'm using the cron cookbooks. it seems to know how to add new cron jobs, but not how to remove them. am i missing something? like action :remove or similar?
[2014-04-10 15:38:22 -0400] lurraca: juliancdunn: so I created a new recipe file posgresql-client.rb, with package 'postgresql-libs' inside it
[2014-04-10 15:38:37 -0400] PleasureTown: Does anyone have any good links to "real world" workflows with Chef? I've read several books and watched several webinars, but now I have information overload and can't figure out where to start :)
[2014-04-10 15:38:39 -0400] lurraca: juliancdunn: I will test it out, thanks for the help
[2014-04-10 15:39:05 -0400] supa_: I'm working with a cookbook that includes a minitest for "assert_sh 'bash -n'" - does that make sense to anyone else?  "bash -n" seems to just launch another bash process...
[2014-04-10 15:39:16 -0400] PapaSierra: PleasureTown: http://misheska.com/blog/2013/06/16/getting-started-writing-chef-cookbooks-the-berkshelf-way/
[2014-04-10 15:39:21 -0400] PierreRambaud: PapaSierra, There's a method to delete cron with this cookbook.https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/cron/blob/master/providers/d.rb#L20-L25
[2014-04-10 15:39:34 -0400] PleasureTown: PapaSierra: Thanks a ton!
[2014-04-10 15:40:15 -0400] notromda: trying to figure out chef vault lots of old documentation out there...
[2014-04-10 15:40:19 -0400] notromda: invalid index name or query
[2014-04-10 15:40:42 -0400] notromda: I have it storing the data for my admin user, but I can't get it to encrypt for the clients
[2014-04-10 15:41:06 -0400] notromda: this worked for my first test data but not for my real data:   knife vault update secrets wested_star_cert --search '*'
[2014-04-10 15:41:14 -0400] PapaSierra: PierreRambaud: right, seen, i'll try that now
[2014-04-10 15:48:55 -0400] PleasureTown: bit of a philosophy question: Is it best practice to create cookbooks as their own git repo or put them within the cookbooks dir of my main repo?
[2014-04-10 15:49:31 -0400] tcate: I prefer to give them their own repo, so it's easier to reuse them between different applications
[2014-04-10 15:49:37 -0400] PapaSierra: PleasureTown: http://dougireton.com/blog/2013/02/16/chef-cookbook-anti-patterns/
[2014-04-10 15:50:00 -0400] PleasureTown: PapaSierra: full of useful info you are
[2014-04-10 15:50:30 -0400] PapaSierra: PleasureTown: they're just the same links that someone gave me a week ago when i didn't know what was going on :)
[2014-04-10 15:50:38 -0400] PleasureTown: lol
[2014-04-10 15:50:59 -0400] PapaSierra: but that first link really made things so clear for me
[2014-04-10 15:51:16 -0400] PleasureTown: PapaSierra: I know the feeling. I've read books for week and now I'm suffering from overload and don't know where to begin
[2014-04-10 15:52:38 -0400] PapaSierra: PleasureTown: also, look for the video on youtube by the guy who created berkshelf
[2014-04-10 15:52:46 -0400] Nukepuppy: @papasierra you have plenty of options for cron jobs.. if they are a lot of horizonally scalable applications that re-use one cookbook in your environment.. i think the chef cron resource is a good idea
[2014-04-10 15:53:12 -0400] Nukepuppy: if you have a lot of one-offs.. then its probably not that useful and you could just template or file/resource it.. but either way theres no wrong
[2014-04-10 15:53:28 -0400] Nukepuppy: the wrong way would definitely be crontab -e  (manually enter)  undocumented / uncontrolled change ;)
[2014-04-10 15:54:59 -0400] someara: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_cron.html
[2014-04-10 15:55:12 -0400] someara: ^ native core resource
[2014-04-10 15:55:19 -0400] PapaSierra: Nukepuppy: ty. i started off by looking at the chef cron resource which looked good, but then srenatus steered me towards the cron cookbook. however, this http://www.hastebin.com/vaboxijuda.rb gives an error ("t" is not defined)
[2014-04-10 15:55:41 -0400] PapaSierra: someara: right, that was my first guess but i never got around to trying it. let me do that now...
[2014-04-10 15:58:13 -0400] PapaSierra: looking at the resource_cron, i'm curious why the cron cookbook exists
[2014-04-10 15:59:37 -0400] someara: to make sure the cron package is installed on the system and the service is running
[2014-04-10 16:00:03 -0400] someara: the cron_d resource I'm not so sure about
[2014-04-10 16:00:03 -0400] tehnef: what's the consensus on validation.pem? is it a good idea to regenerate?
[2014-04-10 16:00:19 -0400] someara: tehnef its a throw away thing
[2014-04-10 16:00:20 -0400] PapaSierra: ok. can someone explain this line:   action node.tags.include?('cookbooks-report') ? :create : :delete
[2014-04-10 16:01:02 -0400] someara: its only used to sign the initial request to chef-server, and request a client be generated for the node... the private key /etc/chef/client.pem is used after that
[2014-04-10 16:01:11 -0400] tehnef: someara: so updating, regenerating the certs used by nginx, and resetting the admin pass (only user we currently even have a pass for) should be good?
[2014-04-10 16:01:31 -0400] someara: as a matter of fact, you should delete it off all your nodes as one of the first things you do in your run_list
[2014-04-10 16:01:50 -0400] someara: yep
[2014-04-10 16:02:01 -0400] tehnef: heh, glad I asked because i did not know that
[2014-04-10 16:02:15 -0400] tehnef: i'll put it in my baseconfig cookbook
[2014-04-10 16:02:47 -0400] Nukepuppy: papasierra probably because the cookbook does other things..   one is free to use it.. or not.. ya know
[2014-04-10 16:03:04 -0400] Nukepuppy: similar to like magic_shell  just a wrapper for env values and aliasing commands
[2014-04-10 16:03:06 -0400] someara: recipe[chef_client::delete_validation]
[2014-04-10 16:03:31 -0400] Nukepuppy: in end you can just make a script to do stuff or a profile.d/entry from a file or template resource   etc..
[2014-04-10 16:04:10 -0400] PapaSierra: i'm just confused because both with are without the cookbook (i.e. native resource cron vs cookbook cron) the delete action appears to do nothing. i must be doing something wrong
[2014-04-10 16:05:56 -0400] someara: they may be a bug in the provider
[2014-04-10 16:06:40 -0400] someara: if you tell it to delete, and it doesn't delete, I'd consider that a bug
[2014-04-10 16:07:08 -0400] Nukepuppy: i have the weirdest issue right now.. from a teammate
[2014-04-10 16:07:09 -0400] PapaSierra: someara: i'm seeing "Processing cron[daily-usage-report] action delete (server-proxy::cron line 7)" in chef's output, but then the file is still physically present in /etc/cron.d/
[2014-04-10 16:07:12 -0400] Nukepuppy: package 'rsync' does nothingo.O
[2014-04-10 16:07:50 -0400] srenatus: PapaSierra: cron[...] doesn't create a file in /etc/cron.d/, does it?  that's what cron_d[...] would do
[2014-04-10 16:08:26 -0400] someara: PapaSierra what platform are you on? can you gist the recipe code? I'll test it out
[2014-04-10 16:08:44 -0400] PapaSierra: srenatus: ok, perhaps that what i'm observing. so there *is* a difference between the cron cookbook vs the cron resource
[2014-04-10 16:08:59 -0400] srenatus: it shouldn't: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/provider/cron.rb#L207-L209
[2014-04-10 16:09:20 -0400] srenatus: PapaSierra: of course there is:  cron[...] --> edit crontab, cron_d[...] -> create file in /etc/cron.d/
[2014-04-10 16:10:36 -0400] PapaSierra: srenatus: right, ok i appreciate now that there is a difference. however, using the cookbook this fails http://www.hastebin.com/lewukibomi.rb (s/cron/cron_d)
[2014-04-10 16:11:27 -0400] JasonG: I'm having an issue trying to reference a service 'baz' in cookbook 'foo' from my recipe 'bar' -- include_recipe 'foo' is in recipe bar, metadata.rb working, but service[baz] cannot be found in resource collection
[2014-04-10 16:12:53 -0400] PapaSierra: it can create entries in /etc/cron.d/ using the cookbook, but action :delete raises an exception about "t" not being defined
[2014-04-10 16:13:14 -0400] mallu: hi, I'm using knife bootstrap with --bootstrap-version .. it appears that --bootstrap-version not doing anything as I already have an older version of chef client installed in my image
[2014-04-10 16:14:30 -0400] mallu: I already have 11 on the image but want to upgrade it to 11.10
[2014-04-10 16:15:39 -0400] someara: papasierra I just took a look at that cookbook... it does indeed look broken... I'd recommend just using the native cron resource for now if your platform ships with cron running as a service
[2014-04-10 16:17:18 -0400] PapaSierra: someara: right, sorry i was going to paste all the stuff you requested, but figured first i need to get clear on what the cookbook is doing
[2014-04-10 16:17:49 -0400] PapaSierra: ty. i'm on ubuntu precise64, i'm going to check now if i can get the cron resource happening for me
[2014-04-10 16:20:56 -0400] nfx_: hello, anyone here have experience with knife winrm?
[2014-04-10 16:22:35 -0400] nfx_: if I specify a command to be executed via winrm for only one host like this: "knife winrm -m "host1" chef-client -x user -P password" it works when winrm is running on host1
[2014-04-10 16:23:20 -0400] nfx_: if i do the same but specifying multiple machines like this: "knife winrm -m "host1 host2" chef-client -x user -P password"  the command output stops displaying if host2 does not have winrm configured
[2014-04-10 16:23:55 -0400] nfx_: essentially I would just like it to say that it can't connect to host 2 but keep running and displaying output from host1
[2014-04-10 16:29:41 -0400] jmreicha: I'm having an issue with gem_package installing a gem correctly.  My chef run seems like it goes okay but after it completes I can't use the gem I just installed?  Where do I need to look for clues as to what happened
[2014-04-10 16:29:54 -0400] jmreicha: Still very new to Chef
[2014-04-10 16:30:16 -0400] jidar: gem list --local not get you going?
[2014-04-10 16:31:19 -0400] jmreicha: It's complaining that gem isn't installed... So I need to install gem on that box first?
[2014-04-10 16:32:00 -0400] jmreicha: here's the output:
[2014-04-10 16:32:09 -0400] jmreicha: The program 'gem' can be found in the following packages:
[2014-04-10 16:32:11 -0400] jmreicha:  * ruby1.9.1
[2014-04-10 16:32:13 -0400] jmreicha:  * rubygems
[2014-04-10 16:32:39 -0400] gleam: it's probably installing it local to chef then
[2014-04-10 16:32:52 -0400] gleam: look in /opt/chef/embedded
[2014-04-10 16:33:53 -0400] hairyhenderson: Hey folks, I'm writing a LWRP that wraps cookbook_file in a loop. Should I call new_resource.updated_by_last_action() once for every cookbook_file that's actually updated, or should I just call it once at the end of my action if any of the cookbook_files are updated?
[2014-04-10 16:34:13 -0400] Nukepuppy: jmreicha there is a failry good cookbook out there that uses the embedded chef installer to install gems
[2014-04-10 16:34:16 -0400] hairyhenderson: (the docs I've found on it are a littel ambiguous)
[2014-04-10 16:34:19 -0400] Nukepuppy: and then you can just ensure you add that to your path
[2014-04-10 16:34:23 -0400] jmreicha: gleam:  Oh yeah, I see it in /opt/chef/embedded/bin
[2014-04-10 16:34:33 -0400] Nukepuppy: you probably dont have it in path!
[2014-04-10 16:35:14 -0400] someara: hairyhenderson just put "use_inline_resources" at the top of the provider and don't worry about update_by_last_action
[2014-04-10 16:35:20 -0400] jmreicha: Nukepuppy: well shit, so is the best method to use that gem cookbook to handle gems?
[2014-04-10 16:35:25 -0400] gleam: as long as everything is chef 11, which it should be
[2014-04-10 16:35:30 -0400] hairyhenderson: someara: I do have that -- what does it actually do?
[2014-04-10 16:36:12 -0400] Nukepuppy: what is the cookbook you were using?
[2014-04-10 16:36:22 -0400] someara: it creates a mini chef run for your provider... if any of the "embedded" resources repair anything, the resource you're implementing will be know something was updated
[2014-04-10 16:36:36 -0400] jmreicha: It is the tmux cookbook but I'm trying to get tmuxinator working on top
[2014-04-10 16:36:43 -0400] jmreicha: Nukepuppy: ^^
[2014-04-10 16:37:04 -0400] jmreicha: So I need the tmuxinator gem
[2014-04-10 16:37:12 -0400] someara: updated_by_last_action is intended to let you notify the resource when you're Using Real Ruby to implement something... usually with shell_out or native ruby methods
[2014-04-10 16:37:36 -0400] hairyhenderson: someara: ah... ok
[2014-04-10 16:37:52 -0400] hairyhenderson: someara: in my case I'm only using core resources
[2014-04-10 16:38:09 -0400] someara: yep. then in your case, just stick "use_inline_resources" at the top and dont worry about it
[2014-04-10 16:38:24 -0400] hairyhenderson: hrm actually, I _am_ using some native ruby, but it's only to feed core resources
[2014-04-10 16:38:30 -0400] someara: well
[2014-04-10 16:38:30 -0400] hairyhenderson: ok, cool. thanks :)
[2014-04-10 16:39:16 -0400] Dairenn: No burning need for this, but I'm curious to know if there's anyone out there working on like a Chef IDE...
[2014-04-10 16:39:18 -0400] someara: if the native ruby changes the state of the system in anyway... like you write a file, then you let chef know about it with updated_by_last_action
[2014-04-10 16:39:36 -0400] hairyhenderson: someara: gotcha
[2014-04-10 16:43:18 -0400] mallu: I'm using knife bootstrap with --bootstrap-version .. it appears that --bootstrap-version not doing anything as I already have an older version of chef client installed in my image
[2014-04-10 16:43:48 -0400] mallu: any help would be appreciated
[2014-04-10 16:45:24 -0400] Nukepuppy: mallu i think it works a bit different than one would expect really
[2014-04-10 16:45:28 -0400] Nukepuppy: what version do you "want"?
[2014-04-10 16:46:38 -0400] jmreicha: What's the differenct between chef_gem and gem_package resoure?
[2014-04-10 16:46:48 -0400] mallu: I want 11.10.0
[2014-04-10 16:47:32 -0400] mallu: i already have 11.4 in the image but want 11.10.0
[2014-04-10 16:47:51 -0400] Nukepuppy: @jmreicha http://docs.opscode.com/resource_gem_package.html    read first 'warning'
[2014-04-10 16:47:57 -0400] bmhatfield: mallu: You want 11.12.2
[2014-04-10 16:48:27 -0400] mallu: bmhatfield: we are not ready to upgrade to the latest
[2014-04-10 16:48:47 -0400] jmreicha: Nukepuppy:  SO I want gem_package?
[2014-04-10 16:49:25 -0400] bmhatfield: mallu: Be aware that it's vulnerable to reverse heartbleed attacks.
[2014-04-10 16:50:02 -0400] bmhatfield: it being "not the latest"
[2014-04-10 16:51:18 -0400] jmreicha: If gem_package installs the gem system wide what do I need to do after it is installed to get the gem to run?
[2014-04-10 16:51:27 -0400] someara: jmreicha chef_gem installs into chef's embedded directory for use by chef and chef alone
[2014-04-10 16:51:28 -0400] jmreicha: Sorry, super new to Chef and Ruby
[2014-04-10 16:51:39 -0400] someara: gem_package installs it to the "system"
[2014-04-10 16:53:02 -0400] jmreicha: @someara: So I tried gem_package to install my gem, it went to /opt/chef/embedded/bin
[2014-04-10 16:53:12 -0400] jmreicha: That's where you would expect it to go?
[2014-04-10 16:53:35 -0400] someara: no, I'd expect it to go into your system ruby's path
[2014-04-10 16:54:40 -0400] jmreicha: @someara: ok, that's what I was thinking.  So I am confused as to why it gets installed there with gem_package install :(
[2014-04-10 16:55:00 -0400] someara: me too.. maybe this will help: https://sethvargo.com/using-gems-with-chef/
[2014-04-10 16:55:01 -0400] Nukepuppy: bmhatfield have a look at this: https://github.com/hw-cookbooks/omnibus_updater
[2014-04-10 16:55:09 -0400] Nukepuppy: maybe a good idea if you want to seriously limit the versions yhou have etc
[2014-04-10 16:55:15 -0400] Nukepuppy: or atleast something like it
[2014-04-10 16:55:58 -0400] mallu: Nukepuppy: any advice?
[2014-04-10 16:56:36 -0400] mallu: bmhatfield: do you have any info about chefc-leint < 11.12 heartbleed?
[2014-04-10 16:56:49 -0400] jmreicha: @someara: Thanks, do you know where to look for clues within Chef?  Logs, etc?
[2014-04-10 16:56:51 -0400] Nukepuppy: oops
[2014-04-10 16:56:54 -0400] bmhatfield: Nukepuppy: What is the context for that link?
[2014-04-10 16:56:56 -0400] Nukepuppy: mallu that was to you!!!
[2014-04-10 16:57:02 -0400] Nukepuppy: bmhat.. it was to mallu :)
[2014-04-10 16:57:03 -0400] Nukepuppy: sorry
[2014-04-10 16:57:31 -0400] bmhatfield: mallu: http://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/04/08/release-chef-client-11-12-0-10-32-2/
[2014-04-10 16:57:39 -0400] bmhatfield: That's what they say about other clients for heartbleed
[2014-04-10 16:57:59 -0400] someara: https://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Troubleshooting+and+Technical+FAQ#TroubleshootingandTechnicalFAQ-WherecanIfindChef'slogs?
[2014-04-10 17:01:08 -0400] mallu: Nukepuppy: thank you for that link.. however can you please tell me how I can use that with knife bootstrap?
[2014-04-10 17:03:21 -0400] jmreicha: @someara: Thanks for the link.  I have so much to learn
[2014-04-10 17:09:23 -0400] kbarry: Question: You you find a community cookbook you want to use, Acme, for example, Would you create another recipe in that cookbook so as to allow you to set attributes, or would you create another cookbook that depends on the cookbookc "acme", and sets attributes?
[2014-04-10 17:09:27 -0400] kbarry: Or some other way.
[2014-04-10 17:10:27 -0400] rayrod2030: kbarry: wrapper cookbook
[2014-04-10 17:10:33 -0400] rayrod2030: your second option
[2014-04-10 17:10:58 -0400] rayrod2030: try not to customize the community cookbook in place.  wrap it instead.
[2014-04-10 17:11:31 -0400] Nukepuppy: use include it..   make your own attributes files.. to override
[2014-04-10 17:11:51 -0400] Nukepuppy: and even then override them elsewhere too (ie environments/node)
[2014-04-10 17:12:08 -0400] Nukepuppy: just try not to fork is general best practice
[2014-04-10 17:13:43 -0400] jmreicha: @someara:  Here is the debug output: http://pastebin.com/qX93HQSL
[2014-04-10 17:14:17 -0400] jmreicha: My Rubygems install path is maybe not right?
[2014-04-10 17:14:55 -0400] someara: looks like its not detecting a ruby on your system so its defaulting to chef's embedded one
[2014-04-10 17:15:15 -0400] estebist_: @coderanger: I missed a bit in the gunicorn_config lwrp where you add the attributes to a list for dynamically building the template vars
[2014-04-10 17:15:21 -0400] estebist_: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/gunicorn/pull/9
[2014-04-10 17:15:26 -0400] someara: what are you trying to do, run a rails app? or...
[2014-04-10 17:15:32 -0400] jmreicha: Let's see.  I used the vagrant-omnibus plugin, maybe that's part of the issue?
[2014-04-10 17:16:12 -0400] jmreicha: MOstly this is just for learning purposes but I'm trying to get an evnironment set up for a web app yeah.
[2014-04-10 17:16:52 -0400] someara: so, there are two ways of running rails apps... using the "system ruby" that ships with a distros packaging system
[2014-04-10 17:17:18 -0400] someara: so, on ubuntu, "apt-get install ruby; apt-get install rubygem-whatever"
[2014-04-10 17:17:48 -0400] someara: which would translate into "package 'ruby'" and "chef_gem 'rubygem-whatever'"
[2014-04-10 17:18:03 -0400] jmreicha: Hm, let me try that
[2014-04-10 17:18:06 -0400] someara: er
[2014-04-10 17:18:17 -0400] someara: sorry both of those would be package resources
[2014-04-10 17:18:32 -0400] someara: the chef_gem would use the gem binary that the system ruby drops off
[2014-04-10 17:18:38 -0400] someara: "gem install whatever"
[2014-04-10 17:18:54 -0400] jmreicha: Yeah I think I understand.  I'll be back :)
[2014-04-10 17:19:02 -0400] someara: the SECOND, more common way to run rails apps, is to use bundler, which is a whole other can of works
[2014-04-10 17:19:08 -0400] someara: worms even
[2014-04-10 17:19:16 -0400] dAnjou: hi, when using chef-solo, how should an environments file look like? i tried this http://paste.pound-python.org/show/jprzamn9ar7ekmKolKRK/ but for the commented "cookbook" line it says it expects 2 arguments and for the one with 2 arguments it says "Environment cookbook version constraints not allowed in chef-solo"
[2014-04-10 17:19:54 -0400] jmreicha: @someara: Yeah, well the only reason I even want tmuxinator is so I can organize the environment.  The actual web app will be Python
[2014-04-10 17:20:49 -0400] jmreicha: So I just need that one piece for my environment
[2014-04-10 17:21:46 -0400] someara: how would you install tmuxinator from the command line without chef
[2014-04-10 17:21:55 -0400] dAnjou: oh, i'm using 11.10. so environments should work for chef-solo
[2014-04-10 17:22:04 -0400] kbarry: I was actually thinking about using attributes on a role, to override the recipe/attributes.
[2014-04-10 17:23:26 -0400] jmreicha: @someara: gem install tmuxinator
[2014-04-10 17:24:19 -0400] someara: try the gem_package resource after you've installed the ruby package and see if that works
[2014-04-10 17:24:54 -0400] jmreicha: @someara:  Looks like the package :install ruby did the trick
[2014-04-10 17:25:20 -0400] someara: yayer
[2014-04-10 17:25:35 -0400] Idealien: I've got a vagrant that the existing chef_solo cookbook sets up capistrano v2.9. What is *the right* way to update the cookbooks so that vagrant up --provision will pull new version instead of using apt-get inside the VM ?
[2014-04-10 17:25:39 -0400] Nukepuppy: dAnjou its talking about cookbook "mysql", "= 5.1.2"  in your error..
[2014-04-10 17:25:40 -0400] Idealien: or ruby gems that is.
[2014-04-10 17:25:54 -0400] someara: brb
[2014-04-10 17:26:07 -0400] dAnjou: Nukepuppy: i know. what should it be instead?
[2014-04-10 17:26:22 -0400] Nukepuppy: i dont know if you can that way in chef-solo honestly
[2014-04-10 17:26:32 -0400] Nukepuppy: i just use berkshelf to lock that up so it never makes it there for testing etc
[2014-04-10 17:26:43 -0400] Nukepuppy: and then in chef-server i setup env restrictions that way for extra level of security
[2014-04-10 17:27:10 -0400] maplebed: Is there a good pattern for using search to find other node's IP addresses where the address you should use varies depending on locality? i.e. for multiple data centers or mixed cloud/DC environments where you want to use the private IP address of local servers and the public address of non-local servers?  Right now my recipes just use node.ipaddress, which doesn't quite do what I want.
[2014-04-10 17:31:07 -0400] Idealien: The cookbook for capistrano basically just says action: install - there isn't anywhere that you can specify for chef which version of capistrano to pull?
[2014-04-10 17:39:21 -0400] circ-user-gf3Vt: quick question about enterprise license, hopefully this is the place for it
[2014-04-10 17:39:27 -0400] circ-user-gf3Vt: wow my username is mental
[2014-04-10 17:39:51 -0400] atiniir: there we go
[2014-04-10 17:40:13 -0400] atiniir: i understand the licensing is per node. i'm trying to clarify if those nodes can be split across server instances
[2014-04-10 17:40:19 -0400] atiniir: (dev and prod for example)
[2014-04-10 17:48:58 -0400] mallu: is it possible to run a post script after knife bootstrap?
[2014-04-10 17:50:42 -0400] PleasureTown: Anyone running Berkshelf 3's bleeding-edge setup?
[2014-04-10 17:51:42 -0400] jtimberman_: PleasureTown: ya, been using the beta for awhile and going to upgrade to the rc today
[2014-04-10 17:52:27 -0400] PleasureTown: jtimberman_: I'm trying to get it set up over here on a fresh 1.9.3, but I get an error when running bundle exec vagrant up
[2014-04-10 17:52:38 -0400] PleasureTown: Syntax error of some sort
[2014-04-10 17:52:53 -0400] mondo: is it a bad idea to store binary files inside a cookbook?
[2014-04-10 17:53:07 -0400] mondo: say I have a 10MB installer.tar.gz file
[2014-04-10 17:53:07 -0400] bmhatfield: mondo: Depends on how big the file is.
[2014-04-10 17:53:11 -0400] gchristensen: yeah that's probably bad
[2014-04-10 17:53:17 -0400] bmhatfield: 10MB is a bit big; git struggles
[2014-04-10 17:53:29 -0400] mondo: cool thanks
[2014-04-10 17:53:41 -0400] gchristensen: mondo: git doesn't do well with binary files
[2014-04-10 17:56:19 -0400] jtimberman_: PleasureTown: vagrant isn't distributed as a gem, so i imagine using bundle exec wouldn't work in general
[2014-04-10 17:56:49 -0400] nobody18188181: has anyone seen this issue with knife configure --initial: ERROR: Ohai::Exceptions::DependencyNotFound: Can not find a plugin for dependency os
[2014-04-10 17:57:04 -0400] atiniir: yeah
[2014-04-10 17:57:09 -0400] atiniir: go back a version at least
[2014-04-10 17:57:14 -0400] PleasureTown: jtimberman_: Yeah, that's what I was thinking, but their instructions explicitly call for it. How do you have it installed?
[2014-04-10 17:57:22 -0400] jtimberman_: PleasureTown: but the #berkshelf channel might have folks that are more familiar.
[2014-04-10 17:57:22 -0400] atiniir: i couldn't get the latest to install anywhere
[2014-04-10 17:57:30 -0400] PleasureTown: jtimberman_: Good call
[2014-04-10 17:57:34 -0400] jtimberman_: I have vagrant installed from the package that Hashicorp provides.
[2014-04-10 17:57:52 -0400] nobody18188181: that pisses me off haha
[2014-04-10 17:58:07 -0400] atiniir: nobody18188181 - i sunk a while into thinking it was my fault yesterday
[2014-04-10 18:02:00 -0400] nobody18188181: atiniir: thanks; the latest 2 versions of chef-client seem broken; only 11.10.4-1 works
[2014-04-10 18:02:22 -0400] atiniir: nobody, yeah that's whati found too
[2014-04-10 18:05:32 -0400] wdpro_kevin: I may have missed this earlier anyone have to update their local SSL cacert file?
[2014-04-10 18:12:36 -0400] sersut: nobody18188181: are you using the omnibus packages for Chef Client?
[2014-04-10 18:12:47 -0400] sersut: while getting Ohai::Exceptions::DependencyNotFound: Can not find a plugin for dependency os
[2014-04-10 18:15:16 -0400] nobody18188181: sersut: yes
[2014-04-10 18:15:40 -0400] nobody18188181: sersut: I went back 2 versions and am able to setup chef-client
[2014-04-10 18:15:49 -0400] nobody18188181: sersut: and use knife
[2014-04-10 18:16:32 -0400] mondo: wdpro_kevin: do you mean the cert used by the chef server or just ssl certs in general?
[2014-04-10 18:17:16 -0400] sersut: got it looking into it right now..
[2014-04-10 18:19:30 -0400] sersut: here https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-5211
[2014-04-10 18:19:40 -0400] sersut: looks like the issue is scoped to only knife configure

[2014-04-10 19:14:37 -0400] phutchins: anveo: and which version of ruby is your chef using
[2014-04-10 19:14:46 -0400] anveo: 1.9.3-p0
[2014-04-10 19:15:37 -0400] phutchins: anveo: i dont' believe it will run them in the order that you see them in the "run list expands to" hash. it should run in the order that you put them in the run_list array
[2014-04-10 19:15:53 -0400] phutchins: *replace hash with string*
[2014-04-10 19:16:35 -0400] anveo: phutchins: it's getting a list from 2 separate roles. Each role has the same base-system cookbook I made listed first. However it is not getting run first

[2014-04-10 19:20:27 -0400] phutchins: anveo: depends on what you mean by run. chef will go throug your cookbooks and some things (like ruby blocks) will run in the first phase but others li ke resources will get queue'd...
[2014-04-10 19:20:49 -0400] phutchins: also, sometimes when your cookbook logs, isn't exactly when that portion of the cookbook is run... depending on how you log

[2014-04-10 19:42:45 -0400] xorl: mallu, after chef-client runs you can add a part to execute some script

[2014-04-10 19:44:26 -0400] mallu: xorl: thanks.. I will take a look at this
[2014-04-10 19:48:22 -0400] CPS: what is the purpose of json_attribs in client.rb? it seems like anything you put in there gets applied once and never removed if that option is turned off
[2014-04-10 19:50:48 -0400] jbz_: CPS:  It's so that when you start up chef-client for the first time, you can prepop attributes.  If you make them 'default', if there's already a server record for that node, it'll override them - but when you're installing chef, you might want to, say, configure the chef-client cookbook to do the right thing.
[2014-04-10 19:51:14 -0400] CPS: okay that sounds like not the right thing to do what i want to do
[2014-04-10 19:51:28 -0400] jbz_: CPS: I tend to use it for attribs I need to have available for initial config, when the node first registers.
[2014-04-10 19:51:33 -0400] CPS: i'd like to be able to frequently change/remove attributes without having to do so in the web ui
[2014-04-10 19:53:09 -0400] CPS: what's the best way to manage attributes that change frequently?
[2014-04-10 19:56:45 -0400] jbz_: CPS: Programatically :-P
[2014-04-10 19:57:22 -0400] CPS: my use case is that owners of nodes will set an attribute on their node to change the behavior of recipes
[2014-04-10 19:57:30 -0400] jbz_: hm
[2014-04-10 19:57:31 -0400] CPS: i just need an easy way to manage that
[2014-04-10 19:57:41 -0400] jbz_: then I'd apply a role to the node
[2014-04-10 19:57:44 -0400] jbz_: indicating ownership
[2014-04-10 19:57:48 -0400] jbz_: and have them change the attribute in the role.
[2014-04-10 19:58:40 -0400] CPS: that's not exactly node-specific
[2014-04-10 19:58:51 -0400] CPS: which is what i'm going for
[2014-04-10 19:59:55 -0400] jbz_: wellI'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do.  I try not to use Chef attributes for 'live control' of individual nodes, because I want all my nodes to be able to reconstitute in case of problems.  If I'm relying on humans setting node attributes, then I can't spin those nodes back up without them.
[2014-04-10 20:00:54 -0400] jbz_: If I have those attributes in roles, I can always spin up new nodes and have them Do The Right Thing because the node record isn't critical-path.
[2014-04-10 20:01:37 -0400] CPS: i've got a bunch of config data in data bags. in dev/qa, sometimes servers want to have slightly different settings without changing the value across that entire environment, so nodes can define an attribute that pulls from a custom data bag of their choice which contains override values
[2014-04-10 20:01:53 -0400] CPS: purely for dev/qa, so reconstruction isn't a priority
[2014-04-10 20:02:11 -0400] jbz_: ah
[2014-04-10 20:06:15 -0400] bricker: Does anybody have suggestions for how to manage nginx configuration? Several of our apps need custom configuration, but I'm trying to stay away from storing app-specific templates in a cookbook

[2014-04-10 20:19:50 -0400] MedicalJaneParis: when i run knife bootstrap for a new node against hosted chef, it creates the node/client just fine, but when the node tries to update itself, it fails because clients > update permissions aren't set. is there a way to enable this during bootstrap?

[2014-04-10 20:38:26 -0400] effgra: Question: I am having a problem overriding (via node.set) a default attribute that is determined by ohai.  i.e. default[recipe][item] = node[fqdn']  then trying to override it with node.set[recipe][item] = 'foo.example.com'
[2014-04-10 20:38:50 -0400] jbz_: effgra: ohai attributes are always of precedence 'automatic' and cannot be overridden.
[2014-04-10 20:38:50 -0400] effgra: The node.set is being ignored
[2014-04-10 20:39:08 -0400] effgra: Ah ha
[2014-04-10 20:39:12 -0400] effgra: That would explain SOO many things
[2014-04-10 20:39:36 -0400] jbz_: Yeah, it's confusing at times.  I found that reading the Opscode doc on attribute precedence - close reading, that is - has served me well.
[2014-04-10 20:40:27 -0400] effgra: What about generated attributes? i.e. default[recipe][item] = "foo", default[recipe][item2] = node[recipe][item], then node.set[recipe][item] = foo is not changing either of the above attributes
[2014-04-10 20:40:38 -0400] effgra: err
[2014-04-10 20:41:06 -0400] effgra: i.e. default[recipe][item] = "foo", default[recipe][item2] = node[recipe][item], then node.set[recipe][item] = bar is not changing either of the above attributes
[2014-04-10 20:42:57 -0400] effgra: a more specific example would be: default[cookbook]['projectname'] = "foo", default[cookbook]['projectdir
[2014-04-10 20:43:25 -0400] CPS: anyone have experience with knife winrm? i'm seeing some weird behavior where chef-client run via winrm complains about permission issues but run locally runs fine, even though the credentials passed in via knife winrm are identical
[2014-04-10 20:43:37 -0400] effgra: a more specific example would be: default[cookbook]['projectname'] = "foo", default[cookbook]['projectdir'] = "/home/#{node[cookbook]['projectname']}
[2014-04-10 20:44:03 -0400] effgra: Then trying to override projectName via node.set[cookbook]['projectname'] = foobar
[2014-04-10 20:44:40 -0400] effgra: Or do generated attributes also have a precedence of automatic?
