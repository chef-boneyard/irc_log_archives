[2014-04-16 00:34:24 -0400] ohmygoshjosh: In case anyone refers back to these IRC logs later, I solved my cert problem by just using a simple Chef resource "file" to pull down my cert and write it to the /etc/chef/trusted_certs directory.  I then use the chef-client cookbook to explicitly set "ssl_verify_mode" to ":verify_peer".  As long as the trusted_certs folder is filled in first, then :verify_peer will work fine.  Easy solution, but took me a bit of time to

[2014-04-16 08:54:18 -0400] nacx: Hi!
[2014-04-16 08:55:13 -0400] nacx: after a first boot chef run, I'd like to remove a recipe from the node run_list and change an attribute to "false", to control wether some parts of a recipe are executed in subsequent chef runs
[2014-04-16 08:55:36 -0400] nacx: (I want chef-client to run periodically, but some stuff must only be executed in the first boot run)
[2014-04-16 08:55:46 -0400] nacx: are there any docs or which is the best way to do that?
[2014-04-16 09:56:14 -0400] srenatus: nacx: you could conditionally include_recipe 'mine::first_boot_only'
[2014-04-16 09:56:55 -0400] srenatus: nacx: using plain ruby in your recipe, i.e. "include_recipe '' unless ::File.exist?('/etc/motd.tail')"
[2014-04-16 10:01:04 -0400] nacx: actually the recipe is defined in a role (which configures some attributes) so I can't remove it from the runlist
[2014-04-16 10:01:23 -0400] nacx: would a "return if node['foo']" at the beginning of the recipe be correct?
[2014-04-16 10:04:23 -0400] nacx: and following with this approach, it is possible to set an attirbute in the node from a recipe?
[2014-04-16 10:04:36 -0400] nacx: can I do something like: node['foo'] = 'bar' in a recipe?
[2014-04-16 10:04:46 -0400] nacx: to set a new attribute?
[2014-04-16 10:06:33 -0400] srenatus: nacx: you always need a precendence level
[2014-04-16 10:06:42 -0400] srenatus: nacx: e.g. node.normal['foo'] = 'bar'
[2014-04-16 10:06:52 -0400] srenatus: but apart from that, "return if .." is fine
[2014-04-16 10:06:58 -0400] nacx: ok
[2014-04-16 10:07:00 -0400] nacx: thanks
[2014-04-16 10:07:18 -0400] nacx: so setting something like: node.normal['first-run-done'] = true
[2014-04-16 10:07:22 -0400] nacx: should do the trick then
[2014-04-16 10:08:55 -0400] srenatus: nacx: as long as the first run is successful, i.e. node.save happens
[2014-04-16 10:09:28 -0400] nacx: great. thank you very much!
[2014-04-16 10:11:09 -0400] srenatus: :)
[2014-04-16 10:11:54 -0400] srenatus: nacx: should you be using chef-solo (i.e. there's no node.save without a server to save it on, local-mode or a proper one), you could still resort to putting a file on disk
[2014-04-16 10:13:18 -0400] nacx: hmmm, the marker file approach seems more general then
[2014-04-16 10:13:24 -0400] nacx: will do that :)
[2014-04-16 10:14:05 -0400] srenatus: nacx: depends... you can query the chef-server for nodes that had a proper run...oh wait, only nodes with proper first runs are stored on the server anyways
[2014-04-16 10:15:01 -0400] nacx: better :)
[2014-04-16 10:15:02 -0400] srenatus: nacx: you could probably check for "does the chef server know me already"... without any attributes or helper files
[2014-04-16 10:15:14 -0400] nacx: hmmm
[2014-04-16 10:15:18 -0400] nacx: using the search api?
[2014-04-16 10:15:19 -0400] workmad3: srenatus: a node could end up without a proper first run if you did a manual 'node.save' in a recipe
[2014-04-16 10:15:46 -0400] nacx: I'm not doing a manual save, but when the chef run is in progress the first time
[2014-04-16 10:15:48 -0400] srenatus: workmad3: yes indeed
[2014-04-16 10:15:55 -0400] nacx: I can see the node in the chef server console (bit it is empty)
[2014-04-16 10:16:00 -0400] srenatus: nacx: you are not, but maybe cookbook mysql did... ;)
[2014-04-16 10:16:02 -0400] nacx: will the search() method return that node?
[2014-04-16 10:16:05 -0400] srenatus: gtg lunch
[2014-04-16 10:16:15 -0400] nacx: oh, right :)
[2014-04-16 10:16:17 -0400] workmad3: nacx: if the chef server knows about it, then yes
[2014-04-16 10:16:47 -0400] nacx: ok, will try the marker attribute/file approach then
[2014-04-16 10:17:20 -0400] workmad3: nacx: if you do set that attribute, then you'd need to do a node.save after setting it in order for that to be searchable too
[2014-04-16 10:18:16 -0400] nacx: I don't need the attribute in the same chef run. it is only to prevent subsequent ones from reaching some code
[2014-04-16 10:18:25 -0400] nacx: do I need to manually save the node in that case too?
[2014-04-16 10:19:28 -0400] nacx: btw, just found these docs http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_resources_first_run.html
[2014-04-16 10:19:29 -0400] nacx: :)
[2014-04-16 10:19:35 -0400] workmad3: nacx: hmm... I'd prefer to do the check for subsequent nodes based on some side-effect that they leave around
[2014-04-16 10:20:37 -0400] workmad3: nacx: e.g. in my custom resources, when I do something like compile a library from source, I'll trigger the compile based on if the compiled lib is in the expected place

[2014-04-16 13:15:36 -0400] shlant: zaargy: it depends where in the wrapper cookbook. If you want to override it in the recipe, you would have to set it at a higher precedence level
[2014-04-16 13:18:21 -0400] zaargy: sure i can override it with override recipe

[2014-04-16 16:10:44 -0400] dAnjou: (not just mysql). because the mysql_bin attribute is platform dependent.
[2014-04-16 16:16:45 -0400] CPS: how do i restore backed up cookbook/client info from a copy of the chef-server directory?
[2014-04-16 16:19:29 -0400] double_p: damnit.. cannot load chefconf stream :(
[2014-04-16 16:19:31 -0400] ben___: how can I see what cookbook version a given node is using?
[2014-04-16 16:19:42 -0400] double_p: ben___: /var/chef/cache ...
[2014-04-16 16:20:41 -0400] ben___: double_p:  that works, thanks
[2014-04-16 16:27:14 -0400] sauraus: This is probably a stupid question, but how do I increment the value of an attribute when looping over an array?
[2014-04-16 16:27:32 -0400] sauraus: xxxx.each do |x|
[2014-04-16 16:27:42 -0400] sauraus: node['y']++
[2014-04-16 16:32:03 -0400] stormerider: sauraus: why not do node['y'] = xxxx.count ?
[2014-04-16 16:32:50 -0400] stormerider: if you're doing conditional filtering, id probably just use a temp variable otherwise
[2014-04-16 16:33:06 -0400] stormerider: and then assign to the node structure at the end
[2014-04-16 16:33:50 -0400] double_p: now, that's chewinggum accent on the stream :}
[2014-04-16 16:47:12 -0400] jidar: live from chefconf http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l_7OzkSZ4s

[2014-04-16 16:48:41 -0400] kersh: Good call on the DevOps_BobRoss.
[2014-04-16 16:48:41 -0400] bmhatfield: This basically has made chef totally unusuable for me on macs

[2014-04-16 17:11:24 -0400] cheeseprocedure: hi all - anyone have advice on dealing with encrypted data bag keys for autoscaling instances?
[2014-04-16 17:12:01 -0400] stormerider: cheeseprocedure: that's been discussed a lot in the past in the mailing list and channel
[2014-04-16 17:12:27 -0400] cheeseprocedure: stormerider: indeed, and i'm having trouble determining whether it's a solved problem or whether everyone has given up and moved to chef-vault
[2014-04-16 17:12:40 -0400] stormerider: short answer, there's no real great solution; you have to trust something if you want an automated config, the question is what do you trust the most
[2014-04-16 17:13:08 -0400] stormerider: chef vault still has the same underlying issue when it comes to autoscaling nodes
[2014-04-16 17:13:25 -0400] cheeseprocedure: yeah, the chicken-and-egg issue is a bit of a snag for us
[2014-04-16 17:13:55 -0400] cheeseprocedure: but thanks; i just wanted to make sure i hadn't missed some sort of brilliant fix-all :)
[2014-04-16 17:14:02 -0400] stormerider: IOW, as coderanger has pointed out before, encrypted data bags are not a panacea
[2014-04-16 17:14:11 -0400] NukePuppy: chef-vault looks like a better solution due to the private key distribution
[2014-04-16 17:14:17 -0400] ohmygoshjosh: cheeseprocedure: if you're talking about storing secrets in Chef, I found a pretty elegant solution using the citadel cookbook
[2014-04-16 17:14:35 -0400] ohmygoshjosh: cheeseprocedure: as long as you're using Amazon Web Services, that is.
[2014-04-16 17:14:44 -0400] stormerider: NukePuppy: istr it breaks down if you're not statically defining the nodes
[2014-04-16 17:14:54 -0400] cheeseprocedure: ohmygoshjosh: i'm a happy citadel customer :)
[2014-04-16 17:15:13 -0400] cheeseprocedure: in this case i'm talking about data_bag encryption keys themselves, which (if i understand correctly) need to be present for recipe compilation not to fail
[2014-04-16 17:15:14 -0400] NukePuppy: stormerider yeah i know but...
[2014-04-16 17:15:16 -0400] NukePuppy: if you use wildcard certs
[2014-04-16 17:15:20 -0400] NukePuppy: it can be a god send
[2014-04-16 17:15:46 -0400] ohmygoshjosh: cheeseprocedure: ah, excellent.  It's a great way to store secrets in S3.  You could then use it to pass around your data_bag encryption keys as well.
[2014-04-16 17:15:53 -0400] stormerider: like i said, comes down to a question of what you trust most :)
[2014-04-16 17:17:05 -0400] NukePuppy: speaking of data bags ;p
[2014-04-16 17:17:13 -0400] cheeseprocedure: ohmygoshjosh: i think my n00bness is showing. is distributing data_bag keys via citadel/some other S3 method possible without introducing a multi-step provisioning process (e.g. first runlist populates keys, runlist updated, run again...)?
[2014-04-16 17:17:16 -0400] NukePuppy: how can i properly fail to a cookbook_file if the data abg isnt present?
[2014-04-16 17:18:33 -0400] ohmygoshjosh: cheeseprocedure: Dude, it may me my n00bness that's showing :)  I know exactly what issue you're talking about b/c I experienced it myself.  The key question is whether citadel can load your key on your server before the encrypted data_bag contents are needed.  And I'm not sure.
[2014-04-16 17:19:00 -0400] ohmygoshjosh: cheeseprocedure: What I would try is putting a recipe first in your runlist whose job is to fetch your encryption key from S3 using citadel
[2014-04-16 17:19:06 -0400] NukePuppy: like i dunno file = data_bag_item('somedatabag', 'values')  || use a cookbook_file instead
[2014-04-16 17:19:33 -0400] ben___: NukePuppy: rescue HTTPServerException when calling data_bag_item
[2014-04-16 17:19:38 -0400] ohmygoshjosh: cheeseprocedure: Then see if your subsequent recipes which use the encrypted data_bag will be able to read the encryption key from that file.  It's only something to test, though.  I'm not sure if it will work.
[2014-04-16 17:20:50 -0400] NukePuppy: @Ben___ that looks interesting thanks a lot
[2014-04-16 17:20:53 -0400] cheeseprocedure: ohmygoshjosh: i was hoping something like that would solve the problem, but the compilation phase of the Chef run blows up due to the missing encryption keys :(
[2014-04-16 17:20:56 -0400] ben___: np
[2014-04-16 17:21:05 -0400] cheeseprocedure: which makes sense
[2014-04-16 17:21:31 -0400] ohmygoshjosh: cheeseprocedure: Ah, I see.  I encountered that exact issue, so we decided to ditch encrypted data_bags entirely and use citadel for everything
[2014-04-16 17:22:02 -0400] ohmygoshjosh: cheeseprocedure: After all, there's nothing you couldn't accomplish in S3/citadel that you can do with encrypted data bags.  It's just storing secrets.
[2014-04-16 17:22:07 -0400] cheeseprocedure: ohmygoshjosh: it's tempting :)
[2014-04-16 17:23:50 -0400] ohmygoshjosh: If I want environment-specific attributes in my recipe, is the best way to do this to to use
[2014-04-16 17:23:58 -0400] ohmygoshjosh: "env_run_lists" in my role definitions?
[2014-04-16 17:37:49 -0400] oponder: hey guys, i remmeber the mysql cookbook would make a random root password
[2014-04-16 17:38:09 -0400] oponder: now "ilikerandompasswords" is baked in the attributes.. whaddup wit that?
[2014-04-16 17:38:11 -0400] oponder: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql/blob/master/attributes/default.rb
[2014-04-16 17:38:37 -0400] bmhatfield: The mysql cookbook is badly in need of a refactor to support databags instead
[2014-04-16 17:40:37 -0400] oponder: Was the random password not a good approach?
[2014-04-16 17:42:11 -0400] surge_: Do i need to make a new chef-validator.pem file because of heartbleed?
[2014-04-16 17:45:00 -0400] oponder: Because now we've got something that by default listens on the public interface with a easily guessed password.
[2014-04-16 17:47:04 -0400] bmhatfield: I mean, it's better than a common password :-)
[2014-04-16 17:47:05 -0400] bmhatfield: But
[2014-04-16 17:47:19 -0400] bmhatfield: Now your mysql root password is saved in the clear on your chef server
[2014-04-16 17:47:29 -0400] bmhatfield: This is /the/ problem databags were intended to solve
[2014-04-16 17:47:59 -0400] oponder: hmm yeah...
[2014-04-16 17:48:13 -0400] oponder: if the databag alternative would work
[2014-04-16 17:48:25 -0400] oponder: or would be ready i mean
[2014-04-16 17:49:32 -0400] bmhatfield: Making the mysql cookbook work with databags instead of attributes is unfortunately a fairly large refactor
[2014-04-16 17:49:53 -0400] NukePuppy: @Ben___ do you have any working examples of the rescue Net::HTTPServerException  ?
[2014-04-16 17:50:03 -0400] NukePuppy: i just keep getting my databag is  blank ''
[2014-04-16 17:50:13 -0400] ben___: NukePuppy, lemme take a look, one sec
[2014-04-16 17:50:45 -0400] oponder: bmhatfield: should I stick to a older version of the mysql cookbook?
[2014-04-16 17:51:09 -0400] bmhatfield: oponder: I don't know. I just said 'screw it' and used whatever was available at the time.
[2014-04-16 17:51:13 -0400] oponder: lol
[2014-04-16 17:51:14 -0400] oponder: I'm too new to make my own rules :P Just need some strong opinions to follow first before I start making my own.
[2014-04-16 17:51:54 -0400] oponder: i'll keep on keepin on though. thanks for the replies
[2014-04-16 17:52:00 -0400] ben___: NukePuppy: first thing ack returned: https://gist.github.com/benlemasurier/10913256
[2014-04-16 17:53:16 -0400] NukePuppy: ill try and go that route i was trying to rescure 404 errors
[2014-04-16 17:53:22 -0400] NukePuppy: maybe its not an actual 404 when data bag isnt found
[2014-04-16 17:56:22 -0400] oponder: Even bind_address does nothing anymore on the new mysql... quite perplexed at what the best approach is now with these newer versions of database and mysql cookbooks
[2014-04-16 18:01:20 -0400] oponder: I guess its in an effort to simplify all the moving parts.. i can appreciate that
[2014-04-16 18:01:45 -0400] NukePuppy: might not be best bet but try the the older tags of the cookbook?
[2014-04-16 18:02:09 -0400] NukePuppy: i know the database cookbook recently had a bunch of breaking changes :(
[2014-04-16 18:04:30 -0400] oponder: i'll give that a try indeed..

[2014-04-16 19:15:36 -0400] alexbst: jidar - no, I think all they did was the keynote.
[2014-04-16 19:19:29 -0400] oponder: asdf_: I think that's a normal thing. I know that I'm including recipe[chef-client::service] from here: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-client in my nodes
[2014-04-16 19:21:48 -0400] asdf_: oponder, as am I, so why does the service stop?
[2014-04-16 19:21:59 -0400] oponder: oh.. hm
[2014-04-16 19:22:03 -0400] asdf_: it bootstraps, does the first chef run and then the service stops...
[2014-04-16 19:22:15 -0400] asdf_: so it won't do chef runs again ...
[2014-04-16 19:22:34 -0400] asdf_: the whole point of chef-client::service is to have it run in the background every X minutes as a daemon.
[2014-04-16 19:22:46 -0400] oponder: mine leaves a process behind: /opt/chef/embedded/bin/ruby /usr/bin/chef-client -d -P /var/run/chef/client.pid -c /etc/chef/client.rb -i 1800 -s 300 -L /var/log/chef/client.log
[2014-04-16 19:22:52 -0400] oponder: and you can see the interval in there
[2014-04-16 19:23:02 -0400] oponder: ps ax | grep chef
[2014-04-16 19:23:12 -0400] oponder: to check if you
[2014-04-16 19:23:25 -0400] oponder: have such a chef-client process running too
[2014-04-16 19:24:59 -0400] asdf_: If I do a ps aux | grep chef , there is no process.
[2014-04-16 19:25:14 -0400] oponder: then something is indeed weird
[2014-04-16 19:25:47 -0400] oponder: But I am afraid that I wouldn't know where to begin :P sorry man
[2014-04-16 19:25:59 -0400] asdf_: I'm running chef 11.12.2 and using the opscode community chef-client cookbook
[2014-04-16 19:26:10 -0400] asdf_: jtimberman, any ideas dude? Been bugging me for days now.
[2014-04-16 19:27:01 -0400] asdf_: If I run a service chef-client status it returns a fail, but if I start the chef-client service, all is OK.

[2014-04-16 20:27:48 -0400] Urocyon: ok, illegal instruction: 4, for those who wish to know, probably means that the binaries in Chef DK were compiled for OS X 10.8 without any compatibility flags for earlier versions.
[2014-04-16 20:27:59 -0400] programmerq: jslusher: looks like you're doing it right. as long as the command exits with a 0 return code, it should pass the only_if check.

[2014-04-16 20:32:26 -0400] jslusher: programmerq: that's the problem. that command in the only_if should return a 1 if the alias doesn't exist, and it does on the command line, but chef seems to think it returns true every time

[2014-04-16 20:46:07 -0400] jslusher: kersh: http://pastebin.com/CQ9jcpzu
[2014-04-16 20:50:18 -0400] kersh: jslusher: Is that supposed to be passed to the OS?
[2014-04-16 20:50:48 -0400] kersh: I think you have to wrap it with system().
[2014-04-16 20:53:03 -0400] jslusher: kersh: is there documentation you can point me to? not sure how to use system()
[2014-04-16 20:54:20 -0400] ben___: jslusher kersh: use https://github.com/opscode/mixlib-shellout instead of system()
[2014-04-16 20:55:16 -0400] kersh: jslusher: Just wrap the string in only_if with system, or mixlib I guess. only_if { system("...") }
[2014-04-16 20:55:28 -0400] kersh: What's the advantage of mixlib-shellout over system?
[2014-04-16 20:55:55 -0400] ben___: readme on that page has a good writeup
[2014-04-16 20:56:09 -0400] kersh: Right now you're just testing for the truthiness of a string, rather than the result of a call to the OS.
[2014-04-16 21:22:34 -0400] doomviking: coderanger time!
[2014-04-16 21:25:32 -0400] iroller: Hey Chef guys, which talk should I attend to get more info on Chef Analytics thing? Pretty interested in it
[2014-04-16 21:26:25 -0400] mhenrixon: I can't make it work
[2014-04-16 21:26:56 -0400] mhenrixon: I want to fetch some stuff from the server using bash but nothing I try works.
[2014-04-16 21:27:11 -0400] mhenrixon: ruby_block isn't really an option because I need to run it as a specific user etc.
[2014-04-16 21:28:46 -0400] mhenrixon: coderanger you always have an answer for everything, what do you suggest? :)
[2014-04-16 21:28:56 -0400] doomviking: he's speaking right this second
[2014-04-16 21:29:28 -0400] mhenrixon: oh that sucks
[2014-04-16 21:29:34 -0400] mhenrixon: lol
[2014-04-16 21:29:58 -0400] mhenrixon: wait no I bet him speaking doesn't suck. I just wish I could figure it out that is all
[2014-04-16 21:35:38 -0400] PapaSierra: using chef, i'm provisioning a server with php 5.5 on ubuntu precise 64. it was working fine a few days ago (installing 5.5.10) i think the ondrej ppa was updated because now it's trying to install 5.5.11, but i'm getting this error and not sure how to proceed http://www.hastebin.com/raw/ranuladulo
[2014-04-16 21:46:17 -0400] notromda: ahhh, I was going to go to coderangers talk
[2014-04-16 21:51:06 -0400] sdfsf: how do I prevent chef from immediately trying to SSH into EC2 instance?
[2014-04-16 21:52:15 -0400] drywheat: sdfsf: could you restate that question? under what conditions do you mean?
[2014-04-16 21:52:19 -0400] jslusher: programmerq: hey, wrapping it system() did the trick. Thanks!
[2014-04-16 21:55:05 -0400] sdfsf: using knife ec2 to start an ec2 instance. after it starts and shows the progress in the knife command line, it immediately tries to start an SSH
[2014-04-16 21:57:42 -0400] stormerider: sdfsf: it tries to bootstrap the node after creation
[2014-04-16 21:58:42 -0400] programmerq: jslusher: good to know!
[2014-04-16 21:59:03 -0400] sdfsf: so bootstrapping the node is starting the ssh?
[2014-04-16 21:59:09 -0400] programmerq: but I think it was kersh that suggested wrapping it.
[2014-04-16 21:59:35 -0400] kersh: programmerq jslusher: Yeah, glad to hear that worked.
[2014-04-16 22:00:04 -0400] jslusher: thank you as well, kersh
[2014-04-16 22:00:08 -0400] kersh: Though I am looking into ben___ 's advice on MixLib.
