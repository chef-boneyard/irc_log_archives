[2014-04-19 01:53:18 -0400] Nate_: Hi all.  I'm trying to come to a decision on something.  I'm about to deploy a couple production environments.  I would like to keep the application configuration (non-sensitive) separate from our dev/test cookbooks.  I also want to avoid keeping this configuration in a non-versioned place like a chef_environment.  Does it make sense to store application configurations in a separate "config" cookbook?
[2014-04-19 01:58:59 -0400] flaccid: Nate_: not really
[2014-04-19 02:00:15 -0400] Nate_: @flaccid, would you keep production configuration like URLs, specific application settings in a data bag?
[2014-04-19 02:00:46 -0400] Nate_: or just in the cookbook where the application recipe resides?
[2014-04-19 02:00:48 -0400] flaccid: Nate_: i'd use node attributes
[2014-04-19 02:02:21 -0400] Nate_: So I have a 100 servers and I maintain the batch_processor app's interval in each node's definition or do you mean to set the node attribute elsewhere?
[2014-04-19 02:09:42 -0400] flaccid: Nate_: set the node attribute on the node as desired
[2014-04-19 02:09:55 -0400] flaccid: when you bootstrap it with knife or what not
[2014-04-19 02:12:14 -0400] flaccid: or use roles
[2014-04-19 02:12:47 -0400] flaccid: there is also enironments
[2014-04-19 02:12:51 -0400] flaccid: *env
[2014-04-19 03:18:26 -0400] hakunin: hi, can anyone help me figure out why searching my chef server for specific tags always returns all nodes, even when they don't have that tag?
[2014-04-19 03:18:39 -0400] hakunin: query looks like "tags:cron"
[2014-04-19 03:19:14 -0400] hakunin: i know this is coming from the server because i tried going to /search/node?q=tags:cron in browser and see all nodes returned
[2014-04-19 03:20:15 -0400] hakunin: also interesting: somehow this works when search is running inside recipes, but not when following that url or using knife
[2014-04-19 03:20:27 -0400] hakunin: whyyyyyyyyy
[2014-04-19 03:20:38 -0400] hakunin: i've been having this for ages now, makes knife hardly useful
[2014-04-19 03:42:03 -0400] hakunin: this is what i see in log when running search by tags:cron:
[2014-04-19 03:42:06 -0400] hakunin: INFO: [] webapp=/solr path=/select params={sort=X_CHEF_id_CHEF_X+asc&indent=off&start=0&q=content:tags__%3D__cron&wt=json&fq=%2BX_CHEF_database_CHEF_X:chef_00000000000000000000000000000000+%2BX_CHEF_type_CHEF_X:node&rows=20} hits=13 status=0 QTime=3
[2014-04-19 03:42:39 -0400] hakunin: (seems small enough for paste)
[2014-04-19 03:42:57 -0400] hakunin: unfortunately 13 hits is wrong, it should've been couple of hits only
[2014-04-19 03:43:41 -0400] hakunin: i ran chef-server-ctl reindex and waited, didn't help
[2014-04-19 03:44:36 -0400] hakunin: why all the extra results
[2014-04-19 04:40:23 -0400] elejia: good afternoon
[2014-04-19 04:40:49 -0400] elejia: anyone alive? :)
[2014-04-19 04:57:41 -0400] cob: elejia: it's 1:57am here, good morning
[2014-04-19 04:57:51 -0400] cob: haha, lol
[2014-04-19 05:01:43 -0400] double_p: 7am, what's up for cooking? :)
[2014-04-19 05:03:26 -0400] cob: greasy eggs?
[2014-04-19 09:34:29 -0400] cyrusdavid: is this also correct in a provider? new_resource[:name]
[2014-04-19 09:34:40 -0400] cyrusdavid: or is .name a function?
[2014-04-19 19:16:45 -0400] ranjib: anyone noticing chef is logging everything twice with --force-logger , in 11.12.0
[2014-04-19 19:16:53 -0400] ranjib: sorry, 11.12.2
[2014-04-19 20:49:48 -0400] heliumcraft: anyone here uses chef-solo ?
[2014-04-19 21:18:10 -0400] sarkis: i'm using chef solo + berksfile way and i don't seem to understand why adding dependencies to the metadata.rb file is necessary to my application level cookbooks?
[2014-04-19 21:19:00 -0400] sarkis: should i just be adding the berkshelf path to my chef solo runpath?
[2014-04-19 21:36:06 -0400] helfire: with chefdk i get a gem not found doing foodcritic, bug? Also how do you run rspec/chefspec via chefdk?
