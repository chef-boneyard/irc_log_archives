[2014-04-06 00:36:07 -0400] davidski: Is anyone about that can help me debug a problem using a 3rd party LWRP cookbook?
[2014-04-06 00:37:44 -0400] Death_Syn: now almost everything on my scroll is 400s
[2014-04-06 00:44:36 -0400] Death_Syn: hmm, https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4504 looks like my issue, but i'm running chef 11.0.11 server
[2014-04-06 00:44:57 -0400] Death_Syn: and knife 11.12.0.rc.1, apparently
[2014-04-06 00:55:10 -0400] Death_Syn: okay, looks like everything is hitting my chef-server 11 successfully except cookbooks
[2014-04-06 00:55:16 -0400] Death_Syn: my cookbooks are empty on the web UI
[2014-04-06 00:55:27 -0400] Death_Syn: environments, roles, nodes, data bags, clients and users all seem to have made it up
[2014-04-06 00:55:39 -0400] Death_Syn: any idea how I can correct this?
[2014-04-06 01:09:23 -0400] Death_Syn: ooh
[2014-04-06 01:09:27 -0400] Death_Syn: /etc/hosts needed to update
[2014-04-06 04:38:39 -0400] Anashel: Hey there, first time I use cookbook and recipe. Here is my recipe: https://github.com/humanequation/opsworks-cookbooks/blob/master/wordpress/recipes/configure.rb
[2014-04-06 04:38:49 -0400] Anashel: Ready to pay someone to help me debug it
[2014-04-06 04:39:14 -0400] Anashel: I just want to change the CHMOD for 2 folders
[2014-04-06 04:39:57 -0400] Anashel: and i get the error Cookbook 'wordpress' (0.0.0) does not contain a file at any of these locations:
[2014-04-06 04:41:25 -0400] Anashel: Anyone?
[2014-04-06 04:41:48 -0400] Anashel: Hello?
[2014-04-06 04:47:34 -0400] double_p: Anashel: dont use resource 'template' for that, but 'directory'
[2014-04-06 04:48:01 -0400] double_p: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_directory.html
[2014-04-06 04:48:42 -0400] Anashel: Thanks, but the directory will be already created by the deployment process
[2014-04-06 04:48:47 -0400] Anashel: (I am in opsworks)
[2014-04-06 04:49:10 -0400] Anashel: So here I catch it when he is about to create the files...
[2014-04-06 04:49:57 -0400] double_p: well, then you need some 'source'
[2014-04-06 04:54:39 -0400] Anashel: Double_p: thanks for your answer, is this better? : https://github.com/humanequation/opsworks-cookbooks/blob/master/wordpress/recipes/configure.rb
[2014-04-06 04:56:20 -0400] double_p: might need 'recursive' to true for parent directories
[2014-04-06 04:56:47 -0400] Anashel: both folder are empty on deployment
[2014-04-06 04:57:03 -0400] Anashel: if I understand what you mean
[2014-04-06 04:58:05 -0400] double_p: if /srv/www/mmorpg_blog/current/wp-content doesnt exist before that is executed, it'll fail.
[2014-04-06 04:58:45 -0400] Anashel: got it
[2014-04-06 04:59:14 -0400] Anashel: but if it doesn't exist, it mean that opsworks will deploy after my recipe, therefore overwrite my permission
[2014-04-06 04:59:31 -0400] Anashel: so I assume it's a question of calling the recipe at the right time
[2014-04-06 05:10:09 -0400] jidar: anybody get berkshelf v3 to work?
[2014-04-06 05:20:50 -0400] Anashel: hey

[2014-04-06 05:30:44 -0400] Anashel: can I exeucte command "yum install newrelic-sysmond"
[2014-04-06 05:30:52 -0400] Anashel: in an execute "" do command?
[2014-04-06 05:49:10 -0400] ignatz: I'd use a package resource
[2014-04-06 13:38:23 -0400] amacgregor: is there a official/working cookbook for apache2.4? I'm particurlary looking for one that supports mod_proxy_fastcgi
[2014-04-06 13:43:26 -0400] amacgregor: ohh well time to fork and fix then :D
[2014-04-06 15:01:55 -0400] double_p:  /names
[2014-04-06 15:04:38 -0400] stormerider: amacgregor: i believe there's a new maintainer taking it over, and i think they have a fork that supports 2.4

[2014-04-06 17:59:31 -0400] cromless: I am seeing a strange problem with the chef-client::clone recipe, when following the instruction in the chef fundamentals video. Here is the output with just chef-client::clone in the run-list http://pastebin.com/xXZ3NHwG Can someone please have a quick look at that and tell me if I am missing something obvious?
[2014-04-06 18:22:46 -0400] papercode: searching for "solr cookbook" returns a bunch of different results some of which haven't been updated in years, and others with little to no documentation. Anyone here have a (public) solr cookbook they turn to?
[2014-04-06 20:46:00 -0400] mhenrixon: wtf
[2014-04-06 20:46:16 -0400] mhenrixon: My environment attrivbutes gets cleared all the time
[2014-04-06 20:46:51 -0400] mhenrixon: I've tried to set them under both override_attributes and default_attributes
[2014-04-06 20:47:04 -0400] mhenrixon: All of a sudden those are gone
[2014-04-06 20:49:17 -0400] mhenrixon: oh I need to have an environment.rb file also
