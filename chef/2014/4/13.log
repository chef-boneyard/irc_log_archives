[2014-04-13 01:53:07 -0400] flaccid: anyone have any idea why i'm getting 255 with rubocop here? https://travis-ci.org/xhost-cookbooks/openvpn/jobs/22867367#L133
[2014-04-13 02:37:17 -0400] juliancdunn: flaccid: because "AllCops/Includes was renamed to AllCops/Include" ?
[2014-04-13 02:38:05 -0400] flaccid: juliancdunn: yep i thought i already fixed it but didn't. forgot to update teh chan!
[2014-04-13 02:38:57 -0400] flaccid: juliancdunn: what i don't get now is how to avoid https://travis-ci.org/xhost-cookbooks/openvpn/jobs/22868446#L136 in .rubocop.yml
[2014-04-13 02:40:10 -0400] flaccid: i only get it on travis ci as well, local its fine
[2014-04-13 02:41:32 -0400] juliancdunn: flaccid: probably because your Gemfile.lock has locked to an older version of rubocop without those warnings
[2014-04-13 02:42:35 -0400] juliancdunn: I hate that cop, so I turn it off
[2014-04-13 02:43:26 -0400] flaccid: juliancdunn: ah i see the pkg is out of date https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rubocop/ and its actually mine hehe

[2014-04-13 11:42:20 -0400] quatrix: Is it possible to merge an array attribute in the same cookbook, say cookbook::recipe_a and cookbook_recipe::b both define node.default["servers"] = ["...",..] so I want to merge all attribute sets when somoene adds both recipe to run_list.
[2014-04-13 11:51:52 -0400] chrombar: I am having some issues with the opscode nginx cookbook. Does anyone have a few minutes, who is familiar with using that cookbook?
[2014-04-13 15:00:10 -0400] holms: anybody using chef-mysql cookbook? http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=JWx4n9Cm
[2014-04-13 15:00:13 -0400] holms: doesn't work =(
[2014-04-13 15:04:31 -0400] holms: schisamo: maybe you here?
[2014-04-13 15:04:43 -0400] holms: or jtimberman

[2014-04-13 15:26:34 -0400] zenloop_: Hey guys, got a question about attributes.  Lets say I have a list for attr1.  It is defined in environments.  I have things I want to add to attr so I make an additional attribute called additional_attrs.  I want to concatenate them so that a recipe runs a combined list that is an attribute created at compile time.  Can I do this?  Can I modify (add to) attributes at compile time?

[2014-04-13 23:49:13 -0400] rafaelmagu: Hi everyone. I need some helping with a custom function I'm writing to retrieve some SSH keys from data bags
[2014-04-13 23:50:55 -0400] rafaelmagu: I made a specific class called SiteUsers with two methods that are supposed to retrieve items from a data bag, iterate over them and return an array with the keys
[2014-04-13 23:51:14 -0400] rafaelmagu: Problem I'm getting is: ERROR: undefined method `data_bag' for Chef::Recipe::SiteUsers:Class
