[2014-06-07 00:57:58 -0400] thun: I just installed chef server on ubuntu 14.04 and it throws no errors. The binaries install but when I run chef-server-ctl reconfigure
[2014-06-07 00:58:05 -0400] thun: chef-server-ctl: command not found
[2014-06-07 00:58:22 -0400] jblack: what version of chef did you install
[2014-06-07 00:58:27 -0400] sarkis: maybe a path issue?
[2014-06-07 00:59:02 -0400] sarkis: hmm maybe not.. its in /usr/bin
[2014-06-07 01:00:04 -0400] jblack: I'm wondering if he installed chef 10, rather than 11
[2014-06-07 01:07:51 -0400] thun: No duh... I installed the client
[2014-06-07 01:07:58 -0400] thun: no 14.04 server?
[2014-06-07 01:08:04 -0400] thun: forubuntu
[2014-06-07 01:08:07 -0400] thun: *for ubuntu
[2014-06-07 01:08:52 -0400] aslan_: thun: run > updatedb ; locate chef-server-ctl
[2014-06-07 01:09:18 -0400] thun: aslan_: thanks I was not even installed... I did client not server ... fixing now
[2014-06-07 01:09:20 -0400] jblack: Chef isn't at 14.04.
[2014-06-07 01:09:28 -0400] jblack: Ahh, ok
[2014-06-07 01:10:13 -0400] aslan_: jblack: do you suggest using a non-omnibus method for installing the server on 14.04?
[2014-06-07 01:10:29 -0400] jblack: I usually use the omnibus.
[2014-06-07 01:11:00 -0400] jblack: I found that I'm -far- less concerned about package management when using chef, so the omnibus install doesn't matte.r
[2014-06-07 01:11:10 -0400] aslan_: jblack: i have never used the omnibus. i always bootstrab my chef client/server
[2014-06-07 01:11:22 -0400] jblack: Right. Knife bootstrap uses omnibus. =)
[2014-06-07 01:11:29 -0400] aslan_: meaning using chef solo to install them
[2014-06-07 01:12:09 -0400] jblack: Oh, I run a chef server and use knife bootstrap. I do this stuff for a living. I'm willing to maintain a chef server to make my life a lot easier.
[2014-06-07 01:12:48 -0400] sarkis: aslan_: gonna have to do that i think, where is the cookbook for that?
[2014-06-07 01:13:03 -0400] jblack: So, how do I  install a gem that I want to use in libraries/helpers?
[2014-06-07 01:14:37 -0400] jblack: Oh I see
[2014-06-07 01:14:42 -0400] aslan_: sarkis: you need to know what you are doing. let me check my docs
[2014-06-07 01:15:08 -0400] aslan_: sarkis: this is the command: chef-solo -c ./solo.rb -j ./chef.json -r http://s3.amazonaws.com/chef-solo/bootstrap-latest.tar.gz -l debug
[2014-06-07 01:15:27 -0400] aslan_: solo.rb will be file_cache_path "/tmp/chef-solo"
[2014-06-07 01:15:28 -0400] aslan_: cookbook_path "/tmp/chef-solo/cookbooks"
[2014-06-07 01:15:55 -0400] aslan_: and chef.json is going to be : {
[2014-06-07 01:15:56 -0400] aslan_:   "chef_client": {
[2014-06-07 01:15:56 -0400] aslan_:     "server_url": "http://chef.example.com:4000",
[2014-06-07 01:15:57 -0400] aslan_:     "init_style": "runit"
[2014-06-07 01:15:57 -0400] aslan_:   },
[2014-06-07 01:15:58 -0400] aslan_:   "run_list": [
[2014-06-07 01:15:59 -0400] aslan_:     "recipe[runit]",
[2014-06-07 01:15:59 -0400] aslan_:     "recipe[chef-client::config]",
[2014-06-07 01:16:00 -0400] aslan_:     "recipe[chef-client]" ]
[2014-06-07 01:16:00 -0400] aslan_: }
[2014-06-07 01:16:19 -0400] aslan_: this is obviously for the client. you can figure out the server
[2014-06-07 01:16:55 -0400] aslan_: one thing to consider is that this tar ball has not been updated for a very long time. so it might not work properly for the server. but it will work for the client
[2014-06-07 01:17:06 -0400] aslan_: and first you need to install chef as a gem
[2014-06-07 01:18:10 -0400] aslan_: good luck
[2014-06-07 04:31:44 -0400] grepory: Does anyone know why the relationship between runner, client, and node works the way it does?
[2014-06-07 04:37:44 -0400] coderanger: grepory: What part do you mean?
[2014-06-07 04:40:31 -0400] grepory: coderanger: So, I was looking into this thing with ChefSpec to try to make nodes easier to create and reuse across cookbooks. My first inclination was to make it so that I could create a Node and then set it as the Runner's node object.
[2014-06-07 04:40:43 -0400] grepory: coderanger: That's when I discovered that it is actually really difficult to do that and have things work. Hahaha
[2014-06-07 04:41:06 -0400] grepory: coderanger: So I see that, and I says to myself... "Huh. Wonder why that is?"
[2014-06-07 04:41:52 -0400] grepory: I'm still reading the Chef code... slowly... to see if I can wrap my head around it to see if there is something I'm missing.
[2014-06-07 04:41:54 -0400] coderanger: Ahh, you mean ChefSpec::Runner, not Chef::Runner
[2014-06-07 04:41:59 -0400] grepory: Oh yes, my apologies.
[2014-06-07 04:42:14 -0400] coderanger: Sorry, I don't know much about ChefSpec internals
[2014-06-07 04:42:55 -0400] grepory: coderanger: It's okay. I probably could have asked in #chefspec first, but I am a little sleepy.
[2014-06-07 05:25:49 -0400] Alayde_: Is anyone here running into issues using test-kitchen, kitchen-docker, and docker.io in Ubuntu 14.04? Even when specifying the binary in .kitchen.yml (setting it to 'docker.io'), test kitchen is kind of struggling to find the docker CLI tool.
[2014-06-07 05:26:02 -0400] Alayde_: Assuming anyone's still around at this time of night
[2014-06-07 05:31:05 -0400] coderanger: Alayde_: Try giving it a full path
[2014-06-07 05:31:48 -0400] Alayde_: coderanger: No go, unfortunately :/
[2014-06-07 05:31:58 -0400] coderanger: Alayde_: Whats the error?
[2014-06-07 05:34:09 -0400] Alayde_: coderanger: http://pastebin.com/zquyR25S
[2014-06-07 05:35:23 -0400] coderanger: Alayde_: Whats your kitchen.yml look like?
[2014-06-07 05:36:51 -0400] Alayde_: coderanger: It's pretty bleak, I was just testing this stuff in a brand new directory - http://pastebin.com/k81yCEwJ
[2014-06-07 05:37:20 -0400] coderanger: Alayde_: How did you install that docker binary?
[2014-06-07 05:37:44 -0400] Alayde_: Just through Ubuntu's repositories; apt-get install docker.io
[2014-06-07 05:38:14 -0400] coderanger: Then that should be /usr/bin/docker.io I would think
[2014-06-07 05:38:42 -0400] Alayde_: I thought that too, but `which docker` returns http://pastebin.com/k81yCEwJ
[2014-06-07 05:38:44 -0400] Alayde_: oh god
[2014-06-07 05:38:45 -0400] Alayde_: not that
[2014-06-07 05:38:54 -0400] Alayde_: '/usr/local/bin/docker' < this
[2014-06-07 05:39:19 -0400] coderanger: yes, because the ubuntu-installed one isn't called docker
[2014-06-07 05:39:25 -0400] coderanger: it is called docker.io
[2014-06-07 05:39:53 -0400] Alayde_: Correct, but docker in /usr/local/bin is a symlink to /usr/bin/docker.io
[2014-06-07 05:40:39 -0400] Alayde_: Alas, /usr/bin/docker.io in the .kitchen.yml fails in the same way
[2014-06-07 05:41:05 -0400] coderanger: Alayde_: If you run `/usr/bin/docker.io` what is the output and exit code?
[2014-06-07 05:41:39 -0400] Alayde_: So the output is the general docker stuff, lists all of the commands and their purpose. Exits with 0
[2014-06-07 05:53:49 -0400] coderanger: Alayde_: Hmm, odd
[2014-06-07 05:53:58 -0400] Alayde_: coderanger: Agreed, it has me a bit baffled
[2014-06-07 05:54:13 -0400] coderanger: How are you running tk?
[2014-06-07 05:55:04 -0400] Alayde_: I just have it installed as a gem, and am just going with the regular `kitchen list` to get this error
[2014-06-07 05:55:45 -0400] Alayde_: And my version of ruby is 2.1.1, TK version is 1.2.1
[2014-06-07 14:57:07 -0400] thun: What is the best way to handle non-community git cookbooks? Berkshelf? What do you guys recommend
[2014-06-07 14:57:58 -0400] mikesplain: Berkshelf takes care of that well, just do cookbook 'cookbookname', :git => 'https://github.com....'
[2014-06-07 14:58:09 -0400] mikesplain: We do that for all our private cookbooks
[2014-06-07 15:00:47 -0400] thun: Never downoad into your repo?

[2014-06-07 17:29:18 -0400] papercode: i'm probably missing something obvious, anyone had this issue as well?
[2014-06-07 18:18:54 -0400] jidar: you try disabling all extensions and everything?
[2014-06-07 18:18:58 -0400] jidar: seems a bit odd
[2014-06-07 18:19:37 -0400] papercode: jidar: yeah, i have my extensions disabled
[2014-06-07 18:20:55 -0400] papercode: it was working before i updated my chrome version, so i'm guessing there has been a recent change
[2014-06-07 18:50:23 -0400] coalbe: is there a way to use ohai attributes in roles?
[2014-06-07 18:52:59 -0400] coalbe: im trying to add the public ip of other nodes into a /etc/hosts file
[2014-06-07 18:53:36 -0400] iiro: not in roles...
[2014-06-07 18:55:27 -0400] coalbe: its trivial in cookbooks, but i was hoping there was a way to use node['ipaddress'] or something other in a role file
[2014-06-07 18:55:46 -0400] iiro: nope...
[2014-06-07 18:56:00 -0400] iiro: roles are just roles
[2014-06-07 18:56:01 -0400] coalbe: darn, do you know why?
[2014-06-07 18:56:10 -0400] iiro: by design. :)
[2014-06-07 18:56:36 -0400] coalbe: hmmp, perhaps ill have to use a wrapper cookbook i guess
[2014-06-07 18:56:49 -0400] iiro: wrapper cookbooks rock. :)
[2014-06-07 18:57:33 -0400] coalbe: i was aiming to forgo the wrapper cookbook, add the original cookbook into the run_list via roles, and do my overrides there too.
[2014-06-07 18:57:55 -0400] coalbe: which was all fine and dandy until i needed to use ohai for pulling node data
[2014-06-07 18:57:56 -0400] gkra: we use role cookbooks if there's anything role-specific that needs to be done outside of application cookbooks
[2014-06-07 18:58:30 -0400] iiro: gkra, what do you use roles for then...?
[2014-06-07 18:58:46 -0400] coalbe: roles usually just point to the role cookbook
[2014-06-07 18:58:51 -0400] iiro: ok
[2014-06-07 18:59:00 -0400] coalbe: so you dont lose the search functionality
[2014-06-07 18:59:00 -0400] gkra: we use roles to define what functionality a system gets
[2014-06-07 18:59:03 -0400] iiro: we have some things in roles. maybe less in future.
[2014-06-07 18:59:21 -0400] gkra: webserver roles, app server roles, baseline role (which everything gets)
[2014-06-07 18:59:24 -0400] iiro: environments only for version locking...
[2014-06-07 18:59:59 -0400] gkra: There are a couple attributes we still define in our environments, but we've been gradually moving those into their associated wrapper cookbooks, keying value off node['environment']
[2014-06-07 19:00:21 -0400] coalbe: for versioning purposes?
[2014-06-07 19:00:37 -0400] iiro: we have some very rare too on environment.
[2014-06-07 19:00:40 -0400] iiro: +s
[2014-06-07 19:00:52 -0400] iiro: gkra, ok
[2014-06-07 19:01:04 -0400] gkra: I'm trying to find time to set up a berks api server and move to berkshelf 3 and berksflow
[2014-06-07 19:01:28 -0400] gkra: I really like the environment cookbook pattern, want to try it out.
[2014-06-07 19:01:44 -0400] coalbe: gkra: got a link for that?
[2014-06-07 19:01:52 -0400] gkra: somewhere... lemme look

[2014-06-07 19:04:47 -0400] coalbe: back to the drawing board :)
[2014-06-07 19:07:17 -0400] gkra: man, how'd i survive before Git and Evernote?
[2014-06-07 19:10:08 -0400] iiro: :D
[2014-06-07 20:15:35 -0400] stoned75: can any resource's attribute be lazy ? it seems that link's target_file can't be. see https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f38bc45d78cf76560ec8
[2014-06-07 21:24:57 -0400] coderanger: stoned75: Hmm, it should work, its implemented as part of set_or_return. Can you pastebin the full traceback?

[2014-06-07 21:41:07 -0400] iiro: I have a wrapper cookbook for Sensu server and ive been fighting because LWRP sensu_snippet claims the same - but all other lwrps are working. Uaaargh.
[2014-06-07 21:41:35 -0400] iiro: if someone could say something I would highly appreciate
[2014-06-07 21:44:37 -0400] iiro: I tried in Sensu channel but this is a Chef thing. I fail...

[2014-06-07 21:47:30 -0400] coderanger: stoned75: Ahh yeah, that would do it
[2014-06-07 21:48:57 -0400] coderanger: stoned75: The issue is https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/resource/link.rb#L88-L90
[2014-06-07 21:48:59 -0400] coderanger: stoned75:

[2014-06-07 21:53:01 -0400] stoned75: I suppose there's no way to have a 11.12.8+ out in a couple of days ?
[2014-06-07 21:55:16 -0400] coderanger: stoned75: Not for this, no
[2014-06-07 21:55:26 -0400] coderanger: stoned75: You can monkey patch it in a lib file if its critical to you
[2014-06-07 21:55:54 -0400] lebrinkma: I'm having problems with my knife bootstrap. it looks like ohai data is not available on the first chef run.
[2014-06-07 21:56:09 -0400] coderanger: lebrinkma: It is, what issue are you seeing?
[2014-06-07 21:57:19 -0400] stoned75: well unless I find another way to have a link resource path computed at execution time I suppose I'm going to monkey patching route
[2014-06-07 21:57:20 -0400] lebrinkma: coderanger: I'm trying to access a node attribute in a template and its empty. running chef-client directly afterwards works as expected.

[2014-06-07 21:57:48 -0400] coderanger: stoned75: You can use an LWRP wrapper
[2014-06-07 21:58:06 -0400] coderanger: stoned75: Or subclass Link
[2014-06-07 21:58:06 -0400] stoned75: really ?
[2014-06-07 21:58:39 -0400] coderanger: lebrinkma: Please pastebin the template
[2014-06-07 21:59:33 -0400] thun: What is the best way to pass in one off config settings for a knife ec2 run ?
[2014-06-07 22:00:49 -0400] stoned75: coderanger: is this Link issue already the subject of a fix, a pull request, something ?
[2014-06-07 22:00:56 -0400] coderanger: stoned75: No idea
[2014-06-07 22:01:05 -0400] coderanger: thun: Probably make a role

[2014-06-07 22:08:51 -0400] lebrinkma: coderanger: that was my first guess, and i added it manually. Now I noticed their was a typo in the package name ... will try again
[2014-06-07 22:12:16 -0400] coderanger: lebrinkma: Just remember if you install the package inside the chef run, you need to re-trigger ohai via the ohai resource

[2014-06-07 22:32:20 -0400] coalbe: i also added a json dump into the recipe to see what was there when the recipe was ran and i didnt see any ec2 attributes
[2014-06-07 22:32:35 -0400] coderanger: coalbe: Where specifically is having issues?
[2014-06-07 22:33:21 -0400] coalbe: oh sorry! https://gist.github.com/colby/825dded255222bbc7c92
[2014-06-07 22:38:54 -0400] coalbe: granted i could use `ec2metadata` and parse that, im trying to grok ohai
[2014-06-07 22:39:47 -0400] coderanger: coalbe: Hmm, if you vagrant ssh, what are the MAC addresses of your interfaces?
[2014-06-07 22:40:45 -0400] coderanger: coalbe: Or just pastebin the output of `ohai network`
[2014-06-07 22:41:25 -0400] coalbe: https://gist.github.com/colby/4f9b3de791d0363a4ac9
[2014-06-07 22:41:33 -0400] coalbe: k, will try
[2014-06-07 22:42:11 -0400] coderanger: coalbe: That looks like you are in a VPC
[2014-06-07 22:43:20 -0400] coalbe: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3abbe23164424de3071f
[2014-06-07 22:43:42 -0400] coderanger: Yep, you're in a VPC
[2014-06-07 22:43:49 -0400] coalbe: hmm, interesting
[2014-06-07 22:43:55 -0400] coalbe: what effect does that have?
[2014-06-07 22:44:44 -0400] coalbe: and which line are you looking for?
[2014-06-07 22:45:50 -0400] coderanger: sec, phone
[2014-06-07 22:46:10 -0400] coalbe: ill hold. :)
[2014-06-07 22:47:22 -0400] Veraticus: ohai chef peeps! I have a best practices question
[2014-06-07 22:47:53 -0400] Veraticus: I have a Rails server and a Rails worker that I want to share a fair amount of code only the restart command between the two of them will be different
[2014-06-07 22:48:17 -0400] Veraticus: Im using the application_ruby deploy resource and was trying to figure out the best way to share most of the configuration information between the two of these things
[2014-06-07 22:48:58 -0400] Veraticus: Is there a standard way to do that sort of thing?
[2014-06-07 22:56:28 -0400] coderanger: coalbe: Okay, so I can tell because non-VPC has a remote MAC of fe:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
[2014-06-07 22:56:40 -0400] coderanger: coalbe: And also it would be 10. numbering on the IP (usually)
[2014-06-07 22:57:08 -0400] coderanger: coalbe: The issue is that if you are on VPC there isn't any way (that we know of) to detect that its an EC2 instance, so you have to set the hint file yourself
[2014-06-07 22:57:20 -0400] coderanger: coalbe: this is done automatically in knife-ec2, but not by vagrant
[2014-06-07 22:59:35 -0400] coderanger: Veraticus: Make a new resource as a plugin for the app* framework that wraps the underlying resources
[2014-06-07 23:04:36 -0400] Veraticus: coderanger: Thanks, thats sort of what I thought! I think I started on that but I cant make it pass the restart command correctly.
[2014-06-07 23:04:50 -0400] Veraticus: coderanger: Heres what my code looks like: https://gist.github.com/Veraticus/b96ada7afb85aa66f2f1
[2014-06-07 23:05:10 -0400] Veraticus: coderanger: It never executes the passed restart command, so I think Im probably not going about this in the correct way...
[2014-06-07 23:05:42 -0400] coalbe: coderanger: ah, that explains some things
[2014-06-07 23:06:09 -0400] coderanger: Veraticus: Yeah, look at how the existing rails plugin is written, there are a bunch of actions that serve as callbacks, you need to implement those
[2014-06-07 23:06:42 -0400] Veraticus: coderanger: So just copy/paste the existing Rails one and insert all my application-specific stuff into it?
[2014-06-07 23:07:26 -0400] coderanger: Veraticus: Thats the easiest way, yeah :-(
[2014-06-07 23:07:33 -0400] coderanger: Veraticus: Unfortunately you can't subclass LWRPs
[2014-06-07 23:07:51 -0400] coderanger: If I had been better when I wrote this all, that would be the solution
[2014-06-07 23:08:05 -0400] coderanger: and I'm planning to rewrite things to allow for that, but haven't had the time/funding yet
[2014-06-07 23:08:12 -0400] Veraticus: coderanger: Haha, no worries! Its still the best out there.
[2014-06-07 23:08:25 -0400] Veraticus: coderanger: Thanks for the guidance. So this is more or less the right way to do things? Im not way out in left field?
[2014-06-07 23:09:24 -0400] coderanger: Veraticus: Its definitely not a common use case, but it should work :)
[2014-06-07 23:09:53 -0400] Veraticus: coderanger: Awesome, thanks!
[2014-06-07 23:10:10 -0400] coderanger: (this was part of the original design goal, that you would only have to copy-pasta the specific resource/provider at least, as opposed to the whole cookbook)
[2014-06-07 23:11:26 -0400] Veraticus: coderanger: Ah, I see so most people who have similar worker/server setups probably also have their own application-specific setup stuff
[2014-06-07 23:12:30 -0400] coderanger: Veraticus: App deployment with Chef is still a touchy business
[2014-06-07 23:12:42 -0400] coderanger: Veraticus: If you would like to improve it, I accept donations :)
[2014-06-07 23:13:33 -0400] Veraticus: coderanger: I would like to improve it! Also I thought app deployment with chef was another best practice.
[2014-06-07 23:13:43 -0400] Veraticus: coderanger: Wheres your donation page at?
[2014-06-07 23:14:23 -0400] coderanger: Veraticus: Depends on who you ask, I think it is but not all agree :)
[2014-06-07 23:14:49 -0400] Veraticus: coderanger: Well it seems to intuitively make sense, since chef has a better view of your infrastructure than your application, usually
[2014-06-07 23:15:13 -0400] coderanger: Veraticus: If you mean for corporate-ish sponsorship or consulting, I can email you about it. For personal stuff and one-offs, gittip.com/coderanger
[2014-06-07 23:16:18 -0400] Veraticus: coderanger: Yeah, please shoot me an email. josh@joshsymonds.com
[2014-06-07 23:18:07 -0400] coderanger: Roger roger
[2014-06-07 23:26:19 -0400] coalbe: coderanger: https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/OHAI-310 i see! thanks for the heads up, there's a patch in there that fixes the issue i have
[2014-06-07 23:26:59 -0400] coderanger: coalbe: I wouldn't use that
[2014-06-07 23:27:08 -0400] coalbe: nots not elegant, but im not using it anywhere else
[2014-06-07 23:27:34 -0400] coderanger: coalbe: I would use a shell provisioner in your vagrantfile to touch the hint file
[2014-06-07 23:27:42 -0400] coalbe: before chef is ran?
[2014-06-07 23:27:45 -0400] coderanger: Yep
[2014-06-07 23:27:50 -0400] coderanger: vagrant runs provisioners in order
[2014-06-07 23:27:53 -0400] coalbe: hmm, thats easy too then. ill give it a try
[2014-06-07 23:30:13 -0400] coalbe: i just need to touch the file or does it need to hold anything special?
[2014-06-07 23:32:21 -0400] coderanger: coalbe: just touch it, well and mkdir -p too
[2014-06-07 23:32:32 -0400] coderanger: etc/chef/ohai/hints/ec2.json
[2014-06-07 23:32:47 -0400] coalbe: yeah
[2014-06-07 23:33:55 -0400] coalbe: you're advising not to use that patch because of the more time it requires?
[2014-06-07 23:34:11 -0400] coalbe: for timeout on non-ec2 ssytems
[2014-06-07 23:35:01 -0400] coderanger: coalbe: Because a few lines in your vagrantfile is a better long-term solution than forking Ohai
[2014-06-07 23:35:16 -0400] coderanger: and that patch will never be merged for the reasons stated in the ticket (which I agree with)
[2014-06-07 23:37:12 -0400] coalbe: yeah, i agree too, this wont be seeing production or anything, but oh well
[2014-06-07 23:39:15 -0400] coalbe: coderanger: thanks for the help
[2014-06-07 23:45:55 -0400] coalbe: coderanger: https://github.com/colby/devops/blob/master/amazon/postgres/Vagrantfile :)
[2014-06-07 23:48:58 -0400] coderanger: coalbe: That should do it :)
[2014-06-07 23:49:54 -0400] coalbe: thanks again
[2014-06-07 23:50:06 -0400] coalbe: i lost a lot of time to that one, haha
