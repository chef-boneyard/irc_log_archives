[2014-06-28 01:07:53 -0400] d4c7: Upgrading 11.1.1 to 11.1.3 doesn't seem to be working seamlessly.  Dies on chef_server_pg_user.  Can't connect to postgres to make the change it appears.
[2014-06-28 01:08:00 -0400] JoelMcCracken: I want to do the following: 1) Create a directory A, 2) Move any files in directory B to A, 3) delete B, 4) symlink B to A. I'm unsure how to write this.
[2014-06-28 01:09:01 -0400] JoelMcCracken: It feels like I might need to create a "resource" to do this
[2014-06-28 01:10:02 -0400] Idealien: I have a vagrant VM that was running fine, but doing an up  --provision is now generating chef errors related to a recipe relating to php_pear "mongo" do action :install - Log at http://pastebin.com/tiKGihhA
[2014-06-28 01:11:06 -0400] Idealien: I'm actually using mysql as db and concerned that I may have lost local dev DB mostly. After ssh to VM and mysql command line I don't see any of my databases. Help?
[2014-06-28 02:39:07 -0400] JoelMcCracken: is there a guide to writing cookbooks outside of DSLs? I'd love to be able to have a cookbook == a single file until things get gnarly
[2014-06-28 04:00:36 -0400] sarkis: whats the recommended way to test cookbooks?
[2014-06-28 04:00:39 -0400] sarkis: kitchen?
[2014-06-28 04:01:06 -0400] sarkis: test kitchen*
[2014-06-28 08:47:15 -0400] gauravarora: anyone from hosted enterprise chef who can help? i still cant upload cookbooks
[2014-06-28 08:48:47 -0400] Kim^J: gauravarora: Did you email/cal support?
[2014-06-28 08:49:04 -0400] gauravarora: Kim^J: i cant even find a support link anywhere
[2014-06-28 17:03:11 -0400] jtimberman: gauravarora: support@getchef.com - more info at http://www.getchef.com/service-level-agreement/#support
[2014-06-28 17:03:29 -0400] sarkis: hey guys, whats the recommended way to update chefdk?
[2014-06-28 17:03:51 -0400] coderanger: sarkis: Just install the new package
[2014-06-28 17:03:54 -0400] jtimberman: sarkis: install updated version of the package when new ones are released
[2014-06-28 17:04:01 -0400] sarkis: got it
[2014-06-28 17:04:03 -0400] jtimberman: 0.1.0 is still the current release
[2014-06-28 17:04:06 -0400] coderanger: sarkis: There should be no user data in the DK folders so its just a direct upgrade
[2014-06-28 17:04:29 -0400] jtimberman: coderanger: unless you gem install things there as root :)
[2014-06-28 17:04:44 -0400] jtimberman: but that's not user data per se
[2014-06-28 17:05:24 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: There is a reason I don't recommend people use chefdk  ;-)
[2014-06-28 17:08:51 -0400] jtimberman: coderanger: well, with the current release, chef gem install should install them in ~/.chefdk/gems, and if you use the ruby / gem binaries it provides, happiness abounds.
[2014-06-28 17:10:42 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: And in a few months I'm sure that will be documented
[2014-06-28 17:11:06 -0400] jtimberman: its documented now
[2014-06-28 17:11:25 -0400] jtimberman: https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk#using-chefdk-as-your-primary-development-environment
[2014-06-28 17:11:33 -0400] jtimberman: for the using chefdk's ruby
[2014-06-28 17:11:49 -0400] jtimberman: and https://github.com/opscode/chef-dk#chef-gem for chef gem installation in ~/.chefdk
[2014-06-28 17:12:29 -0400] jtimberman: docs site has the ruby env use documented http://docs.opscode.com/install_dk.html
[2014-06-28 17:13:06 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: https://www.google.com/search?q=site:docs.opscode.com+chef+gem+install
[2014-06-28 17:13:17 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: the chef gem commands haven't gotten to the docs yet
[2014-06-28 17:16:53 -0400] jtimberman: http://docs.opscode.com/ctl_chef.html#chef-gem
[2014-06-28 17:18:05 -0400] coderanger: Huzzah
[2014-06-28 17:22:44 -0400] jtimberman: needs more detail of course, but it does exist :) https://github.com/opscode/chef-docs/issues/286 and  https://github.com/opscode/chef-docs/issues/287
[2014-06-28 17:25:00 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: +1 on both
[2014-06-28 17:25:23 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: And as I said, I'm sure this will get ironed out over the next few months. Really wish people would stop using it until then though :)
[2014-06-28 17:25:48 -0400] jtimberman: i don't. we won't find issues like this soon enough when it's not used :)
[2014-06-28 17:25:59 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: Hire more QA folks :P
[2014-06-28 17:26:06 -0400] jtimberman: we have :P
[2014-06-28 17:51:54 -0400] sarkis: hey all, ran into a weird issue with environments... it seems default_attribute wasn't overriding the cookbooks attribute/defaults, but according to the long list of precedence it should amirite?
[2014-06-28 17:52:15 -0400] sarkis: i wanted to get to the bottom of it before i try default_override, or should i just be using default_override to do what i want?
[2014-06-28 17:52:35 -0400] sarkis: i need the environment attribute to trump the cookbooks/attribute/default
[2014-06-28 17:52:59 -0400] sarkis: s/default_override/override_attribute/g
[2014-06-28 18:07:14 -0400] matti: jtimberman: I believe Chef calls these "users" :)
[2014-06-28 18:09:42 -0400] sarkis: am i right in assuming that default_override in environment should take precedence over the attributes/default.rb in the cookbooks?
[2014-06-28 18:10:33 -0400] matti: sarkis: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_attribute_files.html -- check precedence.
[2014-06-28 18:16:43 -0400] sarkis: hmm it looks like it should take precedence based off that...
[2014-06-28 18:52:57 -0400] vluther: I have a template that I put a timestamp into.. basically to tell me when it was last modified, but I seem to be doing it in a way that it updates on every chef-client run, is there a way to actually just make it change if the rest of the contents were changed?
[2014-06-28 19:03:07 -0400] squaresurf: vluther: is there a reason you're not just looking at the modified date on the file?
[2014-06-28 19:03:34 -0400] squaresurf: by adding the timestamp to the contents, it is different on every chef run, so chef will always replace it. At least thats how I understand it.
[2014-06-28 19:03:45 -0400] vluther: sometimes when I'm debugging a problem/report, I just want to know when chef-client last updated the file.
[2014-06-28 19:03:50 -0400] gchristensen: vluther: unfortunately not, it'd be more advisable to use `stat` or using notifiers in chef to trigger it
[2014-06-28 19:04:27 -0400] squaresurf: vluther: you can get that info from the modified date for the file
[2014-06-28 19:04:27 -0400] vluther: gchristensen: thanks, squaresurf: yep that's how I'm understanding it too, was just curious if there was a better way
[2014-06-28 19:04:28 -0400] gchristensen: ls -la <file> will reveal the last edit
[2014-06-28 19:04:47 -0400] vluther: gchristensen: yea, I'll stick to that, since it's worked since 1970 or so :)
[2014-06-28 19:04:50 -0400] gchristensen: :)
[2014-06-28 22:32:56 -0400] jessemdavis: hello everyone
[2014-06-28 22:33:20 -0400] jessemdavis: would someone be able to explain to me how the minitest tests are supposed to be executed in the rabbitmq cookbook?
[2014-06-28 22:33:59 -0400] jessemdavis: https://github.com/kennonkwok/rabbitmq/tree/master/test/cookbooks/rabbitmq_test/recipes
[2014-06-28 22:34:30 -0400] jessemdavis: i'm not seeing how to tell Busser to execute them?
[2014-06-28 22:34:57 -0400] jessemdavis: i'm still pretty new to chef, I found a bug, but want to make sure I have the tests correct before submitting a PR
[2014-06-28 22:56:28 -0400] brauliobo: how can I use a databag in a node?
[2014-06-28 22:56:45 -0400] squaresurf: Have you read the docs?
[2014-06-28 22:56:54 -0400] squaresurf: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html
[2014-06-28 22:56:57 -0400] brauliobo: squaresurf: yeah, http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html
[2014-06-28 22:56:57 -0400] squaresurf: They show how there.
[2014-06-28 22:57:09 -0400] brauliobo: it seems the only way is through recipes?
[2014-06-28 22:57:19 -0400] squaresurf: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html#with-recipes
[2014-06-28 22:57:33 -0400] brauliobo: how can I that directly?
[2014-06-28 22:57:35 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: Not sure what you mean
[2014-06-28 22:57:42 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: The only way to do anything is through recipes
[2014-06-28 22:57:44 -0400] brauliobo: on my nodes/hostname.json
[2014-06-28 22:57:49 -0400] squaresurf: ah
[2014-06-28 22:58:14 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: Nodes and Data Bags aren't directly related in any way, they are just two different APIs offered by Chef Server
[2014-06-28 22:58:35 -0400] brauliobo: hum... strange, I'll have to create a recipe just to use the users cookbook...
[2014-06-28 22:58:47 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: The users cookbook supports data bags on its own
[2014-06-28 22:59:31 -0400] brauliobo: but if nodes aren't associated with databags directly, then I need an organizational cookbook to make the link??
[2014-06-28 23:00:38 -0400] brauliobo: and if so, how that cookbook knows which users are for each node?
[2014-06-28 23:01:11 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: Not sure what you mean, the recipe code in the users cookbook talks to the data bags API
[2014-06-28 23:01:17 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: You have to assign that recipe to your node
[2014-06-28 23:03:04 -0400] brauliobo: coderanger: still I can't get how to link nodes <-> users
[2014-06-28 23:03:25 -0400] brauliobo: because each node has a set of users
[2014-06-28 23:04:14 -0400] brauliobo: how to make the link each set of users to each correspondent node?
[2014-06-28 23:04:29 -0400] brauliobo: sorry, I'm pretty much a newbie on chef...
[2014-06-28 23:05:10 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: The readme in the users cookbook explains it, you can add one or more groups to each data bag item, by default any user in the "sysadmin" group is created on all machines
[2014-06-28 23:08:36 -0400] brauliobo: coderanger: still don't get any information about nodes on https://github.com/sethvargo-cookbooks/users. I'm not talking about groups
[2014-06-28 23:09:13 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: The tl;dr is "all users get created on all nodes"
[2014-06-28 23:09:24 -0400] coderanger: You can customize it further, but you would have to go read the docs more carefully
[2014-06-28 23:09:55 -0400] brauliobo: hum, all users on all nodes is not interesting...
[2014-06-28 23:10:21 -0400] squaresurf: Sure it is, takes the monotony out of creating them accross a ton of machines.
[2014-06-28 23:10:50 -0400] squaresurf: If you want customization just create a recipe and add it to the nodes you want that custom set of users set up for.
[2014-06-28 23:11:14 -0400] brauliobo: squaresurf: for that I would do a role or a environment and use them on interested nodes
[2014-06-28 23:11:36 -0400] squaresurf: precisely
[2014-06-28 23:11:43 -0400] brauliobo: squaresurf: for example, I have nodes specific for backups
[2014-06-28 23:11:47 -0400] brauliobo: with specific users
[2014-06-28 23:12:42 -0400] brauliobo: there I have specific users...
[2014-06-28 23:12:42 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: As I said, you can customize it further, but you would have to go read up on how that cookbook models groups of users and how the users_manage LWRP works
[2014-06-28 23:12:44 -0400] squaresurf: For the most flexibility create a recipe for each user, then add them to whatever node you'd like.
[2014-06-28 23:12:51 -0400] coderanger: Or yeah, write something yourself
[2014-06-28 23:16:40 -0400] brauliobo: squaresurf: that's strange and creating recipes for specific tasks is much more strange.... I usually like to do everything on a node's json. for example, I would like to specify an array of users there
[2014-06-28 23:16:57 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: Then write a recipe to do that
[2014-06-28 23:17:09 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: Most people would find that unacceptably repetitive and error prone
[2014-06-28 23:17:23 -0400] brauliobo: coderanger: That's what I'm thinking about
[2014-06-28 23:17:27 -0400] brauliobo: coderanger: why?
[2014-06-28 23:17:34 -0400] coderanger: Why what?
[2014-06-28 23:17:51 -0400] brauliobo: why people find that unacceptably repetitive and error prone?
[2014-06-28 23:18:14 -0400] squaresurf: Also a recipe would be versioned.
[2014-06-28 23:18:30 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: Because you would have to copy-paste the user info on to each node
[2014-06-28 23:18:36 -0400] squaresurf: I personally don't write a recipe for each user, but your question made it sound like you needed that much control.
[2014-06-28 23:18:42 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: Which defeats the point of role-based systems
[2014-06-28 23:20:56 -0400] brauliobo: coderanger: hum, but can I make a data bag runs on one specific role?
[2014-06-28 23:21:25 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: data bags don't "run" on anything, they are only data, nothing more
[2014-06-28 23:21:36 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: How you use that data is up to your recipe code
[2014-06-28 23:22:04 -0400] brauliobo: coderanger: hum, again the need to write a recipe..
[2014-06-28 23:22:10 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: Yes ...
[2014-06-28 23:22:16 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: Thats how chef works, you write recipes
[2014-06-28 23:22:43 -0400] brauliobo: coderanger: i pretty much got used to write recipes and publish them on the community website
[2014-06-28 23:23:03 -0400] brauliobo: still, I didn't get convinced to write private recipes
[2014-06-28 23:23:30 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: You will, indeed, have to write your own glue code
[2014-06-28 23:23:59 -0400] brauliobo: is there some recomendation and documentation for this glue code recipe(s)?
[2014-06-28 23:24:32 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: Not specifically, there isn't much special about them
[2014-06-28 23:25:26 -0400] brauliobo: coderanger: thank you coderanger, you made things I don't want to accept very clear :)
[2014-06-28 23:26:00 -0400] brauliobo: now I understand why many cookbooks do everything by LWRP
[2014-06-28 23:26:02 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: You can look at the chef-user cookbook from fnichol as another option, but users are a place where people generally write at least some of it themselves
[2014-06-28 23:26:07 -0400] brauliobo: and provide no other way...
[2014-06-28 23:26:53 -0400] coderanger: brauliobo: Indeed, writing extensible cookbooks is Very Hard
[2014-06-28 23:28:08 -0400] brauliobo: for example, I wrote https://github.com/coletivoEITA/fetchmail-cookbook to read from a list of "fetches"
[2014-06-28 23:28:17 -0400] brauliobo: it sounds more intuitive for me
[2014-06-28 23:28:36 -0400] brauliobo: of course, LWRP should also be present
[2014-06-28 23:28:52 -0400] brauliobo: but I would use them in conjunction with this fetches array
[2014-06-28 23:29:16 -0400] brauliobo: so both ways get loaded
[2014-06-28 23:31:15 -0400] brauliobo: http://fnichol.github.io/chef-user/ seems to be what I want... I think users database should do that too, by reading node['users'] and creating lwrp for each
[2014-06-28 23:31:21 -0400] brauliobo: I'll fork to do that
[2014-06-28 23:31:26 -0400] brauliobo: and create a pull request
[2014-06-28 23:31:36 -0400] brauliobo: users database -> users cookbook
[2014-06-28 23:31:57 -0400] brauliobo: creating lwrp -> using its own LWRP
[2014-06-28 23:34:51 -0400] brauliobo: coderanger: One of the thing I liked chef was the possibility to view and edit a node config in one single file
[2014-06-28 23:47:12 -0400] jessemdavis: hello everyone
[2014-06-28 23:47:16 -0400] jessemdavis: would someone be able to explain to me how the minitest tests are supposed to be executed in the rabbitmq cookbook?
