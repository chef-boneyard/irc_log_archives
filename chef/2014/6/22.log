[2014-06-22 00:59:03 -0400] sarkis: hey guys, confused whether to just make wrapper cookbooks for each component or to go with application cookbooks
[2014-06-22 01:00:02 -0400] sarkis: either i'm going to include all the components a node needs to the runlist like myco-nginx, myco-logrotate, etc.. or have both the wrapper cookbooks and an app cookbook to bring them all into 1
[2014-06-22 01:00:31 -0400] jbz: We are leaning towards bothI don't claim much expertise, just for data
[2014-06-22 01:00:35 -0400] sarkis:  feel like the latter just creates extra overhead, ya the run_lists might get a bit big, but that forces me to make more modular
[2014-06-22 01:00:47 -0400] sarkis: cookbokos
[2014-06-22 01:00:58 -0400] jbz: The wrapper cookbooks exist p. much to prevent us forking community cookbooks, and the app/stack cookbooks take the place of roles
[2014-06-22 01:01:34 -0400] darkside_: i put mycompany's application in one cookbook to keep it all versioned together, my pipeline is linear though
[2014-06-22 01:02:14 -0400] jbz: We reuse a bunch of the wrappers though, in many app/stack cookbooks.  If we didn't have that reuse, it probably wouldn't be worth having both layers.
[2014-06-22 01:05:57 -0400] sarkis: jbz: i'm at a point where i need to reuse a lot :9
[2014-06-22 01:06:38 -0400] sarkis: i just need to make rules.. one major one i can think of is application cookbooks should only include wrapper cookbooks
[2014-06-22 01:06:41 -0400] jbz: Yeah.  I had a setup with the wrapper functionality in the app stack cookbooks, and I found that after I got past the third different app stack, I was making a bunch of repeat edits whenever I had to fiddle with a wrapper.
[2014-06-22 01:07:43 -0400] jbz: My last app stack cookbook had both app-specific logic/attribs and wrappers.  It included wrappers and straight community cookbooks; if I didn't have to futz with the latter, I avoided the wrappers until I needed them.
[2014-06-22 01:08:34 -0400] jbz: I'm still not great at balancing process and agility when dealing with Chef.
[2014-06-22 01:15:45 -0400] sarkis: coderanger: what do you think ^
[2014-06-22 02:54:28 -0400] sarkis: is something like this possible in a LWRP? run_context.resource_collection.each do |r|
[2014-06-22 03:01:57 -0400] sarkis: wondering if i should just use hwrp, or if that can be done in the provider ^
[2014-06-22 10:05:50 -0400] sam___: @all downloaded a community cookbook and writing a wrapper. there is a recipe which is included in the one of the recipes of community cookbook but would not like to include that. Is there a way to dismiss that recipe in the wrapper?
[2014-06-22 11:36:09 -0400] bcave: hello
[2014-06-22 11:36:31 -0400] m4rcu5: ohai
[2014-06-22 11:38:14 -0400] bcave: is anyone using encrypted data bags on windows?\
[2014-06-22 11:42:37 -0400] bcave: am wondering how you edit an encrypted data bag
[2014-06-22 11:43:16 -0400] bcave: if i set editor to something like notepad or write, it opens but immediately stores the databag instead of waiting for editor to close
[2014-06-22 11:57:06 -0400] sam___: is there a way to exclude_recipe like we have include_recipe?
[2014-06-22 11:59:35 -0400] bcave: don't put in a include_recipe, or redesign so that you don't have nested includes (i.e. the included recipe doesn't have an include)
[2014-06-22 11:59:59 -0400] bcave: alternatively, you could set an attribute and wrap the include_recipe in an if statement
[2014-06-22 12:45:24 -0400] m4rcu5: has anyone been able to get chef-dk or chef-client/knife to work on gentoo? i would like to use knife directly on my workstation.
[2014-06-22 16:09:00 -0400] sarkis: coderanger: i was checking out balanced_user, is there anything there that you needed to use a hwrp over lwrp? I am thinking of writing our user model using a lwrp, all i need is to create a user and manage dotfiles...
[2014-06-22 16:09:39 -0400] coderanger: sarkis: LWRPs don't work with all the features of Poise, or at least I've not tested it entirely
[2014-06-22 16:10:03 -0400] sarkis: i see, i was looking at poise, is it just adding the notify
[2014-06-22 16:10:09 -0400] sarkis: and converge_by
[2014-06-22 16:12:23 -0400] sarkis: nvm, watching your poise presentation lol
[2014-06-22 16:26:20 -0400] sarkis: coderanger: so i am still wondering, everyting balanced_user does, that can still be done via lwrp right? just has to be done via the lwrp dsl
[2014-06-22 16:26:25 -0400] sarkis: and prob a bigger pita
[2014-06-22 16:27:22 -0400] coderanger: sarkis: No, the way balanced_deploy_user works wouldn't be possible as LWRPs can neither extend existing classes nor be extended
[2014-06-22 16:31:52 -0400] coderanger: More to the point, there is simply no reason to use LWRPs other than not wanting to learn how to declare a class
[2014-06-22 16:32:51 -0400] gchristensen: coderanger: I had no idea LWRPs had fallen out of favor so fast
[2014-06-22 16:33:08 -0400] coderanger: gchristensen: They haven't, it's just me
[2014-06-22 16:40:38 -0400] sarkis: i wanted to learn lwrp and then write out hwrp without poise
[2014-06-22 16:40:49 -0400] sarkis: just to know how everything works first and then add the poise "shortcuts"
[2014-06-22 16:41:59 -0400] sarkis: so ill skip lwrp then and goto writingn the hwrp without poise for now
[2014-06-22 16:43:42 -0400] coderanger: sarkis: Just know that without Poise, its very verbose
[2014-06-22 16:44:05 -0400] sarkis: ya i figured :/
[2014-06-22 16:44:21 -0400] sarkis: coderanger: do you know of good resources for hwrp?
[2014-06-22 16:44:26 -0400] sarkis: seems a bit lacking
[2014-06-22 16:44:39 -0400] coderanger: sarkis: I do Chef training :)
[2014-06-22 16:45:05 -0400] sarkis: nice whens the next session?
[2014-06-22 16:47:30 -0400] coderanger: sarkis: I mostly stick to in-house training so whenever you want
[2014-06-22 16:51:29 -0400] coderanger: sarkis: https://coderanger.net/training/
[2014-06-22 17:06:31 -0400] sarkis: coderanger: awesome, i am going to check with my boss :)
[2014-06-22 17:11:15 -0400] sarkis: one thing i see is in the resource under initialize, you have to only define only the attributes that have defaults.. then below where the definitions are, do you have to make a method for ALL attribs there?
[2014-06-22 17:11:18 -0400] sarkis: https://github.com/le0pard/chef_book/blob/master/writing_cookbooks/hwrp.tex
[2014-06-22 17:11:31 -0400] sarkis: https://github.com/le0pard/chef_book/blob/master/writing_cookbooks/hwrp.tex#L103-L118
[2014-06-22 17:11:52 -0400] m4rcu5: hhmm, a chef book :)
[2014-06-22 17:12:34 -0400] sarkis: ya looks cool, specially since it's one of the best explanations of hwrp i found so far :)
[2014-06-22 17:13:31 -0400] m4rcu5: experienced chef-devs are hwrps all the way?
[2014-06-22 17:14:55 -0400] sarkis: i noticed key doesn't have a default set in that example, wondering if it's a typo
[2014-06-22 17:14:56 -0400] m4rcu5: im just a bit frustrated that i need to use a debian vm to use knife... ;_;
[2014-06-22 17:15:29 -0400] sarkis: theres a method that sets key below the where defaults are set and the comment is misleading (define attributes that have defaults) leads me to believe maybe key= was missed?
[2014-06-22 17:26:55 -0400] sarkis: anyone with a good understanding of hwrp know if key is left out here on purpose? https://github.com/le0pard/chef_book/blob/master/writing_cookbooks/hwrp.tex#L98-L119
[2014-06-22 17:27:20 -0400] sarkis: i'm wondering if you just setup the defaults above and then ALL attributes below need a mehthod to set_or_return
[2014-06-22 17:31:38 -0400] someara: that looks like an error
[2014-06-22 17:31:50 -0400] someara: I'd expect to see @key='whatever' up in initialize there
[2014-06-22 17:31:58 -0400] sarkis: i see, so the question is.. what if i have optional args
[2014-06-22 17:32:03 -0400] sarkis: are they never specified anywhere?
[2014-06-22 17:32:13 -0400] sarkis: i mean not optional but ones that have no default value
[2014-06-22 17:32:49 -0400] someara: also, can we please stop calling resources "lwrps" and "hwrps".... the el double you arr pee DSL is just a way to avoid typing come boilerplate
[2014-06-22 17:33:16 -0400] someara: sarkis resource parameters will always have a default value...
[2014-06-22 17:33:22 -0400] someara: set it to nil if you dont want to use it
[2014-06-22 17:33:50 -0400] sarkis: i see
[2014-06-22 17:34:04 -0400] someara: you should learn chefspec while you're learning this
[2014-06-22 17:34:40 -0400] someara: check this out:
[2014-06-22 17:34:55 -0400] someara: a resource shipped with a cookbook: https://github.com/someara/httpd/blob/master/test/fixtures/cookbooks/httpd_test_default/recipes/server.rb
[2014-06-22 17:35:11 -0400] someara: the interface is implemented here:
[2014-06-22 17:35:22 -0400] someara: https://github.com/someara/httpd/blob/master/libraries/resource_httpd_service.rb
[2014-06-22 17:35:43 -0400] sarkis: ah sweet, thanks
[2014-06-22 17:35:48 -0400] someara: and tested here:
[2014-06-22 17:35:49 -0400] someara: https://github.com/someara/httpd/blob/master/spec/unit/httpd_service/debian/7.2/2.2/default_spec.rb#L13
[2014-06-22 17:36:35 -0400] darkside_: anyone know what am I doing wrong with chef-rewind? http://git.io/9kt8Ng I think I'm not understanding the resource collection
[2014-06-22 17:36:43 -0400] someara: the resource is the chef ruby object that's actually created and placed on the resource collection.
[2014-06-22 17:37:26 -0400] someara: darkside_ is there a resource named 'template[/etc/tomcat6/server.xml]' in tomcat::default?
[2014-06-22 17:37:49 -0400] someara: chef-rewind is dangerous as hell as far as I'm concerned
[2014-06-22 17:38:03 -0400] someara: you're monkey patching your compiled resource collection
[2014-06-22 17:38:18 -0400] darkside_: someara: i don't think so, I took a peak with chef-shell and could only find that "tomcat_instance[base]" resource
[2014-06-22 17:38:29 -0400] someara: and monkey patching is a pejorative term for a reason
[2014-06-22 17:38:46 -0400] someara: yea so... a chef recipe is compiled into a "resource collection"
[2014-06-22 17:38:56 -0400] someara: think pre-processing
[2014-06-22 17:39:12 -0400] someara: that gives it a chance to do things like interpolate strings and evaluate loops
[2014-06-22 17:39:40 -0400] someara: so if you had... 1...3 { |i| file i }
[2014-06-22 17:39:45 -0400] someara: you'd have 3 resources,
[2014-06-22 17:39:59 -0400] someara: file[1], file[2], and file[3] on the resource collection
[2014-06-22 17:40:09 -0400] darkside_: ok
[2014-06-22 17:40:17 -0400] someara: then you can make assertions about that resource collection with chefspec
[2014-06-22 17:40:20 -0400] someara: or
[2014-06-22 17:40:25 -0400] someara: have chef converge each one
[2014-06-22 17:40:48 -0400] someara: chef rewind goes in and fiddles with something in there... file[3] for example
[2014-06-22 17:42:05 -0400] darkside_: so if you don't like rewind, is there an alternative besides forking the cookbook?
[2014-06-22 17:42:37 -0400] someara: not really
[2014-06-22 17:43:07 -0400] someara: except for when there is
[2014-06-22 17:43:21 -0400] someara: so the template resource, by default looks in your "current cookbook" for the source
[2014-06-22 17:43:36 -0400] someara: so you can just drop a whatever.erb in your wrapper cookbook and chef will pick it up
[2014-06-22 17:43:41 -0400] someara: no monkey patching necessary
[2014-06-22 17:43:42 -0400] darkside_: oh?
[2014-06-22 17:43:45 -0400] someara: yea
[2014-06-22 17:43:56 -0400] darkside_: that is good to know
[2014-06-22 17:44:08 -0400] darkside_: so, just name the .erb the same?
[2014-06-22 17:44:18 -0400] someara: yep
[2014-06-22 17:44:25 -0400] someara: tempaltes/default/whatever.erb
[2014-06-22 17:44:31 -0400] darkside_: nice, i'll try that
[2014-06-22 17:44:49 -0400] darkside_: thx
[2014-06-22 17:45:01 -0400] someara: np
[2014-06-22 17:54:02 -0400] darkside_: someara: well, i put a modified server.xml.erb in my wrapper cookbook but it didn't get used
[2014-06-22 19:05:23 -0400] p3rror: hello
[2014-06-22 19:05:31 -0400] p3rror: is their any mysql support for chef
[2014-06-22 19:05:50 -0400] p3rror: I installed chef and it comes with postgre by default
[2014-06-22 19:42:42 -0400] aujt74: p3rror: you mean for the omnibus install of chef-server? no, at least not supported by Chef Inc.
[2014-06-22 19:45:49 -0400] aujt74: don't quote me but I seem to remember there being some discussion a long time ago on the list/here about supporting both but suspect that got sensibly sidelined
[2014-06-22 19:47:31 -0400] p3rror: So you mean that I have to use pgsql
[2014-06-22 19:50:13 -0400] someara: yes
