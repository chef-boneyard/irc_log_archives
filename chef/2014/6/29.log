[2014-06-29 00:02:14 -0400] blarf: has anyone seen something like this before? https://gist.github.com/agarian-alex/a4d1ab038047a1405a8f
[2014-06-29 00:14:56 -0400] qrada: hey, quick q.. could someone just point me in the right direction on where i should put helper functions that all of my cookbook recipe's can access? noobing it up here, can't find that.. basically, say i'm doing %w{...}.each do |v| package v end .. I want to put my 'packages' helper somewhere that all of my recipes can access
[2014-06-29 00:22:31 -0400] brauliobo: coderanger: please look at: https://github.com/sethvargo-cookbooks/users/pull/58
[2014-06-29 00:22:38 -0400] brauliobo: it was actually pretty easy
[2014-06-29 00:26:41 -0400] blarf: nobody?
[2014-06-29 00:26:42 -0400] blarf: sigh
[2014-06-29 00:32:19 -0400] mfhua: hello
[2014-06-29 00:34:38 -0400] brauliobo: to allow access from server to clients, should I authorize ssh keys?
[2014-06-29 00:36:57 -0400] mfhua: we have several roles defined for different type of servers, like DB, web, rabbitmq, redis. and the integration is depend on roles, such as how the WEB server find the DB servers. in each role, there are cookbooks or sub roles in 3 layres, there are cookbooks for system, cookbooks for install tomcat/database, cookbooks to install war packages. But in some case, i just need to run the cookbooks for system, the easiest way is to change the run-list
[2014-06-29 00:40:08 -0400] sansmojo: does anyone know if there is a workaround for this?: https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3312?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:all-tabpanel
[2014-06-29 00:42:23 -0400] brauliobo: sansmojo: why not use chef 11 and ubuntu?
[2014-06-29 00:42:56 -0400] sansmojo: Im trying to run it on crunchbang distro.  I guess Im out of luck and have to switch to Ubuntu?
[2014-06-29 00:44:04 -0400] brauliobo: sansmojo: yeah, ubuntu and RHEL are the supported plataforms...
[2014-06-29 00:44:16 -0400] sansmojo: damn :(
[2014-06-29 00:44:18 -0400] sansmojo: thanks
[2014-06-29 00:44:24 -0400] brauliobo: http://www.getchef.com/chef/install/
[2014-06-29 00:45:04 -0400] sansmojo: thanks, Ive seen thatI just really wanted to run crunchbangits a home desktop that I want to dual-purpose for light chef usage to learn
[2014-06-29 00:45:15 -0400] brauliobo: sansmojo: I've created an lxc container just for chef-server
[2014-06-29 00:45:30 -0400] brauliobo: sansmojo: to learn you may use knife solo
[2014-06-29 00:46:18 -0400] sansmojo: yeah, I know I can run just the api too, but having the webui sounded nice ;)
[2014-06-29 00:46:39 -0400] sansmojo: I guess Ill just switch to ubuntu :/
[2014-06-29 00:47:14 -0400] brauliobo: you may use a virtual machine
[2014-06-29 00:47:30 -0400] brauliobo: the webui don't seems to do much
[2014-06-29 00:47:42 -0400] brauliobo: actually, I haven't tried it yet
[2014-06-29 00:47:49 -0400] brauliobo: just saw it running
[2014-06-29 00:47:54 -0400] sansmojo: hrmm, thought about that but didnt love the idea
[2014-06-29 00:48:33 -0400] sansmojo: I mean, I love vagrant for testing and such but also wanted this to be a chef server for all my raspberry pis and beaglebones around the house.
[2014-06-29 00:48:34 -0400] brauliobo: you can use knife solo just with a ruby and some gems
[2014-06-29 00:49:07 -0400] sansmojo: well, Im using chef server at work and just wanted the same type of environment to play around with
[2014-06-29 00:49:22 -0400] brauliobo: https://github.com/coletivoEITA/chef-repo/blob/master/Gemfile
[2014-06-29 00:49:30 -0400] brauliobo: hum, got it
[2014-06-29 00:50:09 -0400] sansmojo: I think Id rather go the standard route and just get over crunchbang.  Maybe I can get openbox running on ubuntu even.
[2014-06-29 00:50:22 -0400] sansmojo: spent way too long trying to get this to work already ;)
[2014-06-29 00:50:44 -0400] sansmojo: thanks a bunch for the info!
[2014-06-29 01:03:17 -0400] jessemdavis: hello everyone
[2014-06-29 01:03:20 -0400] jessemdavis: would someone be able to explain to me how the minitest tests are supposed to be executed in the rabbitmq cookbook?
[2014-06-29 01:03:23 -0400] jessemdavis: https://github.com/kennonkwok/rabbitmq/tree/master/test/cookbooks/rabbitmq_test/recipes
[2014-06-29 01:03:26 -0400] jessemdavis: i'm not seeing how to tell Busser to execute them?
[2014-06-29 01:03:32 -0400] jessemdavis: I found a bug, but want to make sure I have the tests correct before submitting a PR
[2014-06-29 01:46:57 -0400] sarkis: so whats the difference between test kitchen and minitest?
[2014-06-29 01:47:21 -0400] sarkis: minitest will actually test out production as well?
[2014-06-29 01:47:34 -0400] sarkis: after it converges?
[2014-06-29 01:48:44 -0400] jessemdavis: as far as i can tell, it's just another test framework
[2014-06-29 01:48:58 -0400] jessemdavis: kitchen test will still run them, i think?
[2014-06-29 01:49:42 -0400] jessemdavis: but I'm unclear in the rabbitmq cookbook how to tell it to run those tests; it goes down the integration directory to pick up the one BATS test, and then that's it
[2014-06-29 01:50:58 -0400] jessemdavis: i'd contact the author directly, but he doesn't have that information listed on his github profile
[2014-06-29 01:53:33 -0400] digitalchild: raise an issue on github?
[2014-06-29 01:54:07 -0400] digitalchild: i think its reasonable to create an issue and ask for more documentation
[2014-06-29 01:54:42 -0400] jessemdavis: true, guess i just wanted to figure it as well, since it looks like a general way to kick off tests
[2014-06-29 01:55:18 -0400] jessemdavis: and the reason i found this bug is because i'm experimenting with reimplementing my current work architecture using chef
[2014-06-29 01:56:03 -0400] jessemdavis: another question:
[2014-06-29 01:56:36 -0400] jessemdavis: what's the current workflow for getting a ticket number (CHEF-xxxx) to assign to the PR?
[2014-06-29 01:57:03 -0400] jessemdavis: or is that not really followed any more?
[2014-06-29 01:58:23 -0400] jessemdavis: oh well, maybe I should just push this and ask
[2014-06-29 02:03:10 -0400] coderanger: jessemdavis: The Jira system has been shuttered
[2014-06-29 02:14:48 -0400] jessemdavis: anyway: https://github.com/kennonkwok/rabbitmq/pull/127
[2014-06-29 02:15:04 -0400] jessemdavis: for opscode-cookbooks/rabbitmq
[2014-06-29 02:18:06 -0400] coderanger: jessemdavis: As the redirect indicates, that repo no longer exists
[2014-06-29 02:18:16 -0400] coderanger: kennon is maintaining it personally
[2014-06-29 02:18:45 -0400] coderanger: jessemdavis: Also you've put "Copyright Opscode" on your new files, which isn't correct
[2014-06-29 02:20:12 -0400] jessemdavis: are there cookbooks that were under opscode control, but aren't now?
[2014-06-29 02:20:36 -0400] jessemdavis: as for the copyrights, should i replace them with something, or remove them entirely?
[2014-06-29 02:22:26 -0400] coderanger: jessemdavis: You retain copyright on all code you write :)
[2014-06-29 02:22:42 -0400] coderanger: You are providing it to kennon under the terms of the Apache 2 license
[2014-06-29 02:23:08 -0400] coderanger: And yes, Opscode as a company is dropping out of cookbook maintenance as they are able to
[2014-06-29 02:23:13 -0400] jessemdavis: k, i'll adjust
[2014-06-29 02:23:34 -0400] jessemdavis: yeah, i was a little confused by the redirect, but that makes sense
[2014-06-29 02:28:03 -0400] jessemdavis: thanks for the suggestions coderanger
[2014-06-29 02:37:36 -0400] MrHeavy: Is there any way to redefine an attribute on a resource if that resource is defined through a provider for a parent resource (e.g. a service defined by a redis_instance)?
[2014-06-29 02:37:49 -0400] MrHeavy: I tried both the resources method and chef-rewind and both are telling me the service doesn't exist
[2014-06-29 02:45:02 -0400] coderanger: MrHeavy: I can't parse that, can you be more specific
[2014-06-29 04:15:15 -0400] vt101: I'm setting up a completely new environment, is the whole git clone of chef-repo still the thing to start with?
[2014-06-29 04:15:23 -0400] vt101: On the client workstation side
[2014-06-29 04:42:27 -0400] coderanger: vt101: Depends on how you want to use chef
[2014-06-29 04:42:41 -0400] coderanger: vt101: There isn't much in that chef repo skeleton anymore
[2014-06-29 04:42:52 -0400] vt101: That's what I was thinking
[2014-06-29 04:43:41 -0400] vt101: I still want to manage cookbooks, but frankly having nested git cookbooks in a git chef-repo repository is more problem than help, as far as I can tell.
[2014-06-29 04:44:18 -0400] vt101: And knife configure doesn't try to use it, so I wondered if that whole concept was deprecated.
[2014-06-29 04:44:21 -0400] coderanger: vt101: It is increasingly popular to keep all cookbooks isolated in their own repo, with a central repo used very little if at all (I recommend the latter)
[2014-06-29 04:45:14 -0400] vt101: Great, I didn't see a problem with doing that.  Thanks coderanger
[2014-06-29 11:45:51 -0400] adsisco: anyone used the opscode bento for rhel? whats the password for root?
[2014-06-29 12:19:12 -0400] Cope: adsisco: https://github.com/opscode/bento/blob/master/packer/centos-6.5-x86_64.json#L52-L54
[2014-06-29 12:25:40 -0400] Cope: or rather, for rhel: https://github.com/opscode/bento/blob/master/packer/rhel-6.5-x86_64.json#L17-L19 -- same principle
[2014-06-29 12:26:07 -0400] Cope: vagrant should have sudo access, so that should be all you need
[2014-06-29 12:30:41 -0400] adsisco: Cope: yea, vagrant indeed have sudo access, thanks!
[2014-06-29 12:35:24 -0400] Cope: excellent
[2014-06-29 14:16:31 -0400] chiefsucker: Thanks to you awesome guys I discovered The Berkshelf Way before I even started to understand Chef. After watching the presentation, and reading a lot of docs, Im still not sure how to structure my repositories and where to put the Berksfile in. What I definitely know is that there should be one repo per cookbook (which can get kind of annoying for me in the beginning, but its The Berkshelf Way).
[2014-06-29 14:17:56 -0400] chiefsucker: I had a base-ubuntu role that had things like apt, base packages, users & sudo in its run list. Now I already refactored it, created a base-ubuntu cookbook which is the only item on the base-ubuntu role run list (because of versioning).
[2014-06-29 14:18:47 -0400] chiefsucker: Now Im trying to set up a management node with things like DHCP, DNS and I dont know how to do it to stay within the berkshelf philosophy.
[2014-06-29 14:20:01 -0400] chiefsucker: I planned to create wrapper cookbooks for the aforementioned services where necessary, make a dependency to the upstream cookbooks, and then make a management cookbook that includes a list of the wrapper cookbooks.
[2014-06-29 14:20:05 -0400] chiefsucker: Is this the preferred way?
[2014-06-29 14:20:52 -0400] chiefsucker: Now Im completely unsure if I should specify dependencies in Berksfile or metadata.rb?
[2014-06-29 14:22:09 -0400] chiefsucker: If my managament cookbook depends only on the custom wrapper cookbooks and each wrapper cookbook depends on the upstream cookbook, would berkshelf be smart enough to upload all dependencies to the server with me just uploading the management cookbook?
[2014-06-29 14:22:25 -0400] chiefsucker: management*
[2014-06-29 14:24:50 -0400] chiefsucker: The management cookbook would be my application cookbook.
[2014-06-29 14:31:29 -0400] chiefsucker: And should I use the default "https://api.berkshelf.com" source, :opscode or nothing at all?
[2014-06-29 18:47:57 -0400] coderanger: chiefsucker: What version of berks are you using?
[2014-06-29 18:48:13 -0400] coderanger: (presumably 3.x)
[2014-06-29 21:09:20 -0400] krichtof78: hi everybody. The opscode chef server is very slow at the moment for me. Anyone has the same problem ?
[2014-06-29 21:19:24 -0400] krichtof78: I launched a get-client 25mn ago ... Still synchronizing cookbooks ! Very slow chef server today or it's my connection ?
[2014-06-29 21:39:10 -0400] coderanger: krichtof78: That step is almost entirely comms with S3, so likely your node or connection
[2014-06-29 22:04:56 -0400] liku: Hello everyone. Was playing with environments in chef-solo inside vagrant and |'m always getting https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/environment.rb#L307. Chef is 11.12.8. What I'm doing wrong?
[2014-06-29 22:06:38 -0400] liku: @coderanger @jtimberman would appreciate your help.
[2014-06-29 22:07:16 -0400] coderanger: liku: You can't use cookbook version constraints in envs with solo, remove them
[2014-06-29 22:08:31 -0400] liku: hm.. that's a bit odd envs support but thanks anyway!
[2014-06-29 22:11:59 -0400] coderanger: liku: solo doesn't do a version solution like chef-server does, it just uses whatever cookbooks/versions are in the folder you point it at
[2014-06-29 22:12:13 -0400] coderanger: liku: Thus those version constraints can't be used
[2014-06-29 22:12:23 -0400] liku: @coderanger right, that makes sense
[2014-06-29 22:53:39 -0400] cwebber: liku:
[2014-06-29 22:53:53 -0400] cwebber: liku: maybe look at chef-client -z instead of solo?
[2014-06-29 22:54:28 -0400] liku: @cwebber thanx for a tip but that's been already resolved.
