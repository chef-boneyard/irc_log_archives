[2014-06-08 01:11:24 -0400] david__: anyone know how to deal with a parent directory error, like "Parent directory /etc/monit does not exist."
[2014-06-08 01:14:11 -0400] coderanger: david__: Create the parent dir in your recipe code
[2014-06-08 01:19:50 -0400] david__: sweet, that worked. thanks @coderanger. I'm new to chef, but making progress
[2014-06-08 12:36:15 -0400] mhenrixon: anyone have a clue on why a cookbook I uploaded to the chef server isn't being used when I run chef-client?
[2014-06-08 12:40:52 -0400] mhenrixon: I just deleted all the cached cookbooks lets see what happens
[2014-06-08 12:47:10 -0400] mhenrixon: still getting the old version
[2014-06-08 15:45:00 -0400] thun: ERROR: Could not find cookbook my_recipe in your cookbook path, skipping it
[2014-06-08 15:46:41 -0400] thun: It lives in cookbooks folder like normal
[2014-06-08 15:46:53 -0400] thun: I created with berkshelf, now normal knife cookbook will not upload it
[2014-06-08 16:53:54 -0400] MrHeavy: I'm having a funny issue where the chef_gem resource does absolutely nothing
[2014-06-08 16:54:28 -0400] MrHeavy: With debug logging on, it outputs that the gem isn't installed, it outputs the version it found on RubyGems, and then it proceeds to do absolutely nothing with this information
[2014-06-08 16:54:35 -0400] MrHeavy: Anyone seen this before?
[2014-06-08 16:55:02 -0400] mikesplain: Weird.  Have you tried setting the action :install ?
[2014-06-08 16:55:05 -0400] MrHeavy: Yep
[2014-06-08 16:55:30 -0400] MrHeavy: Also tried explicitly calling it with .run_action(:install)
[2014-06-08 16:56:33 -0400] mikesplain: Hmm yeah that's what I would've tried... is this on a fresh node / test kitchen?
[2014-06-08 16:57:52 -0400] MrHeavy: Fresh node
[2014-06-08 16:57:58 -0400] MrHeavy: Actually it seems I've misdiagnosed the problem
[2014-06-08 16:57:59 -0400] mikesplain: damn...
[2014-06-08 16:58:06 -0400] mikesplain: oOo?
[2014-06-08 16:58:28 -0400] MrHeavy: It's installing under the system Ruby despite properly identifying the omnibus installation under /opt/chef/embedded/bin
[2014-06-08 16:58:35 -0400] MrHeavy: So now I'm thoroughly confused
[2014-06-08 17:10:51 -0400] MrHeavy: I think I found the issue
[2014-06-08 17:11:06 -0400] MrHeavy: Looks like chef_gem does absolutely the wrong thing when options is specified as a String instead of a Hash
[2014-06-08 17:11:21 -0400] mikesplain: hah
[2014-06-08 17:11:23 -0400] MrHeavy: It falls back to the default install_via_gem_command
[2014-06-08 17:11:32 -0400] mikesplain: interesting
[2014-06-08 17:21:46 -0400] MrHeavy: Seems fixed in dev (https://github.com/opscode/chef/commit/58810790bd94953a4f2c28c77487f29d435b5ab5) so whatever
[2014-06-08 17:59:14 -0400] MikeTLive: installed ChefDK. stomped on prior chef by replacing /usr/bin/{many things} to link to /opt/chefdk variants. not a happy surprise
[2014-06-08 18:01:51 -0400] MikeTLive: on MacOS X, was it only the symlinks in /usr/bin which get replaced?
[2014-06-08 18:40:38 -0400] MikeTLive: from the installer, a list of binaries, some of which are not found in /opt/chefdk
[2014-06-08 18:41:10 -0400] MikeTLive: PREFIX="/usr"binaries="chef chef-solo chef-apply chef-shell knife shef ohai berks chef-zero fauxhai foodcritic kitchen rubocop strain strainer chef-client"
[2014-06-08 18:41:22 -0400] MikeTLive: for binary in $binaries; do
[2014-06-08 18:41:22 -0400] MikeTLive:   rm -f $PREFIX/bin/$binary
[2014-06-08 18:41:36 -0400] MikeTLive: then we do the symlinks
[2014-06-08 18:41:36 -0400] MikeTLive: ln -sf $INSTALLER_DIR/bin/$binary $PREFIX/bin
[2014-06-08 18:52:10 -0400] MikeTLive: INSTALLER_DIR=/opt/chefdk   however,  ohai, chef-zero, are in $INSTALLER_DIR/embedded/bin, while  strain and strainer are nowhere to be seen.
[2014-06-08 18:59:28 -0400] MikeTLive: ruby. is. breaking. me.
[2014-06-08 20:05:37 -0400] fulanito: hi
[2014-06-08 20:26:01 -0400] sarkis: what's the best way to make environment specific attributes?
[2014-06-08 20:26:35 -0400] sarkis: actually silly question
[2014-06-08 20:55:53 -0400] mjuszczak: Quick organization question.  If I have chef-myorg-openldap which wraps cookbook-openldap and gives me an organization specific LDAP server, and then I have chef-myorg-base which contains all the 'base node' stuff which happens to also include the sssd (openldap client) stuff, what's the best way to test sssd talking to LDAP?
[2014-06-08 20:56:29 -0400] mjuszczak: If I create a kitchen suite inside either of those two repos then that means it has to "depend" on the other, which I don't want.
[2014-06-08 21:30:30 -0400] mjuszczak: coderanger: around by chance?
[2014-06-08 22:27:50 -0400] coderanger: mjuszczak: I am now, whats up
