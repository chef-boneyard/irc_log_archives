[2014-06-01 00:28:45 -0400] stanchan: Can someone help me with a question regarding ruby_block in a provider?
[2014-06-01 00:29:35 -0400] stanchan: I'm getting a undefined method `exists?' for Chef::Provider::File:Class when checking for a existing file.
[2014-06-01 00:30:49 -0400] stanchan: does using the file provider have differenlty from within another provider
[2014-06-01 00:31:42 -0400] stanchan: behave
[2014-06-01 00:38:59 -0400] gkra: Is there a way to get test-kitchen to just let vagrant do it's thing? Feels a little stupid to have to override box_url for every platform driver to use something from vagrant-cloud...
[2014-06-01 00:47:03 -0400] coderanger: stanchan: For a variety of not very good reasons, you need to do ::File.exusts?
[2014-06-01 00:47:06 -0400] coderanger: er, exists
[2014-06-01 00:47:26 -0400] coderanger: gkra: You can customize the vagrantfile template yourself
[2014-06-01 00:47:55 -0400] gkra: ah, that's the one that gets created in the .kitchen tree, then?
[2014-06-01 00:48:29 -0400] gkra: I've taken a shine to box-cutter. :)
[2014-06-01 00:50:15 -0400] gkra: so I've modeled it out where I've got guard running rubocop, foodcritic, chefspec and test-kitchen for continuous testing. :)
[2014-06-01 00:51:10 -0400] gkra: now I'm thinking I need to template out a bare/new cookbook and use rake tasks in teh chef-repo to create a new cookbook with all the right hooks in it from the start.
[2014-06-01 00:51:49 -0400] gkra: berks cookbook <name> && knife cookbook create <name> (with knife-spec installed) is a good starting point, though.
[2014-06-01 00:54:18 -0400] gkra: coderanger: oh, lol, if I specify a blank box_url for the platform driver in .kitchen.yml, it does the "right" thing.
[2014-06-01 00:54:45 -0400] gkra: coderanger: scratch that...
[2014-06-01 00:54:53 -0400] gkra: :P I R BABOON
[2014-06-01 00:55:04 -0400] coderanger: It should have the URLs for all the standard opscode boxes already
[2014-06-01 01:05:32 -0400] gkra: those are the ones listed in the Bento project readme, right?
[2014-06-01 01:10:07 -0400] juliancdunn: gkra: yup
[2014-06-01 01:10:50 -0400] gkra: bah... why, why?
[2014-06-01 01:10:53 -0400] gkra:        curl: (6) Couldn't resolve host 'www.getchef.com'
[2014-06-01 01:11:10 -0400] gkra: okay, so `kitchen login` and yes, yes it does resolve. wtf.
[2014-06-01 01:22:24 -0400] gkra: Okay, let's skip box-cutter and to back to opscode...
[2014-06-01 01:24:31 -0400] gkra: aaand, same problem? https://gist.github.com/gkra/9446fcf65743a89951b1
[2014-06-01 01:24:40 -0400] gkra: kitchen.yml - https://gist.github.com/gkra/35610a44199e0f0b4da2
[2014-06-01 01:25:49 -0400] coderanger: gkra: Guessing networking from within the VM just isn't working in general?
[2014-06-01 01:26:46 -0400] gkra: It is, but... SSL issues? https://gist.github.com/gkra/a428a01aab7b6623addd
[2014-06-01 01:28:22 -0400] gkra: updated https://gist.github.com/gkra/9446fcf65743a89951b1 to include the 'kitchen create' output, too
[2014-06-01 01:32:52 -0400] gkra: if I curl the install.sh URL from the command line inside the kitchen VM, it works fine.
[2014-06-01 01:33:15 -0400] gkra: log back out, kitchen converge, and it fails.
[2014-06-01 01:41:44 -0400] stanchan: coderanger: Thanks!  That did the trick.
[2014-06-01 01:45:07 -0400] gkra: coderanger: interesting. if I switch to opscode centos-6.4, wget fails but curl works....
[2014-06-01 01:47:09 -0400] gkra: guess at some point I'll build my own centos-6.4 and 6.5 from bento and see what's really different, or if it's all SSL-related...
[2014-06-01 01:50:01 -0400] gkra: odd.  wget and curl are behaving identically from the shell on this box (centos-6.4 and centos-6.5)
[2014-06-01 01:50:11 -0400] gkra: converge works on 6.4, but not on 6.5...
[2014-06-01 02:01:45 -0400] gkra: bah, i'll bang on this later...

[2014-06-01 08:33:31 -0400] whysthatso: i have a problem with berkshelf in the chef devkti installation
[2014-06-01 08:34:37 -0400] whysthatso: it seems to ignore my settings in the knife.rb which sets the  client key to my host machine name, rather than the organisation i'm setting on the fly there.
[2014-06-01 08:35:18 -0400] whysthatso: is there any default location chefdk berkshelf is taking configs from?
[2014-06-01 09:50:56 -0400] whysthatso: okay, apparently it expects .berkshelf/config.json in the home dir of the user, but now i get an error about invalid ruby syntax in the cookbooks

[2014-06-01 09:51:36 -0400] whysthatso: anybody has an idea how this can be tackled?
[2014-06-01 09:56:31 -0400] whysthatso: hm, it seems like the embedded ruby cannot found? is that a possibility?
[2014-06-01 09:56:41 -0400] whysthatso: or is not used, rather
[2014-06-01 10:07:56 -0400] digitalchild: whysthatso: i managed to kill ruby embedded by installing system ruby
[2014-06-01 10:08:07 -0400] digitalchild: and that completely killed chef-client on me
[2014-06-01 10:12:49 -0400] whysthatso: lol, yeah
[2014-06-01 10:13:22 -0400] whysthatso: i'm actually quite happy with my rbenv-steered environment
[2014-06-01 10:13:44 -0400] whysthatso: i don't use the distro-packaged ruby
[2014-06-01 10:14:18 -0400] whysthatso: but the error message seems to point to berkshelf trying to use the rbenv-controlled ruby version
[2014-06-01 10:14:49 -0400] whysthatso: is there any place to configure that? config.json of berkshelf maybe?
[2014-06-01 10:15:04 -0400] whysthatso: i thought the dev kit will finally get rid of all those environment implications
[2014-06-01 10:15:35 -0400] digitalchild: mine broke when i used RVM
[2014-06-01 10:15:40 -0400] digitalchild: mistake..
[2014-06-01 10:15:52 -0400] digitalchild: i just got 'ruby command not found'
[2014-06-01 10:16:09 -0400] digitalchild: switched back to the distro ruby no issues
[2014-06-01 10:16:24 -0400] digitalchild: sorry i don't know enough about berks and the rest yet to be much help
[2014-06-01 10:16:33 -0400] digitalchild: i only learned berks/kitchen a week ago
[2014-06-01 21:05:44 -0400] Atttwww: I've been trying to upgrade my cookbook to work with Ubuntu 14.04 and its throwing errors around trying to restart ssh. I've heard that might have changed since the last LTS, because it still works on old nodes? Anyone run into things like that?
[2014-06-01 21:08:53 -0400] mattt: Atttwww: yes
[2014-06-01 21:09:41 -0400] mattt: Atttwww: i hit a # of issues on 14.04
[2014-06-01 21:09:57 -0400] mattt: Atttwww: a lot of services no longer have /etc/init.d init scripts, and chef assumes ubuntu has these
[2014-06-01 21:10:24 -0400] Atttwww: any tips? I'm trying to just do "service 'ssh' do
[2014-06-01 21:10:24 -0400] Atttwww:   action :restart
[2014-06-01 21:10:25 -0400] Atttwww: end" which used to work.
[2014-06-01 21:13:06 -0400] mattt: Atttwww: https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-5276
[2014-06-01 21:14:23 -0400] Atttwww: hmm, still unresolved. I was hoping this would be a little smoother by now.
[2014-06-01 21:14:43 -0400] Atttwww: Thanks for the direction though. Have you solved it yourself or are you waiting?
[2014-06-01 21:18:28 -0400] mattt: Atttwww: i'm waiting :(
[2014-06-01 21:18:48 -0400] mattt: Atttwww: but the crappy thing is that Ubuntu has some services that don't have upstart scripts, so either way you're going to have to override
[2014-06-01 21:27:44 -0400] stormerider: mattt / Atttwww: hm, wonder why not use invoke-rc.d which will work for both upstart and init scripts?
[2014-06-01 21:32:42 -0400] Atttwww: @stormerider could to explain a little more? I'm looking into it but I'm not that well versed in in these topics, thats why I use chef to record my progress as I solve things.
[2014-06-01 21:34:12 -0400] stormerider: Atttwww: well, upstart uses stop/start/restart commands, vs service X stop/start/restart, but there's also invoke-rc.d X stop/start/restart and works with both upstart and init scripts. it would seem to me that there could be a provider that could be written to be more agnostic about the underlying platform used
[2014-06-01 21:34:48 -0400] stormerider: i know ubuntu states that packaging scripts should only use invoke-rc.d instead of the other two options
[2014-06-01 21:37:01 -0400] Atttwww: so "invoke-rc.d" = "service" kinda, so "invoke-rc.d ssh restart" should work in a terminal, right? What about Chef, or am I lost?
[2014-06-01 21:37:39 -0400] stormerider: Atttwww: right. as far as chef is concerned, someone would need to write a provider that would actually use that and extend out the service resource.
[2014-06-01 21:38:26 -0400] Atttwww: and that might go back to that open ticket, and folding that into chef passively
[2014-06-01 21:38:34 -0400] stormerider: there may be good reasons not to do this, im just not sure what they might be :)
[2014-06-01 21:54:20 -0400] Atttwww: well, I'm sure exactly what I did in detail, but my cookbook works on 14.04 now it seems (just finished running). I used some work around code from that ticket thread. I'll need to try it again from a fresh node, but it seems to work. Here is the gist https://gist.github.com/anonymous/48b882519d4086c4cb29
[2014-06-01 21:54:39 -0400] Atttwww: I'm not* sure
[2014-06-01 21:58:17 -0400] mjuszczak: Quick question on the Chef OpenLDAP cookbook.  It generates a slapd ERB template by running a command -- if I just wanted to use my own ERB template in place of that one, is that a good use case for chef-rewind, or should I just write my own, simpler cookbook?
[2014-06-01 22:17:26 -0400] jidar: mjuszczak: reinvinting the wheel is for the birds, wrap it and wrap it right
[2014-06-01 22:17:54 -0400] jidar: I think rewind is the only way to override the erbs?
[2014-06-01 22:19:36 -0400] jidar: mjuszczak: oddly similar issue : https://raymii.org/s/articles/Chef_-_overwrite_templates_in_wrapper_cookbooks.html
[2014-06-01 22:21:23 -0400] jidar: mjuszczak: or this is usually what I reference : http://www.getchef.com/blog/2013/12/03/doing-wrapper-cookbooks-right/

[2014-06-01 22:53:31 -0400] winn: hello all. QQ if i want to use a node tag's value in a template.erb file how is it called?
[2014-06-01 22:54:57 -0400] winn: "<%= node['cookbook'][#{:tag}]['attribute'] %>"
[2014-06-01 22:55:08 -0400] winn: didn't work ^^
[2014-06-01 23:19:15 -0400] stanchan: winn: Have you tried node['tags']['tag_name']
[2014-06-01 23:19:37 -0400] stanchan: I haven't tried, but that seems like a possiblity
[2014-06-01 23:22:44 -0400] stanchan: question for anyone who might know this
[2014-06-01 23:22:58 -0400] stanchan: I'm having an odd issue with a ruby_block
[2014-06-01 23:23:10 -0400] stanchan: I'm doing something like this: node.set["mysql"]["tmp_root_password"] = match[1]
[2014-06-01 23:23:31 -0400] stanchan: the first chef client run, it is 'nil'
[2014-06-01 23:23:53 -0400] stanchan: the second run sets it correctly
[2014-06-01 23:24:01 -0400] stanchan: I'm I running into some race condition?
[2014-06-01 23:24:47 -0400] stanchan: ruby_block is in a provider if that provides any clues
[2014-06-01 23:43:21 -0400] Atttwww: So when I re-run my cookbooks, its a little slow because it pauses on adding PPAs and other lines. What is a good way to check if its already added a little more smoothly?
