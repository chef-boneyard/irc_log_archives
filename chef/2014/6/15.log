[2014-06-15 03:26:21 -0400] soukihei: what exactly is a 'chef-server-ctl cleanse' going to do on a private chef-server? Is it going to delete the checksum files in /bookshelf/data/bookshelf/ ?
[2014-06-15 15:22:26 -0400] shevron: hey guys, I'm having troubles with the apt cookbook on Ubuntu 14.04 (worked on 12.04)
[2014-06-15 15:22:46 -0400] shevron: I have my own recipe that does 'require_recipe 'apt''
[2014-06-15 15:23:12 -0400] shevron: and then uses apt_repository
[2014-06-15 15:23:32 -0400] shevron: but I keep getting: ERROR: Cannot find a resource for apt_installed? on ubuntu version 14.04
[2014-06-15 15:24:36 -0400] shevron: any thoughts?
[2014-06-15 15:24:58 -0400] shevron: (btw its chef-solo)
[2014-06-15 15:47:43 -0400] ambientsound: shevron: do you have "depends 'apt'" in your metadata.rb?
[2014-06-15 15:48:05 -0400] shevron: ambientsound: no.. does it matter in chef-solo?
[2014-06-15 15:48:55 -0400] ambientsound: I believe so
[2014-06-15 15:49:12 -0400] shevron: ok, I'll chek. thanks
[2014-06-15 16:43:31 -0400] roramirez: Hello
[2014-06-15 16:44:25 -0400] roramirez: i have a little question
[2014-06-15 16:48:13 -0400] roramirez: i have a recipe for vagrant
[2014-06-15 16:48:45 -0400] roramirez: is possible used this recipe for install on real machine, not a vm?
[2014-06-15 18:15:26 -0400] someara: it should be yes, assuming that its not relying on anything "vagranty"
[2014-06-15 18:15:40 -0400] someara: such as the presence of the vagrant user, port forwarding, sudoers config, etc
[2014-06-15 20:41:32 -0400] ordos: Suddenly, when I'm running Chef on a server I'm getting a lot of error messages: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4qakw52dlt0hhyy/Screenshot%202014-06-15%2022.31.06.png
[2014-06-15 20:42:02 -0400] ordos: Does anyone recognize this error?
[2014-06-15 20:43:27 -0400] jbz: That looks like an Ubuntu issue:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-control-center/+bug/1264368
[2014-06-15 20:43:45 -0400] coderanger: ordos: Its a bug in things using glib
[2014-06-15 20:44:30 -0400] ordos: It's a headless server, and I'm only getting them when running Chef :s
[2014-06-15 20:46:39 -0400] ordos: Package 'gnome-control-center' is not installed, so not removed
[2014-06-15 20:47:44 -0400] jbz: What @coderanger saidit looks like a glib thing at base.  The gnome-c-c error happens because of the underlying issue...
[2014-06-15 20:47:46 -0400] coderanger: ordos: Its console-kit thats having issues
[2014-06-15 20:48:06 -0400] coderanger: read: if your packages are up to date, there is nothing you can do about it
[2014-06-15 20:48:30 -0400] ordos: Damn
[2014-06-15 20:48:41 -0400] jbz: "Although the problem is old, the message is new because GLib 2.40.0 introduced
[2014-06-15 20:48:41 -0400] jbz: the following change:
[2014-06-15 20:48:42 -0400] jbz:    - g_source_remove() will now throw a critical in the case that you
[2014-06-15 20:48:42 -0400] jbz:      try to remove a non-existent source.  We expect that there is some
[2014-06-15 20:48:43 -0400] jbz:      code in the wild that will fall afoul of this new critical but
[2014-06-15 20:48:43 -0400] jbz:      considering that we now reuse source IDs, this code is already
[2014-06-15 20:48:44 -0400] jbz:      broken and should probably be fixed. "
[2014-06-15 20:49:19 -0400] ordos: Is Chef using that?
[2014-06-15 20:49:33 -0400] ordos: Chef is stuck on "Starting Chef Client, version 11.12.8"
[2014-06-15 20:49:49 -0400] coderanger: ordos: console-kit is a core part of Linux
[2014-06-15 20:50:04 -0400] coderanger: It has nothing to do with Chef
[2014-06-15 21:36:30 -0400] mc_fail: hi guys, why i cant load any attributes saved to node with node.save via Chef::Node.load?
[2014-06-15 21:37:04 -0400] mc_fail: i can see any parameters except saved with node.save
[2014-06-15 21:38:47 -0400] mc_fail: can environment attributes be cause of this problem?
[2014-06-15 21:40:07 -0400] coderanger: mc_fail: What are you trying to do?
[2014-06-15 21:41:31 -0400] mc_fail: coderanger i have a chef recipie that creates a ssh keypair on one host and put pubkey to node attributes, and i have a another recipie to write that pubkey to another host
[2014-06-15 21:41:53 -0400] coderanger: Okay, please pastebin the code
[2014-06-15 21:43:25 -0400] mc_fail: part of recipe to save pubkey: http://pastebin.com/pzNZeZQS
[2014-06-15 21:44:06 -0400] coderanger: mc_fail: You generally don't want to call node.save from recipe code
[2014-06-15 21:44:17 -0400] coderanger: it will be done automatically for you if the run succeeds
[2014-06-15 21:45:10 -0400] mc_fail: part for loading pubkey on another one host: http://pastebin.com/9rdiTvEK
[2014-06-15 21:45:37 -0400] mc_fail: coderanger so, i just can comment a node.save?
[2014-06-15 21:46:15 -0400] coderanger: mc_fail: Yeah, that looks like it should be working, do you see the attribute set on the server?
[2014-06-15 21:46:42 -0400] mc_fail: anyway, i can see the this attribute in chef web-interface, but pp flf['tg-flf_pubkey'] returns nothing
[2014-06-15 21:46:58 -0400] mc_fail: coderanger yes, i can see it on the server
[2014-06-15 21:47:17 -0400] coderanger: Okay, any reason you are using node.load instead of search()?
[2014-06-15 21:47:49 -0400] mc_fail: coderanger just because i tried search before, and result is the same
[2014-06-15 21:48:37 -0400] coderanger: If you can see it via knife node edit, then search() should work fine
[2014-06-15 21:49:31 -0400] mc_fail: but i can: http://pastebin.com/f8XndtXF
[2014-06-15 21:49:50 -0400] mc_fail: anyway, let me try
[2014-06-15 21:50:23 -0400] coderanger: Yep, looks correct :)
[2014-06-15 21:52:25 -0400] mc_fail: actually, i have a lot of environment attributes for this host that starts on "tg-" too, may be it can be cause?
[2014-06-15 21:52:37 -0400] coderanger: No, they all get merged together
[2014-06-15 21:54:26 -0400] mc_fail: for surre, i've replaced a node.load with search: http://pastebin.com/Fs25iD19
[2014-06-15 21:54:34 -0400] mc_fail: (and add a hostname print)
[2014-06-15 21:55:04 -0400] mc_fail: so, it returns:
[2014-06-15 21:55:05 -0400] mc_fail: "srv30"
[2014-06-15 21:55:05 -0400] mc_fail: nil
[2014-06-15 21:55:59 -0400] mc_fail: may be i can use more dabug for it?
[2014-06-15 21:56:03 -0400] mc_fail: *debug
[2014-06-15 21:56:22 -0400] mc_fail: sorry for my ugly english)
[2014-06-15 21:57:50 -0400] mc_fail: actually, pp for entire search results shows all attributes except this one pubkey
[2014-06-15 21:59:57 -0400] mc_fail: any other ideas?
[2014-06-15 22:00:51 -0400] mc_fail: may be i should try to save it to databag?
[2014-06-15 22:01:17 -0400] coderanger: Hmm, that all looks correct
[2014-06-15 22:01:23 -0400] coderanger: Are you certain they are talking to the same chef server?
[2014-06-15 22:01:52 -0400] coderanger: Also try grabbing it by name
[2014-06-15 22:02:06 -0400] coderanger: search(:node, 'name:srv31.tg.local')
[2014-06-15 22:02:17 -0400] coderanger: You might be getting and old copy that isn't being updated
[2014-06-15 22:02:54 -0400] mc_fail: hmm, wait for a second...
[2014-06-15 22:03:05 -0400] mc_fail: i think it's a my stupid mistake
[2014-06-15 22:03:24 -0400] mc_fail: pp flf[hostname] should print "srv31"
[2014-06-15 22:04:05 -0400] coderanger: Heh, that would do it too
[2014-06-15 22:05:48 -0400] mc_fail: yeah, now it works fine.
[2014-06-15 22:06:18 -0400] mc_fail: sorry for disturb)
[2014-06-15 22:06:51 -0400] mc_fail: i've made a mistake in variable name
[2014-06-15 23:49:12 -0400] CloCkWeRX: struggling a bit with knife-solo, and passing in arguments to solo.rb - more or less trying to do environments by passing an ENVIRONMENT_NAME environment variable in; but it looks like solo.rb gets executed twice - the second time, having manipulated the environment variables entirely. Am I missing something obvious as to why it's run twice?
[2014-06-15 23:51:41 -0400] daxroc: Should / can a library cookbook set attributes ?
[2014-06-15 23:52:09 -0400] daxroc: Would it be considered an anti-pattern ?
[2014-06-15 23:54:31 -0400] coderanger: daxroc: Sure, most of mine do as defaults for resource attributes
