[2014-06-14 00:18:07 -0400] aslan: getting this error with chef deploy STDERR: fatal: Could not parse object '564c900fa281a9e0999ee6703c7d09e77940819f'. : 'Ran git fetch origin && git fetch origin --tags && git reset --hard 564c900fa281a9e0999ee6703c7d09e77940819f returned 128'
[2014-06-14 00:18:35 -0400] aslan: this is chef 11.14.0.alpha.4
[2014-06-14 00:18:43 -0400] aslan: any idea how i can fix this?
[2014-06-14 00:27:38 -0400] rsumiwork: im trying to access the apache node attribute default[apache2][dir] in my own cookbook. i keep getting this error undefined method `default' for Chef::Resource::Template
[2014-06-14 00:27:54 -0400] rsumiwork: anyone know how to resolve this?
[2014-06-14 00:28:20 -0400] aslan: i think the way to access that is through node object
[2014-06-14 00:28:30 -0400] coderanger: rsumiwork: Two things, you need to use the node object
[2014-06-14 00:28:38 -0400] aslan: try node['apache']['dir']
[2014-06-14 00:28:50 -0400] coderanger: rsumiwork: And you shouldn't access it directly in the template, pass it in using variables on the resource
[2014-06-14 00:29:09 -0400] coderanger: rsumiwork: variables apache_dir: node['apache']['dir']
[2014-06-14 00:29:19 -0400] coderanger: and then in the template <%= @apache_dir %>
[2014-06-14 00:29:49 -0400] aslan: coderanger: hi. got an interesting error that i have never seen in the past and it only happened after i upgraded my clients to chef 11.14.0.alpha.4
[2014-06-14 00:30:12 -0400] coderanger: aslan: step one, why the smeg would you run an alpha build
[2014-06-14 00:30:15 -0400] aslan: coderanger: this was an omnibus install and i didn't have any control over the version. just took the default
[2014-06-14 00:30:28 -0400] coderanger: No, the default is never to use a prerelease unless you set that up
[2014-06-14 00:30:37 -0400] coderanger: Or unless omnitruck is holycrap broken
[2014-06-14 00:30:42 -0400] coderanger: kallistec: ^^
[2014-06-14 00:31:03 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Regardless, thats an error from git, not chef
[2014-06-14 00:31:38 -0400] aslan: well all i did to install chef was curl -L https://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh | sudo bash
[2014-06-14 00:32:07 -0400] aslan: coderanger: older version of chef runs that fine. has the git provider changed recently ?
[2014-06-14 00:32:35 -0400] aslan: coderanger: by the way i am using ubuntu 14.04
[2014-06-14 00:33:10 -0400] coderanger: let me check the omnitruck output
[2014-06-14 00:33:16 -0400] coderanger: have I mentioned how much I hate this system?
[2014-06-14 00:33:49 -0400] aslan: coderanger: omnibus? seriously? I thought you were encouraging me to use omnibus
[2014-06-14 00:34:04 -0400] aslan: I was happy with the gem install. At least i had more control over the version
[2014-06-14 00:35:18 -0400] coderanger: aslan: No, omnitruck
[2014-06-14 00:35:52 -0400] coderanger: omnibus just makes the packages, omnitruck is the system opscode uses to distribute them and is rubbish, should be using platform native systems where they exist like apt and yum
[2014-06-14 00:35:53 -0400] aslan: hahaha.
[2014-06-14 00:36:09 -0400] coderanger: $ curl https://www.opscode.com/chef/metadata\?v\=\&prerelease\=\&nightlies\=\&p\=ubuntu\&pv\=14.04\&m\=x86\_64
[2014-06-14 00:36:10 -0400] coderanger: urlhttps://opscode-omnibus-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/ubuntu/13.04/x86_64/chef_11.12.8-2_amd64.deb
[2014-06-14 00:36:12 -0400] coderanger: So that looks correct
[2014-06-14 00:36:33 -0400] aslan: :/ why did i get an alpha build then
[2014-06-14 00:36:34 -0400] rsumiwork: thanks aslan and coderanger trying my build again :)
[2014-06-14 00:36:36 -0400] coderanger: You sure thats the exact command you ran?
[2014-06-14 00:36:48 -0400] aslan: 100% sure
[2014-06-14 00:37:40 -0400] aslan: i usually would not select an alpha build. but omnibus doesn't tell you what its going to install so i just ran it as i have typed it here
[2014-06-14 00:37:46 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Hmm, can you run the install.sh script again and pastebin the output? (it should be a no-op the second time)
[2014-06-14 00:37:58 -0400] aslan: k
[2014-06-14 00:38:08 -0400] coderanger: Mostly looking for the output of echo "Downloading Chef $version for ${platform}..."
[2014-06-14 00:38:18 -0400] coderanger: Also might help if you ran it with bash -x
[2014-06-14 00:39:51 -0400] aslan: coderanger: urlhttps://opscode-omnibus-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/ubuntu/13.04/x86_64/chef_11.12.8-2_amd64.deb
[2014-06-14 00:40:01 -0400] coderanger: sounds correct
[2014-06-14 00:40:53 -0400] aslan: crap. i just made an AMI based on that.
[2014-06-14 00:41:33 -0400] coderanger: Hmm?
[2014-06-14 00:41:36 -0400] aslan: coderanger: is there a way to uninstall and install chef
[2014-06-14 00:41:50 -0400] coderanger: aslan: apt-get remove chef
[2014-06-14 00:42:02 -0400] coderanger: just a normal package
[2014-06-14 00:42:03 -0400] aslan: coderanger: im saying my ec2 ami has the wrong version of chef then. the alpha build
[2014-06-14 00:42:07 -0400] coderanger: Ahh
[2014-06-14 00:43:05 -0400] JoshZ_: coderanger: your ssl cure solved my problem! thank you SSOOOOOOO much!
[2014-06-14 00:43:30 -0400] JoshZ_: if only I had asked 2 days ago!!! ;)
[2014-06-14 00:43:36 -0400] coderanger: JoshZ_: No problem
[2014-06-14 00:49:40 -0400] aslan: coderanger: i think i know how that alpha build got there.
[2014-06-14 00:50:18 -0400] aslan: i installed a airbreak-handler and i think it got in as a dependency.
[2014-06-14 00:50:33 -0400] aslan: so is that an issue if you are using the omnibus method?
[2014-06-14 00:50:37 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Did you do gem install --pre whatever
[2014-06-14 00:50:48 -0400] aslan: coderanger: no
[2014-06-14 00:51:08 -0400] coderanger: Hmm, rubygems won't install prereleases by default either unless no other versions exist
[2014-06-14 00:52:03 -0400] aslan: coderanger: thats my only guess
[2014-06-14 00:52:42 -0400] aslan: coderanger: in any case say i have installed chef using omnibus. that has its own gems and ruby version contained. so if i have a dependency like this would that create an issue ?
[2014-06-14 00:53:35 -0400] aslan: coderanger: i have a feeling this way i will get a mishmash of rubys and gems and it will be very hard to debug.
[2014-06-14 00:53:37 -0400] coderanger: aslan: I'm unfamiliar with that gem, but if you are trying to install a gem as an addon to chef you just need to make sure you install it into Chef's ruby
[2014-06-14 00:54:12 -0400] aslan: coderanger: but that is so deep under the hood. how do i do that?
[2014-06-14 00:54:30 -0400] coderanger: aslan: /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install whatever
[2014-06-14 00:54:51 -0400] coderanger: aslan: the embedded folder has all the internal packaged stuff, mostly just normal FHS inside there
[2014-06-14 00:55:21 -0400] aslan: coderanger: humm yeah i see everything is in /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1
[2014-06-14 00:55:29 -0400] aslan: my system ruby is 2.1
[2014-06-14 00:56:19 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Sure, but your system ruby is never involved in chef stuff
[2014-06-14 00:56:33 -0400] aslan: coderanger: now i am less interested in using omnibus.
[2014-06-14 00:57:09 -0400] aslan: coderanger: in any case that issue is fixed. however the git issue is still there
[2014-06-14 00:57:13 -0400] coderanger: aslan: There really isn't much of an option in the matter, omnibus is the only supported way to install it
[2014-06-14 00:57:38 -0400] aslan: coderanger: isn't chef always going to be available as a gem?
[2014-06-14 00:58:13 -0400] coderanger: aslan: It will be, but installing it like decreases the chance of others being able to help you
[2014-06-14 00:58:26 -0400] coderanger: Granted Opscode already doesn't do much community support, so I guess its all relative
[2014-06-14 00:58:57 -0400] jbz: aslan: You really want Chef installed with its own ruby environment.  Installing it as a gem means it lives in your existing Ruby setup, which can cause issues. Omnibus isolates it with its own ruby.
[2014-06-14 00:59:01 -0400] aslan: coderanger: that is an important thing to consider.
[2014-06-14 00:59:08 -0400] coderanger: There is a broad gray area between "possible" and "supported" :)
[2014-06-14 00:59:58 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Anyway, neither here nor there
[2014-06-14 01:00:07 -0400] aslan: jbz: i am just a little bit disheartened that my first attempt with omnibus has been a failure so far
[2014-06-14 01:00:08 -0400] coderanger: aslan: For the actual error, what happens if you run that command by hand?
[2014-06-14 01:00:23 -0400] coderanger: Also what is the recipe code for that git resource
[2014-06-14 01:00:32 -0400] jbz: aslan: apologies, just read backscroll.
[2014-06-14 01:01:03 -0400] aslan: coderanger: i get the same error
[2014-06-14 01:01:19 -0400] aslan: its so strange that i am getting this for the first time
[2014-06-14 01:01:34 -0400] aslan: had never had this issue with github or git provider in the past
[2014-06-14 01:02:07 -0400] aslan: coderanger: before going any further i think i need to do a clean install and start over again.
[2014-06-14 01:02:17 -0400] coderanger: aslan: I don't think this has much to do with chef
[2014-06-14 01:02:26 -0400] coderanger: Guessing that commit hash isn't an object in your git repo
[2014-06-14 01:03:12 -0400] aslan: coderanger: i hope so. the thing is my older ami which has chef 11.6 is running fine
[2014-06-14 01:03:45 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Can you pastebin the recipe code for this section
[2014-06-14 01:04:08 -0400] aslan: sure
[2014-06-14 01:08:29 -0400] aslan: coderanger: https://gist.github.com/Aslan/bf1c64bcbdd0aef53b15
[2014-06-14 01:08:53 -0400] coderanger: aslan: What is rev set to
[2014-06-14 01:09:10 -0400] stormerider: is there an equivalent of knife bootstrap's --use-sudo-password for knife ssh?
[2014-06-14 01:09:26 -0400] aslan: rev = (node[:rails_env] == "production") ? "master" : "develop"
[2014-06-14 01:13:12 -0400] aslan: coderanger: kinda like this http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2013-07/msg00334.html
[2014-06-14 01:21:42 -0400] aslan: coderanger: do you see any problem in the recipe?
[2014-06-14 01:22:03 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Nope, it looks fine, guessing something broke in the git resource somewhere
[2014-06-14 01:22:14 -0400] coderanger: aslan: What is the commit hash for the branch it should be deploying?
[2014-06-14 01:22:31 -0400] aslan: let me check github
[2014-06-14 01:22:39 -0400] aslan: the branch is develop
[2014-06-14 01:23:05 -0400] coderanger: aslan: You can show all local heads with `git show-ref`
[2014-06-14 01:23:20 -0400] coderanger: refs/heads/develop should be the one you want
[2014-06-14 01:24:10 -0400] aslan: i only see master and tags i dont see the develop branch :/
[2014-06-14 01:24:42 -0400] coderanger: Try git ls-remote
[2014-06-14 01:25:30 -0400] aslan: its somewhat different https://gist.github.com/Aslan/bf1c64bcbdd0aef53b15
[2014-06-14 01:25:49 -0400] aslan: the first comment is local the second comment is remote
[2014-06-14 01:26:57 -0400] aslan: coderanger: as you can see the second one has the develop branch in it
[2014-06-14 01:26:58 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Okay, so the commit hash being passed to git reset is correct
[2014-06-14 01:27:04 -0400] coderanger: or at least it matches the branch
[2014-06-14 01:27:12 -0400] coderanger: What version of git do you have installed?
[2014-06-14 01:27:21 -0400] aslan: yeah but i am guessing that whole branch is missing from local
[2014-06-14 01:27:24 -0400] coderanger: If you have 2.0, maybe they changed something there?
[2014-06-14 01:27:49 -0400] coderanger: aslan: the git resource doesn't actually use local branches the same way you would normally
[2014-06-14 01:27:51 -0400] aslan: git version 1.9.1
[2014-06-14 01:28:00 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Hmm, compare that to the servers that are working?
[2014-06-14 01:28:19 -0400] aslan: that one is git version 1.7.9.5
[2014-06-14 01:28:32 -0400] coderanger: Okay, so that sounds like the source of the issue at least :)
[2014-06-14 01:28:38 -0400] coderanger: The next question is "why is it broken"
[2014-06-14 01:28:41 -0400] aslan: it does
[2014-06-14 01:28:55 -0400] aslan: the older one is on ubuntu 12.04
[2014-06-14 01:29:00 -0400] aslan: the new one is on ubuntu 14.04
[2014-06-14 01:29:55 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, but something must have changed in the behavior of git
[2014-06-14 01:29:57 -0400] aslan: i am guessing the provider needs to take into consideration that which version of git is running and adjust accordingly
[2014-06-14 01:29:58 -0400] coderanger: on the new one
[2014-06-14 01:30:07 -0400] aslan: coderanger: i think you are right
[2014-06-14 01:30:10 -0400] coderanger: what do you get if you run `git show 564c900fa281a9e0999ee6703c7d09e77940819f`
[2014-06-14 01:30:22 -0400] coderanger: That should display the commit object for that hash
[2014-06-14 01:31:08 -0400] aslan: coderanger: commit 564c900fa281a9e0999ee6703c7d09e77940819f\n Author ....
[2014-06-14 01:31:15 -0400] coderanger: Okay, so it definitely exists
[2014-06-14 01:31:33 -0400] aslan: coderanger: oops sorry
[2014-06-14 01:31:35 -0400] coderanger: I've lost the scrollback, what was the command chef is trying to run again?
[2014-06-14 01:31:39 -0400] aslan: that was the working version
[2014-06-14 01:31:46 -0400] aslan: this is what i get on the broken one fatal: bad object 564c900fa281a9e0999ee6703c7d09e77940819f
[2014-06-14 01:31:54 -0400] coderanger: Okay, so thats consistent at least
[2014-06-14 01:32:02 -0400] coderanger: try running git fetch
[2014-06-14 01:32:11 -0400] coderanger: does it show a successful sync with the origin?
[2014-06-14 01:32:13 -0400] aslan: git fetch origin && git fetch origin --tags && git reset --hard 564c900fa281a9e0999ee6703c7d09e77940819f returned 128'
[2014-06-14 01:32:29 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, so do those first two commands work :)
[2014-06-14 01:32:48 -0400] aslan: they dont have any output
[2014-06-14 01:32:53 -0400] aslan: they exit with nothing
[2014-06-14 01:32:55 -0400] aslan: no message
[2014-06-14 01:33:02 -0400] aslan: if i put a -v i get this
[2014-06-14 01:33:04 -0400] coderanger: I mean I assume they must because the initial clone worked
[2014-06-14 01:33:20 -0400] aslan: From github.com:xxxxx/rtb_exchange
[2014-06-14 01:33:20 -0400] aslan:  = [up to date]      master     -> origin/master
[2014-06-14 01:33:35 -0400] aslan: i think the issue is git fetch
[2014-06-14 01:33:46 -0400] coderanger: No, that sounds correct
[2014-06-14 01:33:51 -0400] gasfads: hello
[2014-06-14 01:33:54 -0400] coderanger: it normally displays nothing unless it has to sync commits
[2014-06-14 01:34:01 -0400] aslan: its not able to fetch everything so that is why it can't find 564c900fa281a9e0999ee6703c7d09e77940819f
[2014-06-14 01:34:10 -0400] aslan: coderanger: oh ok
[2014-06-14 01:34:30 -0400] gasfads: is there a way add environment variables to a command in an execute block?
[2014-06-14 01:34:40 -0400] coderanger: aslan: The question is why is it not syncing everything, trying to remember if there is some flag for this
[2014-06-14 01:34:58 -0400] coderanger: gasfads: yep, there is a resource attribute "environment"
[2014-06-14 01:35:47 -0400] coderanger: aslan: I'm still on 1.8 locally, let me see what changed in 1.9
[2014-06-14 01:36:05 -0400] aslan: coderanger: ok
[2014-06-14 01:38:03 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Nothing jumps out as causing this, git should be downloading all remote commits, thats the whole point of how git works :-/
[2014-06-14 01:38:33 -0400] coderanger: aslan: what do you see for `git branch -r`
[2014-06-14 01:38:37 -0400] coderanger: (on the broken side)
[2014-06-14 01:38:53 -0400] aslan: coderanger: only master
[2014-06-14 01:39:10 -0400] aslan:  origin/HEAD -> origin/master
[2014-06-14 01:39:11 -0400] aslan:   origin/master
[2014-06-14 01:39:17 -0400] coderanger: aslan: okay, thats definitely not right
[2014-06-14 01:39:27 -0400] coderanger: aslan: since ls-remote clearly saw other remote branches
[2014-06-14 01:39:42 -0400] aslan: coderanger: could it be this is a broken git binary
[2014-06-14 01:40:00 -0400] coderanger: Unlikely, ubuntu probably would have noticed
[2014-06-14 01:40:13 -0400] aslan: coderanger: this is very strange
[2014-06-14 01:40:31 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Can you just go into another folder on the box
[2014-06-14 01:40:38 -0400] coderanger: and try doing a git clone from scratch
[2014-06-14 01:40:58 -0400] coderanger: brb sick dog needs hugs
[2014-06-14 01:41:08 -0400] junk: hi
[2014-06-14 01:41:29 -0400] junk: so, i just updated the SSL certs on a chef-server and now i can upload cookbooks
[2014-06-14 01:42:29 -0400] aslan: coderanger: i got everything doing that
[2014-06-14 01:42:30 -0400] junk: erchef is giving me some issues with "certificate unknown"
[2014-06-14 01:42:52 -0400] junk: and chef-server responds with a 500 Internel Server Error
[2014-06-14 01:43:06 -0400] junk: apparently i'm not unique: https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-5144
[2014-06-14 01:43:28 -0400] junk: reads are fine.  uploads of new/changed cookbooks break
[2014-06-14 01:43:34 -0400] junk: anyone have any experience with that?
[2014-06-14 01:44:59 -0400] junk: chef-server-ctl fails 5 tests
[2014-06-14 01:46:27 -0400] junk: openssl cli says the cert is fine
[2014-06-14 01:46:38 -0400] junk: dunno what erchef wants
[2014-06-14 01:49:46 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Okay, let me go look at how chef does the clone
[2014-06-14 01:49:52 -0400] coderanger: junk: Is it self-signed?
[2014-06-14 01:50:08 -0400] junk: nope
[2014-06-14 01:50:10 -0400] junk: comodo
[2014-06-14 01:50:12 -0400] junk: chained
[2014-06-14 01:50:35 -0400] aslan: coderanger: thanks
[2014-06-14 01:52:12 -0400] coderanger: junk: Does the system have the CA for it? I don't actually know how erlang does that but I would guess it uses /etc/ssl/certs
[2014-06-14 01:52:33 -0400] junk: for what it's worth: chef-server-11.0.12-1.el6.x86_64
[2014-06-14 01:52:58 -0400] junk: crap.  they actually did just change their root cert
[2014-06-14 01:53:29 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Oh derp, you have shallow_clone true
[2014-06-14 01:53:32 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Don't do that :)
[2014-06-14 01:53:55 -0400] aslan: coderanger: thats it?
[2014-06-14 01:54:02 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Probably
[2014-06-14 01:54:10 -0400] aslan: coderanger: lol. ok
[2014-06-14 01:54:28 -0400] aslan: i will try that. but i have to leave office. the cleaning crew is here.
[2014-06-14 01:54:34 -0400] coderanger: aslan: Would have to fully trace the code, but I bet that turns in to --depth=0 on the clone
[2014-06-14 01:54:39 -0400] aslan: coderanger: thanks a lot for all the help
[2014-06-14 01:54:40 -0400] coderanger: which would indeed not sync most commits
[2014-06-14 01:54:57 -0400] aslan: coderanger: totally makes sense.
[2014-06-14 01:55:11 -0400] coderanger: junk: I would be you can just dump it in the certs folder and all will be well
[2014-06-14 01:55:19 -0400] aslan: thanks man :)
[2014-06-14 01:55:28 -0400] junk: as much as i love linux... i hate it sometimes...
[2014-06-14 01:55:58 -0400] junk: i think i have to actually add it to the ca-bundle.crt
[2014-06-14 01:56:02 -0400] coderanger: junk: I think the blame for this one goes on TLS being a file of fail
[2014-06-14 01:56:22 -0400] coderanger: PKI: Not Even Once
[2014-06-14 01:56:48 -0400] junk: well, yeah but if i were a windows/OSX guy, i could double click a crt file and the OS would happily ask me if i wanted to blindly trust it
[2014-06-14 02:04:09 -0400] coderanger: junk: You'll probably need to do the same on the clients too
[2014-06-14 02:05:13 -0400] junk: curl to the rescue: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/curl/master/lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl
[2014-06-14 02:05:28 -0400] junk: recreats the ca-bundle.crt file from mozilla source
[2014-06-14 02:06:09 -0400] junk: now to see if it works
[2014-06-14 02:07:26 -0400] coderanger: junk: You can just use their compiled one directly
[2014-06-14 02:07:40 -0400] coderanger: http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem
[2014-06-14 02:09:29 -0400] junk: my only issue with that is that i like to err on the side of paranoid
[2014-06-14 02:09:49 -0400] junk: since this is a business thing, i'd prefer to go directly to the source of truth
[2014-06-14 02:10:13 -0400] junk: that's actually what i found first, which led me to the curl github repo and the mozilla sources
[2014-06-14 02:10:21 -0400] junk: still did not fix the problem
[2014-06-14 02:11:42 -0400] junk: re: clients - that's a good point.  on dev machines, root CAs get updated "often"
[2014-06-14 02:11:46 -0400] junk: but systems don't
[2014-06-14 02:45:04 -0400] junk`: apparently someone wanted their nick back
[2014-06-14 02:54:18 -0400] junk`: looks like my cert problem is probably an issue with erlang
[2014-06-14 04:23:18 -0400] junk`: for the life of me, i cannot figure out how to make erlang take the new cert chaing
[2014-06-14 04:23:19 -0400] junk`: chain
[2014-06-14 12:56:20 -0400] mc_fail: hi guys
[2014-06-14 12:56:50 -0400] mc_fail: is it possible to append some hode attributes to array
[2014-06-14 12:57:39 -0400] mc_fail: for example, i have a array in node attributes, and i need to append to it in each start
[2014-06-14 12:59:27 -0400] mc_fail: or may be if i have a array in recipie, can i append somewhat to this array from template?
[2014-06-14 13:28:45 -0400] mc_fail: or may be i can somehow pass data between two recipies?
[2014-06-14 17:10:13 -0400] mc_fail: how i can create a gorup in chef if it ONLY doesn't exist
[2014-06-14 17:21:07 -0400] jbz: mc_fail The group resource should not recreate the group if it's already there, so you shouldn't need to worry about that.
[2014-06-14 17:45:29 -0400] korishev: Hello all!  Im trying to get a very simple chef-metal vagrant box running, and Im having trouble.  I keep getting errors about insufficient permission to create /etc/chef/ohai_plugins, which I at first thought were in the vagrant box, but after digging some more, chef appears to be trying to create that dir on my OSX laptop.  Is that normal?
[2014-06-14 18:01:49 -0400] bean:  korishev do you have "require 'chef_metal_vagrant'" in one of your files?
[2014-06-14 18:02:05 -0400] bean: or are you running examples?
[2014-06-14 18:02:27 -0400] korishev: bean: yes, it looks like I had a borked knife.rb file.  I just got past the original error, thanks
