[2014-06-21 00:01:23 -0400] shlant: anyone using runit?
[2014-06-21 00:01:35 -0400] shlant: it doesn't seem to be logging
[2014-06-21 00:44:48 -0400] sam___: @all is there a way to override package resource code? I have a community cookbook which has a package resource in one of the recipes but it doesnt do what I would like to do. I would like to use that recipe and override only that package resource without forking it.
[2014-06-21 00:49:02 -0400] jbz: sam___: I would check to see if this solves your problem, although I don't know if it's current: https://github.com/bryanwb/chef-rewind
[2014-06-21 00:49:13 -0400] jbz: (that's what I used last time I had that problem, but it was a while ago)
[2014-06-21 00:49:38 -0400] upsell5: Hi, Im using https://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh, where is /bin/berks now?
[2014-06-21 00:50:59 -0400] cheeseplus: upsell5: that wouldn't install berks
[2014-06-21 00:51:45 -0400] upsell5: cheeseplus: yes your right, i missed a step my bad thanks.
[2014-06-21 00:52:33 -0400] sam___: jbz: thanks for the quick response. does this mean I need to have that gems installed on all my chef clients?
[2014-06-21 01:11:59 -0400] darkside_: sam___: yes, chef_gem will install it
[2014-06-21 01:12:19 -0400] darkside_: did you look at the usage examples?
[2014-06-21 01:15:02 -0400] sam___: darkside_: I did look at the usage page but at the start, it had installation isntructions saying install using gem
[2014-06-21 01:15:09 -0400] sam___: $ gem install chef-rewind
[2014-06-21 01:15:50 -0400] sam___: which confuses me. if chef-gem is going to install the needed rewind, why is that first step needed at all?
[2014-06-21 01:16:40 -0400] darkside_: that would be an example for a specific application usage
[2014-06-21 01:21:16 -0400] sam___: darkside_: chef_gem wil be getting that rewind from internet but apps wont have access to internet
[2014-06-21 01:21:21 -0400] sam___: chef_gem[chef-rewind] action install [2014-06-20T18:19:54-07:00] WARN:  failed to find gem chef-rewind (>= 0) from [http://rubygems.org/]
[2014-06-21 01:21:30 -0400] darkside_: yea, it is a problem i have too
[2014-06-21 01:21:45 -0400] sam___: is there a way to pass a proxy ?
[2014-06-21 01:22:23 -0400] sam___: or can we download the gem and keep it in local repo?
[2014-06-21 01:24:29 -0400] darkside_: probably
[2014-06-21 01:24:59 -0400] darkside_: i haven't done that yet, so i'd have to refer to the google
[2014-06-21 01:25:57 -0400] sam___: ok. would need a way to pass a proxy
[2014-06-21 01:26:02 -0400] sam___: to chef_gem
[2014-06-21 01:26:12 -0400] sam___: couldnt find this anywhere on my chef installation
[2014-06-21 01:26:15 -0400] sam___: do you know where it is?
[2014-06-21 01:27:06 -0400] darkside_: like i said, i'd have to google it. eg. http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2013-05/msg00517.html
[2014-06-21 01:30:14 -0400] sam___: darkside_: kool. worked
[2014-06-21 01:31:09 -0400] sam___: darkside_: do you have any example of rewinding package resource with attribute --> rewind "package[node['java']['oracle_rpm']['type']]"  do    --> does this look correct?
[2014-06-21 01:31:37 -0400] sam___: :(
[2014-06-21 01:35:34 -0400] darkside_: i don't have an example
[2014-06-21 05:20:10 -0400] drewvanstone: exit
[2014-06-21 06:40:56 -0400] gauravarora: weird, i can ssh into my ec2 instace as root but can't get in through knife bootstrap
[2014-06-21 06:41:00 -0400] gauravarora: anyone seen this?
[2014-06-21 16:04:50 -0400] gauravarora: how do i set attributes on a node from a recipe?
[2014-06-21 22:52:00 -0400] darkside_: anyone an expert on chef-rewind in here?
[2014-06-21 23:26:05 -0400] darkside_: alright, what am I doing wrong with chef-rewind? http://git.io/9kt8Ng
