[2014-02-22 00:05:25 -0500] awc737: the stupid mysql service doesn't start
[2014-02-22 00:14:01 -0500] awc737: what is the diferrence between action :start and action :enable
[2014-02-22 00:14:25 -0500] viglesia1: in EL think: service blah start == start
[2014-02-22 00:14:35 -0500] viglesia1: chkconfig blah on == enable
[2014-02-22 00:20:40 -0500] awc737: EL?
[2014-02-22 00:20:48 -0500] awc737: enterprise
[2014-02-22 00:21:21 -0500] awc737: It works after vagrant up, but breaks after any vagrant reload
[2014-02-22 00:21:32 -0500] viglesia1: enterprise linux == RHEL and CentOS and such
[2014-02-22 00:22:46 -0500] awc737: ya
[2014-02-22 00:23:49 -0500] jwuenschel: awc737: Start means start now, enable means start on boot
[2014-02-22 00:25:04 -0500] jwuenschel: so you probably want something like: action [ :enable, :start ]
[2014-02-22 00:25:16 -0500] awc737: well, with enable... it should start on vagrant reload, no?
[2014-02-22 00:25:52 -0500] jwuenschel: yep, it should
[2014-02-22 00:26:03 -0500] awc737: :/ it's being a butt
[2014-02-22 00:26:34 -0500] jwuenschel: :(
[2014-02-22 00:26:36 -0500] jwuenschel: what os?
[2014-02-22 00:26:42 -0500] awc737: Ubuntu
[2014-02-22 00:26:55 -0500] awc737: I did a destroy / up, I think i'll stop messing with it for a bit
[2014-02-22 00:27:25 -0500] jwuenschel: which ubuntu version is it?
[2014-02-22 00:31:38 -0500] awc737: 12.04
[2014-02-22 01:10:29 -0500] viglesia1: can i reference resources inside a ruby block
[2014-02-22 01:30:55 -0500] coderanger: viglesia1: What do you mean?
[2014-02-22 01:32:56 -0500] viglesia1: so if i am in a ruby block, can i create a file resource in there?
[2014-02-22 01:33:08 -0500] coderanger: viglesia1: Not via the recipe DSL if thats what you mean
[2014-02-22 01:33:15 -0500] viglesia1: yep
[2014-02-22 01:33:16 -0500] viglesia1: kk
[2014-02-22 01:33:33 -0500] coderanger: You can manually create a Chef::Resource::File object though
[2014-02-22 01:33:34 -0500] coderanger: :)
[2014-02-22 01:33:47 -0500] viglesia1: ah i c
[2014-02-22 01:33:47 -0500] coderanger: but if you want to use the recipe DSL, an LWRP is probably what you want
[2014-02-22 01:34:14 -0500] viglesia1: so my issue right now is that im trying to setup info in a recipe, then use that info in another
[2014-02-22 01:34:42 -0500] coderanger: What kind of info?
[2014-02-22 01:34:44 -0500] viglesia1: but the recipes should be able to run on the same node and different nodes
[2014-02-22 01:34:47 -0500] viglesia1: its a key
[2014-02-22 01:34:56 -0500] viglesia1: that is generated at run time
[2014-02-22 01:35:14 -0500] viglesia1: so component A: comes, up and generates the keyu
[2014-02-22 01:35:39 -0500] viglesia1: then component b: needs to grab that key from component A (which could be locally but not necessarily)
[2014-02-22 01:35:58 -0500] coderanger: ahh, sec
[2014-02-22 01:35:59 -0500] viglesia1: so i am adding the key to a node attribute
[2014-02-22 01:36:12 -0500] viglesia1: then trying to grab it from the second recipe, but flailing a bit
[2014-02-22 01:38:03 -0500] coderanger: viglesia1: https://github.com/python/psf-chef/blob/master/cookbooks/rsnapshot/providers/server.rb#L50-L60 and https://github.com/python/psf-chef/blob/master/cookbooks/rsnapshot/providers/client.rb#L35
[2014-02-22 01:38:11 -0500] coderanger: (scroll way right on the second link)
[2014-02-22 01:39:24 -0500] coderanger: basically the server sets a node attr, the client looks up that attr
[2014-02-22 01:39:25 -0500] viglesia1: i think this is exactly it, is ssh key sync a prerequisite, or is that exactly what the first like does?
[2014-02-22 01:39:38 -0500] viglesia1: /like/link/
[2014-02-22 01:40:12 -0500] coderanger: Yes, you have to run chef on the server first or the client will error out
[2014-02-22 01:41:04 -0500] viglesia1: ack but that would just mean A) ordering in a run_list (for same box), B) Ordering of provisioning if they are different
[2014-02-22 01:41:33 -0500] viglesia1: yeah i have pretty much that right now i think
[2014-02-22 01:41:38 -0500] viglesia1: maybe there is something i am missing
[2014-02-22 01:41:41 -0500] viglesia1: one sec
[2014-02-22 01:42:26 -0500] viglesia1: so my server runs this: http://www.fpaste.org/79414/93033333/
[2014-02-22 01:43:06 -0500] viglesia1: then on the client i run something like this: http://www.fpaste.org/79415/13930333/
[2014-02-22 01:43:35 -0500] viglesia1: ah node.set is different
[2014-02-22 01:43:49 -0500] coderanger: Yes, node.override isn't persistent in the same way
[2014-02-22 01:44:00 -0500] coderanger: and yeah, you can dramatically simplify that btw
[2014-02-22 01:44:10 -0500] coderanger: Like you don't need to shell out to cat to read a file :-)
[2014-02-22 01:44:20 -0500] viglesia1: hahahaha my hackery has been exposed!!!!!!!
[2014-02-22 01:45:10 -0500] coderanger: You also don't need the base64, it should work fine with binary data in node attrs, if a bit weird
[2014-02-22 01:45:21 -0500] coderanger: but base64ing doesn't hurt :)
[2014-02-22 01:51:49 -0500] viglesia1: coderanger: ack thank you so much for the help sir
[2014-02-22 03:28:53 -0500] davidcollom: is there a way that I can set a role to all new nodes?
[2014-02-22 03:39:24 -0500] tcotav: you'll have to define "new" programmatically
[2014-02-22 03:39:46 -0500] tcotav: if  you haven't created them yet, you can just set a variable for all "new" nodes
[2014-02-22 03:39:58 -0500] tcotav: and at the same time set the role
[2014-02-22 03:40:21 -0500] tcotav: or, shy of that, do a search and set role for everything that matches variable
[2014-02-22 03:40:28 -0500] davidcollom: ok any way of forcing a default role?
[2014-02-22 03:41:10 -0500] tcotav: well, you define the node creation so you could set it in the runlist
[2014-02-22 03:41:11 -0500] davidcollom: or having a global role
[2014-02-22 03:42:35 -0500] tcotav: in the node creation, you could set runlist = [ "role[superduper]" ]
[2014-02-22 03:47:43 -0500] tcotav: basically, you're going to define how all NEW nodes are created just by changing the base client.rb for each NEW host
[2014-02-22 03:48:40 -0500] tcotav: (I'm floating in cocktails and watching a movie so anyone else please correct me if that's horrible advice....)
[2014-02-22 03:58:55 -0500] atomic-penguin: Maybe environment run lists in _default, although not really what environments are meant for, I suppose
[2014-02-22 04:12:17 -0500] davidcollom: atomic-penguin: how would I go about doing that? I basically just want to ensure that a base run list is added to all nodes
[2014-02-22 04:14:42 -0500] davidcollom: ah.. The '_default' environment cannot be edited.
[2014-02-22 04:16:21 -0500] atomic-penguin: doh, yup, obviously I've never tried it haha
[2014-02-22 04:16:28 -0500] tcotav: again, you define how a node is created.  add whatever role as part of that creation
[2014-02-22 05:16:28 -0500] holms: maybe anybody knows how to use vagrant with chef-solo, with multiple-vms?
[2014-02-22 05:16:40 -0500] holms: http://pastie.org/8757544
[2014-02-22 05:47:27 -0500] coderanger: holms: web.vm.provision :chef_solo ....
[2014-02-22 06:14:04 -0500] brucelee_: coderanger: you there?
[2014-02-22 06:14:21 -0500] coderanger: Yahr
[2014-02-22 06:14:50 -0500] brucelee_: :P
[2014-02-22 06:14:54 -0500] brucelee_: what are you up to?
[2014-02-22 06:14:59 -0500] brucelee_: want to meet up and do some chef :)
[2014-02-22 06:15:14 -0500] coderanger: Bit late and I don't actually live in SF
[2014-02-22 06:15:18 -0500] brucelee_: ah thats right
[2014-02-22 06:15:20 -0500] brucelee_: east bay
[2014-02-22 06:15:30 -0500] coderanger: Yeah, out past oakland
[2014-02-22 06:15:38 -0500] brucelee_: coderanger: i went to the chef cafe the other day, lots of helpful people
[2014-02-22 06:15:58 -0500] coderanger: Its a good group, I usually try to make it to them but it overlapped with SFPython
[2014-02-22 06:16:05 -0500] brucelee_: with my company planning this entire migration to aws from the datacenter, i was wondering whether its more efficient to scale vertically, or horizontally
[2014-02-22 06:16:57 -0500] brucelee_: i met one guy who basically showed me some of his recipes and how he structures out his chef
[2014-02-22 06:17:01 -0500] brucelee_: exactly what you were saying
[2014-02-22 06:17:06 -0500] brucelee_: instead of using the entire chef-repo model
[2014-02-22 06:17:19 -0500] brucelee_: just dump that, and use an entire different repo for each cookbook
[2014-02-22 06:17:44 -0500] coderanger: Indeed
[2014-02-22 06:17:50 -0500] brucelee_: i think his reasoning was you get way more visibility to the diffs of the repo, versus having all cookbooks in one
[2014-02-22 06:17:59 -0500] brucelee_: you get spammed with all the changes for every cookbook
[2014-02-22 06:18:02 -0500] brucelee_: sometimes cookbooks you dont care about
[2014-02-22 06:19:07 -0500] coderanger: Thats probably the least important reasons but its in there
[2014-02-22 06:19:53 -0500] brucelee_: coderanger: i guess its just easier to manage that way?
[2014-02-22 06:20:04 -0500] brucelee_: what are your biggest reasons for doing so
[2014-02-22 06:20:18 -0500] coderanger: tags that matter, isolation for releases, etc
[2014-02-22 06:24:48 -0500] brucelee_: ah
[2014-02-22 06:25:01 -0500] brucelee_: not sure what that means, you mean like git tags?
[2014-02-22 06:25:06 -0500] brucelee_: what are tags?
