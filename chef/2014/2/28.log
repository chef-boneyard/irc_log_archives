[2014-02-28 00:00:08 -0500] coderanger: methods: Other than just setting it globally, not really. If you set a proxy in the chef config it should set the env vars for you I think
[2014-02-28 00:00:14 -0500] coderanger: or maybe vice versa
[2014-02-28 00:01:34 -0500] methods: in my case i need specific proxy just for gem
[2014-02-28 00:01:48 -0500] methods: i can't have it set globally
[2014-02-28 00:01:54 -0500] coderanger: Ahh, then yeah, thats probably your best bet
[2014-02-28 00:05:23 -0500] methods: i think this problem is really presenting it self after omnibus since with string options it defaults back down to `gem` in PATH
[2014-02-28 00:05:55 -0500] methods: I'd rather pass a hash of options but http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/rubygems-update/Gem/DependencyInstaller.html doesn't accept all possible options
[2014-02-28 00:07:06 -0500] methods: that's another point too that chef_gem wasn't correctly using `gem` from omnibus but instead whatever was in PATH
[2014-02-28 00:08:45 -0500] coderanger: methods: Thats just because chef_gem is a subclass of gem_package and so gets all its behaviors too
[2014-02-28 00:09:14 -0500] coderanger: methods: chef_gem is supposed to run in-process for most cases to ensure everything lines up
[2014-02-28 00:12:12 -0500] methods: coderanger:  I just think in this case we should override it and make it figure out the proper omnibus binary to use
[2014-02-28 00:12:42 -0500] coderanger: methods: Remember chef does still support running as non-omnibus, kinda sorta
[2014-02-28 00:12:51 -0500] methods: that's fine
[2014-02-28 00:12:52 -0500] methods: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/provider/package/rubygems.rb#L377
[2014-02-28 00:12:53 -0500] methods: see that line
[2014-02-28 00:13:05 -0500] methods: or better yet https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/provider/package/rubygems.rb#L396
[2014-02-28 00:28:22 -0500] coderanger: someara: Trololol (re: chef-metal)
[2014-02-28 00:29:21 -0500] someara: haha you read the mailing list
[2014-02-28 00:29:35 -0500] coderanger: someara: Yes, just saying that was #1 on my list :)
[2014-02-28 00:32:00 -0500] someara: oh. derp
[2014-02-28 00:32:07 -0500] someara: gmail threading. whats up.
[2014-02-28 00:47:35 -0500] viglesias: at what periodicity does chef-client run by default? additionally how can that be set?
[2014-02-28 00:49:06 -0500] coderanger: viglesias: By default? None
[2014-02-28 00:49:18 -0500] coderanger: viglesias: If you just run chef-client, it does a single converge and then exits
[2014-02-28 00:49:44 -0500] viglesias: coderanger: ack, is there a cheffy way to get it to run periodically or should i just be running it in crontab or the like
[2014-02-28 00:50:01 -0500] coderanger: viglesias: the chef-client cookbook has many options :-)
[2014-02-28 00:50:11 -0500] coderanger: init scripts, upstart, runit, cron etc
[2014-02-28 00:50:24 -0500] coderanger: I think the default in that cookbook is a 30m interval
[2014-02-28 00:56:10 -0500] flaccid: and remember, you are not a devops engineer http://www.virtualizationpractice.com/devops-engineer-25120/
[2014-02-28 00:57:10 -0500] coalbe: mind the silo.
[2014-02-28 01:05:45 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: https://github.com/poise/application_ruby still says you can use chef 10 in readme
[2014-02-28 01:06:22 -0500] coderanger: Look again :)
[2014-02-28 01:06:56 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: lol
[2014-02-28 01:07:24 -0500] flaccid: if thats not agile, i don't know what is!
[2014-02-28 01:15:36 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: which version of application cookbook is latest to work with chef 10?
[2014-02-28 01:15:46 -0500] flaccid: oh i see in readme
[2014-02-28 01:18:12 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: https://github.com/poise/application_ruby/blob/v2.2.0/metadata.rb depends "application", "~> 4.0" but 4 drops 10 support hmm
[2014-02-28 01:18:27 -0500] flaccid: 2.1.4 seems ok
[2014-02-28 01:55:20 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: should poise-ruby work ok with application_ruby ? i get passenger-install-apache2-module: not found from execute[passenger_module] sh(passenger-install-apache2-module --auto)
[2014-02-28 01:55:49 -0500] coderanger: flaccid: How did you install passenger
[2014-02-28 01:56:33 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: perhaps i didn't, is that a pre-req?
[2014-02-28 01:57:13 -0500] coderanger: flaccid: It uses the passenger_apache2 cookbook
[2014-02-28 01:57:26 -0500] coderanger: In which you would have to set the path to the ruby bin
[2014-02-28 01:57:35 -0500] coderanger: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/passenger_apache2#attributes
[2014-02-28 02:01:21 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: kk thanks, i'll have a little jiggle
[2014-02-28 02:03:58 -0500] h2odysee_: is there a way to run chef-client to just run a specific recipe, not all of them?
[2014-02-28 02:05:41 -0500] coderanger: h2odysee_: chef-client -o
[2014-02-28 02:22:58 -0500] h2odysee_: what does "action :nothing" do? I have a script in a recipe failing to run because of that line.
[2014-02-28 02:23:10 -0500] coderanger: h2odysee_: As the name implies, nothing :)
[2014-02-28 02:23:27 -0500] coderanger: It means the resource should exist but take no convergence action
[2014-02-28 02:24:35 -0500] h2odysee_: so it's like "return" in other languages?
[2014-02-28 02:24:47 -0500] h2odysee_: i wonder why this is here. it needs to converge.
[2014-02-28 02:24:55 -0500] someara_: mmmm proper usage of the word convergence
[2014-02-28 02:25:05 -0500] jbz: h2odysee_ Generally that gets put there so that the resource can be triggered at a specific time/instance using :notify or :subscribe, but won't trigger by itself.
[2014-02-28 02:25:54 -0500] h2odysee_: it's run by a "notifies :run" elsewhere
[2014-02-28 02:26:10 -0500] jbz: yep.
[2014-02-28 02:26:47 -0500] jbz: The notifies :run overrides the action :nothing when it calls the resource.
[2014-02-28 02:27:06 -0500] h2odysee_: but if i'm reading the log right, that still doesn't run, due to the "action :nothing"
[2014-02-28 02:27:13 -0500] jbz: no
[2014-02-28 02:27:33 -0500] jbz: what's likely happening is that the point in the logs you're seeing is where the resource is *defined*, at which point it doesn't run
[2014-02-28 02:27:44 -0500] coderanger: It doesn't run in the normal pass, but when sent a notification it will run the request action no matter what
[2014-02-28 02:27:54 -0500] jbz: but later when it is notified it will run.
[2014-02-28 02:27:59 -0500] jbz: what @coderanger said.
[2014-02-28 02:28:05 -0500] h2odysee_: ok that makes sense
[2014-02-28 02:35:40 -0500] flaccid: hmm i assume this ruby is not possible in ruby1.8? do |arg=nil|
[2014-02-28 02:35:44 -0500] coderanger: flaccid: Indeed
[2014-02-28 02:36:14 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: how can i make it 1.8 compliant?
[2014-02-28 02:36:22 -0500] coderanger: flaccid: do |arg|
[2014-02-28 02:36:43 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: yeah do you think there will be any possible issue?
[2014-02-28 02:37:05 -0500] coderanger: If you want real defaults, you need to do a bunch of code generation and eval
[2014-02-28 02:52:10 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: have you ever had your poise work on a ruby 1.8?
[2014-02-28 02:52:37 -0500] coderanger: flaccid: You mean the poise cookbook? No, its explicitly 1.9+
[2014-02-28 02:53:30 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: yeah, i'm trying to hack it for 1.8 coz i can't change that. would 1.9 needed explain why i'm getting uninitialized constant Chef::Resource::PoiseRuby::Poise
[2014-02-28 02:53:44 -0500] coderanger: flaccid: Good luck :)
[2014-02-28 02:54:31 -0500] flaccid: i got close then ran into that. joy..
[2014-02-28 03:13:28 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: hmm getting E: Unable to locate package ruby-210 when following https://github.com/flaccid/poise-ruby#manual-use
[2014-02-28 03:15:09 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: i think it needs to be poise-ruby-210
[2014-02-28 03:25:52 -0500] Joel: is there something out there besides vagrant for bringing up virtual machines and provisioning with chef-solo?
[2014-02-28 03:32:55 -0500] someara_: test-kitchen
[2014-02-28 03:42:42 -0500] Joel: someara_: still seems dependent on vagrant :\
[2014-02-28 03:42:56 -0500] someara_: you can use the IaaS plugins
[2014-02-28 03:43:15 -0500] someara_: https://github.com/someara/build-essential/blob/master/.kitchen.cloud.yml
[2014-02-28 03:43:45 -0500] someara_: https://github.com/someara/build-essential/blob/master/Gemfile#L22
[2014-02-28 03:44:10 -0500] Joel: hm I suppose, if network is available.
[2014-02-28 03:44:37 -0500] coderanger: Joel: Whats the context?
[2014-02-28 03:44:47 -0500] coderanger: Vagrant covers local VBox and VMWare
[2014-02-28 03:44:58 -0500] coderanger: So if you don't have network, thats what you would use
[2014-02-28 03:45:14 -0500] Joel: coderanger: f'ing vagrant-berkshelf isn't building on a windows 8.1 machine for me... embedded ruby isn't finding it's devkit I guess.
[2014-02-28 03:45:34 -0500] coderanger: Joel: Just don't use the embedded Ruby
[2014-02-28 03:45:41 -0500] coderanger: You can still use your own Ruby with Vagrant
[2014-02-28 03:45:48 -0500] coderanger: (just not advertised)
[2014-02-28 03:45:57 -0500] Joel: coderanger: can you? I haven't found any docs on switching it off, the contrary is what I see.
[2014-02-28 03:46:28 -0500] coderanger: Joel: Add these lines to your gemfile
[2014-02-28 03:46:44 -0500] Joel: It's frustrating, the first time the plugin fails, the next time it doesn't say it fails, but it can't seem to connect to github to download any recipes.
[2014-02-28 03:46:44 -0500] coderanger: gem 'vagrant', github: 'mitchellh/vagrant', ref: 'v1.4.3'
[2014-02-28 03:46:51 -0500] coderanger: gem 'vagrant-berkshelf'
[2014-02-28 03:48:24 -0500] coderanger: That should install vagrant as a gem
[2014-02-28 03:48:31 -0500] Joel: coderanger: forgive me for being stupid on this one, but what gemfile?
[2014-02-28 03:48:40 -0500] coderanger: Joel: The one in your cookbook
[2014-02-28 03:49:08 -0500] Joel: coderanger: I'm talking host, are you thinking client?
[2014-02-28 03:49:31 -0500] Joel: I might be too tired for this.
[2014-02-28 03:49:36 -0500] coderanger: Joel: No, this is on your Windows machine
[2014-02-28 03:49:45 -0500] coderanger: You can use bundler to install Vagrant as a gem
[2014-02-28 03:49:56 -0500] coderanger: Rather than using their packaged releases
[2014-02-28 03:50:06 -0500] Joel: gotchya, make a random gemfile, call bundle update
[2014-02-28 03:50:11 -0500] coderanger: You could also just use VirtualBox directly
[2014-02-28 03:50:45 -0500] Joel: yeah that too
[2014-02-28 03:51:16 -0500] Joel: coderanger: earlier doc changes got merged in already, which is nice to see since it took me forever to hunt that crap out.
[2014-02-28 03:51:29 -0500] coderanger: Joel: :-)
[2014-02-28 03:53:32 -0500] CADBOT: Functionally, is there a difference between making a cookbook and it's related files myself
[2014-02-28 03:53:40 -0500] CADBOT: versus using knife to do it?
[2014-02-28 03:53:55 -0500] Joel: no
[2014-02-28 03:54:04 -0500] CADBOT: Like, knife isn't setting any background metadata stuff or anything like taht
[2014-02-28 03:54:16 -0500] CADBOT: Cool thanks
[2014-02-28 03:54:21 -0500] Joel: saves you time
[2014-02-28 03:54:43 -0500] Joel: same reason people use berkshelf
[2014-02-28 03:54:44 -0500] Joel: save time
[2014-02-28 03:55:10 -0500] coderanger: If you make a lot of cookbooks you'll probably want to make your own template though
[2014-02-28 03:55:19 -0500] coderanger: Like I have a cookiecutter template for cookbooks
[2014-02-28 03:56:36 -0500] flaccid: meez is pretty cool
[2014-02-28 03:56:42 -0500] Joel: alright going to kick this pig about a bit.
[2014-02-28 03:56:45 -0500] CADBOT: I'll check it out thanks
[2014-02-28 03:56:58 -0500] CADBOT: Are people generally using berkshelf over librarian chef these days?
[2014-02-28 03:57:09 -0500] flaccid: i still use librarian-chef
[2014-02-28 03:57:29 -0500] coderanger: CADBOT: Yes, berkshelf is definitely dominant by a good margin
[2014-02-28 04:02:21 -0500] CADBOT: Why is a runlist sometimes simply a list of cookbook names, but other times uses some recipe hash?
[2014-02-28 04:02:25 -0500] CADBOT: ie
[2014-02-28 04:02:45 -0500] flaccid: foo = foo::default
[2014-02-28 04:03:06 -0500] jbz: CADBOT: A runlist can contain either cookbook names, in which case the client will run the default recipe in that cookbook, or can contain specific recipes within cookbooks.
[2014-02-28 04:03:14 -0500] jbz: (it can also contain roles)
[2014-02-28 04:03:25 -0500] CADBOT: ah I see, so if one just books the cookbook in the recipe hash
[2014-02-28 04:03:32 -0500] CADBOT: it will run the default recipe
[2014-02-28 04:03:35 -0500] jbz: yep
[2014-02-28 04:03:39 -0500] jbz: shorthand
[2014-02-28 04:03:44 -0500] coderanger: CADBOT: Can you give na example of what you are calling a recipe hash?
[2014-02-28 04:03:54 -0500] CADBOT: sure
[2014-02-28 04:04:15 -0500] CADBOT: run_list = ["recipe[cookbook1]"]
[2014-02-28 04:04:29 -0500] CADBOT: vs run_list = ["cookbook1"]
[2014-02-28 04:04:48 -0500] jbz: oh heh
[2014-02-28 04:04:49 -0500] coderanger: The latter is only used in one specific API call
[2014-02-28 04:04:58 -0500] CADBOT: Those are equivalent, because both map to the default recipe
[2014-02-28 04:05:05 -0500] coderanger: Normally a run list is the former
[2014-02-28 04:05:11 -0500] coderanger: No, they are not equivalent
[2014-02-28 04:05:11 -0500] CADBOT: cookbook::default.rb
[2014-02-28 04:05:16 -0500] coderanger: the latter, in most cases, is an error
[2014-02-28 04:05:21 -0500] CADBOT: Oh?
[2014-02-28 04:05:37 -0500] coderanger: ["recipe[cookbook1]"] vs. ["recipe[cookbook1::default]"] are the same
[2014-02-28 04:05:46 -0500] coderanger: which is what flaccid was explaining
[2014-02-28 04:05:51 -0500] CADBOT: Gotcha
[2014-02-28 04:06:09 -0500] coderanger: but you will never* write a run list like  ["cookbook1"]
[2014-02-28 04:06:10 -0500] CADBOT: so what's going on then when people just put the cookbook name in there runlist?
[2014-02-28 04:06:22 -0500] coderanger: (*until you start debugging Chef internals)
[2014-02-28 04:06:31 -0500] coderanger: CADBOT: Where are you seeing that?
[2014-02-28 04:06:49 -0500] CADBOT: ahh lemme see if I can go find an example
[2014-02-28 04:08:11 -0500] coderanger: The only thing I know of called run_list that is just a list of cookbook names is the argument to the depsolver API
[2014-02-28 04:08:17 -0500] coderanger: which is way internal to Chef
[2014-02-28 04:08:37 -0500] CADBOT: This tutorial did it: http://jonathanotto.com/blog/chef-tutorial-in-minutes.html
[2014-02-28 04:08:57 -0500] CADBOT: I've been doing it that way and it *appears* to work
[2014-02-28 04:09:04 -0500] CADBOT: But I'd like to follow best practices
[2014-02-28 04:09:05 -0500] coderanger: CADBOT: That should be an error
[2014-02-28 04:09:28 -0500] coderanger: In fact most of that example role shouldn't be working at all
[2014-02-28 04:09:42 -0500] CADBOT: On that note where did you all learn chef? The opscode info is okay, but it kind of gives chef-solo secondary treatment
[2014-02-28 04:11:18 -0500] coderanger: CADBOT: I'm probably a really bad example but I learned by hanging out in IRC and futzing around with small sites
[2014-02-28 04:11:45 -0500] coderanger: But step two for me was "write my own Chef server" and then step three was "work as Opscode" so   :)
[2014-02-28 04:12:15 -0500] CADBOT: haha yeah, I've been kind of cobbling info together from IRC and various sites
[2014-02-28 04:12:36 -0500] CADBOT: Oh, you work at opscode?
[2014-02-28 04:12:39 -0500] coderanger: I used to
[2014-02-28 04:13:07 -0500] darkside_: i've found misheska's blog to be helpful
[2014-02-28 04:13:28 -0500] CADBOT: I'll check that out
[2014-02-28 04:14:54 -0500] CADBOT: I'm liking chef so far. I've always liked ruby and disliked sh scripting syntax, so it's a good change
[2014-02-28 04:26:12 -0500] chef860: hi
[2014-02-28 04:26:17 -0500] juliancdunn: I learned Chef by using it to build real working things
[2014-02-28 04:26:28 -0500] juliancdunn: then I got a job doing it, broke a bunch of stuff, and learned it even more :-)
[2014-02-28 04:27:05 -0500] chef860: i am getting error while installing the java on chef client using bootstrap
[2014-02-28 04:27:40 -0500] juliancdunn: what kind of error
[2014-02-28 04:27:52 -0500] chef860: error:Error executing action `install` on resource 'package[tomcat6]'
[2014-02-28 04:28:04 -0500] chef860: my chef client os is centos
[2014-02-28 04:28:09 -0500] chef860: centos 6.5
[2014-02-28 04:28:42 -0500] chef860: any idea why it's failing?
[2014-02-28 04:28:53 -0500] juliancdunn: can you pastebin or Gist some more output than that?
[2014-02-28 04:29:20 -0500] juliancdunn: or run Chef Client in debug mode to see the command it's actually running (chef-client -l debug)
[2014-02-28 04:31:21 -0500] chef860: when i run the chef-client in debug mode that time it's giving error  on line number 39 ->  package pkg do from cookbooks/tomcat/recipes/default.rb recipes file
[2014-02-28 04:31:45 -0500] chef860: its' saying undefined method package
[2014-02-28 04:33:02 -0500] juliancdunn: i'll need more context - can you put the output on a pastebin
[2014-02-28 04:33:13 -0500] chef860: ok
[2014-02-28 04:34:23 -0500] chef860: http://www.pastebin.ca/2648119 link for more information about  error
[2014-02-28 04:35:27 -0500] chef860: i am installing the tomcat on bootstrap
[2014-02-28 04:36:28 -0500] chef860: boostrap command is :knife boostrap client machineip -x username -P password -p 22 -r "recipe[tomcat]"
[2014-02-28 04:36:42 -0500] juliancdunn: what happens when you try to install tomcat6 by hand?
[2014-02-28 04:38:10 -0500] chef860: if i am trying to install tomcat by hand on particular machine using yum install tomcat it's install properly
[2014-02-28 04:38:32 -0500] chef860: only while bootstrap time its failing
[2014-02-28 04:38:36 -0500] chef860: same for java also
[2014-02-28 04:38:57 -0500] chef860: but i can install the apache2 while bootstraping
[2014-02-28 04:39:40 -0500] juliancdunn: doesn't make any sense
[2014-02-28 04:39:44 -0500] chef860: i am stuck with this error from last 2 day but not getting correct solution
[2014-02-28 04:39:57 -0500] juliancdunn: the output is saying that yum is returning a non-zero exit code when chef is trying to call it
[2014-02-28 04:40:25 -0500] chef860: i check yum lock also but still not getting any idea
[2014-02-28 04:41:30 -0500] chef860: i debug that time it's saying package is undefined method so i search on internet some people given solution that it;s because of gem version
[2014-02-28 04:42:04 -0500] chef860: i downgrad the gem version from 1.8.10 to 1.8.5 but still not solving the problem
[2014-02-28 04:42:37 -0500] juliancdunn: that shouldn't have anything to do with it
[2014-02-28 04:42:44 -0500] juliancdunn: are you trying to bootstrap the same machine again and again?
[2014-02-28 04:42:53 -0500] juliancdunn: or are these all completely new machines?
[2014-02-28 04:43:04 -0500] chef860: completely new machine
[2014-02-28 04:43:33 -0500] chef860: same recipe i tried on other machine their it;s working fine
[2014-02-28 04:43:37 -0500] chef860: same centos 6.5
[2014-02-28 04:44:05 -0500] juliancdunn: if you log into one of these fresh machines and try "yum -y install tomcat6" it's fine?
[2014-02-28 04:44:07 -0500] chef860: so i reinstall the centos 6.5 on the machine but still getting same problem
[2014-02-28 04:44:25 -0500] chef860: yes
[2014-02-28 04:45:15 -0500] chef860: only for tomcat and java it;s failing other apache2 ,mysql working fine
[2014-02-28 04:45:38 -0500] juliancdunn: you've tried like a 'yum clean all' prior to doing bootstrap?
[2014-02-28 04:45:48 -0500] chef860: no
[2014-02-28 04:46:47 -0500] chef860: should i tried that option?
[2014-02-28 04:47:26 -0500] juliancdunn: it can't hurt
[2014-02-28 04:48:22 -0500] chef860: or any other issue ?
[2014-02-28 04:49:19 -0500] chef860: because using same recipe i am bootstraping other machine it's working fine
[2014-02-28 04:49:43 -0500] juliancdunn: what other machine are you bootstrapping that's working fine?
[2014-02-28 04:50:19 -0500] chef860: i have 2 chef-client machine
[2014-02-28 04:50:28 -0500] chef860: with same os centos 6.5
[2014-02-28 04:50:53 -0500] chef860: on one machine it's working fine other it's failing
[2014-02-28 04:52:38 -0500] juliancdunn: so there's something wrong with how the machine is installed
[2014-02-28 04:53:59 -0500] chef860: but i reinstall the same centos 6.5 on that machine
[2014-02-28 04:54:11 -0500] chef860: then it;s should work?
[2014-02-28 04:54:29 -0500] juliancdunn: I have no idea, it depends on whether you're installing CentOS consistently across your fleet
[2014-02-28 04:55:00 -0500] juliancdunn: there's some differential between the two boxes, obviously, whether that's in the installation or the configuration before Chef touched it
[2014-02-28 04:55:35 -0500] juliancdunn: anyway, I gotta go - sorry we couldn't figure it out
[2014-02-28 05:03:42 -0500] Joel: coderanger: totally a case of the tired.
[2014-02-28 05:04:16 -0500] Joel: coderanger: so windows and all it's glory, vagrant installer TELLS you to reboot (at the very least you need to kill the explorer proccess and restart it). Once I did that, it took care of the missing devkit.
[2014-02-28 05:05:20 -0500] Joel: coderanger: issue with the cookbook not being pullged from github.... no native git client installed (github windows client doesn't count)
[2014-02-28 05:05:25 -0500] Joel: coderanger: left my ticket open for the vagrant-berkshelf folks, would be nice to get a "Hey idiot you need to install a git client to use git references" type error
[2014-02-28 05:26:37 -0500] viz_: Hello all.
[2014-02-28 06:39:34 -0500] holms: maybe anybody had a problem when No such file or directory - chef-server-ctl reconfigure ?
[2014-02-28 06:40:15 -0500] holms: i'm using chef-solo to provision chef-server with chef-server cookbook. don't ask why, author of cookbook states it's working. it downloaded chef rpm package, installed succesfully
[2014-02-28 06:40:58 -0500] holms: http://pastie.org/pastes/8811216/text
[2014-02-28 06:41:09 -0500] holms: it's usually happens when reinstalling chef
[2014-02-28 06:41:31 -0500] holms: chef-server* and Im removing everything that rpm package installed manually..
[2014-02-28 06:43:33 -0500] holms: anyone X_x?
[2014-02-28 06:47:43 -0500] holms: lol found a problem
[2014-02-28 06:48:13 -0500] holms: how can I contribute in here? https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-server
[2014-02-28 06:50:07 -0500] flaccid: holms: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-server/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
[2014-02-28 06:51:30 -0500] holms: thanks
[2014-02-28 07:09:22 -0500] flaccid: holms: i dunno if you can, that kind of thing is best to solve the reason why it is needed as opposed to being forceful. or get of rpm and do debian
[2014-02-28 07:10:50 -0500] holms: you actually can
[2014-02-28 07:10:54 -0500] holms: there's attribute options
[2014-02-28 07:10:58 -0500] holms: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_rpm_package.html
[2014-02-28 07:11:19 -0500] holms: cause it's critical for me not to reinstall whole node.
[2014-02-28 07:11:25 -0500] flaccid: oh
[2014-02-28 07:11:41 -0500] flaccid: packages belong in repositories heh
[2014-02-28 07:11:48 -0500] holms: and then probably i'll add this attribtue to default attribtue of cookbook.. then I can ovveride this from role
[2014-02-28 07:12:14 -0500] holms: if this'll work, hope my issue will be accepted :D
[2014-02-28 07:12:21 -0500] holms: and i'll make pull request
[2014-02-28 07:13:22 -0500] holms: flaccid: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-server/blob/master/recipes/default.rb#L73
[2014-02-28 07:13:25 -0500] holms: before this line
[2014-02-28 07:13:29 -0500] holms: attribute option should be added
[2014-02-28 07:14:53 -0500] flaccid: that would be an enhancement
[2014-02-28 07:16:51 -0500] holms: now i wonder how can I pass list of attributes
[2014-02-28 07:17:20 -0500] flaccid: what do you mean
[2014-02-28 07:17:23 -0500] holms: options Option options must be a kind of [String]!  You passed ["--force"].
[2014-02-28 07:17:45 -0500] flaccid: kind of looks like you did an array there
[2014-02-28 07:17:56 -0500] holms: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_rpm_package.html
[2014-02-28 07:18:04 -0500] holms: One (or more) additional options that are passed to the command.
[2014-02-28 07:18:13 -0500] flaccid: it doesnt' specify data type.
[2014-02-28 07:19:05 -0500] holms: i though i can specify list =(
[2014-02-28 07:19:51 -0500] holms: some attributes supports hashes: supports :status => true, :restart => true, :reload => true
[2014-02-28 07:19:54 -0500] flaccid: its not python
[2014-02-28 07:20:00 -0500] holms: k :D
[2014-02-28 07:20:22 -0500] flaccid: well this is up to the resource
[2014-02-28 07:20:45 -0500] holms: so it's something like "--force --whateverparam" i hope
[2014-02-28 07:20:59 -0500] flaccid: if its String then i'd say so
[2014-02-28 07:21:21 -0500] holms: sadly they don't provide types in here http://docs.opscode.com/resource_rpm_package.html
[2014-02-28 07:21:24 -0500] holms: of attributes
[2014-02-28 07:21:33 -0500] flaccid: thats what i said
[2014-02-28 07:23:27 -0500] holms: flaccid: maybe you know is nil accepted too?
[2014-02-28 07:27:32 -0500] flaccid: tias
[2014-02-28 07:34:48 -0500] holms: works!
[2014-02-28 07:39:10 -0500] holms: flaccid: maybe you can validate is everything looks alright? https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-4386
[2014-02-28 07:40:50 -0500] holms: i'm doing this for the first time
[2014-02-28 07:42:34 -0500] flaccid: holms: i don't think it has enough specifics. refer https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-server/blob/master/recipes/default.rb and proposed solution
[2014-02-28 07:43:14 -0500] flaccid: more so, provide a reason on why this should actually be needed
[2014-02-28 07:43:28 -0500] holms: can I edit description?
[2014-02-28 07:43:38 -0500] holms: reason: or my current situation I need to pass options to "rpm" command which install rpm package.
[2014-02-28 07:43:42 -0500] holms: provided?
[2014-02-28 07:44:43 -0500] flaccid: thats not actually a reason, you are simply saying that you 'need to'. the why is not explained
[2014-02-28 07:45:03 -0500] holms: how to explain why
[2014-02-28 07:45:08 -0500] holms: rpm command needs arguments lol
[2014-02-28 07:45:43 -0500] flaccid: no it doesn't
[2014-02-28 07:45:57 -0500] flaccid: explain what the use case is of having to do --force
[2014-02-28 07:47:24 -0500] holms: k
[2014-02-28 07:47:29 -0500] holms: so I can't edit decription do I?
[2014-02-28 07:48:37 -0500] flaccid: you can edit both the name and desc of the ticket
[2014-02-28 07:49:47 -0500] holms: couldn't find

[2014-02-28 07:56:01 -0500] holms: just added comment, hope that's fine
[2014-02-28 09:41:17 -0500] holms: okay.. i've got kitchen-test failed on opscode cookbook..what's next..?
[2014-02-28 09:41:19 -0500] holms: Could not locate chef-server package matching version 'latest' for node.

[2014-02-28 09:49:00 -0500] srenatus: holms: it's wierd that the kitchen.yml for chef-server even mentions 13.04... https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-server#platform << {10..12}.04 supported only
[2014-02-28 09:49:35 -0500] holms: ok
[2014-02-28 09:49:55 -0500] holms: so I've created a ticket, and almost finished to fix it.
[2014-02-28 09:49:59 -0500] holms: and now I can't even run a simple test
[2014-02-28 09:50:03 -0500] holms: with master branch
[2014-02-28 09:50:39 -0500] holms: this should be reported..?
[2014-02-28 09:51:38 -0500] srenatus: holms: how did you fix it?
[2014-02-28 09:52:28 -0500] holms: srenatus: i didn't
[2014-02-28 09:52:32 -0500] holms: i'm working on another issue https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-4386
[2014-02-28 09:52:37 -0500] holms: srenatus: thanks seen it :D
[2014-02-28 09:52:56 -0500] holms: and as I understand before making pull request kitchen test is required
[2014-02-28 09:52:58 -0500] holms: to pass
[2014-02-28 09:54:27 -0500] holms: now question how can I pull-request that COOK-4386, if kitchen test is failing even in master branch
[2014-02-28 09:54:28 -0500] srenatus: holms: does it say so?  I'd go with chefspec, but I just noticed that chef-server doesn't have any specs at all :o
[2014-02-28 09:54:50 -0500] holms: k.. i'll try  to follow TESTING.md line by line
[2014-02-28 09:54:56 -0500] holms: i've just ran kitchen init
[2014-02-28 09:55:10 -0500] srenatus: holms: the .tracis.yml shows you this: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-server/blob/master/.travis.yml#L78-L82
[2014-02-28 09:55:54 -0500] srenatus: so just kitchen testing these should be fine.  13.04 won't work with omnitruck.
[2014-02-28 09:55:56 -0500] ocholetras: im getting "Request Entity Too Large" when client tries to save state of the node

[2014-02-28 10:07:42 -0500] srenatus: holms: that will fail, as you already noticed, for ubuntu 13.04 trying to get the omnibus package

[2014-02-28 10:12:53 -0500] srenatus: this will fail for default-ubuntu-1304 because there's no such omnibus chef-server package
[2014-02-28 10:13:55 -0500] srenatus: holms: if your tests with centos-6.4 and ubuntu-12.04 work, just go ahead and PR. :)

I confirmed the server is in the node list via the portal.  It use to work.  Any thoughts how to debug?

[2014-02-28 19:35:52 -0500] Santhosh_: Using a hostname in etc/chef/client.rb for chef_server_url is not an option for me, Hence I'm forced to use a ip address for my chef server. Firstly , is this even allowed. Second, at some point the chef-client tries to reverse lookup the ip address and tries to find the hostname(The DNS will return NXDOMAIN) and is not working. Do i have a valid usecase.?
[2014-02-28 19:41:17 -0500] Ron__: @Santhosh, I am unaware of chef looking back to the node.
[2014-02-28 19:41:41 -0500] Ron__: Im a noob, but I don't think using an ip vs a name should matter much

[2014-02-28 21:35:16 -0500] coderanger: async_io: You can use the included ruby if you want
[2014-02-28 21:35:30 -0500] coderanger: async_io: /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install bundler
[2014-02-28 21:36:02 -0500] async_io: coderanger: and after installing bundler, how would I un-screw my library versions?
[2014-02-28 21:36:44 -0500] coderanger: async_io: Make a gemfile with berkshelf in it
[2014-02-28 21:36:59 -0500] coderanger: async_io: What language are you most familiar with, I can try explain in those terms
[2014-02-28 21:38:07 -0500] async_io: coderanger: I've done enough ruby, so you can try that.  I know how to make a gemfile, I just don't know what set of specifics needs to be put in it, and in the bundler world where that gemfile file should live
[2014-02-28 21:39:55 -0500] CPS: is there an easy way to check the syntax of a template file? i'm getting a syntax error and I'm just not seeing it
[2014-02-28 21:39:59 -0500] async_io: coderanger: the webservice in the repo https://github.com/jonathana/chef_config_server is something I built.  The repo is not-quite-functional-yet, but the bundler/Gemfile stuff isn't the issue, so maybe that tells you what I understand about bundler so far
[2014-02-28 21:40:18 -0500] coderanger: async_io: I have a gemfile in every one of my cookbooks
[2014-02-28 21:41:00 -0500] async_io: coderanger: not to be dense, but why do I need a gemfile in a cookbook in particular?
[2014-02-28 21:41:38 -0500] coderanger: async_io: Manage every cookbook as an independent software project (ex. https://github.com/balanced-cookbooks)
[2014-02-28 21:42:11 -0500] async_io: coderanger: I'm not having a problem with a cookbook.  I'm having a problem with my "deploy environment" setup
[2014-02-28 21:42:28 -0500] coderanger: async_io: That should be a cookbook too :)
[2014-02-28 21:43:29 -0500] async_io: coderanger: ok, I'll get to that particular piece of meta after I can get the environment that was working yesterday to deploy to production working again today after I made no changes to the Berkshelf file or the underlying rubygems in the omnibus installer
[2014-02-28 21:45:01 -0500] async_io: coderanger: hope that didn't come off as snarky, because it wasn't meant to be.  It was an honest statement.  Something moved underneath me in my environment that's got me perplexed and broken.  If making my setup into a chef cookbook itself later helps that, great.  But first I think I need to get back to what works
[2014-02-28 21:45:58 -0500] nickabbey: I have an ldap server deployed by the former sysadmin (who has since moved on).  I need to add /etc/ldap/schema/samba.schema and modify /etc/ldap/slapd.conf to include the samba.schema file that will be added.  I'm very new to chef, and I don't clearly understand how it all works.  If I add/modify those files - will chef change them back next time the chef-client syncs up on that ldap server?
[2014-02-28 21:47:28 -0500] nickabbey: mostly I'm looking for direction on what I need to know/teach myself to make it happen
[2014-02-28 21:47:34 -0500] tara_h2: if chef manages those files, yes
[2014-02-28 21:48:24 -0500] tara_h2: but if your sysadmin only used chef to install basic services and then did subsequent configuration manually, you're probably okay
[2014-02-28 21:48:46 -0500] tara_h2: however, if you don't know your way around chef it can be hard to know
[2014-02-28 21:54:16 -0500] nickabbey: I think that is likely what he did.
[2014-02-28 21:54:17 -0500] nickabbey: If I look in the site-cook books folder and search though the files and templates folders, I dont see any references to the config files.
[2014-02-28 21:54:17 -0500] nickabbey: is there something/someplace else I shoudl look to verify this?
