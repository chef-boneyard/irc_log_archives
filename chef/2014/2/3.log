[2014-02-03 00:10:53 -0500] gyllen: Hi guys, I have a simple question which probably been asked a million times here. But googling, docs and stackoverflow does not give the any good answers. I just need a pointer. So I am looking to use chef for deploy, we have acouple of servers running on AWS.
[2014-02-03 00:11:32 -0500] flaccid: cool
[2014-02-03 00:12:34 -0500] gyllen: I want to deploy by simply just checking into github. What is the best way todo this. My thought was using the deploy resource and then having chef::service running. But that would introduce an delay to the deploy. How do I handle this? Any ideas?
[2014-02-03 00:12:57 -0500] flaccid: gyllen: do you mean you want to do CD ?
[2014-02-03 00:13:36 -0500] gyllen: exactly
[2014-02-03 00:14:15 -0500] flaccid: people usually do push with their CI or they run a chef-client in cron or you could do service based like you mentioned
[2014-02-03 00:16:10 -0500] gyllen: flaccid: How would the CI push work? Running a knife command after successfull test run?
