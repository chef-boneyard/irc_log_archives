[2014-02-02 00:42:00 -0500] gchristensen: masterkorp: I found you on an archlinux forum. still using weechat?
[2014-02-02 00:48:32 -0500] masterkorp: gchristensen: hello yes
[2014-02-02 00:48:57 -0500] gchristensen: right on. I was just considering switching to irssi since there is a solarized theme for it.
[2014-02-02 00:49:30 -0500] masterkorp: i love weechat, just because you can writte plugins in basically any language
[2014-02-02 00:49:48 -0500] masterkorp: altough i do remove the date and the user list on my theme
[2014-02-02 00:50:16 -0500] gchristensen: you remove the message time?
[2014-02-02 00:50:23 -0500] masterkorp: i run 24/7 under tmux on my server and it workds
[2014-02-02 00:50:29 -0500] masterkorp: gchristensen: just from the layout
[2014-02-02 00:50:41 -0500] gchristensen: ah
[2014-02-02 00:50:48 -0500] gchristensen: yeah, I use screen / same idea.
[2014-02-02 00:51:34 -0500] masterkorp: i use tmux just because proper client server approach
[2014-02-02 00:51:47 -0500] gchristensen: ah
[2014-02-02 00:51:52 -0500] masterkorp: also what are the odds of we both being in chef ?
[2014-02-02 00:51:57 -0500] masterkorp: small world
[2014-02-02 00:52:43 -0500] gchristensen: indeed :)
[2014-02-02 02:30:08 -0500] bgupta: so for anyone using elasticsearch with Chef, and autoscaling, there seems to be a bit of a race condition when all the cluster nodes come up using the "chef discovery" mechanism (which seems to use a chef search to populate a template.
[2014-02-02 03:06:53 -0500] coderanger: bgupta: chef is not a good system to use for cluster coordination
[2014-02-02 03:06:59 -0500] coderanger: bgupta: I recommend zookeeper
[2014-02-02 03:08:30 -0500] bgupta: I think elasticsearch comes with zookeeper under the covers.. they have two "builtin" discovery methods.. 1) multicast, and 2) ec2 api calls... however the popular chef cookbook tries to hack it with unicast presseeds.
[2014-02-02 03:10:23 -0500] bgupta: I've come to the conclusioin that using the ec2/cloud autodiscovery is prolly worth playing with..
[2014-02-02 03:10:31 -0500] bgupta: (as per this blog post) http://jontai.me/blog/2013/03/elasticsearch-ec2-discovery/
[2014-02-02 03:10:59 -0500] coderanger: bgupta: Thats still possibly race-y
[2014-02-02 03:11:21 -0500] bgupta: coderanger: You know the plugin?
[2014-02-02 03:11:30 -0500] coderanger: bgupta: no, I know the EC2 APIs
[2014-02-02 03:12:05 -0500] bgupta: what I mean is it's supposed to be dynamic, which leads to to ghink it might poll.. which would solve the problem.
[2014-02-02 03:12:11 -0500] coderanger: its like 99% less likely to have issues than using chef+unicast discovery though
[2014-02-02 03:13:05 -0500] coderanger: bgupta: You'll have to wait a bit for the cluster to find each other if you spawn a bunch of nodes at the same time
[2014-02-02 03:13:06 -0500] bgupta: someone could I thin write a discovery pluging for zookeeper that uses chef searches.. might be a terrible hack though
[2014-02-02 03:13:15 -0500] bgupta: that's ok..
[2014-02-02 03:13:41 -0500] bgupta: thanks
[2014-02-02 07:30:44 -0500] wishlistmaster: anyone got a sample code on how to do a clean "exit/end the whole chef-run"? I've seen some "exit a recipe-run by doing a return". But I'm looking for a proper chef end because I'm going to do a reboot. Anyone?
[2014-02-02 09:20:58 -0500] saintish: exit
[2014-02-02 12:14:48 -0500] epcim: Chef solo search do not work as I expected. Anybody to help me how to deploy Vagrant box with open source Chef-server?
[2014-02-02 12:18:54 -0500] sneak: epcim: if you're doing development, i use test-kitchen to bring up instances and they use chef-zero
[2014-02-02 12:36:01 -0500] epcim: sneak: thanks, any good tutorial you would recommend?
[2014-02-02 12:40:53 -0500] sneak: epcim: http://kitchen.ci
[2014-02-02 12:41:10 -0500] sneak: provisioner: name: chef_zero is what you want in your .kitchen.yml
[2014-02-02 12:41:39 -0500] sneak: nodes_path and environments_path and roles_path and data_bags_path are the other keys under provisioner that specify where chef-zero can find the json
[2014-02-02 12:42:10 -0500] sneak: then search should work mostly okay (though it just has node data from json, not from a full remote node run)
[2014-02-02 15:31:02 -0500] wishlistmaster: saintish, exit will exit with error, correct? I'm looking for a clean stop
