[2014-02-07 00:10:54 -0500] cbarraford: @coderanger whats depot?
[2014-02-07 00:10:57 -0500] coderanger: (note: best != easiet)

[2014-02-07 01:45:40 -0500] kallistec: aneel: odd, try running chef with -ldebug see if there's anything interesting?
[2014-02-07 01:45:48 -0500] phutchin1: is it normal to have to configure chef-server out of the box to listen on 0.0.0.0 instead of only locally?
[2014-02-07 01:46:44 -0500] kallistec: ldk: looks like your dns is busted
[2014-02-07 01:47:07 -0500] kallistec: getaddrinfo is the low level call to look up hostnames and such
[2014-02-07 01:47:08 -0500] aneel: thanks kallistec, i'm using vagrant's chef-client provisioner. where can i put that flag?
[2014-02-07 01:47:42 -0500] kallistec: aneel: check the vagrant docs to be sure, I think there's just a log_level setting
[2014-02-07 01:47:53 -0500] aneel: will do, thanks
[2014-02-07 01:48:16 -0500] coderanger: kallistec: \o.
[2014-02-07 01:48:30 -0500] coderanger: kallistec: Maybe S3's loleventualconsistency hit?
[2014-02-07 01:49:01 -0500] kallistec: coderanger: could be? AWS isn't known for their transparency on such matters

[2014-02-07 02:03:30 -0500] phutchin1: :)
[2014-02-07 02:03:45 -0500] resno_: thats like asking many people breathe? :)
[2014-02-07 02:03:53 -0500] phutchin1: figured that would peak a little interest :)
[2014-02-07 02:04:02 -0500] resno_: sure it always does somewhat
[2014-02-07 02:04:04 -0500] resno_: whats up?
[2014-02-07 02:04:16 -0500] phutchin1: is it part of a general install that you have to reconfigure it to listen on 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1 ?
[2014-02-07 02:04:38 -0500] phutchin1: i've installed many a chef server and never had to do this before... seems I'm having to now however
[2014-02-07 02:04:39 -0500] coderanger: phutchin1: "pique interest" ;-)
[2014-02-07 02:04:45 -0500] phutchin1: :) thx
[2014-02-07 02:04:46 -0500] phutchin1: lol
[2014-02-07 02:04:53 -0500] coderanger: phutchin1: It listens on 0.0.0.0 already
[2014-02-07 02:05:00 -0500] phutchin1: 8000?
[2014-02-07 02:05:06 -0500] coderanger: 443
[2014-02-07 02:05:27 -0500] phutchin1: ah, and that should be the only opening yes?
[2014-02-07 02:05:37 -0500] coderanger: it also listens on 80, but it just redirects
[2014-02-07 02:05:44 -0500] phutchin1: yeah
[2014-02-07 02:06:23 -0500] phutchin1: let me poke at it real quick then. maybe it'd just been too long of a day when i was messing with it the other day :)
[2014-02-07 02:06:29 -0500] coderanger: All internal services are proxied by nginx
[2014-02-07 02:07:10 -0500] resno_: in general can you just use the cookbooks and be done?
[2014-02-07 02:07:17 -0500] resno_: or will they require tweaking?
[2014-02-07 02:07:22 -0500] resno_: if thats a good question
[2014-02-07 02:07:54 -0500] aneel: huh
[2014-02-07 02:08:00 -0500] phutchin1: yeah, thats what i thought but guess i had an incorrect assumption about which port we should be using
[2014-02-07 02:08:14 -0500] aneel: so the file it's trying to download exists...

[2014-02-07 02:09:06 -0500] aneel: the server should send a NOT MODIFIED, not a NOT FOUND, right?

[2014-02-07 02:12:13 -0500] Skeletor_: Hi all, wondering how you all with aws chef instances are restricting access to your chef servers too just your aws instances that connect to your chef server?
[2014-02-07 02:12:31 -0500] aneel: and that's also the case if i add the accept-encoding header
[2014-02-07 02:12:41 -0500] resno_: tjr9898: whats wrong?
[2014-02-07 02:13:22 -0500] phutchin1: tjr9898: i believe i have also... you get an error? might be able to help more with errors... pastebin?
[2014-02-07 02:14:25 -0500] tjr9898: phutchin1: You had them both on the same box?
[2014-02-07 02:15:32 -0500] phutchin1: tjr9898: i do believe so. hwoever not vagrant
[2014-02-07 02:15:56 -0500] tjr9898: I think the last error could having been a couple of things evolving elasticsearch - either the new chef version or a new elasticserach cookbook was the problem
[2014-02-07 02:16:39 -0500] tjr9898: of course I don't I need to boot up my work computer
[2014-02-07 02:16:48 -0500] [ROOT]XxNeoLiTHi: hi all. im installing enterprise chef server (private) and I need to set specific uid/gid values for the opscode and opscode-pgsql users/groups instead of letting it auto select. Is there a way I can do this through the private-chef.rb or do I have to effectively edit the embedded cookbooks to accomplish this?
[2014-02-07 02:16:51 -0500] tjr9898: I was just trying to do a sanity check
[2014-02-07 02:16:54 -0500] resno_: tjr9898: so, could you sit back and let the cookbook complete the whole install or do they need tuning?
[2014-02-07 02:16:58 -0500] kallistec: aneel: hrm, so it must have been working previously, if chef knows the etag and last-modified time
[2014-02-07 02:17:20 -0500] resno_: im just curious how that goes in general
[2014-02-07 02:17:23 -0500] aneel: yeah, i believe this set of recipes was working earlier today
[2014-02-07 02:18:07 -0500] phutchin1: tjr9898: i hear ya :)
[2014-02-07 02:18:21 -0500] phutchin1: do you remember at all what kind of error you were getting? or problem you were having?
[2014-02-07 02:18:57 -0500] tjr9898: resno_: I was just copying what was in the cookbooks' vagrantfiles
[2014-02-07 02:19:23 -0500] kallistec: aneel: I'm out of guesses, aside from something like the upstream rate-limiting you or something. Do you have any idea what might have changed since it was working?
[2014-02-07 02:19:40 -0500] tjr9898: phutchin1: I'll be set back up pretty soon
[2014-02-07 02:20:13 -0500] aneel: if the upstream were rate-limiting me it would affect the curls too, though, right?
[2014-02-07 02:20:16 -0500] tjr9898: I was moving all my stuff over to a new ssd computer
[2014-02-07 02:21:37 -0500] aneel: this version of this recipe worked earlier today in aws, and yesterday in my vagrant setup
[2014-02-07 02:22:36 -0500] aneel: i've tried rolling my git changes back to earlier, but maybe i didn't go far enough
[2014-02-07 02:22:53 -0500] aneel: but this is a community cookbook (postgres), not something i've been editing
[2014-02-07 02:23:09 -0500] aneel: so i'll have to look at the attributes that might affect it
[2014-02-07 02:23:20 -0500] aneel: which seem like the only things that might have changed
[2014-02-07 02:24:01 -0500] tjr9898: aneel a new vagrant up
[2014-02-07 02:24:11 -0500] tjr9898: with omnibus plugin

[2014-02-07 02:25:15 -0500] aneel: i've done several destroy/up cycles, but i'll roll back to yesterday's checkin and try another
[2014-02-07 02:28:12 -0500] tjr9898: @aneel I know they release a new chef version 11.10 so that may be having an impact.  Look to see you omnibus.chef_version is 11.8

[2014-02-07 02:35:58 -0500] aneel: huh, so I'm seeing references to both chef 11.10.0 and 11.0.10
[2014-02-07 02:36:24 -0500] aneel: is the version here wrong? [chef] Installing Chef 11.10.0 Omnibus package...
[2014-02-07 02:36:37 -0500] aneel: oh, nm
[2014-02-07 02:36:43 -0500] aneel: 11.0.10 is the server version
[2014-02-07 02:37:09 -0500] tjr9898: for those keeping score my error was `ERROR: uninitialized constant Extensions`
[2014-02-07 02:38:03 -0500] phutchin1: coderanger: thanks... nothing has changed, i was just down a rabit hole and was loosing my mind :)

[2014-02-07 02:38:31 -0500] phutchin1: my rabbit and such had gotten into a funky state so i had to nuke it all and get a fresh start

[2014-02-07 02:41:55 -0500] tjr9898: sorry chef586, is this android cloud just servers with the android sdk on them
[2014-02-07 02:42:13 -0500] tjr9898: or are the physical android devices

[2014-02-07 02:45:53 -0500] danzel: that was the real error given by chef
[2014-02-07 02:45:59 -0500] aneel: between raid and data?
[2014-02-07 02:46:51 -0500] kallistec: danzel: upgrade to a newer version of chef if at all possible

[2014-02-07 02:48:24 -0500] danzel: 10.28.2
[2014-02-07 02:51:43 -0500] kallistec: danzel: hrm, then probably have to stick to an older version of the aws cookbook
[2014-02-07 02:52:05 -0500] kallistec: danzel: crap like that is a big motivation for the attributes rewrite in chef 11
[2014-02-07 02:54:37 -0500] aneel: okay, a totally fresh vagrant setup with client 11.10.0 and yesterday's config has the same 404
[2014-02-07 02:54:47 -0500] aneel: next to try, 11.8.2, i guess
[2014-02-07 02:55:02 -0500] aneel: well, almost the same 404

[2014-02-07 03:37:05 -0500] danzel: yep i'll do some testing
[2014-02-07 03:38:52 -0500] coderanger: tjr9898: No idea, is that a library that the cookbook is supposed to expose?
[2014-02-07 03:39:14 -0500] tjr9898: coderanger: idk
[2014-02-07 04:27:18 -0500] sarkis: well looking like i am going to be making the switch from puppet to chef in my professional life ;)
[2014-02-07 04:32:43 -0500] tjr9898: sarkis: Welcome!
[2014-02-07 04:33:40 -0500] sarkis: ty ty
[2014-02-07 04:34:00 -0500] sarkis: coderanger: you still a big python guy? i think i remember you doing a chef talk at pycon or djangocon?
[2014-02-07 04:34:06 -0500] sarkis: long time ago
[2014-02-07 04:34:48 -0500] sarkis: any suggestions on where to get started with chef? i am looking for like the most advanced no nonsense quickstart :)
[2014-02-07 04:35:06 -0500] coderanger: sarkis: Indeed
[2014-02-07 04:35:44 -0500] sarkis: very cool, i still love python, too.. ruby is starting to grow on me though
[2014-02-07 06:51:57 -0500] chance: if im just writing cookbooks for personal configuration stuff, is there any point in licensing the repo?
[2014-02-07 07:21:07 -0500] fitzdsl: Hello. What is the recommended way to distribute custom ohai plugins to chef-client ?
[2014-02-07 07:24:36 -0500] fitzdsl: Is there any equivalent to puppet's pluginsync ?
[2014-02-07 07:48:24 -0500] ay_: knife search node 'uptime_seconds:[6213490 TO *]' -a uptime
[2014-02-07 07:48:49 -0500] ay_: This does not seem to work as expected.
[2014-02-07 07:48:57 -0500] ay_: I still get machines with 1-2 days of uptime
[2014-02-07 08:10:38 -0500] coderanger: fitzdsl: What does that do?
[2014-02-07 08:10:57 -0500] coderanger: ay_: Solr doesn't understand numeric ranges
[2014-02-07 08:11:18 -0500] coderanger: ay_: If would do an ascii-based check
[2014-02-07 08:11:48 -0500] coderanger: chance: Sure, no real reason not to
[2014-02-07 08:15:06 -0500] ay_: coderanger: Oh? it does not? Is there no way to do numeric range checks?
[2014-02-07 08:15:53 -0500] ay_: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrQuerySyntax seems to indicate that "field:[100 TO *] finds all field values greater than or equal to 100"
[2014-02-07 08:16:19 -0500] coderanger: ay_: The issue is that we massage all data into a single field
[2014-02-07 08:19:15 -0500] ay_: coderanger: Ehm. Ok. So I will not be able to search for numerical ranges at all. Isn't that a feature that would make sense to have? For example during the leap second bug issue "Search for machines with higher uptime than this" Find machines with more than 3 GB of memory etc.
[2014-02-07 08:19:34 -0500] chance: say i set some attributes in a role
[2014-02-07 08:19:37 -0500] coderanger: ay_: I'm all for it, but it would require major changes on the backend :)
[2014-02-07 08:19:57 -0500] coderanger: ay_: There has been some experimentation with switching from Solr to ES which might allow it
[2014-02-07 08:20:01 -0500] chance: and then i have another role which includes that role in its runlist, how do i keep the attributes in the included roll, and then add to the attributes in the new one?
[2014-02-07 08:20:09 -0500] coderanger: ay_: But I don't know the status of that beyond a one-day PoC
[2014-02-07 08:20:13 -0500] chance: ie: super() with attributes in roles kind-of
[2014-02-07 08:20:28 -0500] coderanger: chance: It does it for you
[2014-02-07 08:20:33 -0500] chance: does it?
[2014-02-07 08:20:40 -0500] ay_: coderanger: Ok. It's quite surprising for a user trying to search atleast :-D
[2014-02-07 08:20:54 -0500] coderanger: Yes, attrs from all roles in the exapnded run list are processed
[2014-02-07 08:21:11 -0500] chance: i thought they overwrite eachother :<
[2014-02-07 08:22:24 -0500] chance: so role "base" sets an attr "foo" and "web" includes "base" in its run list, and also sets the "foo" attr
[2014-02-07 08:22:35 -0500] chance: how does that resolve if their both set on default attributes
[2014-02-07 08:22:45 -0500] chance: chef attribute heirarchy is confusing :\
[2014-02-07 08:22:56 -0500] coderanger: chance: They get deep-merged, in the order they are in the run list
[2014-02-07 08:23:16 -0500] coderanger: so if role[a] has run_list role[b], role[c]
[2014-02-07 08:23:22 -0500] coderanger: the full list is a, b, c
[2014-02-07 08:23:28 -0500] coderanger: and they will be merged in that order
[2014-02-07 08:24:10 -0500] chance: just found: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_node_object_deep_merge.html, that helps
[2014-02-07 08:24:43 -0500] fitzdsl: coderanger: it's to sync ohain custom plugin before chef-run. my problem is that I download ohai plugin as a file resource and reload ohai but chef run seems to fail because it needs to access to the custom attribute during the build of resource collection I think
[2014-02-07 08:24:50 -0500] chance: im just wondering if i have 2 arrays defined for the same attributein two roles
[2014-02-07 08:24:56 -0500] chance: how i can keep both and have them merged
[2014-02-07 08:25:00 -0500] chance: instead of one overwriting the other list
[2014-02-07 08:25:04 -0500] coderanger: fitzdsl: The ohai resource re-runs ohai for you automatically
[2014-02-07 08:25:15 -0500] coderanger: chance: Ahh, let me find the link for you
[2014-02-07 08:25:35 -0500] chance: basically i have a cookbook installing packages from a list in an attribute
[2014-02-07 08:25:37 -0500] coderanger: chance: https://coderanger.net/2013/06/arrays-and-chef/
[2014-02-07 08:25:54 -0500] chance: but i have two roles which list packages to install, and one should include the other roles packages while specifying its own
[2014-02-07 08:25:55 -0500] coderanger: chance: Basically never use arrays in Chef attrs, they have terrible semantics and can't be fixed
[2014-02-07 08:26:11 -0500] chance: how to specifiy list of packages to install then?
[2014-02-07 08:26:20 -0500] fitzdsl: coderanger: I know but thing is as I use this custom attribute directly in recipe to make conditional statement I need the plugin before being in "configure node" stage
[2014-02-07 08:26:23 -0500] coderanger: chance: Read that post, it shows two ways of doing it :)
[2014-02-07 08:26:43 -0500] coderanger: fitzdsl: Run the ohai plugin at compile time then
[2014-02-07 08:27:04 -0500] chance: ek i dislike that :\
[2014-02-07 08:27:09 -0500] chance: very verbose
[2014-02-07 08:27:35 -0500] fitzdsl: coderanger: but at very first first run of chef, how do I install the custom plugin on the client during compile time ?
[2014-02-07 08:27:42 -0500] chance: this is just for a vps/laptop/workstation
[2014-02-07 08:28:02 -0500] coderanger: fitzdsl: One sec, writing you an example
[2014-02-07 08:28:05 -0500] chance: just want to get my stuff managed, but im trying to do it right, but the difference between when to use roles vrs cookbooks and then how attributes reside is rough
[2014-02-07 08:28:09 -0500] coderanger: chance: Sorry, dems da breaks
[2014-02-07 08:28:23 -0500] chance: but i suppose that would work
[2014-02-07 08:28:35 -0500] chance: does ruby have a default dict? :<
[2014-02-07 08:28:41 -0500] coderanger: chance: arrays just don't have good meaning in the context of merges
[2014-02-07 08:28:48 -0500] coderanger: chance: Yes, hash supports it nativelt
[2014-02-07 08:28:52 -0500] chance: oh wait this will be in json, so doesnt matter ><
[2014-02-07 08:29:25 -0500] coderanger: Indeed
[2014-02-07 08:30:34 -0500] chance: also, what do you think, put all my recipes for my base role in a base 'role' or a base 'cookbook'?
[2014-02-07 08:30:40 -0500] chance: i mean im kinda doing both anyways
[2014-02-07 08:31:04 -0500] workmad3: chance: personally, I don't use roles anymore
[2014-02-07 08:31:10 -0500] chance: but im wondering whether it makes more sense to just include_recipe in the recipes vrs putting them in a role's runlist
[2014-02-07 08:31:23 -0500] coderanger: fitzdsl: http://hastebin.com/xuqivedoca.rb
[2014-02-07 08:40:34 -0500] chance: workmad3: whys that
[2014-02-07 08:41:34 -0500] workmad3: chance: they're unversionable, you have to think too hard about what happens with attributes, a minor mistake in one can screw up your production env without an easy way to test it in advance...
[2014-02-07 08:42:02 -0500] coderanger: chance: A workflow which is quickly becoming dominant is to basically just use cookbooks for everything
[2014-02-07 08:42:10 -0500] chance: i see
[2014-02-07 08:42:37 -0500] chance: so just no roles, only cookbooks then.
[2014-02-07 08:43:52 -0500] coderanger: Yeah
[2014-02-07 08:44:03 -0500] chance: and then where are you putting the attributes for the specific nodes?
[2014-02-07 08:44:14 -0500] coderanger: There should be no such thing
[2014-02-07 08:44:21 -0500] coderanger: special snowflakes are eeeeevil :)
[2014-02-07 08:44:48 -0500] chance: well my entire setup is just one-offs but configuration is mostly the same
[2014-02-07 08:45:11 -0500] chance: so do you just specify all the attributes in the attributes of the cookbook?
[2014-02-07 08:45:27 -0500] coderanger: Yep
[2014-02-07 08:46:25 -0500] chance: whats the proper way to deal with attributes that are sensative in this form then, just to clarify, are you getting it from databags in the recipe?
[2014-02-07 08:51:01 -0500] coderanger: chance: Citadel is what I use (also I wrote it) but its EC2-specific
[2014-02-07 08:51:11 -0500] coderanger: chef-vault is another popular option
[2014-02-07 08:57:45 -0500] workmad3: coderanger: I also put attributes in the environment :)
[2014-02-07 08:57:53 -0500] fitzdsl: coderanger: thx
[2014-02-07 08:59:34 -0500] workmad3: chance: oh, and this is what I do with my 'automatic' (as in can be generated by the node) sensitive attributes: http://devblog.hedtek.com/2014/02/encrypted-chef-node-data.html
[2014-02-07 09:00:01 -0500] coderanger: workmad3: What do you mean?
[2014-02-07 09:00:30 -0500] workmad3: coderanger: I'll put some attributes in my environment... things like which secure data bag to use
[2014-02-07 09:00:41 -0500] coderanger: Stop doing that
[2014-02-07 09:01:08 -0500] coderanger: attributes belong in one and _only_ one place (if I'm being opinionated)
[2014-02-07 09:01:10 -0500] coderanger: and thats cookbooks
[2014-02-07 09:01:30 -0500] workmad3: coderanger: hmm... these really are things that apply to the environment
[2014-02-07 09:02:09 -0500] workmad3: coderanger: I have a secure data-bag for each of my environments, with their own secrets... which one to use needs to be pushed from the environment, not from the cookbook
[2014-02-07 09:02:24 -0500] coderanger: x = {'prod' => 'foo', }[node.chef_environment]
[2014-02-07 09:02:29 -0500] coderanger: doneburger
[2014-02-07 09:02:41 -0500] workmad3: coderanger: yes, but then I'd have to replicate that across every server cookbook
[2014-02-07 09:02:51 -0500] coderanger: Put it in your base cookbook
[2014-02-07 09:02:56 -0500] workmad3: I don't have a base cookbook
[2014-02-07 09:03:10 -0500] coderanger: You do now :)
[2014-02-07 09:03:21 -0500] workmad3: no, I have environment-specific data in the environment ;)
[2014-02-07 09:03:30 -0500] coderanger: ::shrug::
[2014-02-07 09:03:31 -0500] workmad3: (difference in opinion ;) )
[2014-02-07 09:04:22 -0500] coderanger: It works well enough until you have people stomping on each other while editing those or you want to control their release between envs
[2014-02-07 09:04:35 -0500] coderanger: like slowly rolling out an env-level change
[2014-02-07 09:05:08 -0500] workmad3: it's a tiny amount of infrequently changing data
[2014-02-07 09:06:16 -0500] workmad3: and (importantly) not a replacement for the sort of stuff that I'd have previously put in role attributes
[2014-02-07 09:07:28 -0500] coderanger: workmad3: Just wait until I try and teach people to stop using node attrs entirely :)
[2014-02-07 09:07:39 -0500] workmad3: coderanger: I mostly have ;)
[2014-02-07 09:08:13 -0500] workmad3: coderanger: my node attributes are either environment-specific invariants or autogenerated and stashed there as part of the run
[2014-02-07 09:09:29 -0500] workmad3: coderanger: everything else is either hard-coded in the server recipe or pulled out of data bags and searches, then passed into LWRPs
[2014-02-07 09:09:45 -0500] mattsmith: Is it possible to run a ruby_block based on the value of attributes? i.e i'd like the ruby block to run if one of the following two conditions are met. a) The node does not have attribute A or B set on the chef-server i.e its the first time this recipe has run. b) attribute A or B have now changed and differ from that stored on the chef-server
[2014-02-07 09:14:51 -0500] coderanger: mattsmith: How would you know if it changed?
[2014-02-07 09:15:18 -0500] coderanger: All you see is "the attributes" which are initialized based on server data, but you don't see that as a seperate entity
[2014-02-07 09:15:31 -0500] coderanger: you would need two sets of attrs and copy from one to the other after checking them
[2014-02-07 09:16:02 -0500] mattsmith: coderanger, do the values from the previous run get stored as an ohai attribute?
[2014-02-07 09:38:22 -0500] coderanger: mattsmith: No, they just get saved up to the server
[2014-02-07 09:38:37 -0500] coderanger: mattsmith: everything but the normal level are recomputed on each run though
[2014-02-07 09:39:00 -0500] mattsmith: coderanger, can you query what exists on the server?
[2014-02-07 09:43:54 -0500] coderanger: mattsmith: Sure, though doing that from within a recipe is somewhat non-standard :)
[2014-02-07 09:47:17 -0500] mattsmith: coderanger,  :-)
[2014-02-07 09:48:08 -0500] ay_: coderanger: Is there some sort of group function for knife search?
[2014-02-07 09:48:22 -0500] coderanger: ay_: Need more description than that
[2014-02-07 09:48:32 -0500] ay_: It would be cool if you could do
[2014-02-07 09:48:33 -0500] coderanger: 2AM noahbrain no work so gud
[2014-02-07 09:48:34 -0500] ay_:  $ knife search "name:*" -g langauges.php.version
[2014-02-07 09:48:49 -0500] ay_: And group all servers under each version of php
[2014-02-07 09:48:57 -0500] coderanger: Ahh, no, write a script :)
[2014-02-07 09:49:07 -0500] coderanger: knife is mostly literal wrappers for single API calls
[2014-02-07 09:49:07 -0500] ay_: would creating a knife plugin work?
[2014-02-07 09:49:12 -0500] coderanger: Sure, overkill though
[2014-02-07 09:49:42 -0500] ay_: I like overkill. Scripts are so.. lame.
[2014-02-07 09:49:43 -0500] ay_: :-)
[2014-02-07 09:50:35 -0500] ay_: coderanger: But you see the cool things you could do with that?
[2014-02-07 09:51:05 -0500] ay_: say that you have attributes with owners of projects
[2014-02-07 09:51:22 -0500] ay_:  $ knife search "name:*" -g owner.ops.pri
[2014-02-07 09:51:36 -0500] spheromak: knife exec script
[2014-02-07 09:51:56 -0500] coderanger: ay_: I guess, I've never wanted such a thing and I can't imagine needing it :P
[2014-02-07 09:53:29 -0500] ay_: We have about 180 machines, but not more than say 5-6 are them are for the same project. All those has their own stage and dev servers etc. So I haven't found the best way to fit this into chef. Still trying stuff out
[2014-02-07 09:53:37 -0500] ay_: Even though we'be been running chef for 2 years.
[2014-02-07 09:54:20 -0500] ay_: How do people mark seperate projects within chef? emtpy roles? enviroments?
[2014-02-07 09:54:22 -0500] ay_: tags?
[2014-02-07 09:54:28 -0500] coderanger: Different cookbooks
[2014-02-07 10:10:53 -0500] ay_: coderanger: They share 80% of the cookbooks.
[2014-02-07 10:11:26 -0500] n1ko: wrapper cookbooks and role names
[2014-02-07 10:11:27 -0500] ay_: So you use sort of empty cookbooks that just include other cookbooks instead of roles?
[2014-02-07 10:11:43 -0500] coderanger: ay_: Sure, but the actual project cookbooks are different
[2014-02-07 10:13:11 -0500] ay_: Hm. So how to you, using chef target machines in three different projects?
[2014-02-07 10:30:33 -0500] mattsmith: coderanger, A thought! could i write the attribute values to a file and then have a notifies within that? that way the ruby block would get executed by the notifies when the file is changed?
[2014-02-07 10:30:43 -0500] coderanger: Sure
[2014-02-07 10:30:57 -0500] mattsmith: guess thats the easiest soloution?
[2014-02-07 10:32:12 -0500] spheromak: coderanger: goto bed ;)
[2014-02-07 10:32:13 -0500] spheromak: its late
[2014-02-07 10:32:16 -0500] coderanger: spheromak: Soon
[2014-02-07 10:32:30 -0500] coderanger: spheromak: http://i.coderanger.net/aw6Zx.png
[2014-02-07 10:32:47 -0500] spheromak: :)
[2014-02-07 10:32:48 -0500] coderanger: spheromak: Been working on stuff to manage 100% of our network via cloudformation
[2014-02-07 10:32:52 -0500] coderanger: this is field test #1
[2014-02-07 10:33:23 -0500] coderanger: You just aim it at a region and it creates a full Balanced data center
[2014-02-07 10:33:32 -0500] spheromak: nice
[2014-02-07 10:33:45 -0500] spheromak: i have some DC bootstrap foo
[2014-02-07 10:34:00 -0500] spheromak: I want to move some stuff to chef-metal
[2014-02-07 10:34:03 -0500] spheromak: :\
[2014-02-07 10:34:29 -0500] coderanger: I looked at chef-metal, but cloudformation seemed easier since we're already drinking a lot of AWS koolaid
[2014-02-07 10:34:48 -0500] spheromak: yea for sure
[2014-02-07 10:35:17 -0500] spheromak: tho chef-metal could provide an abstraction that could be pretty powerfull for that
[2014-02-07 10:35:21 -0500] spheromak: and more portable
[2014-02-07 10:35:35 -0500] spheromak: couple of 'coulds' in there :D
[2014-02-07 10:36:01 -0500] coderanger: cloudformation is already pretty portable since the only thing comparable to it is openstack heat
[2014-02-07 10:36:10 -0500] coderanger: and conveniently heat is a direct port and uses the same DSL
[2014-02-07 10:36:11 -0500] coderanger: :)
[2014-02-07 10:36:29 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2014-02-07 10:36:41 -0500] spheromak: heat
[2014-02-07 10:36:48 -0500] spheromak: ..
[2014-02-07 11:00:19 -0500] lopezt: Hey guys
[2014-02-07 11:00:38 -0500] lopezt: i have a weird error message i didnt find a solution yet
[2014-02-07 11:00:56 -0500] lopezt: "Response:  Invalid signature for user or client" pops up when i try to use knife client list
[2014-02-07 11:01:14 -0500] lopezt: any ideas?
[2014-02-07 11:04:19 -0500] spheromak: lopezt: might be some timing issue. is your clock sqewed far from the chef-server ?
[2014-02-07 11:04:37 -0500] lopezt: hmm
[2014-02-07 11:04:56 -0500] lopezt: spheromak: i dont know where the chef-server is located actually
[2014-02-07 11:05:18 -0500] spheromak: this on hosted chef ?
[2014-02-07 12:14:37 -0500] davsharyan33: Hi All, in case I have multiple interfaces/IPs on the server. How chef-client/ohai decides which one is the primary one node[:ipaddress] ? Is it always the first interface by index , excluded loopback ? thanks
[2014-02-07 13:15:00 -0500] silk1: davsharyan33: The ipaddress for the interface with the default route. http://docs.opscode.com/ohai.html
[2014-02-07 13:15:56 -0500] davsharyan33: silk: thanks
[2014-02-07 13:16:05 -0500] silk: you're welcome
[2014-02-07 13:19:34 -0500] davsharyan33: silk: that means, if there is no default gateway it's gonna be nil and I have to specify the interface
[2014-02-07 13:21:31 -0500] silk: im looking at admittedly an old version of ohai, and it seems to indicate if there is a default route, then use that interface/ipaddress otherwise use the first ethernet interface
[2014-02-07 13:21:57 -0500] silk: looking to see how it determines first
[2014-02-07 13:32:27 -0500] silk: I dont remember what version of ruby started returning hash keys in the order in which they were inserted, but I _think_ it relies on that
[2014-02-07 13:32:39 -0500] silk: Ruby isnt really my thing
[2014-02-07 13:33:05 -0500] silk: and they appear to be inserted into the network Mash in the order that they are returned from ifconfig -a (well at least nder OSX)
[2014-02-07 13:34:59 -0500] davsharyan33: silk: okai thanks. I spent too much time on some things , going to hardcode interface name
[2014-02-07 13:49:38 -0500] sarkis: hey guys, is there a recommended pattern to folow to avoid headaches in the future, i just read about the abstract pattern so far
[2014-02-07 13:50:06 -0500] phutchin1: woo!! saw someone mention opsworks moved off of ruby 1.8 :D
[2014-02-07 13:50:10 -0500] phutchin1: that makes my day...
[2014-02-07 14:26:40 -0500] n1ko: what is actually happening under the hood when you upload environment? I mean, its ridiculously slow even with chef-zero and plain text stuff (like users in a data bag)
[2014-02-07 14:27:03 -0500] n1ko: one users json file is around 10-15 lines and it takes almost as many seconds to upload
[2014-02-07 14:27:06 -0500] n1ko: per user
[2014-02-07 14:43:25 -0500] ay_: Hm.
[2014-02-07 14:43:32 -0500] ay_: WHy is knife search so slow?
[2014-02-07 14:43:54 -0500] ay_: knife search 'name:*' -a langauges.php.version takes around 13 seconds on my machine.
[2014-02-07 14:44:09 -0500] ay_: What is the slowdown there?
[2014-02-07 14:53:23 -0500] [ROOT]XxNeoLiTHi: hi all, on the chef webui, is there a config setting I can change to prevent it from using the fqdn at all (I want it to redirect to the IP specifically and use the IP for everything since my external customers wont be able to resolve our internal fqdn).
[2014-02-07 15:37:36 -0500] vankeisb: hi
[2014-02-07 15:37:46 -0500] vankeisb: is it a place for noob questions ?
[2014-02-07 15:38:28 -0500] vankeisb: I have a problem trying to use apt_repository
[2014-02-07 15:38:55 -0500] vankeisb: It doesn't seem to find the function : ERROR: No resource or method named `apt_repository' for `Chef::Recipe "default"'
[2014-02-07 15:39:10 -0500] vankeisb: dependency problem ?
[2014-02-07 15:41:13 -0500] laurent\: looks like it
[2014-02-07 15:41:47 -0500] vankeisb: I have declared the del in metadata.rb
[2014-02-07 15:41:53 -0500] vankeisb: the del sorry
[2014-02-07 15:41:55 -0500] vankeisb: the dep
[2014-02-07 15:42:34 -0500] vankeisb: is declaring the dependency sufficient, or do I need to specifically call include_recipe "apt" ? Note that I have tried both and none are working...
[2014-02-07 15:42:57 -0500] laurent\: depends "apt" should be enough
[2014-02-07 15:43:03 -0500] vankeisb: hmmmm...
[2014-02-07 15:43:15 -0500] laurent\: have you uploaded the apt cookbook ?
[2014-02-07 15:43:57 -0500] vankeisb: yes
[2014-02-07 15:44:03 -0500] vankeisb: when I upload "my" cookbook
[2014-02-07 15:44:13 -0500] vankeisb: it does upload the apt cookbook
[2014-02-07 15:44:23 -0500] vankeisb: I'm passing --include-dependencies
[2014-02-07 15:44:50 -0500] strictlyb: anyone here using openstack and have a few mnutes to chat?
[2014-02-07 15:45:05 -0500] vankeisb: then my other cookbook (which depends on apt) attempts to call apt_repository, but fails
[2014-02-07 15:46:17 -0500] vankeisb: erf, I get it, myyyyy bad, sorry : I followed the screencasts earlier, and created my own 'apt' cookbook
[2014-02-07 15:46:33 -0500] vankeisb: I guess I only need to dl the actual apt now
[2014-02-07 15:46:48 -0500] vankeisb: thanks for the help
[2014-02-07 15:54:30 -0500] sarkis: is this still pretty accurate on what to do/not do? http://dougireton.com/blog/2013/02/16/chef-cookbook-anti-patterns/
[2014-02-07 15:54:46 -0500] sarkis: anti-patterns - don't do, patterns - do
[2014-02-07 15:58:26 -0500] thom: the role stuff is somewhat controversial, but the advice on not modifying community cookbooks and using wrapper cookbooks for them is good
[2014-02-07 16:02:44 -0500] CaptainQuirk: ohai !
[2014-02-07 16:03:05 -0500] CaptainQuirk: how would you manage users when provisioning a physical machine using chef solo
[2014-02-07 16:03:23 -0500] CaptainQuirk: mainly the  give sudo privileges  to the user part
[2014-02-07 16:07:41 -0500] CaptainQuirk: Since a user's already created on install
[2014-02-07 16:12:59 -0500] sarkis: thom: thanks!
[2014-02-07 16:13:24 -0500] bschlueter: I'm trying to use the output of a command which is install during a chef run, but the command never successfully executes. Does anyone have any experiece with that?
[2014-02-07 16:14:07 -0500] sarkis: thom: so with the roles is it saying to have like an extra recipe on top of the node that defines a role which does all the actual include_recipe? am i understanding that correctly?
[2014-02-07 16:14:44 -0500] sarkis: and i guess the converse side of the argument is.. that is just adding an extra layer of complexity that is not necessary?
[2014-02-07 16:15:33 -0500] bschlueter: we can tell the  command is being executed at the begining of the chef run, but that's not helpful since it's not installed
[2014-02-07 16:18:50 -0500] bschlueter: Basically, we're trying to define a resource
[2014-02-07 16:19:03 -0500] bschlueter: But the resource is running before the program is installed
[2014-02-07 16:19:34 -0500] bschlueter: And if we run the method on the resource after the program is installed, it's acting like it isn't
[2014-02-07 16:19:50 -0500] bschlueter: Is it true that all the methods of a resource are called when the resource is loaded?
[2014-02-07 16:20:35 -0500] jchauncey: what do you mean methods of a resource?
[2014-02-07 16:20:48 -0500] jchauncey: methods located in the resources/foo.rb?
[2014-02-07 16:22:22 -0500] bschlueter: no, on a class defined in a library
[2014-02-07 16:23:32 -0500] bschlueter: so we have a Cluster class defined in a resource with a getMembers method
[2014-02-07 16:23:50 -0500] bschlueter: that method calls `serf members`
[2014-02-07 16:24:33 -0500] bschlueter: but we can't get it to use a serf installation that added during the same chef run
[2014-02-07 16:24:51 -0500] zeknox: when you want to customize a package like assigning a default app to use for nginx, is that always done in the node?
[2014-02-07 16:27:46 -0500] bschlueter: @zeknox yeah, if you're using the opscode nginx cookbook you can specify the binary with node['nginx'][['binary']
[2014-02-07 16:28:18 -0500] zeknox: bschlueter: is each cookbook different in this regard, my biggest issues are customizing a cookbook to my needs
[2014-02-07 16:31:17 -0500] ringods: Anyone confident with the application cookbook? How should I pass svn credentials?
[2014-02-07 16:31:25 -0500] bschlueter: @zeknox yeah, they could have it specified elsewhere too, you'll have to look through the cookbook to figure out what it's using
[2014-02-07 16:32:00 -0500] helfire: i'm using latest berks, and i have it pulling from my git repo, but i keep getting unable to find a solution for demands: and it lists all the cookbooks it just downloaded any idea whats up?
[2014-02-07 16:32:24 -0500] zeknox: bschlueter: you know of any good documentation on customizing receipes by example?
[2014-02-07 16:33:28 -0500] aujt74: Hi, anyone know why with the application LWRP might not be sending notifications? Even when it's set to action :force_deploy? I've got notifies :run, 'execute[fix_uploads_owner]', :immediately at the end of the provider call, but the execute resource isn't running.
[2014-02-07 16:33:47 -0500] btm_: ringods: coderanger is the application cookbook expert. wait for him to show up and ask him :)
[2014-02-07 16:33:56 -0500] bschlueter: @zeknox opscode's docs are good
[2014-02-07 16:34:03 -0500] ringods: btm_: tnx.
[2014-02-07 16:36:47 -0500] bschlueter: New question: how can I install a program using Chef and then run it on the command line?
[2014-02-07 16:37:00 -0500] bschlueter: To use that output later in the recipe?
[2014-02-07 16:37:42 -0500] aujt74: Ah, am I reading it right that LWRPs can't send notifies?
[2014-02-07 16:40:47 -0500] btm: aujt74: they can, you probably need to add 'use_inline_resources' to your provider -- http://docs.opscode.com/lwrp_common_inline_compile.html
[2014-02-07 16:41:16 -0500] tehnef: I'm newly learning chef over the past couple of months...??I'm pulling back on roles in order to spend time later creating a role cookbook that will be versioned, and I'm noticing for the first time that "knife node show" doesn't show all the cookbooks I'm using in the "Recipes:" field. Is this normal?
[2014-02-07 16:41:52 -0500] tehnef: whoops I'm sorry, I thought I was in #learnchef
[2014-02-07 16:42:07 -0500] aujt74: Yeah, just came across that. @btm. I'm using the application LWRP. Which I note doesn't have use_inline_resources in the provider :(
[2014-02-07 16:42:08 -0500] jchauncey: @helfire: you may want to try using HEAD instead of beta5
[2014-02-07 16:46:39 -0500] jchauncey: bschlueter: are you sure its not an ordering problem?
[2014-02-07 16:47:51 -0500] helfire: @jchauncey i got it working, was missing a local dep, but not sure why it didnt just tell me exactly what cb i was missing
[2014-02-07 16:48:55 -0500] jchauncey: helfire: k. we patched berkshelf last week because of an issue where you needed to call berks install multiple times to get all of your deps in the local cache
[2014-02-07 16:57:19 -0500] bschlueter: jhauncey: we're doing an include_recipe for the recipe that installs serf before trying to create a new instance of the class but the ruby code appears to be being run when the resources are being collected
[2014-02-07 17:05:54 -0500] jblancett: Can anyone help me with recipe attributes?  I have a cookbook I'm using as a 'wrapper' cookbook for a community cookbook.  I try to specify some attributes as override in my wrapper, but the root cookbook is still using the attributes set in its own attributes file
[2014-02-07 17:06:12 -0500] jblancett: this has worked in the past but doesn't seem to now
[2014-02-07 17:06:45 -0500] jbz: jblancett: do you have the code in a gist/pasite?
[2014-02-07 17:06:47 -0500] jbz: er, pastie
[2014-02-07 17:07:35 -0500] jblancett: not exactly but I can show you what I mean
[2014-02-07 17:07:52 -0500] jblancett: in this case I'm using the community couchbase cookbook
[2014-02-07 17:08:03 -0500] jblancett: so lets say I have a cookbook called wrapper
[2014-02-07 17:08:13 -0500] jblancett: wrapper depends on couchbase
[2014-02-07 17:08:35 -0500] jblancett: in wrapper/attributes/couchbase.rb I have :
[2014-02-07 17:08:35 -0500] jblancett: override['couchbase']['server']['version'] = "2.1.1"
[2014-02-07 17:09:07 -0500] jblancett: then I have a wrapper/recipes/couchbase.rb that just does include_recipe 'couchbase::server'
[2014-02-07 17:09:38 -0500] jblancett: the couchbase::server recipe still sees that attribute as the default
[2014-02-07 17:09:59 -0500] jblancett: default['couchbase']['server']['version'] = "2.0.1"
[2014-02-07 17:10:43 -0500] jblancett: so the attribute override doesn't seem to be working
[2014-02-07 17:10:58 -0500] jblancett: I've done this same thing in the past and it has worked
[2014-02-07 17:11:01 -0500] jbz: hm
[2014-02-07 17:12:15 -0500] jbz: jblancett: try setting it as normal, not overridenormal is still higher precedence
[2014-02-07 17:12:57 -0500] jblancett: ok will give it a shot
[2014-02-07 17:13:17 -0500] jblancett: same thing
[2014-02-07 17:13:48 -0500] jblancett: I added this to both recipes:  Chef::Log.info("Installing couchbase-server version #{node['couchbase']['server']['version']}")
[2014-02-07 17:13:58 -0500] jblancett: the wrapper shows the correct version, base recipe does not
[2014-02-07 17:20:37 -0500] bschlueter: Here's the issue we're seeing, in a succinct form
[2014-02-07 17:20:50 -0500] bschlueter: I have a two line recipe:
[2014-02-07 17:21:02 -0500] bschlueter: include_recipe "deka::serf"
[2014-02-07 17:21:15 -0500] bschlueter: log `serf members -format=json`
[2014-02-07 17:21:25 -0500] jbz: jblancett: Sorry, I don't have a good answer for you :-/
[2014-02-07 17:21:53 -0500] jblancett: its ok.  something simple thats just bugging me
[2014-02-07 17:23:23 -0500] bschlueter: Why doesn't chef report anything?
[2014-02-07 17:23:45 -0500] bschlueter: This is driving me crazy. It really looks like Chef is broken.

[2014-02-07 17:24:40 -0500] kallistec: bschlueter: this is compile vs. converge stuff
[2014-02-07 17:25:23 -0500] kallistec: bschlueter: the outcome of running your recipe code is a big list of resources, which chef then goes through and runs the actions on
[2014-02-07 17:25:58 -0500] kallistec: bschlueter: if you need to run some code during the convergence process, then you want to use the ruby_block resource
[2014-02-07 17:27:33 -0500] bschlueter: I tried that, the code still failed as if serf hadn't been installed yet
[2014-02-07 17:28:11 -0500] bschlueter: running the command in an execute block succeeds, but that's not helpful unless I can get it's output
[2014-02-07 17:28:41 -0500] bschlueter: oh wait, I think I wrote it wrong

[2014-02-07 20:00:14 -0500] AntelopeSalad: random question: do you guys bother to include your application cookbook inside of your app's repo? maybe in a /deploy or /chef folder, etc.
[2014-02-07 20:16:11 -0500] Doc_IX: AntelopeSalad: i tend to keep all app cookbooks centrally located and not with individual application code. . . but i work with several dozen apps, so trying to get to multiple different locations is a pain. if you're just eadling with a few apps, your pain calculus might be different.
[2014-02-07 20:17:05 -0500] CPS: i've got an application that i'm using a chef template to generate an xml config file for
[2014-02-07 20:17:35 -0500] CPS: the application is under development and different environments will have different versions of the xml format (new fields and such)
[2014-02-07 20:17:45 -0500] CPS: what's a good way to handle this case with chef?
[2014-02-07 20:19:06 -0500] AntelopeSalad: dylannorthrup: what made you switch? i figured it would be less painless if the app cookbook was with the app itself
[2014-02-07 20:20:17 -0500] AntelopeSalad: *painful

[2014-02-07 20:48:11 -0500] railsraider: see my line is actually processing a cookbook but it none:noe
[2014-02-07 20:48:23 -0500] railsraider: maybe its the new chef-client?
[2014-02-07 20:49:12 -0500] railsraider: its 11.10.0
[2014-02-07 20:49:20 -0500] railsraider: i think that this is the cause
[2014-02-07 20:54:25 -0500] AntelopeSalad: zeknox: it's a decent base to work off of but there's not much support around it
[2014-02-07 20:54:39 -0500] AntelopeSalad: i mean community driven support/tutorials/etc.
[2014-02-07 20:56:00 -0500] zeknox: AntelopeSalad: correct, im struggling for the life of me to get a rails deployment rockin'
[2014-02-07 20:56:46 -0500] AntelopeSalad: zeknox, yeah there's a massive roadblock atm if you're looking to convert app deployment from capistrano to chef using rails
[2014-02-07 20:57:56 -0500] zeknox: AntelopeSalad: i have no deployment process atm, just trying to figure out how to automate a rails + postgres + app instance
[2014-02-07 20:58:27 -0500] AntelopeSalad: zeknox: there's a lot of tutorials/help around the topic of setting up the server itself with chef, but not so much app deployment
[2014-02-07 20:59:12 -0500] zeknox: AntelopeSalad: well im struggling with the server side atm
[2014-02-07 20:59:21 -0500] AntelopeSalad: zeknox: have you ever set a server up without chef?
[2014-02-07 20:59:37 -0500] zeknox: AntelopeSalad: yes, i know how to manually install what i need
[2014-02-07 21:00:01 -0500] AntelopeSalad: that's half the battle, next up you just need to figure out which cookbooks you want to do the tasks you already know how to do by hand
[2014-02-07 21:00:10 -0500] AntelopeSalad: *want to use to do
[2014-02-07 21:00:42 -0500] zeknox: AntelopeSalad: whats the best way to customize the cookbook, can i just move the cookbook to site-cookbooks and then edit the attribute and stuff?
[2014-02-07 21:01:11 -0500] AntelopeSalad: there are many different patterns when it comes to managing cookbooks
[2014-02-07 21:01:36 -0500] zeknox: AntelopeSalad: is the one i mentioned acceptable, or what do you reccomend?
[2014-02-07 21:01:44 -0500] AntelopeSalad: everyone has different opinions but i really like the "application cookbook" pattern while using berkshelf
[2014-02-07 21:02:36 -0500] AntelopeSalad: the idea is you have 1 cookbook outside of your chef folder for each app you make, berkshelf manages all of your deps similar to how bundle works with rails
[2014-02-07 21:02:38 -0500] railsraider: anyone knows what would cause chef to flip like that
[2014-02-07 21:02:47 -0500] AntelopeSalad: *bundler
[2014-02-07 21:02:51 -0500] railsraider: making cookbooks runlist as none:none
[2014-02-07 21:03:56 -0500] zeknox: AntelopeSalad: so if im understanding this correctly the application_ruby cookbook is part of the application cookbook overall?
[2014-02-07 21:04:45 -0500] AntelopeSalad: zeknox: i would forget about application_ruby for now and just figure out getting your server setup with chef first
[2014-02-07 21:05:33 -0500] AntelopeSalad: because trying to go migrate from manual server provisioning and capistrano to full on chef for both setting up your server and handling your app deployment is going to be close to impossible to do at the same time
[2014-02-07 21:07:30 -0500] zeknox: AntelopeSalad: my bad, i thought application_ruby installed apache, rails, unicorn, etc for me... its meant to deploy the app on top of those
[2014-02-07 21:07:50 -0500] railsraider: its 11.11
[2014-02-07 21:07:54 -0500] railsraider: its a bug
[2014-02-07 21:08:07 -0500] railsraider: 11.8 doesnt make none:none for cookbook name
[2014-02-07 21:08:22 -0500] AntelopeSalad: zeknox: if you use all of that stuff it might help you get the ball rolling, but i wouldn't adjust my stack just because application_ruby uses those things
[2014-02-07 21:09:44 -0500] AntelopeSalad: zeknox: yeah, that's what i'm doing at the moment
[2014-02-07 21:10:04 -0500] AntelopeSalad: but you don't need application_ruby at all to do that
[2014-02-07 21:10:31 -0500] zeknox: AntelopeSalad: makes perfect sense, thank you sir
[2014-02-07 21:11:20 -0500] AntelopeSalad: zeknox: sec, i'll gist up a mini resource guide to get you going
[2014-02-07 21:13:39 -0500] AntelopeSalad: zeknox: https://gist.github.com/AntelopeSalad/8871948
[2014-02-07 21:15:24 -0500] zeknox: AntelopeSalad: thanks man!
[2014-02-07 21:15:57 -0500] AntelopeSalad: once you're comfortable with all of that, then you can worry about weening yourself off of capistrano and let chef handle everything
[2014-02-07 21:18:54 -0500] zeknox: AntelopeSalad: will do, ill work on understanding chef better, the problem i always have is customizing things, like creating a default db user and stuff
[2014-02-07 21:19:49 -0500] AntelopeSalad: zeknox: yeah, that is the problem chef will solve for you
[2014-02-07 21:20:16 -0500] AntelopeSalad: for example there's a postgres cookbook that gets postgres installed and creates the db user, etc.
[2014-02-07 21:20:36 -0500] zeknox: AntelopeSalad: so ive used the postgres cookbook, and it install psql for me no probs there
[2014-02-07 21:55:30 -0500] dhoer: Is this the proper place to ask a chefspec question?
[2014-02-07 21:57:29 -0500] someara: sure whats up
[2014-02-07 22:06:43 -0500] dhoer: Is it possible to add an additional cookbook_path to chefspec and keeping the berkshelf cookbook_path?
[2014-02-07 22:12:20 -0500] aujt74: Hi coderanger, you got a moment if you are about please? Is there a reason why application LWRP doesn't have use_inline_resources set? And is there a better way to get resource notifications working other than just adding that line in into the provider locally? Thanks!
[2014-02-07 22:24:41 -0500] ignatz: hm should I update my chef client
[2014-02-07 22:34:57 -0500] coderanger: aujt74: It predates use_inline_resources by a year or two
[2014-02-07 22:38:24 -0500] aujt74: coderanger: Ok thanks, that makes sense. I take it the only way I can get notifications from it is to fork the cookbook and add use_inline_resources into the provider?
[2014-02-07 22:43:55 -0500] coderanger: I'm not sure that would have the effect you are expecting
[2014-02-07 22:44:08 -0500] coderanger: the app cookbooks need to be majorly rewritten
[2014-02-07 22:44:37 -0500] coderanger: right now, for example, all of the plugin actions take place in deploy resource callbacks, which are invisible to use_inline_resources
[2014-02-07 22:46:17 -0500] estebistec: playing with the link resource. it seems to never set updated_by_last_action
[2014-02-07 22:46:37 -0500] estebistec: re-run with no change, change the symlink target, either way updated_by_last_action is false :/
[2014-02-07 22:46:57 -0500] andy__: Hi guys, we are about to write a memcached cookbook that allows to choose version of memcached to install, and setup multiple memcached instance. We looked at the current memcached cookbook it doesn't have those options
[2014-02-07 22:51:26 -0500] freezey: andy__: so write one :)
[2014-02-07 22:52:14 -0500] andy__: I was curious why those features I listed  above are not available yet. Aren't they useful?
[2014-02-07 22:52:31 -0500] freezey: ah yeah i dunno. i wrote one to do this for me
[2014-02-07 22:53:07 -0500] estebistec: freezey: of course it will be written, but one wants to do due diligence before diving into a new resource
[2014-02-07 22:53:16 -0500] freezey: true
[2014-02-07 22:53:18 -0500] estebistec: I've written a couple myself lately that I'd like to push back to the community cookbooks
[2014-02-07 22:53:28 -0500] freezey: yeah
[2014-02-07 22:53:31 -0500] estebistec: some stuff in python
[2014-02-07 22:53:41 -0500] estebistec: and just wrote one that could go back into nginx
[2014-02-07 22:53:58 -0500] aujt74: Ah, ok thanks for the clarification coderanger. The intended effect would be for post deployment resources to be notified and run only after a new revision is deployed. I guess I'll just try it out and see what the side effects are. Will probably just fallback to using the deploy_revision directly.
[2014-02-07 22:54:23 -0500] andy__: freezey are you thinking to push what you've done to the community?
[2014-02-07 22:54:32 -0500] freezey: yeah i should
[2014-02-07 22:54:37 -0500] freezey: i will opensource it later tonight
[2014-02-07 22:54:39 -0500] coderanger: aujt74: Make a subresource plugin
[2014-02-07 22:54:45 -0500] freezey: its not beautiful but it works
[2014-02-07 22:54:45 -0500] freezey: heh
[2014-02-07 22:55:30 -0500] andy__: cool I'll take a look over it.
[2014-02-07 22:55:32 -0500] estebistec: freezey, what exactly is your memcached code? resource for individual instances?
[2014-02-07 22:55:34 -0500] coderanger: aujt74: Thats how all the other stuff is implemented
[2014-02-07 22:56:17 -0500] freezey: estebistec: no it just uses lwrp and providers to create a memcached instances based off of a instance name
[2014-02-07 22:56:41 -0500] freezey: so you pass an instance name and could use defaults if you need or set new attribs and it will create the config memcached-instancename and the startup script as well memcached-instance name
[2014-02-07 22:57:11 -0500] estebistec: okay, so if you had several daemons to run, on different ports with different memory limits you could just invoke the lwrp multiple times?
[2014-02-07 22:57:39 -0500] freezey: estebistec: for what this one does you would just create a different recipe for each new instance and just apply them all to the node run list
[2014-02-07 22:58:05 -0500] freezey: so i had a ohai attrib that would look for an aliased interface and grab that in the cookbook for what interface to listen on
[2014-02-07 22:58:08 -0500] estebistec: interesting
[2014-02-07 22:58:11 -0500] freezey: yeah
[2014-02-07 22:58:18 -0500] estebistec: you have any plans to push it back to community memcached?
[2014-02-07 22:58:22 -0500] freezey: yeah i can do that
[2014-02-07 22:58:33 -0500] freezey: so how i would alias the interface would be like eth0:whatever
[2014-02-07 22:58:38 -0500] freezey: and thats how i would apply it
[2014-02-07 22:58:39 -0500] freezey: yada yada
[2014-02-07 22:58:49 -0500] freezey: it worked for me since i would run multiple instances on the same node for different apps
[2014-02-07 22:59:30 -0500] freezey: the ohai attrib would do a simple search like memcached[:instancename] = ip if int.include?("instancename")
[2014-02-07 22:59:33 -0500] freezey: worked out quite well
[2014-02-07 23:00:02 -0500] estebistec: yeah, that sounds kinda cool
[2014-02-07 23:00:02 -0500] freezey: if i didnt have to catch the train i would opensource it now :)
[2014-02-07 23:00:10 -0500] estebistec: no problem
[2014-02-07 23:00:16 -0500] estebistec: I can't be too demanding
[2014-02-07 23:00:23 -0500] freezey: lol
[2014-02-07 23:00:27 -0500] estebistec: Just inquiring, trying to avoid duplication where possible :P
[2014-02-07 23:00:37 -0500] freezey: sure
[2014-02-07 23:00:44 -0500] freezey: i will push it out later tonight
[2014-02-07 23:00:48 -0500] freezey: and paste it to you
[2014-02-07 23:00:50 -0500] freezey: if your still here
[2014-02-07 23:00:54 -0500] aujt74: coderanger: ok, will look into that. Deploying a PHP app so needing to roll my own for certain bits. Used application_ruby quite successfully with Rails before so naturally picked up application again for this. Thanks for the pointers anyway!
[2014-02-07 23:01:07 -0500] estebistec: hmm... I might be. better that I watch your github (or bitbucket, whatever) account
[2014-02-07 23:01:16 -0500] coderanger: aujt74: Just look at how the subresources are implemented
