[2014-02-05 00:01:22 -0500] strictlyb: so basicaly, yeah i have a mongo env and i been using that for a whole for replica sets,
[2014-02-05 00:01:45 -0500] strictlyb: the latest updates are not working with mongos/configserver
[2014-02-05 00:02:00 -0500] strictlyb: i wanted to see if anyone can see if im doijng something wrong here, or what the better way to do it/handle it is,
[2014-02-05 00:03:38 -0500] gmr: grr, trying to use Chef::HTTP::BasicClient in a LWRP provider but can't get the darn thing to include correctly
[2014-02-05 00:03:39 -0500] cwj: strictlyb: meaning you have upgraded the mongodb cookbook and now things are busted?
[2014-02-05 00:04:42 -0500] cwj: strictlyb: i havent been following development of that cookbook recently, so im not sure what to tell you there
[2014-02-05 00:05:00 -0500] strictlyb: yesh
[2014-02-05 00:05:19 -0500] strictlyb: if i had something bettet to use i would be open to it is your public or priv?
[2014-02-05 00:05:38 -0500] cwj: this is the cookbook i wrote https://github.com/needle-cookbooks/chef-mongodb-composable
[2014-02-05 00:05:54 -0500] cwj: it doesnt do configservers yet but i will likely be adding that in the near future
[2014-02-05 00:07:04 -0500] cwj: you can find a usage example in the test cookbook https://github.com/needle-cookbooks/chef-mongodb-composable/blob/master/test/cookbooks/mongodb-test/recipes/mongod.rb
[2014-02-05 00:10:12 -0500] cwj: looks like the existing mongodb cookbook is working on a similar refactor https://github.com/edelight/chef-mongodb/pull/194
[2014-02-05 00:10:20 -0500] cwj: i havent had a chance to look at it
[2014-02-05 00:15:24 -0500] kshep: huh. "undefined method `data_bag_item'" in my template helper

[2014-02-05 00:39:40 -0500] forehand: I'm trying to use the sql server cookbook to install sql server 2008 r2, but I'm not sure what url to set the install package to.  In the example they use an exe hosted my M$.  I have the install media, but not sure what executable to ref. Anyone have experience or know who I can ask about this?
[2014-02-05 00:48:08 -0500] sauraus: Question about attributes, is the following allowed:
[2014-02-05 00:48:10 -0500] sauraus:   default["tomcat"]["url"] = "http://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-#{node["tomcat"]["base_version"].split(".")[0]}/v#{node["tomcat"]["base_version"]}/bin/#{node["tomcat"]["tarball"]}"
[2014-02-05 00:48:34 -0500] sauraus: The split(".") is giving an error saying undefined method, but why?
[2014-02-05 01:39:14 -0500] bettyclamp: How do I get an environment (ruby) file to lookup the role list at run time?
[2014-02-05 01:40:03 -0500] bettyclamp: The roles are in default attribute 'roles', so what I (a newbie) think I'm really asking is: how do I lookup that default attribute?
[2014-02-05 01:53:15 -0500] wassy121: sauraus: perhaps the value is nil ?  Or split is being called on an object that doesn't allow that method
[2014-02-05 02:32:27 -0500] sauraus: @wassy121 split() is being called on a string node[][] object

[2014-02-05 02:38:59 -0500] coderanger: brimstone: Delete the client in addition to the node
[2014-02-05 02:39:27 -0500] brimstone: coderanger: ok, i'll try that next, thanks!
[2014-02-05 02:41:35 -0500] mjuszczak: thank you.
[2014-02-05 02:42:07 -0500] EJC: where on the node can I see the successful chef run log?
[2014-02-05 03:04:29 -0500] coderanger: EJC: Depends on how you configured chef-client
[2014-02-05 03:04:39 -0500] coderanger: By default I don't think it writes a log file, just stdout
[2014-02-05 03:06:33 -0500] EJC: having a heluva time with chef 10
[2014-02-05 03:06:46 -0500] EJC: approaching the point of "just one giant sys exec"
[2014-02-05 03:08:35 -0500] coderanger: EJC: What are you trying to automate?
[2014-02-05 03:09:10 -0500] EJC: god - I'm so far down this rabbit hole at this point....lol
[2014-02-05 03:09:41 -0500] EJC: I started by having this nice cookbook and trying to write a wrapper, but the wrapper in chef 10 kept putting in the object reference instead of the value
[2014-02-05 03:09:42 -0500] coderanger: ::fistbump
[2014-02-05 03:09:54 -0500] EJC: so I ditched that and just started hacking the "parent" cookbook
[2014-02-05 03:10:04 -0500] coderanger: I just wanted to deploy some PHP apps, 3 years later and I'm neck deep in AWS for a payments company
[2014-02-05 03:10:05 -0500] EJC: now at this point, I can't get the service to actually start via chef
[2014-02-05 03:10:12 -0500] EJC: OMFG YES
[2014-02-05 03:10:18 -0500] EJC: ^^^^that
[2014-02-05 03:10:34 -0500] EJC: anyway, the chef run ends with "service started" kinda stuff, but it's not running.
[2014-02-05 03:10:47 -0500] EJC: then I ssh up there and "sudo service start <servicname>" and it fired right up
[2014-02-05 03:11:28 -0500] EJC: I chalked it all up to chef 10 misbehaving without a role but now I'm getting "NoMethodError: undefined method `run_list' for nil:NilClass" about to jump out this window
[2014-02-05 03:11:43 -0500] coderanger: Can you pastebin the recipe code giving you the error?
[2014-02-05 03:13:24 -0500] EJC: one sec
[2014-02-05 03:15:44 -0500] EJC: well, part of the problem is sheer exhaustion
[2014-02-05 03:15:49 -0500] coderanger: EJC: Which line is erroring?
[2014-02-05 03:15:55 -0500] EJC: becasuse I've said "-r roll[blah]"
[2014-02-05 03:16:00 -0500] EJC: that's the wrong kinda roll
[2014-02-05 03:16:06 -0500] EJC: >.<
[2014-02-05 03:16:10 -0500] coderanger: I don't see a run_list method call in what you pasted :)
[2014-02-05 03:16:32 -0500] EJC: right, I'm calling a chef role
[2014-02-05 03:16:52 -0500] EJC: but on the cli, I was using "roll", as in hamburger roll......
[2014-02-05 03:17:01 -0500] coderanger: ahh
[2014-02-05 03:17:19 -0500] coderanger: any particular reason you are starting with Chef 10?
[2014-02-05 03:17:22 -0500] coderanger: Its pretty out of date
[2014-02-05 03:17:29 -0500] EJC: not starting, have been using forever
[2014-02-05 03:17:46 -0500] EJC: there's another group within my company using 11 and at some point, I'll migrate over
[2014-02-05 03:18:50 -0500] EJC: ok, lemmie see if this service actually starts up now....
[2014-02-05 03:20:20 -0500] EJC: coderanger while I have your eye, have you ever seen the object references (instead of their values) shoved into templates?
[2014-02-05 03:21:33 -0500] coderanger: Sure, if the object doesn't define to_s
[2014-02-05 03:22:02 -0500] EJC: it was just a simple attribute
[2014-02-05 03:22:11 -0500] EJC: like, a db url
[2014-02-05 03:22:25 -0500] EJC: or db.username even
[2014-02-05 03:22:29 -0500] coderanger: Chef 10 wrapped attributes with a lot of magic
[2014-02-05 03:22:35 -0500] coderanger: this was removed in Chef 11 because it sucked :)
[2014-02-05 03:23:39 -0500] EJC: blarg
[2014-02-05 03:23:43 -0500] EJC: I'll chalk it up to that
[2014-02-05 03:24:03 -0500] coderanger: Just call to_s on it
[2014-02-05 03:24:06 -0500] coderanger: should fix it
[2014-02-05 03:24:06 -0500] EJC: ok, so got the role working, but still, service wasn't actually started
[2014-02-05 03:24:25 -0500] EJC: I'm again so far down this OTHER rabbit (not wrapper) hole at this point....
[2014-02-05 03:24:48 -0500] EJC: I thought .to_s was the same as #{node[:foo]}
[2014-02-05 03:24:50 -0500] coderanger: EJC: So if you run with `-l debug` you should see the command it runs to star the service
[2014-02-05 03:25:13 -0500] EJC: fak - this isn't chef-solo :-/
[2014-02-05 03:25:25 -0500] coderanger: You can use it with client too
[2014-02-05 03:25:38 -0500] EJC: not just --verbose?
[2014-02-05 03:25:43 -0500] EJC: erm -VV
[2014-02-05 03:25:44 -0500] coderanger: No, -l debug
[2014-02-05 03:25:50 -0500] coderanger: -VV is a knife thing
[2014-02-05 03:26:16 -0500] EJC: sorry - yeah, I can try reconverging - but all of this is happening via "knife ec2 server create"...
[2014-02-05 03:27:17 -0500] coderanger: Ahh, then yeah I think it sends along the log level from knife
[2014-02-05 03:27:24 -0500] coderanger: but its been a long time since I did this in 10.x
[2014-02-05 03:27:43 -0500] EJC: reconverging fricking starts the service >:-(
[2014-02-05 03:29:07 -0500] EJC: crud - don't I need to do update.rc defaults...blah?
[2014-02-05 03:29:17 -0500] coderanger: The :enable should do that
[2014-02-05 03:29:37 -0500] EJC: crud
[2014-02-05 03:29:39 -0500] EJC: something is amiss
[2014-02-05 03:29:51 -0500] EJC: I can see it saying "falling back to process table inspection....
[2014-02-05 03:30:11 -0500] EJC: the process started will be node (it's a nodejs app)
[2014-02-05 03:30:18 -0500] coderanger: Yeah, you didn't set that the init script supports a status subcommand
[2014-02-05 03:30:38 -0500] EJC: do you _have_ to?
[2014-02-05 03:31:46 -0500] coderanger: No, it has a fallback as noted :)
[2014-02-05 03:31:56 -0500] coderanger: it looks for the service name in the output of ps
[2014-02-05 03:32:14 -0500] EJC: poo
[2014-02-05 03:32:39 -0500] coderanger: ?
[2014-02-05 03:34:11 -0500] EJC: I see that in OTHER cookbooks I've written recently
[2014-02-05 03:34:14 -0500] EJC: ok, lemmie test
[2014-02-05 03:34:33 -0500] EJC: coderanger - damm - sometimes it's so good just to have an extra set of eyes
[2014-02-05 03:36:07 -0500] coderanger: \o/
[2014-02-05 03:41:28 -0500] EJC: coderanger wow, all set
[2014-02-05 03:41:56 -0500] brimstone: "Cannot find a resource for partial_search on ubuntu version 12.04" does 11.8.2 not contain this by default?
[2014-02-05 03:41:59 -0500] EJC: I really wonder if I coudln't redo my wrapper work with chef 10 and use the to_s method on those things
[2014-02-05 03:42:27 -0500] coderanger: brimstone: No, will be in by default in 11.10
[2014-02-05 03:42:35 -0500] coderanger: brimstone: For earlier, use the partial_search cookbook
[2014-02-05 03:42:54 -0500] brimstone: coderanger: ok, thanks
[2014-02-05 03:43:03 -0500] brimstone: 11.10 is in RC now right?
[2014-02-05 03:43:41 -0500] coderanger: brimstone: That sounds correct
[2014-02-05 03:43:45 -0500] coderanger: I've been distracted though
[2014-02-05 03:43:56 -0500] brimstone: is there an alternate way to get the ip address of a node with what's default in 11.8.2?
[2014-02-05 03:44:10 -0500] coderanger: brimstone: search()
[2014-02-05 03:44:26 -0500] coderanger: partial_search is just an enhancement to normal search that sends less data to the client
[2014-02-05 03:44:33 -0500] coderanger: The actual search system in unchanged
[2014-02-05 03:45:23 -0500] brimstone: coderanger: thanks
[2014-02-05 03:45:32 -0500] brimstone: looking at http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_search.html i'm not sure how to get the ip
[2014-02-05 03:45:33 -0500] EJC: one last question tho - woudln't default['foo'] = "#{node['foo']}" be the same as adding a .to_s to that assignment?
[2014-02-05 03:50:10 -0500] brimstone: wait, figured it out

[2014-02-05 09:24:16 -0500] ocholetras: What is best way to manage firewall rules on config file (talking about shorewall) with a LWRP?
[2014-02-05 09:43:57 -0500] flaccid: ocholetras: maybe there is a shorewall cookbook
[2014-02-05 09:55:20 -0500] ocholetras: yea
[2014-02-05 09:55:46 -0500] ocholetras: put it works doing node.override[:shorewall][:rules] << {rulehash} on recipes
[2014-02-05 09:56:02 -0500] ocholetras: flaccid: not so clean way IMO
[2014-02-05 09:56:14 -0500] ocholetras: i have tried to define an LWRP
[2014-02-05 09:56:38 -0500] ocholetras: but it cant change node attributes at the time template access it, its made later on the runlist..
[2014-02-05 09:57:09 -0500] ocholetras: and templates are accessing node attributes directly instead of using variables hash, wich makes hard to use lazzy anyway -_-'
[2014-02-05 09:58:46 -0500] ocholetras: or is there anyway to modify attributes inside a provider at compile time?
[2014-02-05 10:05:58 -0500] flaccid: ocholetras: looks like you could just set the node attribute on the node to me
[2014-02-05 10:07:30 -0500] flaccid: if this is wrapping rulehash is a ruby hash done in compile time. i just don't get why people don't just set the node attributes on the node or bootstrap node.json etc.
[2014-02-05 10:44:52 -0500] ocholetras: flaccid: that is because this is done in a recipe for an application that needs the port open. If you do it on the recipe, you dont have to edit the node by hand..
[2014-02-05 10:45:20 -0500] ocholetras: instead of that, you define an lwrp for each rule you need

[2014-02-05 11:27:14 -0500] workmad3: liku: I'd guess that it's just meaning that cookbook constraints can't be resolved in chef-solo... it has the cookbook collection on the node and loads that, no resolving of versions happens
[2014-02-05 11:28:50 -0500] liku: workmad3: oh, you mean that its simly a problem with resolving dependencies, right?
[2014-02-05 11:30:37 -0500] workmad3: liku: going by the error message, I'd guess it's more than an environment for chef-solo considers version constraints as nonsense and throws an error on them

[2014-02-05 14:39:40 -0500] Raboo: shlant ok thanks!
[2014-02-05 14:41:44 -0500] jedi4ever: shlant: yeah , like mocking state of services would be fun :)
[2014-02-05 15:23:56 -0500] brimstone: is there a way to either have chef-client not submit the ip of eth0, or have chef-client pull down the ip of others nodes that is not eth0?
[2014-02-05 15:24:15 -0500] brimstone: i can also match by cidr or ip if that would help
[2014-02-05 15:36:29 -0500] davsharyan33: hey ppl. si there a way to get chef server's hostname from the recipe ?
[2014-02-05 15:37:28 -0500] workmad3: davsharyan33: I suspect 'Chef::Config['chef_server_url'] ' will contain the value you desire
[2014-02-05 15:39:44 -0500] davsharyan33: workmad3: thanks, going to check
[2014-02-05 15:46:25 -0500] davsharyan33: and any idea why client doesn't log to console Chef::Log.info("MESSAGE") ???
[2014-02-05 15:49:05 -0500] workmad3: davsharyan33: if you just dumped that in a recipe, then a) it won't appear where you expect (because it logs at compile phase, not converge phase) and b) I think chef 11 with its new formatters suppresses most logging during compile phase now
[2014-02-05 15:49:32 -0500] workmad3: davsharyan33: if you really want to log at the right place in a chef recipe, use the log resource - 'log "message" do; level :info; end'
[2014-02-05 15:50:28 -0500] davsharyan33: hmm .. I just have a small recipe so have to see it. let me try with log resource, thanks
[2014-02-05 15:51:47 -0500] davsharyan33: workmad3: worked , thanks a lot
[2014-02-05 16:26:17 -0500] qurve: Setting aside whether it's a good idea or not for a second: Is there a reason doing node.set within an after_restart block of a deploy resource, that node value would not actually be set after the deploy resource has executed?
[2014-02-05 16:26:54 -0500] qurve: My problem is the deploy resource internally knows where it is placing log files, so it has to put data about them into node properties used by another cookbook (in this case papertrail, which is a wrapper for rsyslog)
[2014-02-05 16:27:30 -0500] qurve: in my after_restart, I am basically doing: node.set['papertrail']['watch_files'] = <dynamically find the log files>
[2014-02-05 16:27:58 -0500] qurve: Then after the deploy resource runs, I have include_recipe 'papertrail::default' which uses that data.
[2014-02-05 16:28:23 -0500] qurve: Within the after_restart block, I can see the node value getting properly set, but if I log out the value right before the include_recipe, it is nil.
[2014-02-05 16:30:35 -0500] iwarshak_____: Hi. When the chef log says Writing /etc/init/foo - should that file exist after that entry is written. I have a problem where much later in the run, a service fails to start because /etc/init/foo doesn't exist???
[2014-02-05 16:36:04 -0500] EricL: If I have search() query in the variables section of a template method that works fine on an existing node, why would that same search query fail on a bootstrapping node 100% of the time?
[2014-02-05 16:36:14 -0500] qurve: n/m I am an idiot, I see where the problem is.
[2014-02-05 16:37:26 -0500] qurve: Hrm, this is annoying.
[2014-02-05 16:38:21 -0500] StFS_: Hi. I was trying to find some "official" way to install chef solo on a clean CentOS box since it doesn't seem to be in the repo. I would like to use the package manager though. Is there any official RPM repo?
[2014-02-05 16:38:55 -0500] StFS_: I found http://rbel.frameos.org/ but I don't know how reputable they are
[2014-02-05 16:50:05 -0500] aujt74: StFS_: The "official" way to install Chef is http://www.getchef.com/chef/install/, or more specifically "curl -L https://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh | bash". It will download and install the correct package for your system.
[2014-02-05 16:52:26 -0500] qurve: Is there a way to only include_recipe after another resource completes?
[2014-02-05 16:52:49 -0500] qurve: My problem was that the include_recipe was registering immediately, not after the preceeding deploy resource had actually finished doing it's job (as far as I can tell)
[2014-02-05 16:53:13 -0500] qurve: The problem is, I won't have the data I need for the recipe I need to run until after the deploy resource has fully ran and restarted.
[2014-02-05 16:56:44 -0500] StFS_: aujt74: it seems that it doesn't install through the package system
[2014-02-05 16:58:44 -0500] aujt74: StFS_: There aren't official repos but AFAIK it should download an RPM and install that. Certainly downloads and installs a DEB package on Debian platform systems.
[2014-02-05 16:59:17 -0500] StFS_: aujt74: ok... thanks I'll give it a go and take a closer look
[2014-02-05 17:01:01 -0500] StFS_: aujt74: ok... it's manually downloading rpm pacakges from S3. doesn't seem to add a repo so chef wouldn't get updated, although there is a possibility that the rpm that is initially downloaded does add a repo... I'll see that when it's done installing
[2014-02-05 17:02:30 -0500] aujt74: StFS_: Correct and it doesn't add a repo. You need to manage Chef upgrades in other ways. ckbk.it/omnibus_updater for instance.
[2014-02-05 17:03:06 -0500] StFS_: aujt74: thanks
[2014-02-05 17:04:15 -0500] qurve: OK, I think I've boiled down my problem: Is there a way to wait until a resource has completed before calling include_recipe?
[2014-02-05 17:04:41 -0500] qurve: I need the deploy resource to finish the deployment before I will have the data necessary to pass into another recipe.
[2014-02-05 17:15:51 -0500] iwarshak_____: qurve: are u using opsworks?
[2014-02-05 17:15:57 -0500] qurve: Yes.
[2014-02-05 17:16:09 -0500] iwarshak_____: qurve: we're prob in a similar boat
[2014-02-05 17:16:16 -0500] qurve: Not in production yet, but short of something horrible, I likely will be within the near future.
[2014-02-05 17:16:42 -0500] iwarshak_____: qurve: I am trying to use after_restart to start up my BG processor
[2014-02-05 17:16:50 -0500] qurve: I'm just trying to wire up papertrail into the app, the problem is I don't know 1) how many or 2) what the names of my logfiles will be until after the deploy completes.
[2014-02-05 17:17:14 -0500] qurve: They log files are spit put based on the foreman process names and # of processes.
[2014-02-05 17:17:22 -0500] qurve: I'd rather not hard-code that into my cookbook :\
[2014-02-05 17:17:51 -0500] qurve: I wanted to dynamically build my rsyslog file list by getting the contents of the log directory.
[2014-02-05 17:19:14 -0500] iwarshak_____: qurve: chek this out https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Chef_include_recipe_only_if_not_if.html
[2014-02-05 17:19:52 -0500] qurve: My problem isn't conditionally including the recipe, it's timing.
[2014-02-05 17:19:58 -0500] qurve: if do you:
[2014-02-05 17:20:03 -0500] qurve: deploy ...
[2014-02-05 17:20:05 -0500] qurve: include_recipe ...
[2014-02-05 17:20:22 -0500] qurve: The include_recipe will be called before the deploy has finished
[2014-02-05 17:20:29 -0500] qurve: So any node data it sets will not be available.
[2014-02-05 17:20:43 -0500] qurve: At least that's what my debug log shows.
[2014-02-05 17:21:30 -0500] qurve: I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to wait until the deploy fully completes before adding papertrail::defult into the run list.
[2014-02-05 17:21:46 -0500] qurve: include_recipe isn't defined if I try to use it in deploy::after_restart
[2014-02-05 17:23:18 -0500] qurve: Might just have to hard-code the log paths for now and open a bug for myself to make it work better later.
[2014-02-05 17:30:08 -0500] erictang: hi guys i have a nube question about lwrp
[2014-02-05 17:30:20 -0500] kbarry: I'm trying to have Chef move some directories using a powershell script i've written.
[2014-02-05 17:30:33 -0500] kbarry: I inserted it into a powershell_script resource,
[2014-02-05 17:30:40 -0500] kbarry: but its not doing what i expect.
[2014-02-05 17:30:47 -0500] erictang: i'm need to use the s3_file lwrp from the community site, but am having problem getting a hold of it in my recipe
[2014-02-05 17:30:51 -0500] kbarry: (I tested the script on the machine itself, and it worked)
[2014-02-05 17:30:57 -0500] erictang: is there anything i need to do to 'require' it?
[2014-02-05 17:31:30 -0500] kbarry: The files its moving are located on another server, is it possible that it doesn't have the credentials to move the files from another server in the chef scope?
[2014-02-05 17:46:17 -0500] ericReeves: Hm, anybody around who is familiar with the openstack-chef cookbooks?  I think I'm running in to a dependency problem w/ the yum cookbook version.
[2014-02-05 17:47:28 -0500] ericReeves: Oops, I'll see if #openstack-chef is alive.
[2014-02-05 17:52:47 -0500] qurve: Well, I figured out a way to do what I wanted, but I'm not sure if it's hackish.
[2014-02-05 17:53:05 -0500] qurve: In the deploy resource's after_restart block you can @run_context.include_recipe()
[2014-02-05 17:53:29 -0500] qurve: Anyone that knows more than me about chef want to tell me on a scale of 1-10 how stupid that is to do?
[2014-02-05 17:53:34 -0500] sauraus: Good morning Chef peeps, got a question about split(".") in the attributes default.rb file, is this permitted: default["tomcat"]["blahblah"] = "#{node["tomcat"]["base_version"].split(".")[0]}" I am getting an errors saying split() undefined method
[2014-02-05 17:53:57 -0500] qurve: What is the type of node["tomcat"]["base_version"]?
[2014-02-05 17:54:05 -0500] qurve: Are you sure it's a string?
[2014-02-05 17:55:36 -0500] sauraus: default["tomcat"]["base_version"] = "7.0.50"
[2014-02-05 17:56:20 -0500] qurve: The question is what the value of node["tomcat"]["base_version"] is at the time that line executes.
[2014-02-05 17:56:29 -0500] dopacki: anybody know how to get around the following chef-server 11.0.10-1 error on EC2 Linux? I can't seem to upload any cookbooks. /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/chef-11.8.2/lib/chef/cookbook_uploader.rb:16:in `work_queue': uninitialized constant Chef::CookbookUploader::Queue (NameError)
[2014-02-05 17:57:02 -0500] sauraus: @qurve that is true adding a little .to_s. in there should ensure that all is good at all times
[2014-02-05 17:57:14 -0500] dopacki: the error (6) solution in this doc didn't seem to help - http://sanketdangi.com/post/50897416859/chef-errors-and-their-solutions
[2014-02-05 17:57:24 -0500] castro1688: Easy question.. In the new chef UI, in reports>run history... how long does it take to get updated? I had finished a chef run, but it still shows as started and not success like the others
[2014-02-05 17:57:30 -0500] qurve: Well, that will prevent an error from happening, but if that value is nil and you expect it not to be, papering over it may not be what you want.
[2014-02-05 17:59:21 -0500] sauraus: the cookbook actually defines a default value for the attribute so it will never be nil.
[2014-02-05 18:58:52 -0500] netty195: hi all
[2014-02-05 18:59:08 -0500] netty195: is  node.chef_environment available inside templates?
[2014-02-05 19:00:55 -0500] datallah: netty195: it is if you expose it
[2014-02-05 19:03:10 -0500] netty195: @datallah - I don't mean passing it as a variable
[2014-02-05 19:03:16 -0500] netty195: from the recipe
[2014-02-05 19:04:03 -0500] datallah: netty195: why do you mean then?
[2014-02-05 19:05:36 -0500] netty195: datallah: I mean can I reference it like -> node.chef_environment.include?("production") directly in template
[2014-02-05 19:08:54 -0500] datallah: netty195: if you expose the node as variable, you can put ruby snippets in your template's <% %> blocks to do whatever you want.
[2014-02-05 19:17:00 -0500] notromda: All these cookbok versions I'm uploading with berkshelf  is there a way to view or trim the versions on the server?
[2014-02-05 19:18:01 -0500] netty195: found an example here -> https://github.com/tas50/nagios/blob/master/templates/default/apache2.conf.erb
[2014-02-05 19:18:16 -0500] netty195: .<%= node.chef_environment =~ /^_default$/ ? "default" : node.chef_environment%>
[2014-02-05 19:22:01 -0500] datallah: netty195: *shrug* I don't expect that to be exposed automatically, but you can test it.
[2014-02-05 19:26:04 -0500] netty195: datallah: I will. Thanks for your help & time!
[2014-02-05 19:55:37 -0500] kbarry: Looking for some help working with powershell in chef.
[2014-02-05 19:55:47 -0500] kbarry: I can't get any part of my script to execute,
[2014-02-05 19:56:12 -0500] kbarry: I believe I have the syntax correct, as i copied a working powershell section from another recipe,
[2014-02-05 19:56:20 -0500] kbarry: and replaced the code

[2014-02-05 19:56:42 -0500] kbarry: Is there something I am missing?
[2014-02-05 20:07:04 -0500] kbarry: No one using powershell in chef?
[2014-02-05 20:20:07 -0500] sascha_d: @kbarry people are using powershell/windows with chef but not many in irc
[2014-02-05 20:20:21 -0500] sascha_d: I can poke around and see if there's a windows expert in the house :)
[2014-02-05 20:20:35 -0500] kbarry: I would love some help,
[2014-02-05 20:20:42 -0500] kbarry: I know my powershell code works,
[2014-02-05 20:20:48 -0500] kbarry: I have tested it line by line
[2014-02-05 20:20:55 -0500] kbarry: on the server I want to chef,
[2014-02-05 20:20:59 -0500] kbarry: (took a snapshot)
[2014-02-05 20:21:03 -0500] kbarry: it works when run manually,
[2014-02-05 20:21:35 -0500] kbarry: As i understand things, the powershell_script creates a file with the code you have given it, then executes the file..... I don't know that that would change anything,
[2014-02-05 20:22:12 -0500] sascha_d: :) I haven't windowsed in a while but I'm asking around
[2014-02-05 20:22:27 -0500] ringods: While trying to convert the s3_file resource from an LWRP to a resource/provider in the libraries folder, I get a NameError on the resource from my recipe.

[2014-02-05 20:30:11 -0500] sascha_d: @kbarry do you get any errors or does it just say it's execing the block without doing anything?
[2014-02-05 20:30:12 -0500] iwarshak_____: Hi. When the chef log says Writing /etc/init/foo - should that file exist after that entry is written. I have a problem where much later in the run, a service fails to start because /etc/init/foo doesn't exist???
[2014-02-05 20:30:28 -0500] kbarry: no errors at all,
[2014-02-05 20:30:40 -0500] kbarry: Actually i "think" the problem is that i am using "\" in my code,
[2014-02-05 20:30:46 -0500] kbarry: and i believe it needs to be escaped out
[2014-02-05 20:31:52 -0500] sthulb: Hey, how would one normally change attributes based on something like the hostname?
[2014-02-05 20:32:38 -0500] sascha_d: @kbarry I've been bitten by the triple jumbo escape :)
[2014-02-05 20:33:52 -0500] kbarry: is that the only character i need to watch for to escape?
[2014-02-05 20:34:02 -0500] kbarry: (Is there a "These things need to be escaped" list?
[2014-02-05 20:34:14 -0500] scalp42: kbarry go for %qQ syntax
[2014-02-05 20:34:16 -0500] scalp42: usually easier
[2014-02-05 20:34:54 -0500] kbarry: explain?
[2014-02-05 20:35:09 -0500] scalp42: %q|I don't care about quotes! or slashes \ or whatever|
[2014-02-05 20:35:16 -0500] scalp42: => "I don't care about quotes! or slashes \\ or whatever"
[2014-02-05 20:35:46 -0500] kbarry: where can i read about that?
[2014-02-05 20:35:51 -0500] kbarry: Is that a chef-thing?
[2014-02-05 20:36:09 -0500] scalp42: no it's a Ruby thing
[2014-02-05 20:36:10 -0500] scalp42: http://simpleror.wordpress.com/2009/03/15/q-q-w-w-x-r-s/
[2014-02-05 20:36:19 -0500] scalp42: look at this one looks clear enough
[2014-02-05 20:37:02 -0500] scalp42: or http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax/Literals and go to "The % Notation"
[2014-02-05 20:37:23 -0500] sascha_d: @kbarry it's also advised to ensure you're testing as the same user as the chef process is running under
[2014-02-05 20:37:36 -0500] sascha_d: when you run your tests by hand
[2014-02-05 20:37:48 -0500] kbarry: yeah, actually, what user is it running as?
[2014-02-05 20:38:03 -0500] kbarry: i assumed it was using the local "administrator" account that we used when we bootstrapped it
[2014-02-05 20:38:27 -0500] kbarry: it looks like it was syntax problem,
[2014-02-05 20:40:57 -0500] sascha_d: yeah? with backslashes?
[2014-02-05 20:47:11 -0500] notromda: does include_recipe begin running the recipe at parse time or at run time?  It seems like I have some recipes running earlier than they should.
[2014-02-05 20:49:44 -0500] drywheat: i want to install and configures several aspects of my developer environment, such as vim, tmux, shell, bash aliases, etc....
[2014-02-05 20:50:18 -0500] drywheat: i'm inclined to slump that into a single cookbook versus a single cookbook for each aspect because the tasks are so miniscule.
[2014-02-05 20:50:23 -0500] drywheat: does that seem wrong?
[2014-02-05 20:50:30 -0500] scalp42: nothing wrong with that
[2014-02-05 20:51:02 -0500] scalp42: single cookbook with multiple recipes
[2014-02-05 20:52:17 -0500] drywheat: scalp42: that's what i thought, merci

[2014-02-05 20:55:32 -0500] kbarry: sascha_d do I need to use the %q before every single line?
[2014-02-05 20:55:37 -0500] drywheat: i'll check it out though, thx
[2014-02-05 20:56:22 -0500] sascha_d: @kbarry I don't know.  But someone fed me some suggestions for debugging
[2014-02-05 20:56:55 -0500] kbarry: I escaped my "\"s, but it seems to only be fixing some of the problems.
[2014-02-05 20:56:56 -0500] drywheat: rayrod2030: ah, ok, so they employ a method of wrapping a number of related tasks into a single ckbk as separate recipes
[2014-02-05 20:57:07 -0500] sascha_d: @kbarry so this: syntax looks fine. he's populating a $a based on a filter. If the command doesnt succeed, he'll have a null variable, and like a house of cards the rest of the script will error out
[2014-02-05 20:57:07 -0500] sascha_d: if \\remoteserver is not accessible as part of chef run nothing will work. i bet he's testing as himself so he can actually hit the share.
[2014-02-05 20:57:11 -0500] kbarry: I suspec i need to escape things like the "$", possible the "(" and ")"
[2014-02-05 20:57:28 -0500] sascha_d: also, what version of chef? Newest?
[2014-02-05 20:57:42 -0500] kbarry: I believe so,
[2014-02-05 20:57:45 -0500] drywheat: that makes sense, but i also want to make sure i don't pigeonhole myself into a couple of cookbooks that are not well segregated
[2014-02-05 20:57:49 -0500] kbarry: how can i tell?
[2014-02-05 20:58:05 -0500] drywheat: kbarry: chef-client -v
[2014-02-05 20:59:13 -0500] sascha_d: oh yeah, so running it with -l debug will help a lot for info gathering
[2014-02-05 20:59:39 -0500] sascha_d: with *nix varieties at least that spits out all the command line feed back for scripts
[2014-02-05 21:02:01 -0500] notromda: I have an assignment in a recipe,  node.default[:foo][:bar] =    that depends on previous recipies being run.   Those recipes are included, but haven't actually executed yet.   How do I have this defer until the other recipes have actually run?
[2014-02-05 21:03:49 -0500] Lolindir: Howdy Chefs, does anyone know where the files in a cookbook are stored during a chef run on windows?  For example the windows_reboot_handler.rb in the windows cookbook?

[2014-02-05 21:09:54 -0500] sthulb: How do I changes my attributes based on the boxes hostname?
[2014-02-05 21:13:20 -0500] Lolindir: @sthulb Could you use when statements to define the attributes you want for each host?
[2014-02-05 21:16:59 -0500] sthulb: I tried that... :/
[2014-02-05 21:18:51 -0500] scalp42: sthulb can you show me the code ?
[2014-02-05 21:18:59 -0500] scalp42: I could maybe help
[2014-02-05 21:20:23 -0500] glen: hey, how can i knife search hosts to exclude nodes that are down. i know there's some ohai time attribute but how can i use it?
[2014-02-05 21:20:50 -0500] sthulb: https://gist.github.com/8833360
[2014-02-05 21:20:53 -0500] sthulb: scalp42:
[2014-02-05 21:23:22 -0500] Lolindir: Shouldn't you be using environment?
[2014-02-05 21:25:06 -0500] scalp42: glen is it because it takes forever to time out ?
[2014-02-05 21:25:15 -0500] scalp42: sthulb are you putting this in attributes/ ?
[2014-02-05 21:25:20 -0500] sthulb: yup
[2014-02-05 21:25:57 -0500] scalp42: node[:base_packages][:packages] is empty?
[2014-02-05 21:26:00 -0500] glen: scalp42: yes, it steals time to wait for them. i'm doing knife ssh with the search result
[2014-02-05 21:26:04 -0500] scalp42: like whats the symptom please
[2014-02-05 21:26:28 -0500] scalp42: I dont know the perfect solution for it glen but you can do it my way with ssh/config
[2014-02-05 21:26:29 -0500] sthulb: scalp42: it tries to install the wrong hostnames packages
[2014-02-05 21:26:49 -0500] scalp42: just try   ConnectTimeout 5
[2014-02-05 21:26:50 -0500] scalp42: for example
[2014-02-05 21:26:52 -0500] glen: scalp42: i'm not sure how to input >= SOMETHING in solr search
[2014-02-05 21:27:11 -0500] glen: but ohai_time:>NOW-3000 or something would help
[2014-02-05 21:27:29 -0500] scalp42: if its because knife ssh times out, then just make it timeout immediately using ssh/config in case
[2014-02-05 21:28:08 -0500] glen: why can't i do what i want to do --- exclude bad nodes with ohai_time based filter?
[2014-02-05 21:28:17 -0500] scalp42: oh you can :)
[2014-02-05 21:28:20 -0500] scalp42: was just trying to help
[2014-02-05 21:28:34 -0500] glen: so, any help on making that filter? :)
[2014-02-05 21:29:00 -0500] scalp42: I do this in my recipes: https://gist.github.com/scalp42/6119b02fb604fd339986 for ohai_time
[2014-02-05 21:29:27 -0500] glen: well. knife search takes SOLR query
[2014-02-05 21:29:39 -0500] scalp42: yeah I know just trying to help
[2014-02-05 21:29:49 -0500] glen: oo, there is possible filter ranges!
[2014-02-05 21:29:51 -0500] glen: knife search node 'ohai_time:[1324408398 TO 1324426395]' -i
[2014-02-05 21:30:01 -0500] scalp42: nice
[2014-02-05 21:30:19 -0500] scalp42: sthulb whats the hostname
[2014-02-05 21:30:24 -0500] Lolindir: Howdy Chefs, does anyone know where the files in a cookbook are stored during a chef run on windows?  For example the windows_reboot_handler.rb in the windows cookbook?
[2014-02-05 21:31:07 -0500] sthulb: 'sandbox' in this instance
[2014-02-05 21:31:16 -0500] sthulb: I've used a log in the recipe to make sure
[2014-02-05 21:32:11 -0500] glen: knife search node "ohai_time:[$(date --date="-5 hours" +%s) TO $(date --date="-1 hours" +%s)]" -i
[2014-02-05 21:32:18 -0500] glen: now i have to think what that result really gave me :D
[2014-02-05 21:34:25 -0500] glen: okay, this should give me hosts that have checked in in last hour: knife search node "ohai_time:[$(date --date="-1 hours" +%s) TO $(date +%s)]" -a ohai_time
[2014-02-05 21:54:04 -0500] stevedb: is there a good way to enable/disable a service using attributes?
[2014-02-05 21:54:10 -0500] stevedb: like:  if node.default['zookeeper']['enable_on_boot']
[2014-02-05 21:54:10 -0500] stevedb:     notifies :enable, resources(:service => "zookeeper-server")
[2014-02-05 21:54:47 -0500] coderanger: stevedb: action node['..']['enabled'] ? :enable : :disable
[2014-02-05 21:55:38 -0500] stevedb: coderanger: cool! let me try that out
[2014-02-05 22:05:28 -0500] stevedb: that worked great: action [ node.default['zookeeper']['start']? :restart : :nothing,
[2014-02-05 22:05:29 -0500] stevedb: +             node.default['zookeeper']['enable_on_boot']? :enable : :disable ]
[2014-02-05 22:09:03 -0500] coderanger: stevedb: Don't use node.default in recipe code
[2014-02-05 22:09:05 -0500] coderanger: just use node directly
[2014-02-05 22:09:16 -0500] coderanger: otherwise overrides et al won't work
[2014-02-05 22:11:19 -0500] stevedb: thanks
[2014-02-05 22:12:53 -0500] scalp42: stevedb node.default[] is setting it, node[] is reading it if im not mistaken
[2014-02-05 22:13:54 -0500] scalp42: sthulb sorry was eating
[2014-02-05 22:14:08 -0500] scalp42: I'd move the logic in recipe but dont take my advice
[2014-02-05 22:20:18 -0500] fveillette: I would like to know how i can debug issue with a resources that don't get nofies as it supose in my recipe
[2014-02-05 22:20:57 -0500] fveillette: i notifies a service restart in my recipe like i already did in the past but this it's not working and i don'T know why
[2014-02-05 22:23:06 -0500] workmad3: fveillette: did the resource with the notifies line change?
[2014-02-05 22:23:25 -0500] workmad3: fveillette: as notifications don't fire if the resource they're on remained unchanged
[2014-02-05 22:33:10 -0500] fveillette: it's a template resource that notifies a service resource
[2014-02-05 22:33:37 -0500] fveillette: i know my templace resource work since my file change accordingly to the templace
[2014-02-05 22:33:43 -0500] fveillette: but my service don't restart
[2014-02-05 22:34:12 -0500] fveillette: and i don'T see in the chef-run output the the template resource notifies the service resource like i normally see in other recipe...
[2014-02-05 22:36:09 -0500] fveillette: i'm a little bit confuse here
[2014-02-05 22:43:53 -0500] scalp42: fveillette do you have a gist for it ?
[2014-02-05 22:43:59 -0500] scalp42: just put the template and service blocks
[2014-02-05 22:47:34 -0500] scalp42: fveillette you sure the service block subscribes to the template one and vice versa ? (template notifies the service block)
[2014-02-05 22:48:12 -0500] fveillette: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8834926
[2014-02-05 22:48:12 -0500] workmad3: fveillette: and I repeat - did the templated file actually change content during this chef-run?
[2014-02-05 22:48:20 -0500] workmad3: fveillette: if it didn't, the notification won't fire
[2014-02-05 22:48:28 -0500] fveillette: yeah template change the content of the xml file
[2014-02-05 22:48:42 -0500] fveillette: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8834926
[2014-02-05 22:49:28 -0500] workmad3: fveillette: could you also gist the chef run output from the run that you expected to restart the service?
[2014-02-05 22:49:52 -0500] fveillette: sure
[2014-02-05 22:49:56 -0500] scalp42: yeah good point would help
[2014-02-05 22:50:02 -0500] fveillette: hold on
[2014-02-05 22:50:16 -0500] scalp42: but I think Im gonna sit that one out (not expert with windows)
[2014-02-05 22:51:00 -0500] scalp42: curious why all this inside the ruby_block btw
[2014-02-05 22:51:32 -0500] fveillette: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8834995
[2014-02-05 22:51:58 -0500] fveillette: it's not everything that in the ruby block
[2014-02-05 22:52:01 -0500] fveillette: just the log part
[2014-02-05 22:52:49 -0500] scalp42: oh my bad ><
[2014-02-05 22:53:56 -0500] scalp42: can you try having that service "PunchServer_#{servicename}" subscribes to the template?
[2014-02-05 22:54:55 -0500] fveillette: what do you mean subscribe..
[2014-02-05 22:55:29 -0500] fveillette: if the question was if the service restart...
[2014-02-05 22:55:34 -0500] fveillette: no it's not
[2014-02-05 22:55:59 -0500] workmad3: fveillette: no, he's suggesting you invert the notification
[2014-02-05 22:56:12 -0500] scalp42: something sketchy https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8834995#file-gistfile1-txt-L87
[2014-02-05 22:56:17 -0500] scalp42: should have restarted it I agree
[2014-02-05 22:56:39 -0500] scalp42: no idea
[2014-02-05 22:56:39 -0500] workmad3: fveillette: so that rather than having the template notify the service with 'notifes :restart, "..."' you subscribe to the template in the service with 'subscribes :restart, "..."' (or something along those lines)
[2014-02-05 22:56:53 -0500] scalp42: yes sorry I can write a gist if you want
[2014-02-05 22:57:01 -0500] workmad3: and yeah, that looks fine to me... definitely updated... only thing I could think is if the updated cookbook hadn't gotten to the node
[2014-02-05 22:57:13 -0500] fveillette: i never ear about subscribe before...
[2014-02-05 22:57:14 -0500] fveillette: my bad
[2014-02-05 22:57:43 -0500] fveillette: i can assure you that when i look at the chef cache
[2014-02-05 22:57:47 -0500] fveillette: i see my last cookbook :)
[2014-02-05 22:58:29 -0500] flaccid: regarding syntax on http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_libraries.html i run into issue with rubocop where it think its a top level, C: Missing top-level module documentation comment. - should i just give it a comment and be done with it? its obviously not a class but a monkey patch.
[2014-02-05 22:58:38 -0500] scalp42: like this: https://gist.github.com/scalp42/1045cde224450f2cc0c4#file-subscribes-rb-L12
[2014-02-05 23:00:00 -0500] fveillette: i will try the subscribe stuff
[2014-02-05 23:00:24 -0500] scalp42: worth the shot sorry cant figure it out (shrug)
[2014-02-05 23:00:36 -0500] coderanger: flaccid: Ignore it
[2014-02-05 23:00:47 -0500] coderanger: flaccid: Rubocop's default cop config is worthless
[2014-02-05 23:01:05 -0500] coderanger: or at least so highly opinionated you can't use it for Chef without a lot of tweaking
[2014-02-05 23:01:18 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: is there a flag i can use in the .rubycopy.yml to silence it?
[2014-02-05 23:01:37 -0500] coderanger: Yes, the error should mention the cop name
[2014-02-05 23:02:22 -0500] fveillette: scalp42: no luck
[2014-02-05 23:03:38 -0500] glen: can i subscribe to resource with pattern? like file[/etc/*] ?
[2014-02-05 23:03:43 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: does not seem to say the camelcase name https://travis-ci.org/xhost-cookbooks/system/jobs/18306636
[2014-02-05 23:04:32 -0500] coderanger: flaccid: You might need a verbose flag or something
[2014-02-05 23:04:56 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: ah i see, cheers y0
[2014-02-05 23:07:09 -0500] fveillette: any more idea?
[2014-02-05 23:17:42 -0500] fveillette: scalp? workmad or any other one that can try to figure out my issue with a brilliant idea
[2014-02-05 23:22:02 -0500] scalp42: i'm sorry cant figure this one :/
[2014-02-05 23:22:28 -0500] fveillette: :(
