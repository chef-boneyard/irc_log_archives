[2014-02-09 00:29:41 -0500] cwj: gaulia: i ran into that with chefspec also, its because node[platform_family] is not being populated
[2014-02-09 00:29:46 -0500] cwj: you need to do something like ChefSpec::Runner.new(platform: 'ubuntu', version: '12.04) when setting up your runner, so that it can populate the node attributes with some fake data that emulates that platform and release
