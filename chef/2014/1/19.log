[2014-01-19 00:00:08 -0500] segv: how would you launch say 20-30 instances in on ec2 with chef
[2014-01-19 00:00:16 -0500] segv: without autoscaling groups that is
[2014-01-19 00:00:28 -0500] coderanger: Chef doesn't launch servers
[2014-01-19 00:00:31 -0500] coderanger: just manages them
[2014-01-19 00:01:16 -0500] segv: wel yeah, anything that plugs into it to manage that?
[2014-01-19 00:01:42 -0500] coderanger: spiceweasel, cloudformation, Asgard, etc
[2014-01-19 00:02:26 -0500] segv: ah, haven't heard of the other 2
[2014-01-19 00:04:01 -0500] segv: coderanger: wait, nm i have used asgard before
[2014-01-19 00:04:04 -0500] segv: that is perfect
[2014-01-19 00:18:45 -0500] Zauberfisch: asked this in #learnchef, but have not recived any reaction so far, please allow me to repost it here
[2014-01-19 00:19:12 -0500] Zauberfisch: I am facing a rather embarrassing problem
[2014-01-19 00:19:20 -0500] Zauberfisch: WARNING: No knife configuration file found
[2014-01-19 00:19:24 -0500] Zauberfisch: I have a knife.rb in my project-name/.chef/ directory
[2014-01-19 00:19:28 -0500] Zauberfisch: on 2 other PCs that I used so far, knife is using the knife.rb of the project folder, and not using a global one
[2014-01-19 00:19:33 -0500] Zauberfisch: but on this PC here (windows), it appears not to find the project config
[2014-01-19 00:19:38 -0500] Zauberfisch: I must be doing something very basic wrong
[2014-01-19 00:19:46 -0500] Zauberfisch: but fail to see what it is
[2014-01-19 00:19:52 -0500] Zauberfisch: I would highly appreciate any hints on where I might start looking for the problem
[2014-01-19 02:24:50 -0500] leandromoreira: Hi guys, I'm feeling more silly than ever I'm using knife-solo and Berskshelf to manage my rep... anyway I did this config (http://pastebin.com/Tg0GUm9J) and my idea was to replace default values to rbenv cookbook... but when I run: $knife solo cook localhost -x vagrant -P vagrant -p 2222 -r nodes/localhost.json
[2014-01-19 02:25:28 -0500] leandromoreira: It just installs the component but it doesn't install the rubies therefore I think it's not overriding the cookbook/attribute definition
[2014-01-19 03:16:28 -0500] jidar: Zauberfisch: windows I think, only looks in the c:\chef directory for the knife.rb file, but don't quote me on that as windows is _really_ goofy with things like this
[2014-01-19 04:27:11 -0500] Zauberfisch: jidar: yeah, I did exactly that as a work around for now. moved the knife.rb from project/.chef/ to project/
[2014-01-19 04:27:21 -0500] Zauberfisch: jidar: thanks for the response
[2014-01-19 04:27:43 -0500] Zauberfisch: chef (or actually ruby in general) seems to be a pain in the arse to run on windows
[2014-01-19 04:33:37 -0500] jidar: it is
[2014-01-19 04:33:46 -0500] jidar: also, it's so damn slow
[2014-01-19 04:33:47 -0500] jidar: haahah
[2014-01-19 04:35:04 -0500] Zauberfisch: well, my workstation chef doesn't have to be fast I guess
[2014-01-19 04:54:40 -0500] fak3r: running chef-client is giving me an error I haven't seen before, "could not find recipe epel for cookbook yum"
[2014-01-19 04:54:55 -0500] fak3r: full chef run and error is here https://gist.github.com/philcryer/8500594
[2014-01-19 05:19:11 -0500] fak3r: so now, all of the nodes get this error, I've restarted chef-server, I've even rebooted the server - nothing works anymore, same error above. (was fine yesterday)
[2014-01-19 05:19:54 -0500] atompngn: fak3r, you pulled in yum 3.0 in some cookbook
[2014-01-19 05:20:26 -0500] atompngn: fak3r, possibly have a cookbook that depends on ~> 2.0 and ~> 3.0 of yum.
[2014-01-19 05:20:50 -0500] atompngn: fak3r, i mean 2 different cookboks that depend on each respectively
[2014-01-19 05:22:24 -0500] atompngn: fak3r, 'git grep yum::epel', and change to 'yum-epel'
[2014-01-19 05:30:05 -0500] fak3r: atompngn: ok, so instead of include_recipe "yum::epel"
[2014-01-19 05:30:08 -0500] fak3r: use include_recipe "yum-epel"
[2014-01-19 05:32:26 -0500] atompngn: fak3r, yes unless you pin all instances of yum to '~> 2.0' which have the epel recipe
[2014-01-19 05:33:00 -0500] atompngn: fak3r, otherwise w/ yum 3.0, its been broken out into a separate cookbook yum-epel
[2014-01-19 05:36:04 -0500] fak3r: so I'd pin any use of yum in the cookbook to '~>2.0'
[2014-01-19 05:36:18 -0500] fak3r: and I'd the the same for yum::epel?
[2014-01-19 05:56:01 -0500] fak3r: in Berksfile I did cookbook 'yum', '~>2.0' - berks in; berks up, but chef-client still gives the same error
[2014-01-19 07:37:33 -0500] zeknox: im trying to create a deployment process for apache2, passenger, psql, rbenv, i have all these working in the process, but what cookbook should I use to install rails?
[2014-01-19 07:39:11 -0500] savant: isnt rails an application-level dependency?
[2014-01-19 07:39:26 -0500] savant: your gemfile should take care of that, no?
[2014-01-19 07:52:06 -0500] zeknox: savant: i dont think so, i think that i need to use the rails_application cookbook:  http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/rails_application
[2014-01-19 07:52:32 -0500] savant: i mean
[2014-01-19 07:52:40 -0500] savant: you dont need to deploy your app from within chef
[2014-01-19 07:52:42 -0500] savant: but oks
[2014-01-19 07:53:21 -0500] zeknox: yes i understand that, i will use capistrano to deploy the app, but right now apache with mod_passenger wont render the rails code, and i think its because i dont have rails_application installed or a rails gem
[2014-01-19 07:53:47 -0500] savant: i guess
[2014-01-19 07:56:33 -0500] savant: lol
[2014-01-19 07:56:40 -0500] savant: woops wrong window
[2014-01-19 13:48:04 -0500] aboudreault: any idea why I can't use sudo in my bash script anymore (was working before) . I't a chef recipe for my vagrant env. error: http://paste.ofcode.org/a4Ft2cCSu28jvKVaLktX7x
[2014-01-19 14:14:10 -0500] krz: hi
[2014-01-19 14:16:17 -0500] cwj: aboudreault: that leads me to believe your sudo is not configured to allow that user passwordless sudo access
[2014-01-19 14:16:30 -0500] cwj: aboudreault: have you considered using the resources provided by the sudo cookbook to ensure that sudo is configured to your liking before your script runs?
[2014-01-19 14:16:44 -0500] aboudreault: it is. with vagrant ssh, I can do sudo echo "dddd" without password asking
[2014-01-19 14:17:20 -0500] cwj: that doesnt necessarily mean that your commands are executing as the vagrant user
[2014-01-19 14:17:39 -0500] aboudreault: cwj, well, I specified user 'vagrant'
[2014-01-19 14:17:44 -0500] aboudreault: in the bash call
[2014-01-19 14:18:27 -0500] aboudreault: currently splitting my bash script into two part, compile and install. but I found that unuseful. it was minimal and perfect using a simple script.
[2014-01-19 14:18:38 -0500] cwj: tried using debug logging with your chef run?
[2014-01-19 14:19:08 -0500] aboudreault: maybe I'll try that after. almost finished the small refactoring though.
[2014-01-19 14:20:42 -0500] krz: if i need to test some recipes out in localhost. how should i go about this?
[2014-01-19 14:21:29 -0500] cwj: krz: vagrant + virtualbox is a popular option
[2014-01-19 14:22:38 -0500] aboudreault: krz, I use vagrant + chef + berkshelf here. works great.
[2014-01-19 14:24:35 -0500] krz: my recipes are really simple. i just want to test if it creates the file in the right place
[2014-01-19 14:25:08 -0500] cwj: krz: ok, you can probably run a recipe on your actual localhost pretty easily using chef-solo
[2014-01-19 14:25:22 -0500] aboudreault: vagrant + berkshelf is easy. I test all my stuff in directory of my recipe
[2014-01-19 14:26:44 -0500] krz: how does one install chef solo? installing the chef gem do it?
[2014-01-19 14:27:02 -0500] cwj: krz: i would use the omnibus installer
[2014-01-19 14:27:17 -0500] cwj: http://www.getchef.com/chef/install/
[2014-01-19 14:28:18 -0500] cwj: but to answer your question, i think you could install it via gem as well
[2014-01-19 14:32:31 -0500] krz: ok trying that out via the gem chef
[2014-01-19 14:36:09 -0500] krz: where do you all create cookbooks?
[2014-01-19 14:36:31 -0500] krz: in /var/chef?
[2014-01-19 14:38:33 -0500] krz: anyone
[2014-01-19 14:44:16 -0500] cwj: krz: /var/chef is one place i might drop off cookbooks on a remote machine for chef-solo to run, but i dont work out of that directory when writing cookbooks
[2014-01-19 14:44:37 -0500] cwj: i generally make each cookbook its own git repository
[2014-01-19 14:45:21 -0500] krz: cwj: under ~/cookbooks ?
[2014-01-19 14:45:39 -0500] cwj: ~/chef
[2014-01-19 14:45:53 -0500] krz: ok sounds good will try this out
[2014-01-19 14:45:55 -0500] cwj: but thats just personal preference
[2014-01-19 14:47:12 -0500] krz: cwj: thats fine. i just need to test locally. i hate having to change some recipes and ppush remotely several times just to make sure the recipes work
[2014-01-19 14:47:14 -0500] krz: takes too much time
[2014-01-19 14:47:48 -0500] cwj: yeah thats part of the appeal of testing locally with tools like vagrant
[2014-01-19 14:48:15 -0500] cwj: that and not constantly messing up your own workstation, which probably doesnt look much like your target environment anyway
[2014-01-19 15:04:14 -0500] krz: cwj: what do i need to put in solo.rb to change the default path it currently looks at (/var/chef)
[2014-01-19 15:05:04 -0500] cwj: i believe cookbook_path is the variable
[2014-01-19 15:05:28 -0500] cwj: cookbook_path ::File.expand_path(~/chef)
[2014-01-19 15:05:30 -0500] cwj: might work
[2014-01-19 15:06:04 -0500] krz: i got cookbook_path File.expand_path('../cookbooks', __FILE__)
[2014-01-19 15:06:08 -0500] krz: oh
[2014-01-19 15:06:36 -0500] cwj: i believe its looking for a directory containing multiple cookbooks
[2014-01-19 15:08:17 -0500] krz: cookbook_path File.expand_path('~/Chef/cookbooks', __FILE__)
[2014-01-19 15:08:29 -0500] krz: still get:
[2014-01-19 15:08:31 -0500] krz: [2014-01-19T23:09:35+08:00] ERROR: Permission denied - /var/chef
[2014-01-19 15:08:51 -0500] krz: why is it still looking in /var/chef
[2014-01-19 15:10:13 -0500] krz: ah i removed ~
[2014-01-19 15:10:23 -0500] krz: and used an explicit path instead
[2014-01-19 15:10:38 -0500] krz: err still the same actually
[2014-01-19 15:13:28 -0500] krz: aboudreault: with your combination. do you still need virtual box?
[2014-01-19 15:13:52 -0500] krz: you said: aboudreault | krz, I use vagrant + chef + berkshelf here. works great.
[2014-01-19 15:14:01 -0500] krz: where is virtualbox?
[2014-01-19 15:14:11 -0500] cwj: vagrant drives virtualbox, or some other virtualization system
[2014-01-19 15:14:17 -0500] cwj: e.g. vmware, docker, etc
[2014-01-19 15:14:31 -0500] krz: oh
[2014-01-19 15:21:39 -0500] krz: hmm but if im testing a recipe. how can i throw it a custom json?
[2014-01-19 15:21:42 -0500] krz: i.e. params
[2014-01-19 15:32:53 -0500] krz: where are the chef logs located?
[2014-01-19 15:32:57 -0500] krz: i.e. when one does Chef::Log.info("foooooooooooooooooooooo")
[2014-01-19 15:47:33 -0500] zxd: what do I do if want to append to new attributes to mysql cookbook and append the values to the .erb file under templates/  ? do I need to create a wrapper cookbook ? and copy the content of the entire original .erb file?
[2014-01-19 15:47:45 -0500] zxd: s/to/two
[2014-01-19 16:03:12 -0500] krz: is   symlink_before_migrate '.env' => 'config/.env'
[2014-01-19 16:03:29 -0500] krz: is symlink_before_migrate only available inside the deploy block?
[2014-01-19 16:32:39 -0500] zxd: where on chef server are roles saved?
[2014-01-19 17:40:56 -0500] Cope: zxd: the role dsl converts the role to json which is sent to the role API end point
[2014-01-19 17:59:02 -0500] CaptainQuirk: any chefspec users around here ?
[2014-01-19 17:59:26 -0500] CaptainQuirk: #join chefspec
[2014-01-19 18:08:10 -0500] CaptainQuirk: Hi
[2014-01-19 18:08:48 -0500] CaptainQuirk: I'm trying to use chefspec but there are a couple of things I don't understand
[2014-01-19 18:16:09 -0500] Cope: CaptainQuirk: /j chefspec :)
[2014-01-19 18:16:23 -0500] CaptainQuirk: Cope, yeah ...
[2014-01-19 18:16:28 -0500] CaptainQuirk: no one there
[2014-01-19 18:16:31 -0500] CaptainQuirk: ;)
[2014-01-19 18:16:55 -0500] Cope: i'm thre
[2014-01-19 20:24:35 -0500] zeknox: im using the postgresql cookbook, what is the proper way to creat an additional db and user role?
[2014-01-19 21:26:27 -0500] silk: Is it possible to wrap a notifies in a conditional statement?
[2014-01-19 22:35:27 -0500] taftse: https://gist.github.com/taftse/810e13605ae0f596e17e
[2014-01-19 22:36:21 -0500] Taftse|Mac: trying to change folder permissions with chef and am getting the following error can someone tell me where I'm going wrong ? https://gist.github.com/taftse/810e13605ae0f596e17e
[2014-01-19 22:53:43 -0500] silk: Can you also gist the recipe that is including that
[2014-01-19 22:54:32 -0500] silk: and what is the value of deploy[:deploy_to] at that point
[2014-01-19 22:55:42 -0500] Taftse|Mac: silk the recipe should be at the bottom
[2014-01-19 22:55:56 -0500] Taftse|Mac: rw_storage_permissions.rb
[2014-01-19 22:56:25 -0500] Taftse|Mac: I'm not sure what the deploy[:deploy_to] value is
[2014-01-19 22:57:33 -0500] silk: yeah, I saw the recipe but if you read the error message: [2014-01-19T21:36:10+00:00] ERROR: Caught exception while compiling OpsWorks custom run list: ArgumentError - You must supply a name when declaring a deploy resource
[2014-01-19 22:57:57 -0500] Taftse|Mac: tbh I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing
[2014-01-19 22:58:58 -0500] silk: and there is a method_missing error in there also, which i think is probably somethign to do with deploy[:deploy_to] not really existing
[2014-01-19 22:59:10 -0500] Taftse|Mac: hmm
[2014-01-19 22:59:28 -0500] silk: so we may need to see the piece of the puzzle that is including the rw_storage_permissions recipe
[2014-01-19 22:59:54 -0500] Taftse|Mac: well the error is being thrown by aws opsworks
[2014-01-19 23:00:38 -0500] Taftse|Mac: which allows me to set recipes for different stages of the provisioning of the server/app
[2014-01-19 23:01:43 -0500] silk: ok, so presumably there is a deploy resource somewhere in your recipes
[2014-01-19 23:01:50 -0500] Taftse|Mac: give me a second just going to try something
[2014-01-19 23:01:54 -0500] silk: at least that seems to be what the error is indicating
[2014-01-19 23:02:23 -0500] Taftse|Mac: yes there is a section that allows me to specify recipes for deployment
[2014-01-19 23:03:06 -0500] Taftse|Mac: this is the repo with all the cookbooks I'm using https://github.com/taftse/AWS_Cookbooks
[2014-01-19 23:03:53 -0500] Taftse|Mac: most of them are standard cookbooks created by amazon but just edited to install php 5.5 instead of 5.3
[2014-01-19 23:10:08 -0500] flaccid: there is ##aws for opsworks
[2014-01-19 23:10:47 -0500] Taftse|Mac: yes but I'm not getting any help there
[2014-01-19 23:11:04 -0500] flaccid: :(
[2014-01-19 23:11:08 -0500] flaccid: maybe try the aws forums
[2014-01-19 23:11:26 -0500] Cope: This reminds me of the early days of ubuntu... when people would ask for help in #debian
[2014-01-19 23:11:48 -0500] Cope: Ubuntu... well it's *based* on Debian... it's *like* debian
[2014-01-19 23:12:05 -0500] Taftse|Mac: yes thought this might be the quickest considering its a chef recipe which is causing the problem
[2014-01-19 23:12:12 -0500] flaccid: well in this case its an opsworks error right, not chef
[2014-01-19 23:12:15 -0500] Cope: to which the often heard response was: well, ozone is *like* oxygen... it's based on the sae thing.. but I don't suggest you breathe it :)
[2014-01-19 23:13:00 -0500] Taftse|Mac: the funny thing is that script worked fine when i had the server on php 5.3
[2014-01-19 23:21:33 -0500] bgupta: US-ASCII or UTF-8 for cookbooks??
[2014-01-19 23:23:16 -0500] flaccid: Taftse|Mac: looks like you can set the php version by node attribute so you wouldn't have to use an 'aws cookbook' or edit a cookbook https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/php/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L82
[2014-01-19 23:23:31 -0500] BuSerD: My stance is that it doesn't matter until it does. don't set it unless you have a reason to do so.
[2014-01-19 23:25:09 -0500] bgupta: have started running rubocop against my new cookbooks, and rubocop doesn't like US-ASCII, and is askign for UTF-8.. Any reason not to comply?
[2014-01-19 23:25:32 -0500] flaccid: i don't see why not
[2014-01-19 23:25:34 -0500] BuSerD: none that I can think of
[2014-01-19 23:25:40 -0500] bgupta: danke
[2014-01-19 23:26:00 -0500] BuSerD: not a problem. you have a valid reason :)
