[2014-01-12 00:51:15 -0500] cheeseplus: chef-lll: just tweak nginx - client_max_body_size #M;
[2014-01-12 01:33:37 -0500] chef-lll: cheeseplus: already tried that, the error message is from erchef, not nginx
[2014-01-12 01:35:55 -0500] cheeseplus: chef-lll: only other way that I know how is disabling ohai plugins to bring the size down
[2014-01-12 01:43:26 -0500] cheeseplus: chef-lll: if you're feeling bold you could rebuild chef_wm: https://github.com/opscode/chef_wm/blob/master/src/chef_wm_enforce.erl#L35
[2014-01-12 01:44:46 -0500] gchristensen: oh my
[2014-01-12 01:45:34 -0500] cheeseplus: gchristensen: to the rebuild? ;)
[2014-01-12 01:45:40 -0500] gchristensen: yup
[2014-01-12 01:45:51 -0500] gchristensen: :)
[2014-01-12 01:46:01 -0500] cheeseplus: I mean the real solution, in every other case I've seen, is reduce size
[2014-01-12 01:46:17 -0500] cheeseplus: it's just Erlang :D
[2014-01-12 01:46:18 -0500] gchristensen: probably the better solution... there is likely some data being passed back you don't need
[2014-01-12 01:47:09 -0500] ranjib_: ^^ +1
[2014-01-12 01:47:11 -0500] cheeseplus: it's definitely the better solution
[2014-01-12 01:47:37 -0500] cheeseplus: too much time looking at Riak code has made me less averse to dropping in updated Erlang beams
[2014-01-12 01:48:25 -0500] gchristensen: cheeseplus: not that there is an issue or fear there, but changing upstream isn't a low-cost proposition :) you're committed to that forever.
[2014-01-12 01:48:55 -0500] cheeseplus: oh totally - I'd not do it but if one insisted that is how to do it ;)
[2014-01-12 09:43:05 -0500] zxd: is it possible to specify runlists to environments?
[2014-01-12 09:57:10 -0500] railsraider: hi, i'm trying to set node attribute with node.default inside a ruby block, it seems like it is a scope issue and the node attribute value is only available inside the ruby block and not outside of it
[2014-01-12 09:57:44 -0500] railsraider: how can i use node.default in such a way that it is available for the enitre recipe run
[2014-01-12 09:58:19 -0500] railsraider: i'll try without the block
[2014-01-12 10:00:44 -0500] coderanger: railsraider: Remember that chef is a two-pass execution system
[2014-01-12 10:00:52 -0500] coderanger: outside of the ruby block, your code hasn't run yet
[2014-01-12 10:00:59 -0500] railsraider: yes you right
[2014-01-12 10:01:06 -0500] railsraider: i simpply removed the block
[2014-01-12 10:01:13 -0500] railsraider: no real need for that
[2014-01-12 10:28:36 -0500] zxd: anyone here|?
[2014-01-12 10:30:07 -0500] zxd: when I add a node to an environment does it consult the roles list to check which runlist to run for that specific environment
[2014-01-12 10:30:36 -0500] zxd: do I need to add both the environment and role to a node how does it work?
[2014-01-12 10:36:42 -0500] jonlives: zxd: it will check the environment for any cookbook version constraints etc to apply, the run_list won't change unless you're using per-environment run_lists in your roles: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_roles.html#set-per-environment-run-lists
[2014-01-12 10:37:06 -0500] jonlives: zxd: the environment doesn't specify the run_list, only constraints.
[2014-01-12 10:49:45 -0500] zxd: I have another small question, I one can invoke different recipes with cookbook::recipe   in yum cookbook  there is a file called  main.rb under attributes/   not default.rb  how do I access the attributes on this file from the recipe ? or does chef by default read all .rb files under attributes so it dosen't matter what I call the .rb file
[2014-01-12 10:52:03 -0500] jonlives: zxd: the latter - see second para of http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_attribute_files.html
[2014-01-12 10:58:28 -0500] zxd: cool
[2014-01-12 10:59:42 -0500] zxd: jonlives: one last question please, I see in alot of coobooks examples they name their attributes as  default['cookbookname']['thenmakeupwhatevertheywant'][.....   is there a reason why this is? can I choose whatever I want after default[ ... ?
[2014-01-12 11:00:38 -0500] jonlives: zxd: attribute naming like that is mainly for organisational reasons, to make it clear which attributes were created by (or apply to) which cookbook. There's no technical reason you can't change the names if you want to.
[2014-01-12 11:08:38 -0500] bubu: Hey guys, am using the S3_File community cookbook. I want to include the Chef::Provider::File::RemoteFile Class into my s3_file provider so I can use file_cache_path's. How is this done? Could someone point me to documentation how to do this?
[2014-01-12 11:33:04 -0500] zxd: jonlives: when using per environment run list the node needs to be associated with both a role and an environment correct?
[2014-01-12 11:33:12 -0500] zxd: ofcourse makes sense
[2014-01-12 11:33:23 -0500] zxd: how else would it know which per_environment run list to choose
[2014-01-12 11:33:51 -0500] jonlives: zxd: correct - if you don't explcitly add a node into an environment, it's actually in an environment called _default.
[2014-01-12 11:34:28 -0500] jonlives: zxd: so you add a role to the node's run_list, add the node to an environment.
[2014-01-12 11:34:42 -0500] zxd: question is where to store attributes for the application based on the environment, if under environment/  or like in the example http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_roles.html#set-per-environment-run-lists in the cookbook itself under env_run_lists "recipe[apache::copy_test_configs]"
[2014-01-12 11:35:56 -0500] jonlives: zxd: that depends on how you want them to take precedence - see the attribute precedence section of http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_attribute_files.html
[2014-01-12 11:52:47 -0500] zxd: what does a  node['']  attribute mean?  default['']  become node[''] attriubte ?  after a chef run?
[2014-01-12 11:54:38 -0500] jonlives: zxd: default is just setting the precedence level. As of chef 11, you have to specify the precedence level of the attribute you're writing to (https://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Breaking+Changes+in+Chef+11#BreakingChangesinChef11-NodeAttributeChanges:). Before that, you were implicitly writing to a "normal" precedence attribute if you didn't specify.
[2014-01-12 11:56:20 -0500] jonlives: zxd: when saved on the node after a run, node.default['apache'['foo'] will be node['apache']['foo']
[2014-01-12 11:56:49 -0500] jonlives: when using attribute values you don't need to specify the precedence, you only need to give the precedence when *writing* to the attribute.
[2014-01-12 11:58:18 -0500] jonlives: zxd: personally, in cookbooks I tend to always set attributes at the "default" level in the cookbooks's attributes file(which is 1 out of 15 on the precedence list). That means if I need to override the attribute in a role or environment I can do,.
[2014-01-12 11:58:36 -0500] jonlives: general best practice is to use the lowest precedence level you can.
[2014-01-12 11:58:46 -0500] jonlives: ^ in my opiniom, at least
[2014-01-12 13:12:57 -0500] railsraider: i'm having troubles with aws cookbook tags - i pass it tags to be updated and it ignores them
[2014-01-12 13:13:15 -0500] railsraider: anyone had luck with that? i also tried remove
[2014-01-12 13:13:18 -0500] railsraider: and add
[2014-01-12 13:13:28 -0500] railsraider: same thing, wont update
[2014-01-12 13:15:05 -0500] railsraider: anyone can help with this nightmare?
[2014-01-12 13:27:40 -0500] zxd: :/
[2014-01-12 13:49:07 -0500] railsraider: I got all my nodes on _default env, why when i do  cookbook upload aws -E test it goes to _default too?
[2014-01-12 13:55:57 -0500] gregkare: Uploading cookbooks doesn't take an environment switch
[2014-01-12 13:56:25 -0500] gregkare: You can set versions of cookbooks each of your environment will use though
[2014-01-12 13:57:05 -0500] gregkare: knife-spork is really useful for bumping, uploading & freezing and promoting to your different environments
[2014-01-12 14:29:35 -0500] railsraider: gregkare: but i see -E Set ENVIRONMENT's version dependency match the version you're uploading
[2014-01-12 14:29:44 -0500] railsraider: when i do knife cookbook upload --help
[2014-01-12 14:49:22 -0500] jonlives: railsraider: that doesn't actually make sure your node is in that environment, it just adds a version contraint into the environment to match the version of the cookbook you just uploaded.
[2014-01-12 14:49:49 -0500] jonlives: railsraider: to actually move a node into an environment, you can use something like https://github.com/jonlives/knife-flip
[2014-01-12 14:50:12 -0500] railsraider: i know, but i set my node manually from the chef UI to test env and then push the cookbook to that env, and then cookbook on default get the changes too
[2014-01-12 14:51:07 -0500] jonlives: railsraider: the _default environment doesn't contain any version constraints. if an environment doesn't have specific constraints set, any nodes in that environment will get the latest version of any cookbooks.
[2014-01-12 14:51:35 -0500] railsraider: thanks
[2014-01-12 14:51:38 -0500] jonlives: np :)
[2014-01-12 14:52:07 -0500] jonlives: railsraider: think of version constraints as opt-in - they'll be respected if specified, but otherwise everything will grab the latest cookbook versions by default.
[2014-01-12 15:29:08 -0500] Abhishek: Hi epcim you mentioned that chef supports multi tier app deployment ootb. can you please point me to any doc or blog?  what about rolling upgrade?
[2014-01-12 15:50:41 -0500] zxd: question about this cookbook it says it iterates through  node['users']  in https://github.com/fnichol/chef-user though no where in this cook book I see anything that defines this
[2014-01-12 15:58:30 -0500] Abhishek: hi guys can any one tell me "Does chef support multi tier app deployment and rolling upgardes?"
[2014-01-12 16:02:24 -0500] zxd: knife role from file roles/devstation.rb

[2014-01-12 16:05:35 -0500] zxd: forgot "_default" => []
[2014-01-12 16:06:22 -0500] zxd: they should be consistant and put in all examples
[2014-01-12 16:06:27 -0500] zxd: and  not snippet of code like in diff
[2014-01-12 16:06:30 -0500] cheeseplus: Abhishek: very generally yes but there are lots of ways to do attack that problem
[2014-01-12 16:06:31 -0500] zxd: very confusing
[2014-01-12 16:06:46 -0500] cheeseplus: Abhishek: also a very open ended question ;)
[2014-01-12 16:10:10 -0500] Abhishek: cheeseplus : can you point any documentation where multi tier app is managed through chef?   I know we can solve this problem but i just wanted to know if this is done by chef out of the box the way Ansible does.
[2014-01-12 16:11:32 -0500] cheeseplus: Abhishek: it's not exactly something ootb, Chef isn't an orchestration layer though you can make it act like one
[2014-01-12 16:11:34 -0500] zxd: is there a syntax error here  override_attributes 'user' => { 'ssh_keygen' => 'false' }
[2014-01-12 16:11:34 -0500] zxd:    ?
[2014-01-12 16:12:39 -0500] Abhishek: cheeseplus: if you have solved this problem , then what was you way to solve this?
[2014-01-12 16:13:48 -0500] cheeseplus: Abhishek: what do you mean by multi-tier exactly?
[2014-01-12 16:15:42 -0500] zxd: it's very confusing also the names,  in one context node means the actual station where chef-client will run and configure the node, in other context they are  attributes like   override_attributes "node" => { "attribute" => [ "value", "value", "etc." ] }
[2014-01-12 16:15:46 -0500] zxd: ?
[2014-01-12 16:17:47 -0500] cheeseplus: zxd: usually the actual station is referred to as "workstation", node (in chef parlance) has a very specific meaning
[2014-01-12 16:18:02 -0500] cheeseplus: that said sometimes there are only so many words and humans write docs
[2014-01-12 16:18:44 -0500] cheeseplus: Abhishek: generally for rolling upgrades I use chef environments to lock versions of cookbooks which control the application version
[2014-01-12 16:18:52 -0500] zxd: cheeseplus: what is the meaning? one meaning is the value set to attributes after they have been compiled on the workstation?
[2014-01-12 16:19:32 -0500] zxd: I am confused
[2014-01-12 16:20:00 -0500] zxd: btw, what's the correct ruby syntax to add multiplie override_attributes in a role .rb file
[2014-01-12 16:21:02 -0500] cheeseplus: zxd: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_node_object.html
[2014-01-12 16:21:15 -0500] cheeseplus: when using the term node with respect to Chef
[2014-01-12 16:21:38 -0500] cheeseplus: workstation is the machine you have configured to interact with the chef server
[2014-01-12 16:22:23 -0500] cheeseplus: zxd: also I highly recommend the Learn Chef resources for helping clarify this stuff - https://learnchef.opscode.com/
[2014-01-12 16:24:31 -0500] cheeseplus: zxd: for override attribute example - http://pastebin.com/mYMQU3Kz
[2014-01-12 16:24:45 -0500] Abhishek: cheeseplus: when i am talking about rolling upgrade this means  that if i have 10 web servers then chef should disable monitoring, disable server in LB and deploy code on one of the box at a time and after that put server back into the LB and repeat same on other nodes,  multi tier app deployment is like if i need 1 web , 1 app and 1 db server i define template where i put my requirement and chef will provision the multi tier app envi
[2014-01-12 16:25:07 -0500] Abhishek: its something like templating your app requirement
[2014-01-12 16:25:16 -0500] zxd: cheeseplus: that's JSON ?
[2014-01-12 16:25:21 -0500] zxd: cheeseplus: do you have it in ruby?
[2014-01-12 16:25:46 -0500] cheeseplus: zxd: that isn't JSON, the => isn't legal in json
[2014-01-12 16:26:38 -0500] cheeseplus: zxd: the parenthesis are allowable since it's a method, it just makes it easier to read
[2014-01-12 16:26:39 -0500] zxd: do I need the  : before apache2 and tomcat ?
[2014-01-12 16:27:09 -0500] cheeseplus: if you use the parenthesis I believe you do
[2014-01-12 16:27:25 -0500] cheeseplus: I'm not a ruby expert or by any stretch
[2014-01-12 16:28:16 -0500] cheeseplus: Abhishek: so yes, chef can do that but the disabling monitoring and controlling one box at a time is something you need to potentially use another service to control
[2014-01-12 16:28:38 -0500] cheeseplus: Abhishek: enterprise chef has a "pushy" feature that allows for something more like orchestration
[2014-01-12 16:29:19 -0500] Abhishek: cheeseplus: do not we have this kind of feature in opensource chef version?
[2014-01-12 16:29:20 -0500] cheeseplus: Abhishek: but you could have nodes save attributes on themselves or modify roles/environments to set flags that remove/add nodes to appropriate pools
[2014-01-12 16:29:51 -0500] cheeseplus: Abhishek: it is coming but as with many features it starts off in the enterprise version (don't hold me to this I don't work for Chef)
[2014-01-12 16:30:26 -0500] cheeseplus: I've seen many clients use chef for the configuration management and something like fabric or ansible for orchestation-y type stuff
[2014-01-12 16:31:45 -0500] cheeseplus: Abhishek: as for defining stacks, that is something chef can easily do with combinations of environments, roles, and run_lists
[2014-01-12 16:32:11 -0500] cheeseplus: another option is to use something like etcd/zookeeper that chef can query for values
[2014-01-12 16:32:43 -0500] cheeseplus: Abhishek: I highly recommend giving the Etsy article a look: http://codeascraft.com/2013/08/02/infrastructure-upgrades-with-chef/
[2014-01-12 16:33:18 -0500] cheeseplus: there is lots of tooling around Chef that can help you setup whatever workflow you want
[2014-01-12 16:33:20 -0500] Abhishek: cheeseplus: have you checked Cloudify?
[2014-01-12 16:34:24 -0500] cheeseplus: generally familiar but I stay away from OpenStack myself
[2014-01-12 16:34:45 -0500] cheeseplus: also my brain turns off at "DevOps Applications"
[2014-01-12 16:36:01 -0500] cheeseplus: perhaps one of the biggest complaints from new and veteran usere alike is that Chef isn't opinionated out of the box (I was totally in that boat when I started using)
[2014-01-12 16:41:55 -0500] cheeseplus: zxd: although not required, I find it easier to stick to json instead of ruby if only because it turns into json on the server anyway
[2014-01-12 16:58:05 -0500] zxd: didn't understand what node is from http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_node_object.html
[2014-01-12 16:58:08 -0500] zxd: too abstract
[2014-01-12 16:58:13 -0500] zxd: what is it in ruby ?
[2014-01-12 16:59:53 -0500] cheeseplus: http://rubydoc.info/gems/chef/Chef/Node/
[2014-01-12 17:00:35 -0500] cheeseplus: the node object stores information about the target node
[2014-01-12 17:01:18 -0500] zxd: target node???
[2014-01-12 17:01:29 -0500] cheeseplus: the machine that chef is running on
[2014-01-12 17:01:33 -0500] zxd: god
[2014-01-12 17:01:35 -0500] zxd: ok
[2014-01-12 17:01:40 -0500] zxd: I see
[2014-01-12 17:01:48 -0500] zxd: thanks
[2014-01-12 17:01:53 -0500] cheeseplus: i.e. the machine that runs chef-client
[2014-01-12 17:02:09 -0500] cheeseplus: the information is built up from some inherent machine information (ohai service)
[2014-01-12 17:02:41 -0500] cheeseplus: as well as attributes from the cookbooks and attributes you explicitly assign at the node/role/environment level
[2014-01-12 17:03:12 -0500] cheeseplus: on top of that there are different precedence levels which interact according to that chart
[2014-01-12 17:03:27 -0500] zxd: so I could replace this  override_attributes "node" => { "attribute" => [ "value", "value", "etc." ] }
[2014-01-12 17:03:27 -0500] zxd:    with   override_attributes "nodeOBJECT" => { "attribute" => [ "value", "value", "etc." ] }
[2014-01-12 17:03:34 -0500] zxd: nodeobject  sounds clearer
[2014-01-12 17:03:45 -0500] zxd: node is confusing, node object? target node
[2014-01-12 17:04:21 -0500] cheeseplus: take a step back
[2014-01-12 17:04:30 -0500] cheeseplus: override_attributes "apache2" => { "listen_ports" => [ "80", "443" ] }
[2014-01-12 17:04:32 -0500] cheeseplus: for example
[2014-01-12 17:04:55 -0500] zxd: yes apache2  is a node?
[2014-01-12 17:04:58 -0500] zxd: that's confusing
[2014-01-12 17:05:00 -0500] cheeseplus: no
[2014-01-12 17:05:03 -0500] zxd: it's a node object
[2014-01-12 17:05:04 -0500] zxd: ?
[2014-01-12 17:05:16 -0500] zxd: then why do they call it node  in    http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_roles.html#set-per-environment-run-lists
[2014-01-12 17:05:53 -0500] cheeseplus: apache is an attribute
[2014-01-12 17:06:31 -0500] cheeseplus: attributes get set on nodes
[2014-01-12 17:06:36 -0500] zxd: yes but they are confusing me
[2014-01-12 17:06:42 -0500] zxd: they call it node on that webpage
[2014-01-12 17:08:00 -0500] cheeseplus: in that one example it is definitely confusing but the rest of the page uses it fairly consistently
[2014-01-12 17:10:10 -0500] cheeseplus: I think the complication may stem from the fact node is implied
[2014-01-12 17:10:58 -0500] cheeseplus: as in you could be explicit in a ruby sense but the Chef DSL takes care of that (again, my understanding of rubyisms is not expert level)
[2014-01-12 17:12:21 -0500] cheeseplus: I wouldn't get to hung up on that though, it's something that is easier to reason about (and less abstract) once you start playing cookbooks
[2014-01-12 17:13:42 -0500] zxd: yea
[2014-01-12 17:13:45 -0500] zxd: thanks
[2014-01-12 17:13:53 -0500] cheeseplus: np, happy to help
[2014-01-12 17:13:55 -0500] zxd: yes too many acronym
[2014-01-12 17:14:08 -0500] cheeseplus: it's a huge amount of new terminology if you aren't used to it
[2014-01-12 17:14:17 -0500] jonlives: agreed
[2014-01-12 17:14:20 -0500] cheeseplus: after a year and a half it mostly makes sense to me
[2014-01-12 17:14:32 -0500] cheeseplus: mewstly
[2014-01-12 18:18:05 -0500] fifthecho: So I've got a tricky problem to try and solve. I'm trying to make a Winbind authentication cookbook and am running into an issue where Debian 7 requires libnss-winbind and Debian 6 doesn't have that package. Is there an easy way to build a case for different releases of platforms?
[2014-01-12 18:19:12 -0500] borntyping: node[:platform_version]
[2014-01-12 18:21:00 -0500] fifthecho: borntyping: Wow. I'd been trolling through the docs and missed that somehow. Thanks a ton!
[2014-01-12 18:31:20 -0500] darron__: fifthecho: Here's an example: https://github.com/darron/ubuntu_base-cookbook/blob/master/attributes/default.rb
[2014-01-12 18:33:31 -0500] fifthecho: darron: Thanks.
[2014-01-12 20:01:47 -0500] gchristensen: is anyone else having issues with search ight now?
[2014-01-12 20:02:07 -0500] gchristensen: thah's a yes
[2014-01-12 20:03:26 -0500] gchristensen: jtimberman / kallistec: for the record, http://status.opscode.com/post/73117525751/issues-with-hosted-chef-search says it was posted on Wednesday jan 12... I'm not sure that is right?
[2014-01-12 20:14:13 -0500] queuetip: set up a new os chef server, and i can knife upload stuff to it, but when i try to access the server by going to ip:443 i get a nginx error, although i can visit the same server using https://ip
[2014-01-12 20:14:22 -0500] queuetip: but that's causing me not to be able to bootstrap nodes
[2014-01-12 20:14:53 -0500] queuetip: by going to ip:443 i get a nginx 400 bad request error "The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port"
[2014-01-12 20:15:16 -0500] queuetip: it's literally the same ec2 ami and same set up and same config as another server that works just fine heh
[2014-01-12 20:29:33 -0500] BuSerD: can you post the nginx config?
[2014-01-12 20:56:10 -0500] queuetip: BuSerD: it's the default config that comes with the embedded nginx
[2014-01-12 20:58:05 -0500] BuSerD: I've seen a few tricks to get past that -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8768946/dealing-with-nginx-400-the-plain-http-request-was-sent-to-https-port-error
[2014-01-12 20:58:16 -0500] BuSerD: they do a pretty decent job of explaining
[2014-01-12 21:11:02 -0500] rafaelmagu: getting a lot of "Usage: bookshelf {start|stop|restart|reboot|ping|console|console_clean|attach}" messages in the log for bookshelf while trying to start server
[2014-01-12 21:11:07 -0500] rafaelmagu: All the other services are up
[2014-01-12 21:11:14 -0500] rafaelmagu: Anyone else experinced that?
[2014-01-12 21:11:18 -0500] rafaelmagu: experienced*
[2014-01-12 21:14:15 -0500] queuetip: BuSerD_away: i tried that, but the default config doesn't even have ssl on in it, so i tried a ton of variations of it too, all without success
[2014-01-12 21:37:50 -0500] rmg: Are there any guides for writing community cookbooks?
[2014-01-12 22:00:05 -0500] cheeseplus: rmg: there is https://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cookbook+Style+Guide+Draft
[2014-01-12 22:00:23 -0500] cheeseplus: but other than that it's really greenfield
[2014-01-12 22:00:32 -0500] cheeseplus: write it, let people comment and PR
[2014-01-12 22:00:58 -0500] cheeseplus: try to look at existing ones like apache or nginx as they're probably the most mature
[2014-01-12 22:01:38 -0500] rmg: so there's nothing for scaffolding them like there is for deployment repos?
[2014-01-12 22:02:26 -0500] rmg: I'm new to Chef, but quite familiar with Ruby
[2014-01-12 22:02:31 -0500] cheeseplus: there is "knife cookbook create"
[2014-01-12 22:02:56 -0500] cheeseplus: that sets up the files that you'll use but I know folks who just write a single default recipe and that is it
[2014-01-12 22:03:31 -0500] cheeseplus: and there is also The Berkshelf way which is what most of the cool kids are using
[2014-01-12 22:03:43 -0500] cheeseplus: http://misheska.com/blog/2013/06/16/getting-started-writing-chef-cookbooks-the-berkshelf-way/
[2014-01-12 22:04:31 -0500] cheeseplus: then you can easily have a Vagrantfile in there and get a head start on test-kitchen testing
[2014-01-12 22:04:33 -0500] rmg: that might be what I'm looking for.. skimming now
[2014-01-12 22:05:15 -0500] cheeseplus: rmg: it's a good pattern but by no means required - just makes lots of other stuff like local testing easier
[2014-01-12 22:05:41 -0500] rmg: seems focused on making an application cookbook, not a cookbook for a stack component
[2014-01-12 22:07:19 -0500] cheeseplus: in that example yes, but stack cookbooks still have dependencies (like apt perhaps) so it still can be useful
[2014-01-12 22:07:34 -0500] cheeseplus: example and shameless plug: https://github.com/basho/riak-chef-cookbook
[2014-01-12 22:08:11 -0500] cheeseplus: even though it's just a DB cookbook it's still Berkshelf'ed to lock dependencies and for vagrant
[2014-01-12 22:09:31 -0500] rmg: so how do you test that?
[2014-01-12 22:09:53 -0500] cheeseplus: test-kitchen
[2014-01-12 22:10:13 -0500] rmg: big fan of Basho, btw.. I've ready far more about Riak than is healthy for someone who isn't using it
[2014-01-12 22:10:15 -0500] cheeseplus: I can either go in and do a "vagrant up" which will build me out a configured VM
[2014-01-12 22:10:36 -0500] cheeseplus: or run "kitchen test REGEX-FOR-BOX-TYPE"
[2014-01-12 22:10:43 -0500] cheeseplus: rmg: :D
[2014-01-12 22:11:00 -0500] cheeseplus: it's basically a series of academic papers masquerading as a database
[2014-01-12 22:11:21 -0500] cheeseplus: rmg: for ours we also use foodcritic which checks some basic syntax stuff
[2014-01-12 22:11:38 -0500] cheeseplus: i.e. a cookbook linter
[2014-01-12 22:11:38 -0500] cheeseplus: http://acrmp.github.io/foodcritic/
[2014-01-12 22:11:39 -0500] rmg: ah, so test-kitchen can run it through its paces without needing to create a separate app cookbook that pulls it in?
[2014-01-12 22:11:46 -0500] cheeseplus: yep
[2014-01-12 22:12:03 -0500] cheeseplus: amazingly useful if you support every platform under the sun
[2014-01-12 22:12:25 -0500] cheeseplus: before then it was lots of manual vagrant testing which was still better than nothing
[2014-01-12 22:12:45 -0500] cheeseplus: if you've got a beefy machine you can do all the permutations in parallel too
[2014-01-12 22:12:51 -0500] cheeseplus: or if you want heat
[2014-01-12 22:13:39 -0500] rmg: my computer was spec'd with that workflow in mind :-)
[2014-01-12 22:14:30 -0500] rmg: the docs I've found on my own are all targeted at ops people deploying, not developers publishing cookbooks for others to use in their deployments
[2014-01-12 22:15:32 -0500] cheeseplus: rmg: on my macbook pro I use parallel, on my air it's hilarious
[2014-01-12 22:16:17 -0500] cheeseplus: I started working on it very barebones and ops oriented, it was my intro to Chef so it's become better and better over time
[2014-01-12 22:25:51 -0500] rmg: cheeseplus: thanks for the link, your riak cookbook looks like a good example of what I'm wanting to do
[2014-01-12 22:26:44 -0500] cheeseplus: glad I could help!
[2014-01-12 22:27:05 -0500] cheeseplus: I think we initially used the nginx one for reference
[2014-01-12 22:29:31 -0500] rmg: ah, looks like the erlang cookbook is a little more fleshed out than the nodejs cookbook.. that explains how you can support so many platforms
[2014-01-12 22:30:46 -0500] rmg: I've seen so many that say "Tested on Ubuntu 10.04, might work elsewhere" I was kinda wondering if anyone was even trying
[2014-01-12 22:43:57 -0500] BuSerD: @queutip . https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8391668
[2014-01-12 22:44:10 -0500] BuSerD: works just fine with a little tweaking.
[2014-01-12 22:50:16 -0500] BuSerD: heck, mistyped your handle. sorry about that queuetip
[2014-01-12 23:19:04 -0500] queuetip: BuSerD: thanks, taking a look now
[2014-01-12 23:29:27 -0500] BuSerD: cool beans.
