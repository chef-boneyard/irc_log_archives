[2014-01-27 00:23:15 -0500] gabrtv: anyone know a way to pre-install a gem w/ knife bootstrap? i need it at compile time..
[2014-01-27 00:23:52 -0500] workmad3: gabrtv: chef_gem installs a gem at compile time
[2014-01-27 00:24:12 -0500] gabrtv: workmad3: yeah, unfortunately i need it before chef_gem
[2014-01-27 00:24:25 -0500] workmad3: gabrtv: sorry, not following...
[2014-01-27 00:24:53 -0500] gabrtv: i have library code that uses the gem.. chef_gem is evaluated after the library code
[2014-01-27 00:25:07 -0500] workmad3: gabrtv: ah, so you want it at *load* time, not compile time
[2014-01-27 00:25:16 -0500] gabrtv: yes!
[2014-01-27 00:25:19 -0500] workmad3: gabrtv: I didn't manage to figure that out :(
[2014-01-27 00:25:36 -0500] gabrtv: no you're right, compile time means something else..
[2014-01-27 00:25:55 -0500] workmad3: gabrtv: no, I mean that when I was considering that problem recently, I didn't figure out a solution ;)
[2014-01-27 00:26:07 -0500] gabrtv: oh, dang
[2014-01-27 00:26:14 -0500] workmad3: gabrtv: I ended up with the stuff I'd written as dependency base classes in a separate cookbook
[2014-01-27 00:26:44 -0500] workmad3: gabrtv: I toyed with the idea of having my bootstrap script install the gem, but that seemed somewhat messier
[2014-01-27 00:27:58 -0500] gabrtv: workmad3: bootstrap script?
[2014-01-27 00:28:11 -0500] workmad3: gabrtv: you can provide a script to bootstrap a node
[2014-01-27 00:28:16 -0500] workmad3: gabrtv: as the --template-file option
[2014-01-27 00:28:28 -0500] gabrtv: score
[2014-01-27 00:28:36 -0500] gabrtv: tyvm kind sir
[2014-01-27 00:28:41 -0500] workmad3: gabrtv: basically, a bash script (with some ERb to allow you to push in values from the client)
[2014-01-27 00:29:12 -0500] workmad3: gabrtv: as I said, it wasn't a solution I particularly liked :)
[2014-01-27 00:29:19 -0500] workmad3: but that's me
[2014-01-27 00:51:05 -0500] thedeeno: When running `chef-client -z` can I specify the node's run_list in a json file I pass in with the `-j` option?
[2014-01-27 00:51:28 -0500] thedeeno: Because it doesn't appear to work. Chef-client is still reporting that my node's run_list is empty.
[2014-01-27 00:55:36 -0500] thedeeno: oh, nvm, if I specify the chef_type as "Chef::Node" it breaks, I guess this file isn't supposed to be a 'node'.
[2014-01-27 00:56:07 -0500] thedeeno: but with just they keys: 'normal, override, default, automatic, and run_list' all appears good. Yay!
[2014-01-27 02:41:41 -0500] estebistec: so, the wrapper cookbook patter is all the rage these days.
[2014-01-27 02:41:47 -0500] estebistec: Are there any patterns for enhancing the behavior of LWRPs by writing new ones?
[2014-01-27 02:42:15 -0500] estebistec: or rather, harvesting provider logic in writing a new one with slightly larger or different scope?

[2014-01-27 08:24:02 -0500] ganaiwali:  we run chef server open source
[2014-01-27 08:24:03 -0500] ganaiwali: have about 100+ cookbook that manage applications almost everhthing
[2014-01-27 08:24:04 -0500] ganaiwali: an environment file got upload to chef by accident
[2014-01-27 08:24:06 -0500] ganaiwali: which did not have latest information of all cookbook that we run in production
[2014-01-27 08:24:07 -0500] ganaiwali:  and as a result on the chef client run , our applications got downgraded to versions that was in stale environments files
[2014-01-27 08:24:08 -0500] ganaiwali: e.g prod.json
[2014-01-27 08:24:09 -0500] ganaiwali: : is there a way to get prod.json update in just a few knife commands and upload the latest one so that chef can update/install as per update .json file
[2014-01-27 08:28:30 -0500] chaoselixir: knife environments from file
[2014-01-27 08:28:35 -0500] chaoselixir: is that what you are looking for ?
[2014-01-27 08:30:22 -0500] ganaiwali: that would upload the environment file which is stale in my case
[2014-01-27 08:30:42 -0500] ganaiwali: the issue is it got uploaded today and was an year old almost
[2014-01-27 08:31:11 -0500] ganaiwali: while as we have updated several cookbooks when are never/updated versions that environments doesent have
[2014-01-27 08:31:51 -0500] ganaiwali: so when the old environments/prod.json got uploaded with old versions of cookbooks
[2014-01-27 08:31:55 -0500] chaoselixir: oh sorry so you are trying to fix the .json file
[2014-01-27 08:33:34 -0500] ganaiwali: is there a way to take latest cookbook or metadata version and dump in to my environments
[2014-01-27 08:33:44 -0500] ganaiwali: so that i can upload new environments file
[2014-01-27 09:22:06 -0500] mattsmith: Morning all, this morning I came into the office to find that several of our instances had >500 chef-clinet processes running, any ideas what causes these to hang and never terminate?
[2014-01-27 09:44:39 -0500] enbergj: mattsmith: try first killing all old processes (killall chef-client) and then running it with debug log in interactive mode: chef-client -l DEBUG
[2014-01-27 09:45:06 -0500] enbergj: then and wait until it freezes

[2014-01-27 17:21:04 -0500] luckymike: though that would surprise me at this point
[2014-01-27 17:21:30 -0500] Doc_X: node[:platform_version] shows "10.8.5"
[2014-01-27 17:21:48 -0500] Doc_X: so, not mavericks, just yet.
[2014-01-27 17:23:21 -0500] Doc_X: and node[:platform] shows 'mac_os_x', so based on the rules detailed at http://docs.opscode.com/resource_template.html#file-specificity i would presume it should choose templates/mac_os_x over templates/default. . . but it doesn't seem to be doing that.
[2014-01-27 17:23:46 -0500] Doc_X: also, this is with chef version 11.8.2 (in the interests of getting all info out there)

[2014-01-27 17:43:28 -0500] btm: addisonj: knife bootstrap --sudo
[2014-01-27 17:44:18 -0500] addisonj: btm: that gives root permissions, but you will still ahve base users env, right? so you don't get home set? or perhaps I am just confused this morning
[2014-01-27 17:54:15 -0500] Doc_X: addisonj: that uses sudo to install chef-client and register with the server. how you run chef-client afterwards is up to you.
[2014-01-27 17:55:11 -0500] mil0: knife ssh nodename chef-client?
[2014-01-27 17:56:33 -0500] mil0: seem broken for me - I use a nodename that exists (node list gives it back) and still get FATAL: No nodes returned from search!
[2014-01-27 17:58:02 -0500] mil0: ah, seems fqdn issue
[2014-01-27 17:58:42 -0500] Doc_X: mil0: knife ssh 'name:fqdn' 'command'    <--- works for me
[2014-01-27 18:00:14 -0500] mil0: if you're using the fqdn, then why not just run ssh fqdn chef-client?
[2014-01-27 18:00:38 -0500] Doc_X: honestly, if i'm working on a single host, I do.
[2014-01-27 18:00:57 -0500] Doc_X: if i'm working on multiple hosts, i search for an attribute of the host to search on.
[2014-01-27 18:01:28 -0500] Doc_X: knife ssh 'run_list:cookbook_name' 'command'
[2014-01-27 18:01:30 -0500] Doc_X: or some such
[2014-01-27 18:02:51 -0500] Doc_X: and more often than that, i'll do a knife search to get the node names, add that to some tmux kung fu and open lots of windows with synchronized keyboard input on those hosts so i'm interactive on all of them at once.
[2014-01-27 18:03:25 -0500] Doc_X: but that's just my particular workflow. YMMV

[2014-01-27 18:28:49 -0500] btm: josephholsten: I haven't heard that. In my experience, it's based on the size of the queue (number of updates) and is normally within a second or two.
[2014-01-27 18:29:13 -0500] josephholsten: k, that makes more sense. esp since workers only have
[2014-01-27 18:30:17 -0500] paulmooring: josephholsten for very lightly used Chef servers it can depend on the time for solr to commit which might be 60 seconds

[2014-01-27 19:33:12 -0500] kbarry: Hmmmm. Can someone show me an example of the "content" parameter for cookbook_file please?
[2014-01-27 19:33:26 -0500] kbarry: I thought it would be in the form content "Hello, this is the content of this file"
[2014-01-27 19:33:41 -0500] kbarry: as in "cookbook_file
[2014-01-27 19:33:50 -0500] kbarry: content "hello there"

[2014-01-27 19:35:43 -0500] docwhat: kbarry: I think you want "file" in that case.  "cookbook_file" has a "source" attribute that gets the file from the files directory.

[2014-01-27 20:09:01 -0500] evan[bam]: when are libraries loaded?
[2014-01-27 20:09:10 -0500] evan[bam]: and did chef 11 change that?
[2014-01-27 20:10:20 -0500] kallistec: evan[bam]: libraries load first, chef 11 didn't change that but the code moved into its own class. https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/run_context/cookbook_compiler.rb#L70-74
[2014-01-27 20:10:31 -0500] evan[bam]: ok, well maybe someone can help me
[2014-01-27 20:10:35 -0500] evan[bam]: with this cookbook: https://github.com/RiotGames/rbenv-cookbook
[2014-01-27 20:10:45 -0500] evan[bam]: the default recipe uses some stuff coming from libraries/
[2014-01-27 20:10:57 -0500] evan[bam]: none of the files in libraries are required before the recipe is run
[2014-01-27 20:10:59 -0500] evan[bam]: so it blows up
[2014-01-27 20:11:26 -0500] evan[bam]: I assume this worked at some point in the past, otherwise this cookbook wouldn't function
[2014-01-27 20:11:50 -0500] kallistec: evan[bam]: if you're on chef-solo, it's probably because the dependency isn't specified
[2014-01-27 20:11:59 -0500] evan[bam]: the dependency from what to what?
[2014-01-27 20:12:03 -0500] evan[bam]: this is intra cookbook
[2014-01-27 20:12:16 -0500] kallistec: from the cookbook using the library to the cookbook containing the library
[2014-01-27 20:12:33 -0500] evan[bam]: it's rbenv's recipes using rbenv's libraries
[2014-01-27 20:12:40 -0500] evan[bam]: or rather, wanting to.
[2014-01-27 20:16:07 -0500] kallistec: evan[bam]: did you run it with -ldebug and confirm you don't see these log entries for the files getting loaded? https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/run_context/cookbook_compiler.rb#L178
[2014-01-27 20:16:22 -0500] evan[bam]: yep
[2014-01-27 20:25:15 -0500] kallistec: evan[bam]: are you loading the recipes from a different cookbook using `include_recipe` ?
[2014-01-27 20:25:37 -0500] evan[bam]: yes
[2014-01-27 20:26:03 -0500] kallistec: evan[bam]: and does that cookbook specify the dependency in its metadata?
[2014-01-27 20:26:12 -0500] evan[bam]: probably not, no.
[2014-01-27 20:27:00 -0500] kallistec: evan[bam]: that's your problem then. chef 11 uses dependencies to find the correct order to load things so they're deterministic and sane
[2014-01-27 20:27:13 -0500] evan[bam]: wow.
[2014-01-27 20:27:17 -0500] kallistec: whereas ordering was basically a crapshoot in the past
[2014-01-27 20:27:21 -0500] evan[bam]: it really should load the libs probably
[2014-01-27 20:28:37 -0500] kallistec: TBH we didn't really consider this exact case when we added the deterministic ordering. IMO trying to include recipe on a cookbook that's not in the run_list or dependencies should be an error
[2014-01-27 20:29:26 -0500] evan[bam]: i'd be happy with it blowing up on the include_recipe
[2014-01-27 20:29:29 -0500] evan[bam]: the way it is now
[2014-01-27 20:29:34 -0500] evan[bam]: it's just a total unknown

[2014-01-27 21:31:26 -0500] coderanger: fak3r: You have a depsolver problem
[2014-01-27 21:32:00 -0500] coderanger: fak3r: This is generally caused by bad version constraints on a cookbook somewhere that triggers pathological behavior in the dependency resolution system
[2014-01-27 21:32:39 -0500] fak3r: ok, thanks, I think the only place I have versions called out is in Berksfile, will take a look
[2014-01-27 21:33:00 -0500] coderanger: No, berksfile has no effect on it
[2014-01-27 21:33:08 -0500] coderanger: Only cookbook metadata and envionment files
[2014-01-27 21:34:50 -0500] Popsikle-Work: does anyone know what directory ohai hints need to be in to be loaded in a plugin?
[2014-01-27 21:34:56 -0500] jej: i've seen it happen when i have constraints in my wrapper cookbook's metadata, but something downstream has a different idea
[2014-01-27 21:36:23 -0500] fak3r: coderanger: so I looked at my qa env, since the error called it, but I don't have any versions listed in there
[2014-01-27 21:36:28 -0500] fak3r:   "cookbook_versions": { },
[2014-01-27 21:37:15 -0500] coderanger: fak3r: Not sure what you mean
[2014-01-27 21:37:44 -0500] coderanger: fak3r: Like I said, the error is most likely in your cookbook metadata somewhere, unfortunately there isn't a great way to debug it
[2014-01-27 21:38:00 -0500] fak3r: ok, thanks
[2014-01-27 21:38:19 -0500] coderanger: You can just hit that endpoint with different sets of cookbooks until you find the one making it fail
[2014-01-27 21:38:24 -0500] coderanger: and then break the bad cyckle
[2014-01-27 21:39:45 -0500] jej: what i did to try to narrow it down in the past was keep track of what 'berks upload' uploads, and see if any of the cookbooks that don't have specifically defined constraints are new versions being uploaded, then trace it back down the dependency chain
[2014-01-27 21:39:49 -0500] jej: it sucks to debug

[2014-01-27 21:46:12 -0500] coderanger: borntyping: I might make PyPy packages, but its much harder to yell at people to use that :-/
[2014-01-27 21:46:50 -0500] borntyping: coderanger: (I'm actually glad for that, I prefer to use system packages where I can)
[2014-01-27 21:48:39 -0500] borntyping: I imagine getting any existing project to use pypy is pretty hard, much as I like it I'm unlikley to look at using it unless I'm worried about performance

[2014-01-27 22:43:25 -0500] zenloop: Hey guys, anyone know if ["chef_server"]["erchef"]["s3_url_ttl"] applies to a chef-solo run?  I want chef-solo to run for as long as it needs to (which could be up to 12 hours).
[2014-01-27 22:43:45 -0500] kbarry: On the subject of health-checking and event log entris: I see that chef will display errors to the console. What are people doing to handle this?
[2014-01-27 22:43:52 -0500] kbarry: record it, etc?
[2014-01-27 22:44:22 -0500] kbarry: I'm not really excited by the idea of rchecking/watching the chef ourput from several hundred hosts.
[2014-01-27 22:44:51 -0500] btm: zenloop: it wouldn't, that's just used for the chef server. http://docs.opscode.com/config_rb_chef_server_optional_settings.html
[2014-01-27 22:45:45 -0500] zenloop: awesome.  so chef-solo should run indefinitely?
[2014-01-27 22:45:53 -0500] zenloop: Are there any other timeout gotchas?
[2014-01-27 22:46:00 -0500] zenloop: Thanks for the response.
[2014-01-27 22:47:55 -0500] btm: zenloop: various providers may have their own timeouts, e.g. the execute resource: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_execute.html#attributes
[2014-01-27 22:49:31 -0500] btm: zenloop: we've tried pretty hard to have the timeouts only come up when something goes wrong, like a program asking for input when nobody is there, and not limit a big slow run. I recommend moving forward presuming that timeouts won't be an issue, and then if you run into one looking at it specifically.
[2014-01-27 22:52:48 -0500] zenloop: btm: Thanks!
[2014-01-27 22:54:14 -0500] kallistec: kbarry: if you use enterprise chef, you get detailed reports of what chef runs have modifed and if they failed, etc.
[2014-01-27 22:55:01 -0500] martinisoft: any good solutions for handling multiple knife configs on a workstation?
[2014-01-27 22:55:09 -0500] martinisoft: think that is what just bit me
[2014-01-27 22:55:47 -0500] zenloop: martinisoft: I setup a make config for switching configs based on environment.
[2014-01-27 22:55:50 -0500] kallistec: kbarry: otherwise you can use http://docs.opscode.com/handlers.html
[2014-01-27 22:56:32 -0500] kallistec: martinisoft: knife starts by looking upward from your CWD for a .chef/ dir, so you can have multiple configs in different dirs
[2014-01-27 22:56:34 -0500] martinisoft: kbarry: hosted chef has reporting on runs, there are also things like data dog's handler if you use that service
[2014-01-27 22:57:30 -0500] martinisoft: kallistec: yeah but that doesn't work too well in multiple cookbooks. I have two orgs to deal with so its just two configs really.
[2014-01-27 23:00:04 -0500] kallistec: martinisoft: FWIW, in Chef 11 knife uses CWD so it doesn't get confused by symlinks
[2014-01-27 23:00:36 -0500] kallistec: so if it's not terribly painful to set up you could have two dirs with shared stuff symlinked in
[2014-01-27 23:00:55 -0500] allaire: Anybody use the mongodb cookbook?
[2014-01-27 23:01:41 -0500] kallistec: martinisoft: where by CWD, I mean the environment variable which your shell should set so it can tell the difference when you cd into a dir that 's a symlink
[2014-01-27 23:03:22 -0500] martinisoft: kallistec: looks like chefvm is my ticket: https://github.com/trobrock/chefvm

[2014-01-27 23:04:12 -0500] gregf: can resource defaults in a lwrp reference other resources and node attributes?
[2014-01-27 23:06:15 -0500] martinisoft: trobrock: seems to be fairly straightforward, thanks for making this! <3
[2014-01-27 23:07:06 -0500] gregf: never mind i'm certainly going about this the wrong way
[2014-01-27 23:12:26 -0500] kbarry: Is there a switch to force cookbook_file create any and all parent directories?
[2014-01-27 23:13:45 -0500] gleam: pair it with directory w/recursive
[2014-01-27 23:15:53 -0500] kbarry: gleam I don't know if i follow what you mean,
[2014-01-27 23:16:05 -0500] kbarry: Alternatively, I could user remote_directory
[2014-01-27 23:16:33 -0500] gleam: or that
[2014-01-27 23:16:46 -0500] kbarry: gleam, what were you talking about?
[2014-01-27 23:16:49 -0500] gleam: directory "/parent/dir" recursive true
[2014-01-27 23:16:59 -0500] gleam: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_directory.html
[2014-01-27 23:17:04 -0500] gleam: and then cookbook_file after it
[2014-01-27 23:32:28 -0500] martinisoft: trobrock: works like a charm! thank you again
[2014-01-27 23:32:40 -0500] chefwin: I am getting this errror FATAL: NoMethodError: undefined method `windows?' for Chef::Platform:Class
[2014-01-27 23:32:54 -0500] chefwin: Not sure why this is happening this is an ubuntu machine
[2014-01-27 23:33:43 -0500] trobrock: martinisoft: good to hear
[2014-01-27 23:35:20 -0500] ypaq: hey
[2014-01-27 23:35:43 -0500] ypaq: is it possible to override an attribute in kitchen.yml?
[2014-01-27 23:36:20 -0500] martinisoft: ypaq: attributes there work like a node attribute
[2014-01-27 23:37:00 -0500] martinisoft: ypaq: oh wait you mean an existing one. I think you can do that via a kitchen.local.yml but unsure of the structure.
[2014-01-27 23:37:32 -0500] martinisoft: ypaq: might be just the same structure as you see it in the kitchen.yml
[2014-01-27 23:39:21 -0500] chefwin: this is the full error http://pastebin.com/8uEYQvyt
[2014-01-27 23:40:04 -0500] helfire: anyone see this? yum-dump.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
[2014-01-27 23:41:39 -0500] helfire: STDERR: /usr/bin/python: can't open file '/opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/chef-11.8.0/lib/chef/provider/package/yum-dump.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
[2014-01-27 23:41:43 -0500] helfire: It doesnt exist
[2014-01-27 23:45:59 -0500] chefwin: Not sure why its trying to load windows cookbook
[2014-01-27 23:50:17 -0500] ypaq: martinisoft: what do you think about using a role with override attributes and include that in the kitchen file?
[2014-01-27 23:51:15 -0500] chefwin: Can somebody help me out, for some reason windows cookbook is loading and causing an error http://pastebin.com/8uEYQvyt. Is there a way to ignore windows as we are not using windows
[2014-01-27 23:51:56 -0500] helfire: chefwin: comment out the depends in whatever community cookbook depends on it
[2014-01-27 23:52:18 -0500] doomviking: or just install the windows cookbook and forget about it
