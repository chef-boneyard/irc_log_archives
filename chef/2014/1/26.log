[2014-01-26 00:07:09 -0500] celhead: greetings all; simple question: Using node.set, I can set variables for later use.  Is there a variable, say, environment which is global, i.e., which all clients could read?
[2014-01-26 02:45:34 -0500] juliancdunn: celhead: you might want to look into data bags for that. http://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/01/23/attributes-or-data-bags-what-should-i-use/
[2014-01-26 03:35:35 -0500] thun_: When I use knife ec2 and create an instance the chef run fails on package rdiff-backup, if I ssh into exact same instance and run the client again without changing a thing its fine
[2014-01-26 03:35:41 -0500] thun_: Has anyone experienced this?
[2014-01-26 04:21:31 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: Hello, I'm attempting to bootstrap a server for the first time.  The node I'm bootstrapping can't authenticate to the server.  When knife shows me the relevant config, some of the settings are wrong, but I don't know how to change the config used by boostrap.  Any ideas?
[2014-01-26 04:24:07 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: Does anyone respond to any messages here?
[2014-01-26 04:59:53 -0500] juliancdunn: ohmygoshjosh: on a Saturday night, it's unlikely you'll get much response
[2014-01-26 05:00:17 -0500] juliancdunn: however... the bootstrap settings are generated using the knife.rb on your workstation as a base. what values are wrong?
[2014-01-26 05:00:24 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: ah, that makes sense.  thx for the update
[2014-01-26 05:00:57 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: well, it seems that the validation_key on my newly bootstrapped node is wrong
[2014-01-26 05:01:12 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: I looked in the gems that I think bootstrapper is executing
[2014-01-26 05:02:03 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: and they seem to read from <%= validation_key %>
[2014-01-26 05:02:11 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: but the node still can't authenticate to chef-server
[2014-01-26 05:02:19 -0500] juliancdunn: it copies the validation key from your workstation into 'validation.pem' on the remote
[2014-01-26 05:02:52 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: that's what's confusing, because running "knife client list" on the workstation works fine
[2014-01-26 05:03:01 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: but then bootstrapping with knife somehow the validation key is wrong
[2014-01-26 05:03:09 -0500] juliancdunn: that's using your user PEM, not the validation PEM
[2014-01-26 05:03:16 -0500] juliancdunn: (knife client list I mean)
[2014-01-26 05:03:27 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: oh, I see.
[2014-01-26 05:03:55 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: hmm, I'm going to log into the new node manually and compare it's validation.pem vs my /chef-repo/.chef/chef-validator.pem
[2014-01-26 05:04:05 -0500] juliancdunn: good plan
[2014-01-26 05:04:53 -0500] juliancdunn: you can always regenerate the validator PEM on the server, and download a fresh copy
[2014-01-26 05:07:07 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: huh, so the validator.pem files are the same
[2014-01-26 05:08:07 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: I think you're right, my validation.pem must not be valid for the server anymore
[2014-01-26 05:08:16 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: i'll try manually regenerating
[2014-01-26 05:09:07 -0500] juliancdunn: sometimes weird linebreak issues will cause invalid certs
[2014-01-26 05:09:16 -0500] juliancdunn: e.g. if you copy-and-pasted from a browser into a file
[2014-01-26 05:10:54 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: Success!
[2014-01-26 05:11:08 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: @juliancdunn Thanks for your help
[2014-01-26 05:11:44 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: funny, the error message told me the exactly wrong problem "your validation_key may be invalid" but I wrongly assumed that my local validation key was correct and the config was the problem
[2014-01-26 05:12:12 -0500] juliancdunn: ohmygoshjosh: no problem, have fun!
[2014-01-26 15:54:14 -0500] laurent\: i'm running chef-server 11.0.10 and I'm still affected by https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3975 / https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4261
[2014-01-26 15:56:44 -0500] laurent\: btm has changed the fix version from 11.0.10 to 11.2.0 back in november
[2014-01-26 17:43:52 -0500] jhayden: question: on chef server (v 10.26) the node page shows a run list section but appears to be showing the main (top level) role of the node. I have been trying to access the name of this role in a template using the following "path": "aws.<%= node.chef_environment %>.<%= node.run_list[0] %>.<%= node["ec2"]["placement_availability_zone"].chop %>" and instead of getting foo I get role[foo]. What am I doing wrong?
[2014-01-26 17:48:15 -0500] MrBIOS: grr, this documentation doesn't show how to add multiple users to a group, http://docs.opscode.com/resource_group.html
[2014-01-26 17:48:19 -0500] MrBIOS: does anyone know what the proper syntax is?
[2014-01-26 17:49:30 -0500] teukka: MrBIOS: should be an array of strings, like ["foo", "bar"]
[2014-01-26 17:51:15 -0500] MrBIOS: thanks!
[2014-01-26 17:51:50 -0500] Cope: MrBIOS: array - if in doubt check the source: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/provider/group/groupadd.rb#L67-L91
[2014-01-26 17:53:48 -0500] MrBIOS: hm, this while loop I have isn't working
[2014-01-26 17:53:56 -0500] MrBIOS: %w{ bob joe billy }.each do |prod_users|
[2014-01-26 17:53:56 -0500] MrBIOS:   users_manage prod_users do
[2014-01-26 17:53:57 -0500] MrBIOS:     action [ :remove, :create ]
[2014-01-26 17:53:58 -0500] MrBIOS:   end
[2014-01-26 17:53:59 -0500] MrBIOS: end
[2014-01-26 17:54:10 -0500] MrBIOS: what's the best practice for something like that?
[2014-01-26 17:56:31 -0500] Cope: could you define 'isn't working@
[2014-01-26 17:56:43 -0500] Cope: wow punctuation fail
[2014-01-26 17:59:56 -0500] teukka: MrBIOS: `users_manage` takes a group name as an argument. and it then searches users data_bag for users that are members of that group
[2014-01-26 18:00:10 -0500] teukka: see the users cookbook readme
[2014-01-26 18:37:36 -0500] MrBIOS: teukka: perfect, thanks
[2014-01-26 19:04:22 -0500] jhayden: in a template erb file, is it possible to extract a substring? ie: <%= node.run_list[0] %> returns "role[foo]", I'd like just the foo part!
[2014-01-26 19:05:43 -0500] Cope: jhayden: you can do anything ruby can do
[2014-01-26 19:07:28 -0500] jhayden: Cope: Apparently I can't !  ;-)
[2014-01-26 19:09:55 -0500] jhayden: I have tried <%= node.run_list[0].gsub(/\[(.*?)\]/) %> and <%= node.run_list[0] %>.(/\[(.*?)\]/) neither works
[2014-01-26 19:10:26 -0500] jhayden: <%= node.run_list[0] %>.gsub(/\[(.*?)\]/)
[2014-01-26 19:10:56 -0500] Cope: jhayden: slow down; is node.run)_list[0] really a String?  I suspect it is.  Can you verify?
[2014-01-26 19:14:52 -0500] teukka: jhayden: String#gsub wants two arguments
[2014-01-26 19:15:09 -0500] Cope: anyway, something like this should work: http://lpaste.net/99117
[2014-01-26 19:15:14 -0500] teukka: or a block. otherwise it returns an enumerator
[2014-01-26 19:17:58 -0500] jhayden: teukka: I just ran this "aws.<%= node.chef_environment %>.<%= node.run_list[0].to_s.gsub(/\[(.*?)\]/) %>.<%= node["ec2"]["placement_availability_zone"].chop %>""aws.cap.#<Enumerator:0x00000005d52758>.us-east-1" and the output was
[2014-01-26 19:18:30 -0500] jhayden: and the output was "aws.cap.#<Enumerator:0x00000005d52758>.us-east-1"
[2014-01-26 19:22:09 -0500] teukka: jhayden: that's what I said. If you don't pass it two arguments or a block, it returns an enumerator: http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/String.html#method-i-gsub
[2014-01-26 19:22:40 -0500] jhayden: <%= node.run_list[0].to_s.match(/\[(\w+)\]/)[1] %> worked
[2014-01-26 19:23:17 -0500] jhayden: so was it gsub that needed 2 args?
[2014-01-26 19:24:59 -0500] jhayden: teukka: and Cope: thanks for the help
