[2014-07-12 00:04:44 -0400] jkeiser: shlant: correct on that, yeah
[2014-07-12 00:05:08 -0400] jkeiser: shlant: attribute 'db', { 'name' => 'a', 'username' => 'b' } is what you are really doing
[2014-07-12 00:05:34 -0400] jkeiser: shlant: another thing you can do is attributes { 'db' => { 'name' => 'a', 'username' => 'b' }, 'otherattr' => 'othervalue', ... }
[2014-07-12 00:05:47 -0400] jkeiser: shlant: it's all a question of how much of the attributes hash you want to replace
[2014-07-12 00:06:18 -0400] shlant: jkeiser: awesome, thanks so much
[2014-07-12 00:06:23 -0400] jkeiser: shlant: np
[2014-07-12 00:06:33 -0400] shlant: I will put that in the docs too
[2014-07-12 00:33:33 -0400] mpechner: I've been reading docs for an hour. Can't find the right search terms.  So, how do I read a attribute  When I set it,  node.default[:attr1][:attryyy]='d'.  On the next run, how do I read that value?
[2014-07-12 00:38:12 -0400] coderanger: mpechner: node['attr1']['attryyy']
[2014-07-12 02:47:30 -0400] hypnosb: you guys do anything like, set passwords into an encrypted databag/vault as environment variables for code used in a versioning that is part of a cluster?
[2014-07-12 02:47:57 -0400] coderanger: hypnosb: secrets management is very hard
[2014-07-12 02:48:07 -0400] coderanger: hypnosb: encrypted data bags are a cursory solution at best
[2014-07-12 02:48:20 -0400] coderanger: but its usually better than nothing
[2014-07-12 02:48:28 -0400] hypnosb: kinda the best thing i can think of
[2014-07-12 02:48:40 -0400] coderanger: hypnosb: Are you using AWS?
[2014-07-12 02:48:43 -0400] hypnosb: yes
[2014-07-12 02:48:50 -0400] coderanger: Use citadel
[2014-07-12 02:48:58 -0400] coderanger: https://github.com/poise/citadel
[2014-07-12 02:49:16 -0400] hypnosb: holy shit
[2014-07-12 02:49:33 -0400] hypnosb: :x
[2014-07-12 02:49:42 -0400] coderanger: For other situations, chef-vault is usually better than encrypted data bags unless you are trying to do autoscaling other non-interactive infra changes
[2014-07-12 02:50:15 -0400] hypnosb: yeah... the goal is auto scaling
[2014-07-12 02:50:28 -0400] hypnosb: to spot instances
[2014-07-12 02:50:53 -0400] coderanger: hypnosb: Then you can't use chef-vault unfortunately
[2014-07-12 02:50:56 -0400] coderanger: but citadel is fine
[2014-07-12 02:52:16 -0400] coderanger: As I led with, secrets management is Hard, so prepare to grit your teeth a bit
[2014-07-12 02:52:19 -0400] coderanger: :-/
[2014-07-12 02:52:23 -0400] hypnosb: cool, thanks  coderanger
[2014-07-12 02:52:26 -0400] hypnosb: yeah I'm sure
[2014-07-12 02:52:55 -0400] gchristensen: and dont have secrets!
[2014-07-12 02:52:57 -0400] coderanger: hypnosb: other things to check out: red october and trousseau
[2014-07-12 02:53:41 -0400] coderanger: gchristensen: That is actually the way to mitigate things, move to asym identification mechanisms instead of shared secrets
[2014-07-12 02:54:17 -0400] coderanger: gchristensen: For example, both postgres and myself support client keys for authentication, and its much easier to manage a directory of public keys than it is to distribute a shared password
[2014-07-12 02:54:45 -0400] gchristensen: omg yes it is
[2014-07-12 02:54:51 -0400] gchristensen: coderanger: I was in fact, serious, about not having secrets
[2014-07-12 02:55:26 -0400] coderanger: gchristensen: still not trivial since you need a strong concept of identity and role management, but the key data itself doesn't need to be secret :)
[2014-07-12 02:55:28 -0400] hypnosb: today guy at work i asked him for the key, and he's like... i just go in and make a password :\
[2014-07-12 02:55:42 -0400] hypnosb: facepalm
[2014-07-12 02:56:33 -0400] coderanger: But plenty of things don't support asym modes anyway, so its not likely to be a complete solution regardless
[2014-07-12 02:59:34 -0400] hypnosb: shit idk wth happened to knife
[2014-07-12 03:02:26 -0400] coderanger: hypnosb: Hmm?
[2014-07-12 03:03:02 -0400] hypnosb: coderanger, http://dpaste.com/2AZZYFN  can't get chef-dl to eval
[2014-07-12 03:03:06 -0400] hypnosb: dk
[2014-07-12 03:03:54 -0400] hypnosb: hmm no shell-init
[2014-07-12 03:07:03 -0400] hypnosb:  /opt/chefdk/bin/chef shell-init  even says same thing
[2014-07-12 03:59:50 -0400] jblack: I'm trying to find the guy that does the co-cloudstack cookbook,  pdion I think is his name.  He hasn't worked on the cookbook in about a month, so I wanted to email him that I did a pull request
[2014-07-12 04:00:38 -0400] jblack: Anyone happen to know him?
[2014-07-12 04:06:06 -0400] coderanger: jblack: No, and that cookbook doesn't look like a thing
[2014-07-12 04:06:15 -0400] coderanger: 6 commits, all from one person
[2014-07-12 04:06:27 -0400] coderanger: three of which are typos in the readme
[2014-07-12 04:06:48 -0400] jblack: he does work at cloudops.com, though
[2014-07-12 04:06:58 -0400] jblack: oh, ok. then off to find a new cookbook!!
[2014-07-12 04:08:11 -0400] coderanger: jblack: https://github.com/cloudops/cookbook_cloudstack says they were trying to rebuild it as resources
[2014-07-12 04:10:43 -0400] jblack: I think I'll jsut hand deploy cloudstack
[2014-07-12 05:04:06 -0400] Damm: that's the spirit burn yourself with fab install
[2014-07-12 05:06:19 -0400] jblack: I'm not thrilled with that either, but there's a half dozen cookbooks that I'm more interested in working on than cloudstack.
[2014-07-12 05:07:47 -0400] jblack: There's other stuff I need to do rather frequently that I want to get into CM. I would have to put that all off to do something I do once or twice a year.
[2014-07-12 05:08:37 -0400] jblack: I can cook a pretty mean cheeseburger, but sometimes, I skip the effort and go to mcdonalds.
[2014-07-12 06:00:12 -0400] MrHeavy: Is there some really awful, hackish way to force a loaded cookbook not to error out on an unsupported platform?
[2014-07-12 06:00:32 -0400] coderanger: MrHeavy: Cookbooks don't actually know anything about platforms
[2014-07-12 06:00:42 -0400] coderanger: MrHeavy: The "supports" line in the metadata is purely for display purposes
[2014-07-12 06:01:04 -0400] MrHeavy: D'oh, it's actually in this cookbook and this wine is too strong for me to have read the error thoroughly
[2014-07-12 06:01:09 -0400] MrHeavy: Thanks for the sanity check
[2014-07-12 06:21:00 -0400] Damm: jblack, that's usually where i land with docker
[2014-07-12 06:21:07 -0400] Damm: those that haven't or don't integrate well with CM
[2014-07-12 10:55:30 -0400] jagorjat: Hi all! :)
[2014-07-12 10:57:29 -0400] jagorjat: Can someone tell where it's better to put monkey patches within cookbook which overrides some methods in external providers ? :) It always works if I put it to recipe, but that doesn't look nice :) Though monkey patch itself is not a good thing, but good temp. solution until merge in community cb
[2014-07-12 10:58:22 -0400] jagorjat: monkey patch itself looks like:
[2014-07-12 10:58:38 -0400] jagorjat: class Chef::Provider::WindowsPackage
[2014-07-12 10:58:38 -0400] jagorjat:     def remove_package(name, version)
[2014-07-12 11:00:45 -0400] jagorjat: is there way to tell Chef to load my library after LWRPs and other resources are proccessed ?
[2014-07-12 13:10:45 -0400] kamsamp: has anyone ecountered tree_top gem error when converging with kitchen
[2014-07-12 13:11:16 -0400] kamsamp: i get a  NoMethodError
[2014-07-12 13:11:17 -0400] kamsamp:        -------------
[2014-07-12 13:11:18 -0400] kamsamp:        chef_gem[treetop] (dynamically defined) had an error: NoMethodError: undefined method `full_name' for nil:NilClass
[2014-07-12 18:36:20 -0400] bougyman: i'm unclear on some docs.
[2014-07-12 18:36:49 -0400] bougyman: do envs which appear in env_run_lists of a role override run_list or append to it?
[2014-07-12 18:43:42 -0400] coderanger: bougyman: override
[2014-07-12 18:43:57 -0400] bougyman: thanks coderanger
[2014-07-12 18:44:22 -0400] bougyman: and if a run_list exists and the chef environment isn't a key in env_run_lists ?
[2014-07-12 18:44:30 -0400] bougyman: does it fall back to run_list, or get an empty one?
[2014-07-12 18:44:41 -0400] coderanger: bougyman: falls back
[2014-07-12 18:44:46 -0400] bougyman: perfect.
[2014-07-12 18:45:09 -0400] bougyman: it said if I didn't specify _default then _default would get an empty run_list
[2014-07-12 18:45:13 -0400] bougyman: but didn't specify about other envs.
[2014-07-12 18:46:50 -0400] coderanger: bougyman: Honestly it isn't a feature I recommend using much
[2014-07-12 18:46:59 -0400] bougyman: i know, I read the warnings.
[2014-07-12 18:47:29 -0400] bougyman: we have _one_ specific recipe in one role we want to do this for.
[2014-07-12 18:47:40 -0400] bougyman: and it's only temporary
[2014-07-12 18:57:46 -0400] coderanger: bougyman: Remember you can do stuff like this in the recipe itself
[2014-07-12 18:58:04 -0400] coderanger: bougyman: At the top you could put "return if node.chef_environment == 'whatever'"
[2014-07-12 18:58:11 -0400] jagorjat: Sry, repeating, maybe someone can answer :) Can someone tell where it's better to put monkey patches within cookbook which overrides some methods in external providers ? :) It always works if I put it to recipe, but that doesn't look nice :) Though monkey patch itself is not a good thing, but good temp. solution until merge in community cb
[2014-07-12 18:58:38 -0400] coderanger: jagorjat: libraries/
[2014-07-12 18:58:54 -0400] jagorjat: tried, but still it's not overriding
[2014-07-12 18:58:58 -0400] coderanger: jagorjat: depending on the specifics though, what kind of provider?
[2014-07-12 18:59:16 -0400] jagorjat: class Chef::Provider::WindowsPackage
[2014-07-12 18:59:17 -0400] jagorjat: <jagorjat>     def remove_package(name, version)
[2014-07-12 18:59:27 -0400] jagorjat: I want to override remove_package method
[2014-07-12 18:59:48 -0400] jagorjat: works if I put that into recipe
[2014-07-12 18:59:52 -0400] jagorjat: but doesn't if to library
[2014-07-12 19:00:09 -0400] coderanger: jagorjat: Is that coming from a cookbook? Because the core one is called chef::provider::package::windows
[2014-07-12 19:01:04 -0400] jagorjat: that's provider 'package' from windows cookbook ( community one )
[2014-07-12 19:01:16 -0400] coderanger: Ahh yeah, its specifcally an LWRP
[2014-07-12 19:01:25 -0400] jagorjat: yep
[2014-07-12 19:01:26 -0400] coderanger: those are loaded after lib files
[2014-07-12 19:01:36 -0400] coderanger: so recipe is the easiest place
[2014-07-12 19:01:40 -0400] jagorjat: so recipe is the only place ?
[2014-07-12 19:01:46 -0400] jagorjat: ok, thanks :)
[2014-07-12 19:07:35 -0400] jblack: hmmm, so supermarket doesn't show the github branch for the cookbook?
[2014-07-12 19:08:55 -0400] coderanger: jblack: branch?
[2014-07-12 19:09:23 -0400] jblack: https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/nfs
[2014-07-12 19:09:37 -0400] jblack: which I think is https://github.com/atomic-penguin/cookbook-nfs
[2014-07-12 19:09:58 -0400] coderanger: jblack: "View Source" in the sidebar
[2014-07-12 19:10:02 -0400] jblack: Oh, I"m silly. View source... yeah.
[2014-07-12 19:12:25 -0400] jblack: (from cloudstack install docs)  /export  *(rw,async,no_root_squash)
[2014-07-12 19:12:27 -0400] jblack: <shudder>
[2014-07-12 19:28:00 -0400] atomic-penguin: jblack, understand the supermarket is a published artifact, while github is the source tree
[2014-07-12 19:28:22 -0400] atomic-penguin: jblack, there is no relationship to branch vs. what is on the supermarket
[2014-07-12 19:48:48 -0400] jblack:   cmd <<-EOC
[2014-07-12 19:49:08 -0400] jblack: Right. I just happend to run into SM first on google, and said to myself  "I want that. Now where is it really".
[2014-07-12 20:04:30 -0400] brucelee: coderanger: you there?

[2014-07-12 20:27:43 -0400] Phelms_: Hey - What does the attribute allow_pending_reboots do ?
[2014-07-12 20:31:09 -0400] mattt: Phelms_: which cookbook?
[2014-07-12 20:31:34 -0400] Phelms_: I am not using any cookbooks yet
[2014-07-12 20:31:38 -0400] Phelms_: just setting everything up
[2014-07-12 20:32:26 -0400] mattt: Phelms_: you using windows ?
[2014-07-12 20:32:34 -0400] Phelms_: yes
[2014-07-12 20:32:36 -0400] cheeseplus: Phelms_: looking at the code of the reboothandler it looks like it checks if chef or windows reboots that are pending, and then reboots
[2014-07-12 20:33:10 -0400] Phelms_: Thanks - I will. I assume my inital cookbook I load when I bootstrap machines can just turn it to false?
[2014-07-12 20:34:31 -0400] cheeseplus: unless you know you'll be installing things that require a reboot
[2014-07-12 21:11:25 -0400] sam_: Question: I am trying to use the method/resource defined in my dependency cookbooks, in my application cookbook but for some reason, it doesn't detect that method/resource from dependency cookbook during compilation. it gives me "No resource or method named". Am I missing something on how to use methods defined in dependency cookbooks?
[2014-07-12 21:12:14 -0400] sam_: I have dependency defined in metadata.rb and trying to use that resource/method in my application cookbook
[2014-07-12 21:15:01 -0400] sam_: I am trying to use tar_extract method from tar cookbook https://github.com/gofullstack/tar-cookbook
[2014-07-12 21:20:52 -0400] cheeseplus: sam_: are you including the recipe?
[2014-07-12 21:21:43 -0400] sam_: I included the dependency in the metadata.rb and would like to use the LWRP/resource defined in my dependencuy
[2014-07-12 21:21:59 -0400] sam_: I found a post saying I would neeed to prefix the LWRP with cookbook name
[2014-07-12 21:22:07 -0400] sam_: is that right?
[2014-07-12 21:22:17 -0400] sam_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17330374/including-a-chef-lwrp-from-another-cookbook
[2014-07-12 21:22:18 -0400] cheeseplus: sam_: I mean including the recipe in the recipe you are executing
[2014-07-12 21:23:23 -0400] sam_: are you saying to include the LWRP recipe?
[2014-07-12 21:23:39 -0400] sam_: in my app recipe
[2014-07-12 21:24:19 -0400] cheeseplus: yep
[2014-07-12 21:25:58 -0400] sam_: No I didnt. I thought adding in metadata.rb and prefixing the LWRP in my app cookbook wiht dependency cookbook was enough?
[2014-07-12 21:29:59 -0400] cheeseplus: sam_: it depends on the scope of how you're calling it I believe
[2014-07-12 21:31:00 -0400] sam_: am trying it this way, <cookbookName>_<LWRPName>
[2014-07-12 21:31:18 -0400] cheeseplus: seem to remember an issue about using LWRPs inside a ruby block
[2014-07-12 21:33:17 -0400] cheeseplus: including the recipe in the run list or the recipe itself should get you access to the resource, not familiar with the method you're trying
[2014-07-12 21:34:03 -0400] sam_: let me try
[2014-07-12 21:35:44 -0400] sam_: that recipe doesnt exist in "recipes/" in dependency cookbook. it is a provider
[2014-07-12 21:36:03 -0400] sam_: can i include a provider using a include_recipe?
[2014-07-12 21:39:01 -0400] sam_: looks like thats not deasible
[2014-07-12 21:39:04 -0400] sam_: *feasible
[2014-07-12 21:39:54 -0400] sam_: i gotta go now. thank you fdor the help @cheeseplus
[2014-07-12 21:40:06 -0400] sam_: I will try some more later in the evening
[2014-07-12 21:42:01 -0400] cheeseplus: sam_: just including the (tar) recipe in the run list or via an include_recipe is how I'd do it but I'm going to double check and see for myself
[2014-07-12 21:43:44 -0400] cheeseplus: sam_: depends should just make sure the cookbook exists but I was not under the impression it causes it to get loaded
[2014-07-12 22:46:35 -0400] sam_: since LWRP code doesnt exist under "recipes" so I cant use include_recipe
[2014-07-12 22:56:21 -0400] Phelms_: Does anyone have any documentation on chef's api put commands ?
[2014-07-12 23:10:09 -0400] cheeseplus: sam_: it loads the whole cookbook
[2014-07-12 23:15:00 -0400] sam_: cheeseplus: thanks. I went past resource not found by prefixing it with cookbook name
[2014-07-12 23:15:10 -0400] sam_: now thrre looks to be an issue with the cookboo
[2014-07-12 23:15:11 -0400] sam_: l
[2014-07-12 23:15:15 -0400] sam_: *cookbook
