[2014-07-07 01:07:16 -0400] mjuszcza1: I have an attribute hash defined like so: http://pastebin.com/QggkRMQS -- I need to somehow pass a list into a template of only users that have "true" set.  What's the easiest way to break that down in ruby so that my template simply gets: user1, user3
[2014-07-07 01:29:39 -0400] lamont_oc: s1991: you might try this HOWTO instead:  https://gist.github.com/lamont-granquist/40d26b6fa8178212594f
[2014-07-07 01:53:13 -0400] vt102_: So, I'm trying to use AWS ec2 instances in chef recipes, specifically munin, which uses ohai info to build config files.  I'm getting ipaddress instead of ec2.public_ipv4, so I can't reach them.  Is that just a problem with the cookbook?  Should they be checking for ec2.public_ipv4 or cloud_v2.public_ipv4_addrs?  Or have I bootstrapped it incorrectly?
[2014-07-07 01:53:38 -0400] vt102_: It's getting the ec2 10.x.x.x and not the elastic IP, basically.
[2014-07-07 02:08:08 -0400] Damm: cwebber, sadly I have more questions than answers after reading that
[2014-07-07 02:08:55 -0400] Damm: vt102_, knife[:ssh_attribute] should be set to what you want
[2014-07-07 02:09:03 -0400] Damm: like network.ipaddress or ec2.public_ipv4
[2014-07-07 02:09:06 -0400] Damm: or cloud..
[2014-07-07 02:10:21 -0400] cwebber: Damm: what kinds of questions?
[2014-07-07 02:10:30 -0400] vt102_: Damm: it's in a community recipe...
[2014-07-07 02:13:53 -0400] vt102_: Basically, like configuring iptables rules.  But, since it's using the 10.x.x.x instead of the elastic ip, they're wrong.
[2014-07-07 02:19:06 -0400] cheeseplus: vt102_: you could do a PR on the cookbook or use a wrapper cookbook
[2014-07-07 02:19:41 -0400] cheeseplus: depending on how the attrs are being set
[2014-07-07 02:20:25 -0400] vt102_: cheeseplus: Right.  It just seemed weird that EC2 would be so different, I wanted to make sure I wasn't doing something fundamentally wrong.  Seems like somebody would be using munin outside ec2 to monitor something in ec2 and using the community cookbook...
[2014-07-07 02:20:59 -0400] cheeseplus: vt102_: basically I don't assume anything when it comes to community coookbooks
[2014-07-07 02:23:50 -0400] vt102_: LOL...just realized my server is NATing outbound...what a fucking headache
[2014-07-07 02:39:47 -0400] Damm: cwebber, obvious questions are does it deprecate the community site? what problems does it hope to solve vs the old one? how long will the old one be up
[2014-07-07 02:40:11 -0400] Damm: cwebber, as what it appears to be is a 2nd cookbook site; and I cannot discern if it will take over; if it wont' or anything except it's OSS
[2014-07-07 02:42:40 -0400] Damm: as someone who ships many cookbooks I don't know if I should or should not ship cookbooks there; if anyone will notice? work / payoff ratio
[2014-07-07 02:43:34 -0400] cheeseplus: Damm: yes it will eventually deprecate the community site
[2014-07-07 02:44:19 -0400] cheeseplus: Damm: also, the trello and roadmap are linked on that post
[2014-07-07 02:44:21 -0400] cheeseplus: https://github.com/opscode/supermarket/wiki/Roadmap
[2014-07-07 02:45:14 -0400] cheeseplus: Damm: for the time being, if you ship something to the existing community site it is replicated to supermarket but not the other way around
[2014-07-07 02:45:21 -0400] cheeseplus: Damm: delay is 3 hours IIRC
[2014-07-07 02:45:40 -0400] Damm: ahh see I was wondering that last part
[2014-07-07 02:45:47 -0400] Damm: I uploaded the cookbook to both sites as I didn't see it move
[2014-07-07 02:46:10 -0400] cheeseplus: yea, I wish the 3hr delay part was more blatantly advertised
[2014-07-07 02:46:24 -0400] Damm: + the deprecation
[2014-07-07 02:46:48 -0400] cheeseplus: so right now we don't expect a lot of people to be using supermarket (it'd heavily advertised as beta) but generally it will replace the old stuff
[2014-07-07 02:46:49 -0400] Damm: I originally saw it as 2 sites with 2 different cookbooks of the same thing
[2014-07-07 02:47:12 -0400] Damm: yeah that's not really right and will only confuse people
[2014-07-07 02:47:14 -0400] Damm: but that's my take
[2014-07-07 02:47:26 -0400] Damm: if I can be seriously confused easily; I know my customers will be
[2014-07-07 02:47:35 -0400] Damm: as well as other end users
[2014-07-07 02:48:01 -0400] cheeseplus: Damm: indeed - for the most part the blog post and related material answers most of the questions but a simple FAQ might be in order
[2014-07-07 02:48:08 -0400] chefgirl: can any one give me pointer to a recipe to install wordpress on a server using Chef ???
[2014-07-07 02:48:38 -0400] Damm: cheeseplus, I would strongly disagree with that statement
[2014-07-07 02:49:04 -0400] cheeseplus: Damm: did those links not include the answers?
[2014-07-07 02:49:12 -0400] Damm: I know how a customer took that blog post; they said it lacked too much context to understand it
[2014-07-07 02:49:17 -0400] Damm: so they just asked me what the .. it meant
[2014-07-07 02:49:28 -0400] cheeseplus: understandable - we welcome feedback
[2014-07-07 02:49:30 -0400] Damm: but I can't help that
[2014-07-07 02:50:07 -0400] Damm: Maybe release a survey and ask people what they thought the blog post was; collate and figure it out
[2014-07-07 02:50:42 -0400] cheeseplus: Damm: for the most part, people tracking supermarket heard about it at chefconf (at least that is my impression)
[2014-07-07 02:51:03 -0400] cheeseplus: also the chefconf video is helpful in this context (and may be helpful for customers) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUXaG4LLhcA
[2014-07-07 02:51:49 -0400] cheeseplus: and we've got a bit banner of (what you need to know) on the supermarket site itself
[2014-07-07 02:57:16 -0400] chefgirl: how can I use git ??
[2014-07-07 02:57:27 -0400] chefgirl:  i have made my account over here installed git bash
[2014-07-07 02:57:42 -0400] chefgirl: now how should i proceed further
[2014-07-07 03:00:43 -0400] cheeseplus: chefgirl: I highly recommend checking out this for learning to use git: http://git-scm.com/book
[2014-07-07 03:02:59 -0400] chefgirl: +cheeseplus: I want to apply the knowledge practically
[2014-07-07 03:03:16 -0400] chefgirl: I have signed up for git
[2014-07-07 03:03:27 -0400] cheeseplus: github?
[2014-07-07 03:03:37 -0400] chefgirl: yeah github account
[2014-07-07 03:03:55 -0400] chefgirl: git bash insalletd on system
[2014-07-07 03:03:59 -0400] cheeseplus: https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
[2014-07-07 03:04:13 -0400] chefgirl: i have gone al through this
[2014-07-07 03:04:23 -0400] chefgirl: i want to do some hands on
[2014-07-07 03:04:39 -0400] cheeseplus: well then you need to find some code to write ;)
[2014-07-07 03:05:15 -0400] chefgirl: okay, can u tell me how can i change the user in git bash
[2014-07-07 03:05:48 -0400] chefgirl: i havd two users and i want to login thruh other
[2014-07-07 03:05:52 -0400] j^2: chefgirl: http://gettingstartedwithchef.com/first-steps-with-chef.html
[2014-07-07 03:06:00 -0400] j^2: that seems like what you are looking for
[2014-07-07 03:06:10 -0400] j^2: builds a wordpress blog with chef
[2014-07-07 03:09:49 -0400] chefgirl: how can i access the git using git bash
[2014-07-07 03:09:56 -0400] chefgirl: like issue the commands
[2014-07-07 03:10:05 -0400] j^2: did you read the blog?
[2014-07-07 03:10:05 -0400] chefgirl: how an i set credentials
[2014-07-07 03:10:15 -0400] j^2: i think it does exactly what you are asking for
[2014-07-07 03:10:21 -0400] cheeseplus: chefgirl: I'm not sure what you're asking? it sounds like you need help setting up your gitconfig
[2014-07-07 03:10:58 -0400] chefgirl: I am using git bash to create repo and all that stuff
[2014-07-07 03:11:11 -0400] cheeseplus: ok
[2014-07-07 03:11:16 -0400] chefgirl: how to set the credentials the RSA private key
[2014-07-07 03:11:22 -0400] cheeseplus: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
[2014-07-07 03:11:46 -0400] cheeseplus: chefgirl: that page tells you how to setup git to use with github
[2014-07-07 03:12:18 -0400] chefgirl: can u tell me how can i log out from my git bash  and login again using other usetr
[2014-07-07 03:12:56 -0400] cheeseplus: I assume by git bash you mean the git command line client (you can just call it git)
[2014-07-07 03:13:26 -0400] cheeseplus: changing users in git involves editing your gitconfig as mentioned in the article I just linked
[2014-07-07 03:14:25 -0400] cheeseplus: chefgirl: you don't really log in a log out of git as such
[2014-07-07 03:14:47 -0400] chefgirl: i mean how can i switch my account in git bash
[2014-07-07 03:14:56 -0400] cheeseplus: the server (in this case github) is only involved when you push or pull from a repo and in that case it checks your gitconfig
[2014-07-07 03:15:00 -0400] chefgirl: i have two accounts
[2014-07-07 03:16:12 -0400] j^2: accounts where?

[2014-07-07 05:00:37 -0400] sadbox: If I'm editing a role
[2014-07-07 05:00:55 -0400] sadbox: Can I use a search for overriding one of the default attributes?
[2014-07-07 05:01:04 -0400] sadbox: Not sure how it would work since it's a json file
[2014-07-07 05:30:08 -0400] Damm: cheeseplus, I don't go to conferences I have to pay attention to
[2014-07-07 05:30:19 -0400] Damm: and I haven't really gotten enough out of the summits in the previous years to go last year
[2014-07-07 05:30:43 -0400] Damm: I failed so hard at it
[2014-07-07 06:00:24 -0400] chandrasekhar: can anyone tel me how can i make my windows machine as a workstation ?
[2014-07-07 06:00:41 -0400] chandrasekhar: i didnt find any useful sites for windows
[2014-07-07 06:01:00 -0400] digitalchild: install virtual box, run linux in a vm and start that up as the WS ? :)
[2014-07-07 06:03:49 -0400] chandrasekhar: digitalchild: is there any alternative way rather than installing virtula box
[2014-07-07 06:03:50 -0400] chandrasekhar: ?
[2014-07-07 06:04:02 -0400] chandrasekhar: i have already set up chef server on linux
[2014-07-07 06:04:31 -0400] chandrasekhar: only want to make my local windows machine as a work station
[2014-07-07 06:16:41 -0400] chefgirl: can anybody answer my question if I dont defin the alias name of server then I dont require to write the rewrite conditions in apache ??
[2014-07-07 06:24:38 -0400] chefgirl: cana nybody give me a pointer to install wordpress site
[2014-07-07 06:27:41 -0400] chefgirl: Word press recipe
[2014-07-07 06:31:07 -0400] chefgirl: can anybody point to a nice tutorial of creating a wrapper cookbook .
[2014-07-07 06:36:03 -0400] lamont_oc: chefgirl: http://www.getchef.com/blog/2013/12/03/doing-wrapper-cookbooks-right/
[2014-07-07 06:36:33 -0400] chefgirl: lamony_oc : thanks a bunch
[2014-07-07 06:36:35 -0400] chefgirl: :)
[2014-07-07 06:44:07 -0400] chefgirl: hey can any body tell me about wrapper cookbooks, I read that article but not getting anything :(
[2014-07-07 06:46:15 -0400] lamont_oc: i kinda gotta pass out soon
[2014-07-07 06:47:15 -0400] lamont_oc: basic idea is you want to take a cookbook from the community site, but apply your local policy and defaults to it
[2014-07-07 06:47:41 -0400] chefgirl: okay
[2014-07-07 06:47:52 -0400] chefgirl: i have just started exploring chef
[2014-07-07 06:47:56 -0400] lamont_oc: so if you work at acme, inc then you create acme_nginx
[2014-07-07 06:48:12 -0400] chefgirl: I have just installed chef server , workstation
[2014-07-07 06:48:19 -0400] chefgirl: and knife ec2
[2014-07-07 06:48:27 -0400] chefgirl: bootstarpped it
[2014-07-07 06:48:37 -0400] lamont_oc: acme_nginx would depend on the nginx cookbook (metadata.rb would say 'depends "nginx"') and the recipe/default.rb would 'include_recipe "nginx"'
[2014-07-07 06:48:38 -0400] chefgirl: created a cookbook to install apache
[2014-07-07 06:49:01 -0400] chefgirl: how to proceed further
[2014-07-07 06:49:10 -0400] lamont_oc: yeah
[2014-07-07 06:49:12 -0400] chefgirl: have learned a bit of git
[2014-07-07 06:49:16 -0400] Kim^J: chefgirl: Slow down, try to take baby steps instead of trying to go full blown right from the start.
[2014-07-07 06:49:51 -0400] chefgirl: Kim^: how should i proceed now
[2014-07-07 06:49:59 -0400] chefgirl: I dont have any idea
[2014-07-07 06:50:06 -0400] lamont_oc: well you're doing pretty good so far
[2014-07-07 06:50:17 -0400] lamont_oc: if you got that fa
[2014-07-07 06:50:18 -0400] lamont_oc: far
[2014-07-07 06:50:24 -0400] chefgirl: thanks lamont_oc
[2014-07-07 06:50:28 -0400] Kim^J: chefgirl: http://www.mechanicalrobotfish.com/blog/2013/01/01/configure-a-server-with-chef-solo-in-five-minutes/
[2014-07-07 06:50:33 -0400] Kim^J: I read that to get started.
[2014-07-07 06:50:49 -0400] Kim^J: Then just try to install services, small -> bigger.
[2014-07-07 06:50:52 -0400] lamont_oc: i just got inspired to write this up tonight:  https://gist.github.com/lamont-granquist/40d26b6fa8178212594f
[2014-07-07 06:50:59 -0400] Kim^J: Like, try to get nginx/apache to be installed.
[2014-07-07 06:51:05 -0400] Kim^J: Then try to get it configured, etc.
[2014-07-07 06:51:34 -0400] lamont_oc: ^^^ that should get you started with test-kitchen/vagrant and doing cookbook development on your workstation
[2014-07-07 06:52:01 -0400] chefgirl: what is this knife solo, test-kitchen /vargrant ??
[2014-07-07 06:54:19 -0400] Kim^J: chefgirl: As said, don't try to eat the whole cake, take small bites.
[2014-07-07 06:54:43 -0400] chefgirl: Kim ^: okay i have a doubt
[2014-07-07 06:54:45 -0400] Kim^J: Forget vagrant, test-kitchen and all that for a moment. Try to learn chef and chef only.
[2014-07-07 06:55:18 -0400] Kim^J: chef-solo is chef client+server, used to configure one server from cookbooks.
[2014-07-07 06:55:31 -0400] Kim^J: Read the tutorial I linked, it'll get you up and running in no time.
[2014-07-07 06:55:31 -0400] chefgirl: If i am using the wrapper cookbooks do i need to upload dependet cookbooks in my chef repo ?
[2014-07-07 06:55:36 -0400] Kim^J: Then, jump onto other stuff.
[2014-07-07 06:55:57 -0400] Kim^J: No, you can make a reference thingie in Git to other repos.
[2014-07-07 06:56:07 -0400] chefgirl: okay
[2014-07-07 06:56:55 -0400] Kim^J: chefgirl: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule
[2014-07-07 06:56:59 -0400] Kim^J: That is what you want.
[2014-07-07 07:48:10 -0400] chandrasekhar: can anyone give idea how can i make my local windows machine as workstation ?
[2014-07-07 08:06:00 -0400] chandrasekhar: can anyone give idea how can i make my local windows machine as workstation ?
[2014-07-07 08:06:53 -0400] ambientsound: chandrasekhar: I believe that's more trouble than it's worth, and that it just might not be possible
[2014-07-07 08:06:58 -0400] ambientsound: but you could try using Cygwin
[2014-07-07 08:11:43 -0400] lamont_oc: chefdk for windows is coming
[2014-07-07 08:12:00 -0400] lamont_oc: until then i would avoid trying to do that
[2014-07-07 08:13:55 -0400] lamont_oc: (coming very soon)
[2014-07-07 08:33:18 -0400] yruss972: Hi. Is there anyway to get chef to prompt the console for data during a chef run?
[2014-07-07 08:40:09 -0400] Kim^J: Wouldn't that kinda defeat the purpose of chef?
[2014-07-07 08:40:57 -0400] mhulan: yruss972: I'd suggest looking at chef installer, it asks for some input and then it uses chef for installation I think
[2014-07-07 08:49:12 -0400] chefgirl: Do we need to upload the cookbooks in berks to chef server ?
[2014-07-07 08:51:15 -0400] chefgirl: How to handle dependencies using berkshelf
[2014-07-07 08:51:16 -0400] chefgirl: ?
[2014-07-07 08:51:28 -0400] chefgirl: I have installed berks on my worksation
[2014-07-07 08:51:44 -0400] chefgirl: im trying to upload this cook book

[2014-07-07 08:53:30 -0400] mhulan: chefgirl: I think berks install will install all dependencies for you
[2014-07-07 09:00:12 -0400] chefgirl: mhulan : I have used this command to instal the dependent cookbooks the dependent cookbooks are in .berkshelf/cookbook/

[2014-07-07 11:54:17 -0400] i42n: matti: the nginx cookbook works fine if I use it directly. But since I build the wrapper it does not work any more
[2014-07-07 11:54:33 -0400] i42n: matti: I used nginx::source and nginx::passenger before

[2014-07-07 11:54:49 -0400] i42n: now I included both in my wrapper recipe
[2014-07-07 11:55:03 -0400] rsavage: matti: The problem is, the RPM install says run upgrade, but the document does not say to.
[2014-07-07 11:55:24 -0400] whiteadam: I say treat this as an AND and not an OR
[2014-07-07 11:56:19 -0400] matti: rsavage: I'd make sure that I have backup done with knife backup.
[2014-07-07 11:56:30 -0400] matti: rsavage: Then deny RPM to do things, and then issue commands myself.
[2014-07-07 11:57:24 -0400] matti: You could probably tarball entier /etc/chef-server.
[2014-07-07 11:57:41 -0400] matti: Then reconfigure and restart.
[2014-07-07 11:57:46 -0400] matti: And it in theory should work.
[2014-07-07 12:00:11 -0400] rsavage: matti: It is working for me, perhaps I am not explaining myself correctly.  What I am asking is, on one of my chef servers, I followed the RPM install, the chef-server-ctl reconfigure, the chef-server-clt restart, and it worked like a champ.  But on another test server, I did the RPM install, chef-server-clt upgrade (got and error), and then a reconfigure, and then restart...  so my question is "upgrade" actually necessary when going fro
[2014-07-07 12:10:28 -0400] rsavage: For those who care, this is the answer I was looking for: https://github.com/opscode/chef/issues/1595
[2014-07-07 12:10:40 -0400] rsavage: If you are going from 11.1.0 to 11.1.3, you must do this

[2014-07-07 12:39:11 -0400] i42n: whiteadam: this is my wrapper. First time using wrappers. ttps://github.com/i42n/wrapper-nginx-passenger I want to use the nginx cookbook. Compile from source and compile passenger module into nginx. However the recipe does not compile the passenger module into nginx. When I try to launch nginx it does not know about passenger.
[2014-07-07 12:39:17 -0400] chandrasekhar: i need to run it on chef server ?
[2014-07-07 12:39:20 -0400] whiteadam: no

[2014-07-07 12:39:42 -0400] chandrasekhar: ok.
[2014-07-07 12:39:59 -0400] i42n: whiteadam: no error. the recipe runs without error.
[2014-07-07 12:40:34 -0400] i42n: whiteadam: I actually installs nginx, but passenger does not work.
[2014-07-07 12:40:42 -0400] chandrasekhar: ok. let me check
[2014-07-07 12:41:04 -0400] i42n: whiteadam: So I assume my wrapper does do the right settings
[2014-07-07 12:41:17 -0400] i42n: *not do the right settings
[2014-07-07 12:42:14 -0400] i42n: to add the passenger module to nginx compile, you have to list the modules as an array https://github.com/miketheman/nginx#source
[2014-07-07 12:42:27 -0400] i42n: I did that in the attributes default file in my wrapper recipe
[2014-07-07 12:43:56 -0400] i42n: for me everything looks quite correct
[2014-07-07 12:44:06 -0400] i42n: mybe I oversee something.
[2014-07-07 12:46:15 -0400] whiteadam: i42n: Does it actually have to compile with passenger support?
[2014-07-07 12:46:54 -0400] i42n: whiteadam: I need passenger support. I have not found any other way than compiling. If you have an idea, I'd appreciate it.
[2014-07-07 12:47:15 -0400] i42n: whiteadam: As far is I am informed, ubuntu does not provide nginx + passenger prebuild package
[2014-07-07 12:48:25 -0400] i42n: whiteadam: I could try to use this: https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#install_on_debian_ubuntu
[2014-07-07 12:48:28 -0400] whiteadam: i42n: I haven't used it myself, I was just looking at this part https://github.com/miketheman/nginx/blob/master/recipes/passenger.rb#L33-L37
[2014-07-07 12:49:47 -0400] i42n: whiteadam: but this is the passenger gem. This is not the passenger module for nginx?
[2014-07-07 12:50:12 -0400] whiteadam: i42n: yeah, I probably don't know what I'm talking about
[2014-07-07 12:50:24 -0400] whiteadam: :)
[2014-07-07 12:51:13 -0400] i42n: that's also my problem ;)
[2014-07-07 12:51:22 -0400] i42n: that's why I am asking here
[2014-07-07 12:51:42 -0400] i42n: thing is: I used nginx::source and nginx::passenger recipes directly before
[2014-07-07 12:51:47 -0400] i42n: worked perfectly
[2014-07-07 12:51:57 -0400] i42n: it compiled it with passenger support
[2014-07-07 12:52:18 -0400] i42n: however since I use the wrapper it does not work, so I thought the wrapper is the problem
[2014-07-07 12:52:58 -0400] whiteadam: Oh interesting.
[2014-07-07 12:53:25 -0400] i42n: but I need the wrapper to create the nginx site config without forking the whole nginx cookbook
[2014-07-07 12:57:55 -0400] i42n: whiteadam: does this actually set the attributes correctly for the nginx::source recipe? https://github.com/i42n/wrapper-nginx-passenger/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L2
[2014-07-07 12:58:17 -0400] i42n: whiteadam: or do I have to configure this in my vagrant file?

[2014-07-07 14:59:15 -0400] juliancdunn: guest15482: MSUs can be installed just like MSIs
[2014-07-07 14:59:44 -0400] juliancdunn: so use 'package' or 'windows_package' (latter if you're on an older version of Chef)
[2014-07-07 15:04:19 -0400] guest15482: juliancdunn: Does the package resource just recognize the msu or does it need to be told what installer type? What would be the 'name' so the package doesn't get reinstalled each run?
[2014-07-07 15:53:03 -0400] aub: im trying to run chef solo on ec2 what can I use for the recipe_url such that the cookbooks can be stored in a private location?
[2014-07-07 15:54:19 -0400] savant: good job everyone on ditching jira for cooks and going to github! :)
[2014-07-07 15:55:50 -0400] vt102: savant: What is cooks?
[2014-07-07 15:56:04 -0400] savant: the COOK issue tracking done in jira
[2014-07-07 15:56:25 -0400] savant: to fix a bug, you have to file an issue in jira, and then open a PR in github
[2014-07-07 15:56:31 -0400] vt102: ah
[2014-07-07 15:56:33 -0400] savant: and then go back to jira and paste a link to the bug
[2014-07-07 15:56:57 -0400] gchristensen: and then light a candle and burn some sage hoping you did it right

[2014-07-07 16:19:33 -0400] mmzyk: aub chef solo is aging a bit at this point. You might look into chef-client local mode (-z). But any url should work for the recipe_url, so long as chef solo can connect to it.

[2014-07-07 16:33:56 -0400] jcarapet: Dumb question, but what are utensils in regards to working with Chef? Just Plugins? Saw something related in regards to supermarket so just curious
[2014-07-07 16:46:03 -0400] cheeseplus: jcarapet: there are a bunch - chef[-client,-solo], knife, test-kitchen, and berkshelf would be my essentials list
[2014-07-07 16:46:42 -0400] cheeseplus: jcarapet: supermarket is just a new name/look for our community cookbook site
[2014-07-07 16:48:52 -0400] jcarapet: Cheeseplus: okay, thanks for the clarification. I use all of those, but just never heard them called that before.
[2014-07-07 16:52:00 -0400] cheeseplus: not sure that utensils has any "official" meaning though wrt to the tools, probably someone just being cheeky
[2014-07-07 16:56:25 -0400] jmreicha: Hey guys.  I'm having an issue getting certificates read by one of my recipes in test kitchen, not really sure what to look at
[2014-07-07 17:01:51 -0400] aub: mmzyk: thanks. seems like i can pull it from an s3 bucket if i make it public, but Id really like to lock down the permissions on it.
[2014-07-07 17:02:16 -0400] aub: i guess i could also just use chef-server
[2014-07-07 17:02:36 -0400] micgo: jmreicha: what do you mean by "getting certificates read"? Are you getting SSL errors from your chef-client run or reading a certificate file from disk?
[2014-07-07 17:02:50 -0400] mmzyk: aub I believe it might work with https, but youll have to play with permissions to see how much you can lock it down.
[2014-07-07 17:02:59 -0400] jmreicha: micgo: I am getting the errors on my chef-client run
[2014-07-07 17:04:13 -0400] micgo: jmreicha: have you enabled SSL verification on your client? A link to a gist with the output of the error might be helpful
[2014-07-07 17:04:28 -0400] jmreicha: micgo: ok, just a sec
[2014-07-07 17:04:37 -0400] goncalop: hi there, I'm trying to understand how File and RemoteFile use the backup attribute? Don't see any files or dotfiles in the same folder ?
[2014-07-07 17:04:53 -0400] aub: im using chef_gem to install the mysql gem. obviously, ruby and some libmysql-dev must be installed for this to work. but chef always runs the chef_gem line first, regardless of where i put it in the run list. is there a way to make it run correctly?
[2014-07-07 17:05:54 -0400] workmad3: aub: chef_gem installs the gem at compile-time, not at converge time
[2014-07-07 17:06:08 -0400] workmad3: aub: so any dependencies also need to be installed at compile-time
[2014-07-07 17:06:41 -0400] workmad3: aub: however, with chef_gem, the ruby dependency is already satisfied (chef_gem installs into the gem repo for the embedded ruby running chef)
[2014-07-07 17:06:51 -0400] micgo: goncalop: backups are made to whatever is set for Chef::Config[:file_backup_path] .... that defaults to /var/chef/backup most of the time
[2014-07-07 17:07:16 -0400] aub: workmad3: how do i tell it to install the libmysql-dev package at compile time?
[2014-07-07 17:07:52 -0400] micgo: depending on your platform... it will create a directory structure that matches where the file existed... ie. if you are backing up a file a /tmp/foo.sh it will create a file called /var/chef/backup/tmp/foo.sh-20143456345
[2014-07-07 17:08:11 -0400] micgo: with a timestamp appended to show when it was backed up
[2014-07-07 17:08:21 -0400] goncalop: micgo: oh right, I'm running test kitchen just saw it on /tmp/kitchen - I was expecting it to be on the same folder with a sort of rolling versioning
[2014-07-07 17:08:35 -0400] goncalop: thank you!
[2014-07-07 17:08:44 -0400] workmad3: aub: easiest way... 'p = package('libmysql-dev'){action :nothing}; p.run_action(:install)'
[2014-07-07 17:09:11 -0400] aub: workmad3: ah, ive seen that around and wondered what it was. thanks

[2014-07-07 17:18:51 -0400] sigusr1: a question about chef-metal, please?
[2014-07-07 17:19:19 -0400] sigusr1: how can I pass a bootstrap-proxy argument, similar to knife bootstrap?
[2014-07-07 17:22:43 -0400] micgo: jmreicha: yep... looks like a formatting error. "3073128072:error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line:pem_lib.c:703:Expecting: ANY PRIVATE KEY"
[2014-07-07 17:23:13 -0400] micgo: make sure you are adding '\n' for the new lines so it can be reformatted properly
[2014-07-07 17:23:25 -0400] jmreicha: micgo: ugh, totally missed that
[2014-07-07 17:23:30 -0400] jmreicha: I will be back.  Thank you

[2014-07-07 17:29:53 -0400] sigusr1: no, it's a normal http proxy used during the bootstrap process to download the chef-client
[2014-07-07 17:30:32 -0400] jkeiser: ah!  I don't think there's any arguments yet.  Seems like a good thing to add.  Soon we need to make a full accounting of knife bootstrap options to make sure we have more functionality
[2014-07-07 17:30:33 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: useful when one does not have upfront internet access from the machines created
[2014-07-07 17:32:46 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: I see  waiting patiently then

[2014-07-07 17:33:40 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: mind filing a github issue on it?  And if you're in there, maybe another brief issue just saying "achieve parity with knife bootstrap" that I can use to track these?
[2014-07-07 17:33:45 -0400] aanand_: What I have: ============ 1.  host_list.txt file that has list of all the hosts with role for each node. The format for the file is:     HostName   IPADDRESS   ROLE 2.  A shell script that reads host_list.txt and process (explained below) the hosts 3.  A library method (defined under libraries/utility.rb) that searches for nodes at 3 different levels     - Run List level     - Role Level     - Recipe level
[2014-07-07 17:33:56 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: yep, will do

[2014-07-07 17:34:10 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: if you want to make the patch yourself, I'll gladly point you in the right direction.  I don't think it'll be hard at all
[2014-07-07 17:34:32 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: I can try 
[2014-07-07 17:35:02 -0400] jkeiser: I say this in part because I'm not planning to do it for a bit (like not in the next couple of weeks)
[2014-07-07 17:35:20 -0400] jkeiser: And because you have a proxy server and I don't, so you are ideal for testing it :)

[2014-07-07 17:36:42 -0400] aanand_: the search method is returning different results for the same search
[2014-07-07 17:37:44 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: you can see what knife bootstrap is doing with the proxy here (looks like it sets an environment variable): https://github.com/opscode/chef/search?q=bootstrap_proxy&ref=cmdform
[2014-07-07 17:38:49 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: ya  so as long as chef-metal's bootstrap process honors that variable  it should work

[2014-07-07 17:39:29 -0400] s1991: Hello, is it good method to add a script as "config.vm.provision :shell, :path => 'vagrant_resources/vagrant_bootstrap.sh'" and install pip packages from that script?
[2014-07-07 17:40:34 -0400] miketheman: s1991: I think you're looking for vagrant help, not so much about Chef - I'd use Chef to install pytohn_pip pacakges
[2014-07-07 17:41:38 -0400] s1991: miketheman: yes, but how do I install packages listed in requirements.txt via chef?
[2014-07-07 17:42:09 -0400] s1991: requirements.txt contain python packages to be install via pip
[2014-07-07 17:43:35 -0400] miketheman: s1991: ah, that's harder. There's been much discussion on the topic over here: https://github.com/poise/python/pull/27 https://github.com/poise/python/pull/20 with no clear resolution
[2014-07-07 17:43:48 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: I assume this is using chef-metal-fog, btw?
[2014-07-07 17:43:56 -0400] sigusr1: yes
[2014-07-07 17:44:19 -0400] miketheman: s1991: you might derive some insight from here: https://github.com/poise/application_python/blob/master/examples/recipes-packaginator.rb
[2014-07-07 17:44:57 -0400] s1991: miketheman: ok, thanks
[2014-07-07 17:45:33 -0400] miketheman: (btw, s1991 - these are currently maintained by coderanger )
[2014-07-07 17:45:58 -0400] coderanger: s1991: Use an execute resource
[2014-07-07 17:46:08 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: the way we download and install Chef on the machine is flexible, and is chosen by chef-metal-fog here: https://github.com/opscode/chef-metal-fog/blob/master/lib/chef_metal_fog/fog_driver.rb#L534-L547
[2014-07-07 17:46:14 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: we call it a "convergence strategy"
[2014-07-07 17:46:21 -0400] therealtimsmith: anyone at Chef care to speak on the estimated release data for 11.14?
[2014-07-07 17:46:23 -0400] coderanger: installing a requirements.txt is not (currently) idemponent in an externally visible way
[2014-07-07 17:46:34 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: ok  will take a look
[2014-07-07 17:46:46 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: anything else useful to look at?
[2014-07-07 17:47:07 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: first thing: if you pass :cached_installer, you likely won't need the proxy at all.  It will download the Chef package to your workstation and then upload it via ssh to the bootstrapped machine
[2014-07-07 17:47:09 -0400] miketheman: coderanger: I'd love to have a chat about that sometime and see what the state is
[2014-07-07 17:47:23 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: but that can take a toll on your network if you are bootstrapping a lot of boxes
[2014-07-07 17:47:24 -0400] bawt: PONG
[2014-07-07 17:47:37 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: so if you're only doing a few, it might be your quickest route to happiness
[2014-07-07 17:47:43 -0400] s1991: coderanger: so, what you have in  recipes-packaginator.rb is probably a good method
[2014-07-07 17:48:03 -0400] coderanger: s1991: You mean the old app_python example?
[2014-07-07 17:48:11 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: indeed; that's good to know
[2014-07-07 17:48:15 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: if you don't say :cached_installer, it will pick the "InstallSh" method.  That uses Chef install.sh to install the package
[2014-07-07 17:48:21 -0400] s1991: coderanger: yes.
[2014-07-07 17:48:36 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: IIRC it uses wget to get it?
[2014-07-07 17:48:47 -0400] coderanger: s1991: Using the app* cookbooks at this point is pretty much not recommended, they are finicky as all hell and no one has expressed interest in funding an upgrade
[2014-07-07 17:49:18 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: well, chef-metal downloads install.sh (the script) to your local machine using ruby, uploads that via ssh, and kicks it off in bash: https://github.com/opscode/chef-metal/blob/master/lib/chef_metal/convergence_strategy/install_sh.rb#L29-L31
[2014-07-07 17:49:27 -0400] s1991: coderanger: though I'm only interested in "django do" section
[2014-07-07 17:49:51 -0400] viglesias: jkeiser: nice work on chef-metal, got quite a bit working over the weekend
[2014-07-07 17:50:02 -0400] coderanger: s1991: The application cookbook system is a framework, you can't just use one piece in full isolation
[2014-07-07 17:50:17 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: install.sh itself uses wget / curl / anything it can get its hands on to actually do the download: https://github.com/opscode/opscode-omnitruck/blob/master/views/install.sh.erb#L363-L392
[2014-07-07 17:50:37 -0400] s1991: coderanger: ok, so picking only that section won't help
[2014-07-07 17:50:43 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: I'm unclear precisely how these methods would use a proxy
[2014-07-07 17:51:06 -0400] coderanger: s1991: You would have to let the app* system control the whole code deployment, which as I said is not recommended pending rewrite
[2014-07-07 17:51:11 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: ahem - but in that case, if wget picks up the http_proxy env var (as I think it should) then the chef-client download should work nicely
[2014-07-07 17:51:32 -0400] s1991: coderanger: so can adding that cmd in bash script and calling it from vagranfile can be next better option I guess.
[2014-07-07 17:51:54 -0400] coderanger: s1991: Or use an execute resource, as in the first thing I said :P
[2014-07-07 17:52:13 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: if that's the case, it might be a simple matter of setting the environment variable when you execute bash install.sh in the InstallSh class :)
[2014-07-07 17:52:22 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: yes
[2014-07-07 17:52:29 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: something to test
[2014-07-07 17:52:34 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: thanks!
[2014-07-07 17:53:09 -0400] s1991: coderanger: sorry I'm a beginner, can you explain a bit what's execute resource
[2014-07-07 17:53:18 -0400] s1991: ohh ya, its this http://docs.opscode.com/resource_execute.html
[2014-07-07 17:53:23 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: no problem!  I would test out the command lines locally and see how you can pass env vars to bash before going in there; I don't know how straightforward it is
[2014-07-07 17:53:41 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: if you can't figure out any way to do it, though, you can always stick the env var into install.sh itself, heh :)
[2014-07-07 17:53:47 -0400] jkeiser: Just prepend it to the script
[2014-07-07 17:53:48 -0400] coderanger: s1991: Indeed, if you are interested in more personalized help with using Chef for application deployment I offer training and consulting services
[2014-07-07 17:54:03 -0400] jkeiser: Before you upload it
[2014-07-07 17:54:04 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: that's the easy part: http_proxy="http://blah:3128 ./install.sh"
[2014-07-07 17:54:10 -0400] jmreicha: micgo: adding the /n worked
[2014-07-07 17:54:17 -0400] jkeiser: Sweet!  Good luck then!
[2014-07-07 17:54:20 -0400] jmreicha: thank you!
[2014-07-07 17:54:29 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: I would put this in :convergence_options
[2014-07-07 17:54:45 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: ok
[2014-07-07 17:55:24 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: that hash is passed through to the InstallSh class
[2014-07-07 17:56:00 -0400] jkeiser: sigusr1: so like machine_options :convergence_options => { :proxy => '...' }
[2014-07-07 17:56:32 -0400] sigusr1: jkeiser: aha  will test that asap
[2014-07-07 17:57:34 -0400] micgo: jmreicha: Yay! I have a shell script around somewhere that converts keys for just this reason :)
[2014-07-07 18:03:33 -0400] miketheman: what was the formatter flag to get the old INFO logging from a chef run?
[2014-07-07 18:03:34 -0400] miketheman: (instead of the default doc formatter)
[2014-07-07 18:04:36 -0400] coderanger: miketheman: you should still see it under `-l info` I think
[2014-07-07 18:07:35 -0400] double_p: coderanger: can i scare you? hierachied roles :)
[2014-07-07 18:08:04 -0400] miketheman: coderanger: still formats it as doc
[2014-07-07 18:09:17 -0400] coderanger: miketheman: The log messages and the output formatter will be intertwined, but they shouldn't be related directly
[2014-07-07 18:09:33 -0400] coderanger: miketheman: You can use "-F null" to disable the formatter output I think
[2014-07-07 18:19:27 -0400] medya: is there a chef-dk for enterprise chef-server too ? (for the workstation)
[2014-07-07 18:20:30 -0400] Damacus_: medya, iirc there is no difference.
[2014-07-07 18:21:07 -0400] medya: @damacus_ whats iirc ?
[2014-07-07 18:21:16 -0400] Damacus_: if i remember correctly.
[2014-07-07 18:21:16 -0400] holoway: medya: "if I remember correctly"
[2014-07-07 18:21:19 -0400] gleam: i can't think of what the difference would be on the workstation side
[2014-07-07 18:21:28 -0400] holoway: medya: and yeah, there is no difference on the workstation side.
[2014-07-07 18:21:34 -0400] medya: should I download the chef-dk from the website and just replace the knife.rb ?
[2014-07-07 18:21:38 -0400] Damacus_: I've not used enterprise chef myself. But I believe the difference is just your knife.rb config.
[2014-07-07 18:21:41 -0400] holoway: yep
[2014-07-07 18:21:47 -0400] medya: cool thanks
[2014-07-07 18:21:49 -0400] Damacus_: yeah. it'll just be a slightly tweaked knife.rb
[2014-07-07 18:22:10 -0400] Damacus_: huzzah for educated guesses.
[2014-07-07 18:31:45 -0400] viglesias: are there any plans to add more lwrp to chef-metal (namely creating environments)
[2014-07-07 18:32:28 -0400] holoway: viglesias: jkeiser will know for sure
[2014-07-07 18:32:45 -0400] jkeiser: viglesias: you mean creating Chef environment objects?
[2014-07-07 18:32:53 -0400] viglesias: jkeiser: ack
[2014-07-07 18:33:00 -0400] jkeiser: viglesias: you can use chef_environment for that.  It's in cheffish (which is a dependency of chef-metal)
[2014-07-07 18:33:12 -0400] viglesias: jkeiser: beautiful! that was my missing link
[2014-07-07 18:33:19 -0400] jkeiser: https://github.com/opscode/cheffish/tree/master/lib/chef/resource
[2014-07-07 18:33:26 -0400] viglesias: jkeiser: kick ass
[2014-07-07 18:33:32 -0400] jkeiser: cookbooks are the only thing not in there yet, waiting for Policyfiles before I do that
[2014-07-07 18:34:26 -0400] jkeiser: viglesias: you can also use with_chef_environment 'blah', which works like the other with_* things: any machines you create will be automatically placed in that environment
[2014-07-07 18:34:38 -0400] viglesias: ah awesome!
[2014-07-07 18:34:54 -0400] jkeiser: data bags have a few with_ things as well
[2014-07-07 18:39:46 -0400] schuckles1: Has anyone had issues installing sensu-windows client on a windows 2008 server?
[2014-07-07 18:39:46 -0400] schuckles1: i've been having issues with memory
[2014-07-07 18:40:30 -0400] viglesias: jkeiser: next dumb question :), is there a way to access attributes of a machine? for example its ip address?
[2014-07-07 18:40:43 -0400] viglesias: i see that ip and such is not populated until after the first converge
[2014-07-07 18:41:36 -0400] jkeiser: viglesias: that's correct.  ohai data isn't populated until first converge.  If ip address and such is known earlier than that, we could certainly stuff it in the 'metal' attributes, though.
[2014-07-07 18:41:43 -0400] jkeiser: And it is known earlier than that, of course :)
[2014-07-07 18:41:51 -0400] viglesias: yeah i think chef-metal-fog should do that
[2014-07-07 18:42:05 -0400] viglesias: it has info like the instance id
[2014-07-07 18:42:24 -0400] viglesias: jkeiser: i will have a pr for adding endpoint config to chef-metal-fog
[2014-07-07 18:42:36 -0400] viglesias: i am using euca and need to set the iam and ec2 urls
[2014-07-07 18:42:42 -0400] viglesias: works like a charm so far
[2014-07-07 18:49:07 -0400] jkeiser: viglesias: there are two routes to a solution here; if you *really* need the ip address before the machine has done anything yet, you can modify the code.  But another way is to write a recipe like this:
[2014-07-07 18:49:11 -0400] jkeiser: viglesias: https://gist.github.com/jkeiser/7c1d690b5c612e9e3b01
[2014-07-07 18:49:25 -0400] jkeiser: viglesias: there are other reasons to want to follow that gist, too (speed and comfort :)
[2014-07-07 18:49:41 -0400] jkeiser: viglesias: but, I would *love* that patch to chef-metal-fog.  I think people will want it
[2014-07-07 18:51:49 -0400] jkeiser: viglesias: the idea is, for most clusters there is a bunch of stuff you can do on all your machines that *doesn't* require them to know about each other.
[2014-07-07 18:51:59 -0400] jkeiser: viglesias: So you can do all those at once, in parallel (provision base roles, etc.).
[2014-07-07 18:52:06 -0400] jkeiser: After you are done with that, all the machines are fully populated with all their data and can find each other.
[2014-07-07 18:52:16 -0400] rshade98: is there a setting that allows the admin user only to be able to login from localhost
[2014-07-07 18:52:27 -0400] rshade98: when I try and login remotely, I get rejected
[2014-07-07 18:52:36 -0400] jkeiser: So you can do another pass and add the recipes that need the other machines to exist (like mongo startup or your webserver that needs to know the address of the database)
[2014-07-07 18:52:51 -0400] jkeiser: Like, first make all the machines in parallel, *then* tell them to talk to each other
[2014-07-07 18:54:34 -0400] viglesias: jkeiser: here is what i am working with https://gist.github.com/anonymous/34f6dfb1ab41bbc76650
[2014-07-07 18:57:16 -0400] jkeiser: viglesias: ah!  so you are already doing the multi-stage thing :)
[2014-07-07 18:58:19 -0400] viglesias: jkeiser: i had a long weekend dude :)
[2014-07-07 18:58:30 -0400] viglesias: that thing evolved like you wouldnt believe
[2014-07-07 18:58:46 -0400] s1991: Hello, in chef I wanna execute "pip install -r requirements.txt" where requirements situated where vagrantFile is. So what should be path of requirements.txt
[2014-07-07 18:58:46 -0400] jkeiser: super glad that was discoverable!  I'm super excited!  I would love to see a blog post about your experiences
[2014-07-07 18:59:20 -0400] viglesias: jkeiser: so right now i am using motherbrain but id like to move to chef-metal
[2014-07-07 18:59:24 -0400] grubernaut:  #learnchef is now depricated?
[2014-07-07 19:00:24 -0400] jkeiser: grubernaut: yep, this is the right channel for it!  Plenty of helpful folk here
[2014-07-07 19:00:47 -0400] grubernaut: jkeiser:  cool cool :)
[2014-07-07 19:01:27 -0400] jkeiser: s1991: do you have the path to the vagrantfile?
[2014-07-07 19:02:08 -0400] viglesias: jkeiser: i will try to write up a blog, i really like the flow but need to button up these last few issues to get a full euca deployment working
[2014-07-07 19:02:09 -0400] s1991: jkeiser: yes, but should I need to use whole absolute path
[2014-07-07 19:02:46 -0400] btm: Chef Office Hours @ChefOfficeHours
[2014-07-07 19:02:51 -0400] btm: Chef Developer Office Hours: Join: bit.ly/1msbqs7 Watch: bit.ly/1msbnMR
[2014-07-07 19:03:01 -0400] jkeiser: s1991: chef-client runs in /, not in your current directory, if that's what you mean, so you would need the absolute path for that
[2014-07-07 19:03:16 -0400] jkeiser: s1991: alternatively, you could use "cwd" in the execute resource to move into that directory
[2014-07-07 19:03:37 -0400] jkeiser: s1991: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_execute.html#attributes
[2014-07-07 19:03:47 -0400] s1991: jkeiser: ok thanks
[2014-07-07 19:03:49 -0400] jkeiser: s1991: then the relative path would work
[2014-07-07 19:03:52 -0400] jkeiser: np
[2014-07-07 19:04:22 -0400] jkeiser: viglesias: understood :)
[2014-07-07 19:04:55 -0400] viglesias: jkeiser: once again, hats off to you sir
[2014-07-07 19:06:43 -0400] jkeiser: Man, I tried getting SABnzbd, Sick Beard, and friends working yesterday ... and failed.  I need to get some Chef up in there
[2014-07-07 19:08:48 -0400] viglesias: jkeiser: i done did dat, its awesome, used ubuntu 12.04 and the git repos with supervisord
[2014-07-07 19:10:36 -0400] gchristensen: jkeiser: you use sick beard for tracking ubuntu releases and other legal datasets, correct?
[2014-07-07 19:11:24 -0400] rsavage:  I thought sick beard was for leeching tv and movies... not a topic for #chef
[2014-07-07 19:12:45 -0400] gleam: haha
[2014-07-07 19:13:25 -0400] jkeiser: gchristensen: of course
[2014-07-07 19:14:03 -0400] jkeiser: That and rewatching things on my own schedule
[2014-07-07 19:14:07 -0400] jkeiser: Eh, I just want to set up all the server things that I own
[2014-07-07 19:14:23 -0400] jkeiser: And I am uncomfortable setting up servers in a one-off manner.  I'd prefer to chef all the things
[2014-07-07 19:15:08 -0400] nulleric: anyone know if there is a maintained chefapi client for java? I see one but it's a few years old
[2014-07-07 19:24:09 -0400] bmurt: anyone able to recommend a vagrant host manager for /etc/hosts
[2014-07-07 19:26:14 -0400] bmurt: nm, vagrant-hosts wins out due to activity
[2014-07-07 19:28:15 -0400] ResidentR: Alright, I'm running through the 'create your first cookbook' tutorial and I've already screwed it up. Where in the chef-repo are you supposed to put file resources?
[2014-07-07 19:28:52 -0400] ResidentR: nevermind.
[2014-07-07 19:29:02 -0400] rsavage: ResidentR you mean a template like an ERB?
[2014-07-07 19:29:48 -0400] jkeiser: viglesias: I just re-read you--did you create Chef cookbooks for it?  Or were you just saying you had set that stuff up already
[2014-07-07 19:29:49 -0400] ResidentR: in the case of the tutorial, I'm trying to upload a basic web page with the cookbook.
[2014-07-07 19:29:59 -0400] ResidentR: I see where it goes now though.
[2014-07-07 19:30:17 -0400] rsavage: Resident-Evil: cool, where did you put it?
[2014-07-07 19:30:43 -0400] holoway: nulleric: the only java api I know of is the jclouds one
[2014-07-07 19:31:10 -0400] ResidentR: it goes in chef-repo/cookbooks/nameofthecookbook/file/default/filethatimtryingtoupload.html
[2014-07-07 19:31:32 -0400] jtimberman: FYI: we're working on api.berkshelf.com for the supermarket go live. if you see 'actor crashed' when downloading cookbooks, and your source is 'api.berkshelf.com', switch to supermarket.getchef.com.
[2014-07-07 19:32:09 -0400] rsavage: Resident-Evil: yep, that's right, as well as ERB (embedded Ruby files).  I use that location all the time for creating files (configs, etc.).
[2014-07-07 19:32:48 -0400] rsavage: Resident-Evil: this might help you out: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_files.html
[2014-07-07 19:32:57 -0400] ResidentR: rsavage: thanks!
[2014-07-07 19:33:32 -0400] rsavage: <<why am I in the mood to hunt zombies??>>
[2014-07-07 19:37:10 -0400] jtimberman: api.berkshelf.com should be good now :)
[2014-07-07 19:37:45 -0400] c_t: before it was oh-so-bad
[2014-07-07 19:38:46 -0400] gchristensen: lol
[2014-07-07 19:40:40 -0400] george_mcfly: hello, I have a cookbook that wraps around a community cookbook ... I'm overriding an attribute in my wrapper, but when the 'parent' cookbook acceses it, it reads it as nil, which is its default value ... how could this be ?
[2014-07-07 19:41:24 -0400] rshade98:  is there a setting that allows the admin user only to be able to login from localhost, I can login locally from lynx, but not across the internet
[2014-07-07 19:41:57 -0400] rshade98: on chef-server, when started from cookbook
[2014-07-07 19:42:50 -0400] holoway: george_mcfly: can you put your code in a gist?
[2014-07-07 19:42:51 -0400] coderanger: rshade98: No
[2014-07-07 19:43:46 -0400] coderanger: cwebber jtimberman: https://api.berkshelf.com/status wasn't ported over
[2014-07-07 19:44:40 -0400] Damm: alias /status to /?
[2014-07-07 19:45:12 -0400] double_p: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOk0q5B5ZK4
[2014-07-07 19:45:40 -0400] george_mcfly: holoway: i would but its convoluted ... and i was able to solve the issue by moving the override to attributes instead of the recipe file
[2014-07-07 19:45:49 -0400] rshade98: @coderanger, any idea why I can't login?
[2014-07-07 19:46:12 -0400] holoway: rshade98: is the server/webui actually bound to ports other than localhost?
[2014-07-07 19:46:24 -0400] jtimberman: coderanger: in that we aren't redirecting that to the new status endpoint, correct.
[2014-07-07 19:46:38 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: New status endpoint?
[2014-07-07 19:46:55 -0400] jtimberman: coderanger: https://supermarket.getchef.com/api/v1/health
[2014-07-07 19:47:08 -0400] rshade98: @holoway, yes, I can reach it from 80 remotely
[2014-07-07 19:47:21 -0400] rsavage: I know this is NOT chef related but since alot of people in #chef use linux, and this is a major announcement: http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2014-July/020393.html
[2014-07-07 19:47:22 -0400] rshade98: https://ec2-184-73-120-151.compute-1.amazonaws.com/users/login
[2014-07-07 19:47:25 -0400] rsavage: centos 7 is here
[2014-07-07 19:47:33 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: It shouldn't be a redirect, that should be the berks API status, not supermarket status
[2014-07-07 19:48:05 -0400] jtimberman: api.berkshelf.com is now served by supermarket.getchef.com.
[2014-07-07 19:48:16 -0400] c_t: I would like to propose that tickets for supermarket fixes be "Cleanup on Aisle <number>"
[2014-07-07 19:48:20 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: Yes, and part of that API spec is a /status endpoint
[2014-07-07 19:48:38 -0400] coderanger: I know at least one company that uses that for monitoring (because I wrote it :)
[2014-07-07 19:48:57 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: If you would like to propose changing the berks API, thats a horse of a different color
[2014-07-07 19:50:13 -0400] cwebber: coderanger: can you please open an issue on opscode/supermarket to discuss this?
[2014-07-07 19:52:12 -0400] rsavage: supermarket... I like it.   lol... I didn't even know that existed, I'm working with git submodules to rain down the community cookbooks
[2014-07-07 19:52:57 -0400] coderanger: cwebber: Done, but as this represents a reversion I would recommend migrating back to the old berks API server until it can be addressed
[2014-07-07 19:53:09 -0400] mmzyk: rsavage just officially launched today. Its the replacement for the old community site.
[2014-07-07 19:54:08 -0400] s1991: How to I execute the "pip install -r requirements.txt" in recipe. I mean what should be the path of requirement.txt if its situated where vagrantFile is?
[2014-07-07 19:54:14 -0400] rsavage: mmzyk: nice.  Two cool things came out today
[2014-07-07 19:57:20 -0400] xponent: I'm creating a recipe that runs on windows, ubuntu, and redhat.  I'm dependent on some cookbooks but not for each platform.  An example is apt.  In the recipe I'm using: case node['platform']  when "ubuntu"  include_recipe "apt".  And then in metadata I have the depends 'apt'.  But windows doesn't need it.  Should I use recommends?
[2014-07-07 19:58:08 -0400] someara: xponent, no recommends isn't functional. you'll need to pull the apt cookbook down on windows
[2014-07-07 19:58:12 -0400] gyoza: Eulipion|Work: get ice working?
[2014-07-07 19:58:39 -0400] Eulipion|Work: not yet, rekicking my node with am IAM role to see if that fixes it
[2014-07-07 19:59:29 -0400] xponent: ok, so same in reverse ubuntu is pulling recipe windows, but it doesn't matter, as long there are no calls to it?
[2014-07-07 19:59:54 -0400] mmzyk: s1991 How are you trying to execute that that a Vagrant file comes into play? On a vm? I would assume you can use an absolute path, or else try and figure out what the relative path should be.
[2014-07-07 20:00:09 -0400] cwebber: @coderanger: as the /status endpoint was an implementation detail of the berks-api server and isnt actually used as part of the berkshelf client, we are going to go ahead and leave things pointed at supermarket. but, we will work towards an alternative quickly. in the meantime, I would suggest pointing at /api/v1/health.
[2014-07-07 20:00:13 -0400] someara: xponent yep.
[2014-07-07 20:00:19 -0400] viglesias: jkeiser: non chefification yet
[2014-07-07 20:00:48 -0400] coderanger: cwebber: Thats like saying the API was an implementation detail of the server
[2014-07-07 20:01:08 -0400] cwebber: @coderanger: with that said, I will get into the gory details on the issue you just opened.
[2014-07-07 20:01:20 -0400] coderanger: cwebber: If you want to say "it isn't used by berks itself so we don't care", so be it, but you didn't implement the API :)
[2014-07-07 20:01:27 -0400] xponent: perfect, thanks someara for clearing that up!  My sanity has been saved!
[2014-07-07 20:02:04 -0400] cwebber: @coderanger: fair enough, we actually implemented the /universe endpoint ;-)
[2014-07-07 20:02:48 -0400] s1991: mmzyk: ya on vartual machine and in virtualenv. I have tried everything in recipe absolute path also but throws error "no such file or directory"
[2014-07-07 20:04:09 -0400] s1991: mmzyk: also it is showing error in "/tmp/vagrant-chef-3/chef-solo-1/cookbooks/pgd_cookbook/recipes/default.rb" but this path doesn't exists
[2014-07-07 20:04:23 -0400] mmzyk: s1991 You sure its on the box? Is it possible its still residing on the host system and hasnt been brough in like you think?
[2014-07-07 20:05:15 -0400] s1991: mmzyk: I've done vagrant up and then I'm testing using "vagrant provision".
[2014-07-07 20:11:24 -0400] medya: I installed the chef-dk but there is no .chef or chef-repo folder in my ubuntu
[2014-07-07 20:11:39 -0400] mmzyk: s1991 my guess is that you need to make use of syncd folders to get the file where you want it. http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/index.html It might be that the /vagrant default share already has what you want.
[2014-07-07 20:17:46 -0400] pcorliss: Hey folks I asked in #berkshelf but didn't get a response. I'm seeing failures when running berks install as of a few hours ago.
[2014-07-07 20:18:25 -0400] pcorliss:   ==> Chef response did not contain a JSON body
[2014-07-07 20:18:25 -0400] pcorliss: Error retrieving versions of cookbook 'apt' at site: 'http://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/cookbooks'
[2014-07-07 20:18:43 -0400] pcorliss: Wondering if the 301 redirect to supermarket could be causing an issue in the 2.0 branch of berkshelf?
[2014-07-07 20:20:18 -0400] davidordave: @pcorliss, just verified that I am seeing the same error on berks 2.0.17
[2014-07-07 20:20:32 -0400] pcorliss: Glad I'm not the only one.
[2014-07-07 20:21:08 -0400] pcorliss: To my unfamiliar eyes it looks like Berkshelf doesn't handle 3XX status codes
[2014-07-07 20:24:56 -0400] davidordave: aye, that sounds like a fair assessment. sadly --debug doesn't shed anymore light on it.
[2014-07-07 20:28:34 -0400] chef685: hey, I'm having a hard time with the apache_passenger cookbook. after installing, which works, apache is not restarting because the module is not enabled but used by a site. i've tried to use apache_module "passenger" but without luck http://pastebin.com/exsqbfk4 any tipps?

[2014-07-07 20:30:46 -0400] cwebber: coderanger: issue updated with the history
[2014-07-07 20:31:33 -0400] cubed: +1 to pcorliss and davidordave , running into the same issue.
[2014-07-07 20:36:52 -0400] gyoza: eu: i msg'd it to you
[2014-07-07 20:38:37 -0400] holoway: cwebber and jtimberman - probably worth investigating if we need to turn off the 301 while we get a fix for berks 2 and redirects
[2014-07-07 20:39:44 -0400] cwebber: @holoway i was under the impression that berks 2 didnt use the api server at all
[2014-07-07 20:40:01 -0400] holoway: cwebber: it doesn't - it uses the community endpoint
[2014-07-07 20:40:07 -0400] holoway: cwebber: to fetch sources
[2014-07-07 20:41:08 -0400] cwebber: holoway: that makes sense. I will follow up in #berkshelf
[2014-07-07 20:41:09 -0400] holoway: cwebber: most likely the hard-coded source in Berkshelf 2 doesn't handle the redirect
[2014-07-07 20:41:33 -0400] holoway: cwebber: a likely fix would be to just have http://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/cookbooks return sans-301
[2014-07-07 20:41:43 -0400] cwebber: holoway: if it is like berks 3 it is the upgrade to https
[2014-07-07 20:42:13 -0400] cwebber: holoway: yeah, if that is the case then I will do some minor refactors on the cookbook to fix
[2014-07-07 20:43:37 -0400] holoway: cubed, pcorliss, davidordave - you can probably get around that by updating your sources
[2014-07-07 20:44:33 -0400] eherot: Anyone know how to edit a chef-zero node's attributes manually?
[2014-07-07 20:44:34 -0400] holoway: something like cookbook "artifact", site: "https://supermarket.getchef.com/api/v1/cookbooks"
[2014-07-07 20:45:15 -0400] ablythe: ohai chefs, lots going on today the link to the logs at the top of this room and the link here: https://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/IRC appear to be forwarding to supermarket http://community.opscode.com/chat/chef
[2014-07-07 20:45:33 -0400] davidordave: good point, I think we are going to start pointing our project maintainers to switch to berks three with all of the issues we have been seeing in the 2 branch recently, but it will be nice to present options if this doesn't get straightened out and people are slow to switch.
[2014-07-07 20:46:06 -0400] cwebber: ablythe: thanks! I will get that fixed in just a few
[2014-07-07 20:46:06 -0400] holoway: davidordave: we should talk about it in #berkshelf, but yeah - I would say we should do a release of berks 2 that updates the default source properly
[2014-07-07 20:50:32 -0400] holoway: davidordave cubed pcorliss: working on making berks 2 work again
[2014-07-07 20:53:42 -0400] s1991: Why I'm getting "Version 2.7.3 of python not found" while doing "package 'python' do version '2.7.3'" in recipe?
[2014-07-07 20:55:07 -0400] juliancdunn: s1991: your package manager can't figure out how to install version 2.7.3?
[2014-07-07 20:55:32 -0400] s1991: juliancdunn: How do I fix that
[2014-07-07 20:55:39 -0400] cubed: holoway: thanks for the suggestion
[2014-07-07 20:55:45 -0400] juliancdunn: s1991: what operating system are you using?
[2014-07-07 20:55:56 -0400] s1991: juliancdunn: ubuntu
[2014-07-07 20:56:15 -0400] miketheman: s1991: 2.7.3 may no longer be available
[2014-07-07 20:57:33 -0400] juliancdunn: you should be able to 'apt-get' something to see what version of Python comes with Ubuntu (I'm sorry, I don't use Ubuntu so I don't know the exact command)
[2014-07-07 20:57:55 -0400] gchristensen: apt-cache showpkg python
[2014-07-07 20:58:41 -0400] miketheman: apt-cache madison python
[2014-07-07 20:58:45 -0400] miketheman: is also nice
[2014-07-07 20:58:54 -0400] eherot: juliancdunn: Hey do you know anything about how chef-zero deals with attribute persistence across multiple runs?
[2014-07-07 20:59:07 -0400] miketheman: jkeiser would know, I think
[2014-07-07 20:59:08 -0400] juliancdunn: eherot: it... doesn't? it's not a real chef server
[2014-07-07 20:59:10 -0400] jkeiser: eherot: are you talking about local mode or about chef-zero the server?
[2014-07-07 20:59:16 -0400] eherot: jkeiser: oh there you are
[2014-07-07 20:59:18 -0400] s1991: miketheman: even 3.2.3 won;t install
[2014-07-07 20:59:40 -0400] jkeiser: eherot: if it's chef-client -z / local mode, attributes are persisted in the node / role json files on disk
[2014-07-07 20:59:43 -0400] pengin: question.. can the variable for a template point to an attribute value?
[2014-07-07 20:59:51 -0400] jkeiser: attributes are just part of whatever node or role they are in
[2014-07-07 21:00:00 -0400] eherot: jkeiser: Do you know where those would be stored by test kitchen+vagrant?
[2014-07-07 21:00:06 -0400] jkeiser: eherot: look for a nodes/ directory
[2014-07-07 21:00:19 -0400] jkeiser: I'm not sure where test kitchen does it but it must be around somewhere
[2014-07-07 21:00:39 -0400] jkeiser: eherot: I think test kitchen might be running chef-zero inside the container, which is not ideal, but that's where you will find your nodes/ dir
[2014-07-07 21:00:39 -0400] eherot: jkeiser: It's saving something between chef runs that I need it to forget...
[2014-07-07 21:01:06 -0400] eherot: jkeiser: ah you're right.  I swear I looked in here!  thanks ;-)
[2014-07-07 21:01:10 -0400] jkeiser: eherot: maybe make a recipe that blanks out that attribute and add it to the run list?
[2014-07-07 21:01:16 -0400] eherot: jkeiser: /tmp/kitchen/nodes for your reference.
[2014-07-07 21:01:22 -0400] jkeiser: cool :)
[2014-07-07 21:01:47 -0400] eherot: jkeiser: You would think that putting attributes: my_attribute: {} in .kitchen.yml would be enough
[2014-07-07 21:02:01 -0400] juliancdunn: s1991: perhaps start with just "package 'python'" and see what version you get out of it
[2014-07-07 21:02:15 -0400] jkeiser: eherot: is this a normal level attribute or one of the attributes set by ohai?
[2014-07-07 21:03:51 -0400] vijendar: Hi all
[2014-07-07 21:04:05 -0400] vijendar: I am seeing following error message "Error retrieving versions of cookbook 'apt' at site: 'http://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/cookbooks'"
[2014-07-07 21:04:30 -0400] vijendar: has any one seen this?
[2014-07-07 21:04:42 -0400] tequilarista: vijendar: are you specifying a specific version of the apt cookbook?
[2014-07-07 21:05:08 -0400] holoway: vijendar: are you using berkshelf 2?
[2014-07-07 21:05:33 -0400] eherot: jkeiser: this is a custom attribute set by one of my own recipes
[2014-07-07 21:06:06 -0400] vijendar: tequilarista: yes. we are specifying  "2.3.8"
[2014-07-07 21:06:39 -0400] s1991: juliancdunn: yes, It does work, but didn't it support python_pip?
[2014-07-07 21:06:57 -0400] s1991: i mean "python_pip 'django'"
[2014-07-07 21:07:07 -0400] jkeiser: eherot: if it's in "automatic" attributes that probably explains it
[2014-07-07 21:08:15 -0400] vijendar: holoway: yes. Berkshelf (2.0.15)
[2014-07-07 21:08:49 -0400] holoway: vijendar: we're working on it - the issue is related to http->https uplift in the migration to supermarket
[2014-07-07 21:09:09 -0400] holoway: vijendar: you may be able to fix it by specifying a source in your berksfile that points to the https endpoint for now
[2014-07-07 21:09:10 -0400] tequilarista: I was just gonna say "probably related to the update they just did on the berkshelf api server..."
[2014-07-07 21:09:11 -0400] tequilarista: so there you go
[2014-07-07 21:09:12 -0400] tequilarista: :)

[2014-07-07 21:19:04 -0400] cwebber: pcorliss, cubed, davidordave: I think we have a fix in place for the berkshelf 2 issue, think you could give it a try?
[2014-07-07 21:19:54 -0400] davidordave: @cwebberm:  got an error on 2.0.17
[2014-07-07 21:20:22 -0400] cwebber: davidordave: did you just try? also, can you paste in your output?
[2014-07-07 21:20:28 -0400] eherot: jkeiser: shouldn't be automatic.  The name is pretty cookbook specific ({'et_hostname'=>{'addl_hosts_entries'=>[]}})
[2014-07-07 21:20:41 -0400] davidordave: putting it in pastebin now
[2014-07-07 21:21:15 -0400] pcorliss: cwebber seeing success

[2014-07-07 21:22:17 -0400] s1991: Does I need to install yum, and yum-epel cookbook also for python cookbook to work?
[2014-07-07 21:22:46 -0400] davidordave: @cwebber, got http://pastebin.com/NmLF00a4  on the first try, but now I am back to "Chef response did not contain a JSON body"
[2014-07-07 21:23:22 -0400] pcorliss: FYI, while testing out Berkshelf 3.1 on AWS opsWorks I am seeing a timeout (default looks to be 600s) during setup.
[2014-07-07 21:23:47 -0400] pcorliss: Not critical as it appears I can downgrade back to 2.0 now, but might be worth looking into.
[2014-07-07 21:26:07 -0400] icarus_: https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/ant is white paging
[2014-07-07 21:26:10 -0400] icarus_: FYI
[2014-07-07 21:26:17 -0400] icarus_: showed me a 502 error a second ago also
[2014-07-07 21:26:35 -0400] icarus_: i guess the supermarket.* subdomain shift is having issues
[2014-07-07 21:33:30 -0400] chef854: i'm getting some errors insalling cookbooks via berkshelf http://pastebin.com/BgBGKivz
[2014-07-07 21:36:00 -0400] davidordave: @chef854 that error looks to be related to the recent supermarket switchover. I believe there are people looking into it.
[2014-07-07 21:36:37 -0400] s1991: Does I need to install yum, and yum-epel cookbook also for python cookbook to work?
[2014-07-07 21:36:37 -0400] chef854: is there a work around?
[2014-07-07 21:37:51 -0400] davidordave: some people mentioned pointing directly to the new supermarket api in your Berksfile, I haven't tested it though so I can't tell the exact syntax off the top of my head.
[2014-07-07 21:38:36 -0400] davidordave: via holowa: something like cookbook "artifact", site: "https://supermarket.getchef.com/api/v1/cookbooks"
[2014-07-07 21:40:17 -0400] viglesias: jkeiser: where is it that the metal attributes are set? namely where can i plug in the instance ip into the metal hash
[2014-07-07 21:48:22 -0400] TheDracle: So, I'm using 'bash' to execute an installation script. At some point I have a command that returns an exit code other than '0', but for some reason chef is just ignoring it and continuing on as if everything is hoky dory.
[2014-07-07 21:48:43 -0400] TheDracle: How do I specify if a particular command has a bad exit code, I want my recipe to fail?
[2014-07-07 21:49:23 -0400] holoway: TheDracle: that is extremely unlikely
[2014-07-07 21:49:26 -0400] garylabronz: exit 1 ?
[2014-07-07 21:49:43 -0400] holoway: TheDracle: by default, chef fails if a bash resource returns a non-zero exit code
[2014-07-07 21:49:46 -0400] gchristensen: set -e in your bash script
[2014-07-07 21:50:04 -0400] garylabronz: disregard me, read the question wrong
[2014-07-07 21:50:35 -0400] holoway: TheDracle: the issue is your script is not actually returning a non-zero status code, unless you have set ignore_failure to true, or have specified a set of returns codes
[2014-07-07 21:51:22 -0400] TheDracle: holoway, Hm, I'll check the case where it's set somehow to ignore_failure, because I'm about 100% certain it's returning the bad exit code.
[2014-07-07 21:51:34 -0400] TheDracle: I'm using opworks with amazon, and maybe somewhere in the stack it's setting this.
[2014-07-07 21:51:44 -0400] lopaka: been getting the following error from the supermarket:
[2014-07-07 21:51:44 -0400] lopaka: HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable: Back-end server is at capacity
[2014-07-07 21:51:59 -0400] lopaka: for the last 10 minutes
[2014-07-07 21:52:06 -0400] holoway: TheDracle: ok - just know that this part of chef is exercised constantly, so the odds you have a bug where we don't fail on non-zero exit status is near 0
[2014-07-07 21:52:13 -0400] cwebber: lopaka: yeah, we are working on it.
[2014-07-07 21:52:28 -0400] cwebber: note to self: we should have opscode_status notify this room
[2014-07-07 21:52:50 -0400] TheDracle: holoway, Yeah, it's for some reason occurring with nearly all of the bash scripts on my opsworks deployments, I've gone and done totally bogus things and it still runs and exits as if nothing is wrong.
[2014-07-07 21:52:57 -0400] lopaka: cwebber: thanks!
[2014-07-07 21:53:06 -0400] TheDracle: holoway, I'm thinking it's like what you said, I'll dig further, thanks :)
[2014-07-07 21:53:18 -0400] cwebber: just keeping everyone in the loop, we seem to have hit an actual capacity issue and are adding a few nodes to help.

[2014-07-07 22:47:58 -0400] TheDracle: Are there any good documents on the recommended way to run a service via chef? I see the 'service' command, but I'm having a hard time understanding exactly how it works.
[2014-07-07 22:49:05 -0400] TheDracle: Do I need to like make an erb template file for each OS type as an init script for that OS?
[2014-07-07 22:49:18 -0400] gchristensen: TheDracle:the service resource runs an init.d or upstart etc. script, that's all
[2014-07-07 22:50:07 -0400] TheDracle: gchristensen, So, I need to provision that script somehow first. At the moment I have a binary I deploy to my server, I can run it manually. If I run it via 'bash' or 'execute' it's behaving strangely and not really working.
[2014-07-07 22:50:26 -0400] gchristensen: yeah you should make an init or upstart or whatever script
[2014-07-07 22:50:30 -0400] TheDracle: Okay.
[2014-07-07 23:02:05 -0400] shlant: anyone know why I would get this with the application LWRP?
[2014-07-07 23:02:06 -0400] shlant: STDOUT:
[2014-07-07 23:02:07 -0400] shlant: STDERR: Permission denied (publickey).

[2014-07-07 23:02:08 -0400] shlant: Please make sure you have the correct access rights
[2014-07-07 23:02:08 -0400] shlant: and the repository exists.
[2014-07-07 23:02:27 -0400] shlant: If I take the command it is trying and tun it manually, it works
[2014-07-07 23:03:57 -0400] Drewzar: Does the root user have access (ssh keys) for the repo you're trying to clone?
[2014-07-07 23:04:10 -0400] cwebber: Alright, looks like we have stablized supermarket and api.berkshelf.com
[2014-07-07 23:04:31 -0400] zpencerq: Yay
[2014-07-07 23:04:37 -0400] Drewzar: \o/
[2014-07-07 23:04:39 -0400] shlant: Drewzar: if I can run the command manually, I would assume so, yes
[2014-07-07 23:04:48 -0400] Drewzar: Are you the root user?
[2014-07-07 23:05:13 -0400] shlant: Drewzar: does the application LWRP get run as root even though Im specify a deploy user?
[2014-07-07 23:05:23 -0400] Drewzar: chef is always run as root
[2014-07-07 23:08:28 -0400] shlant: Drewzar: so my id_rsa should be owned by root even though it's in /home/deploy/.ssh?
[2014-07-07 23:08:38 -0400] Drewzar: shlant: when you set the owner and group that's who will own the path after the repo gets cloned. the root user is still doing the clone.
[2014-07-07 23:08:51 -0400] Drewzar: should be in /root/.ssh/

[2014-07-07 23:10:36 -0400] shlant: Drewzar: root doesn't have a home directory and shouldn't need one
[2014-07-07 23:10:49 -0400] shlant: I guess I could put it in chef cahce?
[2014-07-07 23:10:51 -0400] shlant: cache
[2014-07-07 23:11:25 -0400] viglesias: s1991: looks like you need a name for the package you want to pip install

[2014-07-07 23:14:41 -0400] pengin: can someone please help me? I'm hitting a brick wall when it comes to using attribute values in templates
[2014-07-07 23:14:57 -0400] pengin: this is the cookbook in question https://github.com/dlutsch/dnsmasq/
[2014-07-07 23:15:19 -0400] pengin: im constantly getting "undefined local variable or method `upstream1' for #<Erubis::Context:0xb6dbfdb0>"
[2014-07-07 23:15:28 -0400] shlant: Drewzar: moved id_rsa to Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]. chmod 700 chown root:root. Same error
[2014-07-07 23:15:52 -0400] pengin: ive tried setting the attribute and the template variables so many different ways. i still cant seem to get it to work
[2014-07-07 23:17:19 -0400] Drewzar: shlant: Try using the 'deploy_key' attribute
[2014-07-07 23:17:30 -0400] duallain: @pengin, I think you're missing an @ in resolve.erb, so upstream1 should be @upstream1
[2014-07-07 23:18:00 -0400] shlant: Drewzar: that is what I'm using
[2014-07-07 23:18:25 -0400] Drewzar: shlant: using github?
[2014-07-07 23:19:21 -0400] shlant: Drewzar: not sure what you mean. The deploy_key application LWRP attribute?
[2014-07-07 23:19:31 -0400] Drewzar: Yes
[2014-07-07 23:19:40 -0400] Eulipion|Work: shlant: might want to tell ur box where the key is, http://pastebin.com/nDkK3SL9
[2014-07-07 23:20:02 -0400] pengin: @duallain, wow, that worked. I swear I tried that :) thanks for the catch!
[2014-07-07 23:20:11 -0400] Drewzar: deploy_keys are not your ssh_keys

[2014-07-07 23:20:47 -0400] duallain: @pengin, no problem.  Glad to help.
[2014-07-07 23:21:28 -0400] shlant: Drewzar: ah, ok I was using that wrong then. Eulipion|Work: I will try that
[2014-07-07 23:27:57 -0400] shlant: worked! thanks Drewzar + Eulipion|Work

[2014-07-07 23:32:10 -0400] spenserp: Hello all, I'm trying to setup a chef-server within a private subnet on a VPC on Amazon. I'm having trouble getting the chef-webserver-ui working, I believe it's an issue with the instance not having a proper FQDN. Any thoughts?
[2014-07-07 23:34:14 -0400] SilkFox: @spenserp are you having the issue where you login and get redirected back to the login page again?
[2014-07-07 23:34:22 -0400] shlant: coderanger: does the app_ruby unicorn provider allow for zero downtime deployments?
[2014-07-07 23:37:56 -0400] spenserp: @SilkFox: that was one of the issues. The main one was I couldn't connect to it from my local machine

[2014-07-07 23:42:18 -0400] PeteJ: I have a question about a fairly annoying thing that happens with my chef clients when they are starting their run, this happens intermittantly, and that is the run gets as far as " chef-client pid: XXXX" and then seems to stall. no error, no break, it just sits there for a long time.
[2014-07-07 23:42:45 -0400] PeteJ: sometimes it moves forward, sometimes it sits there for well i have let it go over night, and it just sits there
[2014-07-07 23:47:17 -0400] PeteJ: is anyone able to offer advice on this
