[2014-07-27 04:44:56 -0400] shlant: anyone know how I can use a variable in a .each in a  template?
[2014-07-27 04:44:58 -0400] shlant: like <% (0..(<%= @worker_count %> - 1)).each do |i| %>
[2014-07-27 05:12:30 -0400] gleam: you shoul dbe able to just do (@worker_count - 1)
[2014-07-27 05:12:43 -0400] gleam: in that context
[2014-07-27 05:15:04 -0400] Damm: shlant, hmm you should copy the mongrel stuff from ey if you really want that
[2014-07-27 05:15:24 -0400] Damm: ugly as sin

[2014-07-27 10:39:45 -0400] chef899: hey!
[2014-07-27 10:39:51 -0400] chef899: what's this channel about?
[2014-07-27 10:40:01 -0400] chef899: cookery?
[2014-07-27 10:40:01 -0400] bawt: cookery not found
[2014-07-27 10:47:00 -0400] ambientsound: chef899: it's about Chef, infrastructure as code
[2014-07-27 11:58:47 -0400] tomoyuki28jp: What's the right way to set OS env value like LC_ALL and LANG?
[2014-07-27 13:20:07 -0400] simmel: Does one keep the nodes subdirectory under version control?
[2014-07-27 13:20:28 -0400] simmel: (this is a chef-solo/chef-client --local-mode scenario)
[2014-07-27 14:53:40 -0400] thun: How do you include one of your own cookbooks when using berksfile
[2014-07-27 15:25:07 -0400] cheeseplus: thun: is the cookbook in github?
[2014-07-27 16:30:00 -0400] SmudgerDan: Hey anyone about who uses powershell to return a result and then uses that result in a cookbook?
[2014-07-27 19:33:54 -0400] coderanger: SmudgerDan: That, in general, isn't easy
[2014-07-27 20:32:43 -0400] shlant: anyone know why I can't notify a service from an LWRP to an LWRP? I am using monit_monitrc (https://github.com/phlipper/chef-monit/blob/master/providers/monitrc.rb) from my own LWRP and it gives me
[2014-07-27 20:32:45 -0400] shlant: "resource template[/etc/monit/conf.d/unicorn.monitrc] is configured to notify resource service[monit] with action reload, but service[monit] cannot be found in the resource collection. template[/etc/monit/conf.d/unicorn.monitrc] is defined in /var/chef/cache/cookbooks/monit/providers/monitrc.rb:8:in `block in class_from_file'"
[2014-07-27 20:33:06 -0400] shlant: do I have to specify it as a service in my LWRP?
[2014-07-27 20:33:50 -0400] ranjib: lwrp s have their own run context
[2014-07-27 20:34:06 -0400] ranjib: shlant, are you using the use_inline_resources directive?
[2014-07-27 20:34:55 -0400] ranjib: ideally, you would like to do the notification from outside. i.e the lwrp as a whole should notify (from where its being consumed) to another lwrp (as a whole, not child resources)
[2014-07-27 20:35:10 -0400] Damm: shlant, easiest in that case
[2014-07-27 20:35:15 -0400] Damm: shlant, otherwise you have to notify the actual resource
[2014-07-27 20:35:32 -0400] Damm: shlant, notify :restart, "resource[monit-install]" I think
[2014-07-27 20:36:01 -0400] Damm: shlant, basically you have to notify the correct resource with a lwrp as the service "monit" maybe embedded in a provider and not easily available
[2014-07-27 20:36:08 -0400] ranjib: shlant, if you use the inline resources.. then you can do what you have asked.  http://docs.opscode.com/lwrp_common_inline_compile.html
[2014-07-27 20:36:13 -0400] Damm: otherwise the lazy service "monit" do action :nothing end
[2014-07-27 20:36:16 -0400] Damm: and notifying that works
[2014-07-27 20:36:32 -0400] Damm: hmm is it opscode or getchef?
[2014-07-27 20:37:08 -0400] ranjib: Damm, google returned that page when i searched for use_inline_resource :-)
[2014-07-27 20:37:14 -0400] Damm: use_inline_resources if defined?(use_inline_resources)
[2014-07-27 20:37:16 -0400] Damm: is the right answer
[2014-07-27 20:37:32 -0400] Damm: github.com/damm/backup has it
[2014-07-27 20:37:35 -0400] Damm: so it must be right
[2014-07-27 20:37:45 -0400] Damm: ranjib, really wasn't directed at you
[2014-07-27 20:37:55 -0400] Damm: unless you work for getchef
[2014-07-27 20:41:32 -0400] ranjib: u need those funky defined predicate only if you are on older versions of chef use_inline_resources is being around for quiet some time..
[2014-07-27 20:44:08 -0400] shlant: alright thanks1
[2014-07-27 20:44:29 -0400] Damm: ranjib, I always publish my cookbooks so I expect it
[2014-07-27 20:44:50 -0400] Damm: that and if your going to use a feature; best to check if it's available
[2014-07-27 20:44:52 -0400] Damm: before using it
[2014-07-27 20:45:05 -0400] Damm: if it saves you a little breakage the pain is hardly a problem
[2014-07-27 21:01:48 -0400] shlant: doesn't seem to be working. I will provide a bigger picture: https://gist.github.com/MrMMorris/e161e35f994df4cc9e57
[2014-07-27 21:02:04 -0400] shlant: line 66 is the monit LWRP which is trying to notify monit reload
[2014-07-27 21:06:46 -0400] shlant: ranjib Damm ^

[2014-07-27 23:27:04 -0400] Damm: a lot of people put that on 2 lines
[2014-07-27 23:27:06 -0400] thun: PERFECT ty
[2014-07-27 23:28:02 -0400] Damm: 6 c1 medium instances, decomissioned down to 400% cpu usage on 2 Intel L5520 (2.27's)
[2014-07-27 23:28:05 -0400] Damm: pretty wicked
[2014-07-27 23:28:17 -0400] Damm: I had really expected more
[2014-07-27 23:28:41 -0400] thun: Webtraffic?
[2014-07-27 23:28:42 -0400] bawt: Webtraffic not found
[2014-07-27 23:28:51 -0400] Damm: yeah it's an old rails app
[2014-07-27 23:28:56 -0400] thun: Where did you take them?
[2014-07-27 23:29:08 -0400] thun: 10 fold??
[2014-07-27 23:29:09 -0400] Damm: well actually the owner had it already setup; they just had not filled the racks
[2014-07-27 23:29:12 -0400] Damm: i just joined
[2014-07-27 23:29:18 -0400] Damm: so to speak as a consultant/contractor
[2014-07-27 23:29:24 -0400] thun: Took them out of the cloud?
[2014-07-27 23:29:36 -0400] Damm: he has this little mom and pop DC in vegas
[2014-07-27 23:29:39 -0400] Damm: reno to be exact

[2014-07-27 23:30:46 -0400] Damm: all their logs are in logstash now so that's something we can start to discern
[2014-07-27 23:31:03 -0400] Damm: kinda hard adding stuff to EY instances
[2014-07-27 23:31:06 -0400] Damm: that old gentoo is just old
[2014-07-27 23:31:13 -0400] raul782: hi guys, is there an opsworks cookbook for nginx+php, the buil-in works only with amazon?

[2014-07-27 23:32:35 -0400] Damm: why would we?
[2014-07-27 23:33:29 -0400] thun: Idk just thought thats what you meant
