[2014-07-05 02:18:18 -0400] vegardx: Sigh!
[2014-07-05 02:18:30 -0400] vegardx: Now I've been hitting my head against the wall for a few days.
[2014-07-05 02:18:45 -0400] vegardx: For some reason chef won't put data into solr, yet solr returns 200 OK.
[2014-07-05 02:19:07 -0400] vegardx: I can even reindex it, and get success on everything, yet no data is put in
[2014-07-05 02:19:54 -0400] vegardx: I can query it using "knife search" and it returns no values.
[2014-07-05 02:21:36 -0400] vegardx: All services are running, chef-server-api, chef-expander, chef-solr, rabbitmq and couchdb.
[2014-07-05 05:15:53 -0400] spheromak: vegardx: check the expander log. is the issue with chef-server 11 ? or 10 ?
[2014-07-05 09:01:08 -0400] juzer: When I try to install mongodb-10gen cookbook via knife, it just switches back and forth between mongodb-10gen branch and apt branch, not sure whats going on there.
[2014-07-05 10:45:50 -0400] vegardx: shadylog: expander log is empty, and it was version 10.x
[2014-07-05 13:33:03 -0400] vegardx: I've been using the omnibus-packages and installed chef-client on the nodes with bootstrap, but they're not installed as services.
[2014-07-05 13:33:29 -0400] vegardx: Which result in having ot manually run chef-client on each node when I update something. They should be polling over <configured> minute.
[2014-07-05 13:34:21 -0400] vegardx: And there is literally nothing in the docs about it.
[2014-07-05 13:36:41 -0400] vegardx: I should've guessed where it was heading when the suggested method of using Debian was to select a specific version of the ubuntu packages.
[2014-07-05 14:04:15 -0400] vegardx: Sigh, the packages on debian are actually unusable.
[2014-07-05 14:04:33 -0400] vegardx: As in, the packages supplied by opcode.
[2014-07-05 14:18:30 -0400] gchristensen: vegardx: how are they unusable?
[2014-07-05 14:20:09 -0400] vegardx: gchristensen: The chef-client packages don't install as services, and the docs says nothing on how to do it.
[2014-07-05 14:22:43 -0400] gchristensen: vegardx: check out the chef-client cookbook
[2014-07-05 14:27:09 -0400] vegardx: alright, thanks!
[2014-07-05 15:13:14 -0400] paul_: Very limited experience here. I have a Chef workstation, server, and clients set up on virtual machines at home. I'm wondering exactly what this sentence means. It's a "homework" problem from a recruiter for a DevOps position.
[2014-07-05 15:13:20 -0400] paul_: Create a chef recipe that writes a hash from an attribute into a YAML file
[2014-07-05 15:14:15 -0400] paul_: I'm thinking the most practical application would be to convert an attribute file into a yaml file and write the yaml file to the client server.
[2014-07-05 15:14:57 -0400] paul_: an attribute file from the cookbook that is
[2014-07-05 15:29:45 -0400] anthonyacquanita: paul_:   read an attribute which happens to have values in a hash format to a file on disk in yaml form
[2014-07-05 15:30:31 -0400] paul_: the ones I've seen are almost in a hash format...
[2014-07-05 15:30:58 -0400] paul_: shown here, http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_node_object_deep_merge.html
[2014-07-05 15:31:50 -0400] paul_: attribute ( ....................... ) would need to be, attribute = { ..............................}, right?
[2014-07-05 15:32:36 -0400] paul_: from attribute = { .......................... } I can do the job.
[2014-07-05 15:34:25 -0400] paul_: I suppose I could process the text to replace  '('  with  '={',  and  ')'  with  '}'
[2014-07-05 15:34:49 -0400] anthonyacquanita: an nodes attributes are in hash format.  A value from a node can be anything, a string, a array or a hash
[2014-07-05 15:35:20 -0400] paul_: If I could count on the '(' and ')' only at the outside brackets of the attribute.
[2014-07-05 15:35:26 -0400] paul_: Am I making any sense?
[2014-07-05 15:35:40 -0400] paul_: thanks, by the way, Anthony
[2014-07-05 15:36:04 -0400] anthonyacquanita: I would first make a CB that makes an attribute in hash format and then prints it
[2014-07-05 15:36:24 -0400] anthonyacquanita: then worry about the yaml part later
[2014-07-05 15:36:47 -0400] anthonyacquanita: look at attributes.rb stuff for awhile first
[2014-07-05 15:37:14 -0400] anthonyacquanita: then make a recipe/default.rb that reads the attribute you just set and log/print them to the console
[2014-07-05 15:37:25 -0400] anthonyacquanita: good luck... heading out
[2014-07-05 15:37:35 -0400] paul_: I know how to convert a hash to yaml and write to yaml file. I've done that already in a recipe. But I put the hash right in the recipe.
[2014-07-05 15:37:40 -0400] paul_: ok, thanks
[2014-07-05 15:38:45 -0400] paul_: how do I read an attribute that I've set, I think is the question for me.
[2014-07-05 15:39:38 -0400] paul_: I'll google that. Thanks for the leads, Anthony
[2014-07-05 17:08:35 -0400] mikexstudios_: I'm writing an LWRP and currently implementing actions in the provider. Is there a way to create a wrapper action that can call other actions? For example, I have the following actions: :build, :release, :deploy. I want to create another action called :brd that calls :build, :release, and :deploy. Is there a way to do this?
[2014-07-05 17:28:33 -0400] bricker`LA: Has anybody setup a rundeck server with chef?
[2014-07-05 17:38:10 -0400] lamont_oc:  mikexstudios_: you can set your default_action to [:build, :release, :deploy]
[2014-07-05 17:38:57 -0400] lamont_oc: you can also jut have build call do_build, release call do_release, etc and then brd can just be do_build; do_release; do_deploy
[2014-07-05 17:42:14 -0400] lamont_oc: it actually should work to have brd call action_build; action_release; action_deploy
[2014-07-05 17:49:09 -0400] mikexstudios_: lamont_oc: I'll give that a try. Thanks!
[2014-07-05 22:08:17 -0400] paul_: test paste two lines...
[2014-07-05 22:08:27 -0400] paul_:     :apache => {
[2014-07-05 22:08:29 -0400] paul_:       :listen_ports => [ 80 ],
[2014-07-05 22:15:32 -0400] sadbox: I'm trying to edit the overide_attributes of a role, but I'm not sure what the syntax should be. Every example seems to be focused on editing a ruby file instead of the json one that I see when I knife role edit {thing}
[2014-07-05 22:18:10 -0400] sadbox: and... nvm
[2014-07-05 22:18:14 -0400] sadbox: lol
[2014-07-05 22:22:32 -0400] bricker`LA: Does anybody have any recommendations for managing rundeck users with chef? I want users to be able to set their own password, for example, so a hardcoded databag might not be best.
