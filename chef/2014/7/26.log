[2014-07-26 00:06:06 -0400] lamont_oc: thatll make sure to get the right package
[2014-07-26 01:12:32 -0400] Damm: man upgrading to the latest chef server is sure bumpy
[2014-07-26 01:12:38 -0400] Damm: and I mean the actual cpu load
[2014-07-26 01:15:02 -0400] Damm: oh that bug
[2014-07-26 01:15:03 -0400] Damm: nm
[2014-07-26 01:15:22 -0400] Damm: someone buys the weirdest WD disks; they hit 41c and they start to get random slow periods
[2014-07-26 01:15:28 -0400] Damm: and with a wal log heh
[2014-07-26 01:15:37 -0400] Damm: 50-60 writes every 10s add's up fast
[2014-07-26 01:35:41 -0400] Damm: rbowlby, email sales@?
[2014-07-26 01:36:42 -0400] rbowlby: Damm, yes I suppose the contact form link that's labeled "Need to change your subscription? Contact us." doesn't actually go anywhere.
[2014-07-26 01:36:44 -0400] rbowlby: \()/
[2014-07-26 01:38:56 -0400] Damm: rbowlby, well be aware there's no limits on Hosted; so if you are exceeding your subscription count
[2014-07-26 01:39:32 -0400] Damm: just basically fill out the form and sales will get to you; i don't imagine it's fast as sales is usually tied up through Salesforce (depending on the company, no clue on chef) so it may take a bit to get the lead assigned
[2014-07-26 01:39:36 -0400] Damm: :(
[2014-07-26 01:39:37 -0400] Damm: horrible excuse i know
[2014-07-26 01:40:25 -0400] rbowlby: thanks Damm
[2014-07-26 01:40:40 -0400] Damm: sales is horrible that way
[2014-07-26 01:40:49 -0400] Damm: I had to deal with salesforce a few times as a sysadmin
[2014-07-26 01:41:00 -0400] Damm: usually made me walk away thinking the sales guys were freaks
[2014-07-26 01:58:55 -0400] shlant: anyone use rbenv cookbook?
[2014-07-26 01:59:07 -0400] shlant: do I pass CFLAGS through env variables
[2014-07-26 01:59:15 -0400] Damm: shlant, I hope that memo helps btw
[2014-07-26 01:59:24 -0400] shlant: Damm: yes thank you. testing now
[2014-07-26 01:59:31 -0400] Damm: sv 2 unicorn
[2014-07-26 01:59:33 -0400] Damm: is typically what I do
[2014-07-26 01:59:50 -0400] shlant: haha
[2014-07-26 02:36:20 -0400] Damm: any javascript clients for chef-server?
[2014-07-26 02:36:34 -0400] Damm: one of my developers wants to talk to the chef-server via js
[2014-07-26 02:36:49 -0400] Damm: but that's not really what we want heh
[2014-07-26 02:48:34 -0400] mmzyk: Damm None that I know of, although the api is all rest based, so it could be done.
[2014-07-26 02:51:44 -0400] nlloyds: Damm there's a node.js client: https://github.com/sgentle/chef-node
[2014-07-26 03:00:58 -0400] coderanger: I've seen attempts at using pure-JS RSA impls in the browser, but you would have to paste the private key in to a browser and thats just not going to fly ever
[2014-07-26 03:01:21 -0400] coderanger: The rails app the powers the EC WebUI is basically just a proxy for exactly this reason
[2014-07-26 03:25:43 -0400] Damm: well that was my goal coderanger
[2014-07-26 03:25:50 -0400] Damm: was to paste the private key in the js
[2014-07-26 03:26:03 -0400] Damm: it's all secure content over https
[2014-07-26 03:26:12 -0400] coderanger: Damm: There is no good way to do that with any modicum of security
[2014-07-26 03:26:17 -0400] Damm: so we were just wanting a way to dynamically populate a lame ssh:// list
[2014-07-26 03:26:28 -0400] Damm: from our node list
[2014-07-26 03:26:35 -0400] Damm: simple dimple
[2014-07-26 03:27:01 -0400] Damm: we'll take a look as well as using the rest method
[2014-07-26 03:27:11 -0400] coderanger: JS 1) lacks good crypto primitives in most browsers and 2) doesn't offer enough language security to trust pasting a priv key in to a textarea
[2014-07-26 03:27:49 -0400] Damm: and those are bad excuses because we need better crypto primtives
[2014-07-26 03:28:01 -0400] Damm: and the latter part; security needs to be increased in that area
[2014-07-26 03:28:19 -0400] Damm: don't take it personal but those are not reasons to stop me here
[2014-07-26 03:28:30 -0400] coderanger: Okay, sure, but unless you want to go write me a better browser I can only comment on the ones that actually exist :)
[2014-07-26 03:29:40 -0400] coderanger: Damm: If Google says they can't do RSA safely in a browser, I believe them :)
[2014-07-26 03:30:20 -0400] coderanger: There might be enough stuff in end-to-end to make it work
[2014-07-26 03:31:21 -0400] coderanger: But I don't know of any standalone libs and WebCrypto support is minimal at best
[2014-07-26 03:31:54 -0400] coderanger: polycrypt is an option, but AFAIK it is abandonded
[2014-07-26 03:32:30 -0400] coderanger: Damm: Please see http://matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/ if after this you still think this is a good idea
[2014-07-26 04:00:26 -0400] tabolario: Anyone around who's played with the new vagrant-berkshelf RC?
[2014-07-26 04:00:40 -0400] chef682: Hi all :) I'm a noob in chef :( sorry for the noob question :( I am writing a template and i cant get to an attribute within the environment, can someone give me an example?
[2014-07-26 04:26:52 -0400] coderanger: chef682: environment attributes are merged together in to the node data
[2014-07-26 04:27:01 -0400] coderanger: chef682: So you access it like any other node attribute
[2014-07-26 04:57:17 -0400] chef682: Hi all :) I'm a noob in chef :( sorry for the noob question :( I am writing a template and i cant get to an attribute within the environment, can someone give me an example?
[2014-07-26 04:58:20 -0400] coderanger: chef682: Same answer as before
[2014-07-26 04:58:29 -0400] coderanger: chef682: environment attributes are merged together in to the node data

[2014-07-26 09:57:38 -0400] s1991: I initiated the vargrant and inside that in cookbook I initiated a cookbook using berkshelf. So Now I have two vagrantfile 1) while initiating the vagrant 2) initiating the berkshelf. Which one I should use for vagrant up?

[2014-07-26 15:57:06 -0400] xmltok: is there no longer a way to disable the yum makecache in the yum cookbook?
[2014-07-26 16:03:41 -0400] kramos: Hi guys, how do I pass ssh-key for --ssh-gateway? It seems that my passed param for ssh-gateway is asking for password [ http://pastebin.com/phZG1aiR ]
[2014-07-26 16:18:36 -0400] mparadise: kramos is it possible that the key is not present on the system being bootstrapped? Looks like you're getting to the gateway fine, but it's either not being forwarded to the destination node, or it's not present in the destination's authorized_keys.
[2014-07-26 16:19:38 -0400] mparadise: Or is $BASTIONIP the 54.210.75.32 address?
[2014-07-26 16:19:55 -0400] kramos: it's fixed, I had to put the Host into ~/.ssh/config . I thought the ssh-gateway also uses --identity-file
[2014-07-26 16:20:03 -0400] mparadise: Ahh, ok cool
[2014-07-26 16:55:30 -0400] s1991: Hello, I want a help
[2014-07-26 16:56:47 -0400] s1991: I've initiated a vagrant env and inside cookbook I've initiated a berkshef cookbook. Now I've two vagrantfile 1)from vagrant 2) from berkshef. Which one I should use for vargant up?
[2014-07-26 16:57:37 -0400] cheeseplus: so you have a cookbook inside a cookbook?
[2014-07-26 17:01:25 -0400] s1991: cheeseplus: no, I'm creating a new cookbook. So in cookbook folder I initiated berkshef's cookbook
[2014-07-26 17:01:55 -0400] cheeseplus: IMO skip/dump the Vagrantfile altogether and use test-kitchen
[2014-07-26 17:02:25 -0400] s1991: cheeseplus: for what test-kitchen is used?
[2014-07-26 17:02:40 -0400] cheeseplus: testing cookbooks
[2014-07-26 17:02:46 -0400] cheeseplus: it can use vagrant but also cloud providers
[2014-07-26 17:03:01 -0400] cheeseplus: http://kitchen.ci/
[2014-07-26 17:04:02 -0400] cheeseplus: for your question, it just depends on what you want the vagrantfile to do, likely you want the one berkshelf created
[2014-07-26 17:05:00 -0400] s1991: cheeseplus: but even then don't I need to run 'vagrant up'?
[2014-07-26 17:05:31 -0400] cheeseplus: for test-kitchen? no - it does everything for you
[2014-07-26 17:05:46 -0400] s1991: ok, thanks
[2014-07-26 17:06:50 -0400] cheeseplus: you use something like "kitchen test" or "kitchen converge" which will build a Vagrantfile for you dynamically from a template and start the machines and with "test" will run any chefspec/minitest/BATS/serverspec tests you have
[2014-07-26 17:07:48 -0400] cheeseplus: if using kitchen-vagrant then "kitchen converge" is basically "vagrant up"
[2014-07-26 17:45:31 -0400] someara: kitchen verify
[2014-07-26 18:12:03 -0400] shlant: anyone using monit? what cookbook? I would like to be able to supply my own template
[2014-07-26 18:12:40 -0400] shlant: looks like this is my best bet so far: https://github.com/apsoto/monit
[2014-07-26 19:09:52 -0400] helllen: helllo
[2014-07-26 19:10:06 -0400] helllen: I have installed chef-server (version 11) and works correctly
[2014-07-26 19:10:30 -0400] helllen: I would like to use inlcuded bookshelf to store some objects (s3)
[2014-07-26 19:10:45 -0400] helllen: I have tried to use it but has no success
[2014-07-26 19:10:49 -0400] helllen: someone could help me  ?
[2014-07-26 19:14:48 -0400] coderanger: helllen: Not sure what you mean, you can't really use bookshelf outside of the context of chef
[2014-07-26 19:15:05 -0400] coderanger: helllen: It isn't setup as a general-purpose data storage system
[2014-07-26 19:15:22 -0400] helllen: at the webpage it says: Bookshelf is an S3 API compatible object store.
[2014-07-26 19:16:45 -0400] helllen: even show the s3cf config file I have to use: https://github.com/opscode/bookshelf/blob/master/etc/s3cfg
[2014-07-26 19:18:08 -0400] helllen: coderanger, do you work in opscode ?
[2014-07-26 19:18:44 -0400] coderanger: helllen: It kind of is, but is is only there to act as a file storage layer for the chef server, please setup your own S3 simulator if you want one of those
[2014-07-26 19:18:54 -0400] coderanger: and no, I don't work for opscode, I just (mostly) manage this channel
[2014-07-26 19:19:03 -0400] helllen: ok ok
[2014-07-26 19:19:20 -0400] helllen: I wanted to use this as file storage too
[2014-07-26 19:19:23 -0400] helllen: if possible
[2014-07-26 19:19:30 -0400] coderanger: That is not what it is for, don't do that
[2014-07-26 19:19:52 -0400] coderanger: RiakCS is a good option for a general-purpose S3-compatible server
[2014-07-26 19:20:32 -0400] helllen: yes I have used riak-cs and it works too
[2014-07-26 19:20:40 -0400] helllen: but I need something simpler
[2014-07-26 19:20:45 -0400] helllen: and on one node only
[2014-07-26 19:20:51 -0400] helllen: it will not scale at all
[2014-07-26 19:20:59 -0400] helllen: but I need it for simpler instalations
[2014-07-26 19:20:59 -0400] coderanger: You could try to deploy bookshelf yourself I guess, but there is zero docs on doing that AFAIK
[2014-07-26 19:21:06 -0400] helllen: I see
[2014-07-26 19:21:13 -0400] coderanger: bookshelf only supports exactly what is needed for chef-server
[2014-07-26 19:21:17 -0400] helllen: I see
[2014-07-26 19:21:48 -0400] helllen: If I use ruby api to connect to s3 (bookshelf)
[2014-07-26 19:21:50 -0400] helllen: it connects
[2014-07-26 19:21:59 -0400] helllen: and I can see buckets
[2014-07-26 19:22:25 -0400] helllen: but when I try to access to keys I see The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your key and signing method."
[2014-07-26 19:22:30 -0400] helllen: and it is confusing me
[2014-07-26 19:23:29 -0400] coderanger: Like I said, it isn't a complete implementation, its an internal component of chef-server
[2014-07-26 19:25:25 -0400] coderanger: There are a ton of other options though
[2014-07-26 19:26:45 -0400] helllen: for example:
[2014-07-26 19:26:46 -0400] helllen: http://pastebin.com/S2BPsMfK
[2014-07-26 19:27:16 -0400] coderanger: I can't make this any clearer _do not use chef-servers bookshelf as your own file server_
[2014-07-26 19:27:28 -0400] coderanger: It is considered an internal implementation detail
[2014-07-26 19:28:24 -0400] coderanger: If RiakCS is too complex, Ceph also offers S3 compat now
[2014-07-26 19:28:30 -0400] helllen: thanks coderanger
[2014-07-26 19:29:02 -0400] coderanger: Or use something like https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3
[2014-07-26 19:29:24 -0400] helllen: mm interesting
[2014-07-26 19:29:47 -0400] coderanger: Or parkplace which is what chef-server used to use
[2014-07-26 19:29:54 -0400] coderanger: pretty sure thats abandonded though
[2014-07-26 19:30:07 -0400] coderanger: it's ex-why code
[2014-07-26 19:39:45 -0400] helllen: fake-s3 works :-D
[2014-07-26 19:39:53 -0400] helllen: thanks coderanger
