[2014-07-20 00:28:22 -0400] someara: try putting a version number as an arg?
[2014-07-20 00:33:48 -0400] tehgeekmeister: can chef install its own plugins?
[2014-07-20 00:44:53 -0400] rodolfojcj: no someara, unshare command does not receive options
[2014-07-20 00:46:16 -0400] rodolfojcj: I've just uploaded a cookbook, drupalbaseplus, and it is very curious for me than in just some minutes there are 19 downloads
[2014-07-20 00:46:52 -0400] rodolfojcj: is there some kind of bot, automated checker or anything that downloads cookbooks?
[2014-07-20 00:47:10 -0400] rodolfojcj: or quite contrary are there real humans?
[2014-07-20 00:47:33 -0400] rodolfojcj: I mean, are they real humans downloading it?
[2014-07-20 00:54:26 -0400] kramos: Hi guys, how do I save my node to use the IP address of eth1 into my chef-server?
[2014-07-20 01:13:22 -0400] jblack: kramos: Use a node attribute
[2014-07-20 01:13:43 -0400] jblack: well, wait, I misread the question
[2014-07-20 01:13:57 -0400] kramos: I'm trying to change my node.ipaddress then save it
[2014-07-20 01:14:20 -0400] jblack: Ahh, ok, so you have an attribute with an ip, and you want to change the ip of the system to that ip?
[2014-07-20 01:14:59 -0400] jblack: There is a ifconfig resource that would work great for you
[2014-07-20 01:15:03 -0400] kramos: not an attribute. the node.ipaddress . I'd like to change it. but hmmm... I think I'm doing the code wrong
[2014-07-20 01:15:04 -0400] jblack: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_ifconfig.html
[2014-07-20 01:15:13 -0400] kramos: yep. thanks
[2014-07-20 01:15:36 -0400] jblack: RIght. if you want to change the ip of a system, use that.
[2014-07-20 01:15:55 -0400] jblack: and how you define the ip, whether via an attribute, data bag or hard coded.. that's up to how you write the recipe. =)
[2014-07-20 01:16:14 -0400] kramos: my bad. I did my code as node.ipaddress="iphere" instead of node.set
[2014-07-20 01:16:51 -0400] kramos: but it did not save it. tsk
[2014-07-20 01:17:31 -0400] jblack: right. That's not how it actually works. node.ipaddress is a notification of what chef saw, not what it "wants to be"
[2014-07-20 01:17:45 -0400] kramos: http://pastebin.com/46fBiqkC
[2014-07-20 01:18:00 -0400] jblack: http://docs.opscode.com/ohai.html
[2014-07-20 01:18:31 -0400] jblack: Right. That's not going to do what you want.
[2014-07-20 01:18:55 -0400] jblack: Ohai sets that according to what the ip is. Changing it won't change the actual ip. For that, you'll need the ifconfig resource
[2014-07-20 01:19:48 -0400] kramos: but I was just doing that so that the node data in chef-server is returning the ipaddress of the eth1 instead of those dummy from eth0
[2014-07-20 01:20:49 -0400] jblack: http://pastebin.com/fzQynRxm
[2014-07-20 01:21:25 -0400] jblack: Let me explain this a different way. Some of the node attributes are there for convience. They're just copies of the real thing.
[2014-07-20 01:21:27 -0400] kramos: no, i'm not trying to change my eth0 ipaddress
[2014-07-20 01:22:24 -0400] jblack: What are you trying to do, then?
[2014-07-20 01:22:30 -0400] kramos: i have 2 interface. I want to tell chef-server that my node.ipaddress is the ip from eth1
[2014-07-20 01:23:22 -0400] jblack: You could try changing the chef_server url in /etc/chef.rb to point to the external ip for your chef server.
[2014-07-20 01:23:39 -0400] jblack: node.ip is the ip that your system connectd to chef with.
[2014-07-20 01:23:58 -0400] kramos: same, I did connect using the eth1 addresses
[2014-07-20 01:24:56 -0400] jblack: let me find a better node attribute for you to get the external ip. ohai has all of the interfaces somewhere
[2014-07-20 01:26:04 -0400] jblack: oh, actually, that's the ip for which you have a default route, according to http://docs.opscode.com/chef/ohai.html .
[2014-07-20 01:26:30 -0400] kramos: I'm not trying to get my node attribute. I want to tell chef-server or save my node data that my IP address is the new one
[2014-07-20 01:26:54 -0400] jblack: it'll automatically change the next time the node change chef-client
[2014-07-20 01:27:13 -0400] jblack: pardon, the next time the node runs chef-client
[2014-07-20 01:27:55 -0400] kramos: http://pastebin.com/xSJYZk48
[2014-07-20 01:28:09 -0400] kramos: so no other way to change it?
[2014-07-20 01:28:25 -0400] jblack: Change it with the ifconfig resource. =)
[2014-07-20 01:29:05 -0400] jblack: I think I undersatnd what's going on. You're using a mongodb cookbook, and it's trying to use node.ipaddress to configure clustering, and it has the wrong ip?
[2014-07-20 01:29:34 -0400] kramos: i'm not using a cookbook. I'm just using chef-shell
[2014-07-20 01:30:01 -0400] kramos: and under vagrant :D
[2014-07-20 01:30:23 -0400] jblack: Well, I'm sorry I couldn't be more help. GOod luck
[2014-07-20 01:31:00 -0400] kramos: haha yeah. no worries. thanks for pointing out on default route, It's a start
[2014-07-20 01:31:11 -0400] cheeseplus: kramos: you could change the default route on the machine before vagrant bootstraps chef
[2014-07-20 01:31:18 -0400] cheeseplus: using like the inline shell provider perhaps
[2014-07-20 01:31:35 -0400] cheeseplus: but that will likely break the vagrant communication and it'll blow up
[2014-07-20 01:31:38 -0400] kramos: tada! https://coderwall.com/p/hwiohg
[2014-07-20 01:32:08 -0400] cheeseplus: yep, was going to say you'll want an ohai plugin to override
[2014-07-20 02:47:20 -0400] Damm: sounds like he needs the network ohai plugin
[2014-07-20 02:47:34 -0400] Damm: so he can access node.network.ipaddress_eth1
[2014-07-20 02:47:35 -0400] Damm: and such
[2014-07-20 02:47:54 -0400] Damm: having to do  node[:network][:interfaces][:eth1][:addresses].detect{|k,v| v[:family] == "inet" }.first
[2014-07-20 02:47:57 -0400] Damm: sucks
[2014-07-20 04:41:18 -0400] phelms1: Hey - Question for you guys. How would you normally handle downloading a config file for a server deployment. I was thinking of storing them in S3 and download them as part of the recipe ?
[2014-07-20 04:42:25 -0400] coderanger: phelms1: Normally those are done with a template resource
[2014-07-20 04:57:50 -0400] phelms1: coderanger: Thanks.
[2014-07-20 05:30:31 -0400] Damm: phelms1, depends on context
[2014-07-20 05:30:40 -0400] Damm: both are acceptable answers
[2014-07-20 05:31:02 -0400] phelms1: Damm: I'm just thinking of using S3 so I can upload the config files from my web panel
[2014-07-20 05:31:17 -0400] Damm: phelms1, nah
[2014-07-20 05:32:08 -0400] phelms1: ?
[2014-07-20 05:32:34 -0400] Damm: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CtQXNan3MdYJ:12factor.net/config+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us
[2014-07-20 05:33:09 -0400] Damm: some people say store your configuration files in a git repo; ugh.  Storing them in Chef is just as deplorable
[2014-07-20 05:33:18 -0400] Damm: I'm a big fan of json blobs
[2014-07-20 05:33:30 -0400] Damm: and basically feeding them into chef and letting chef spit out the end result
[2014-07-20 05:34:26 -0400] Damm: and since my docker usage I've become a fan of environment variables a lot more
[2014-07-20 05:34:27 -0400] Damm: :(
[2014-07-20 05:34:28 -0400] phelms1: Where in Chef? A template?
[2014-07-20 05:34:51 -0400] Damm: well you feed the production credentials in a json blob and spit them out in chef
[2014-07-20 05:34:59 -0400] Damm: you don't need a template to dump out yaml or json
[2014-07-20 05:35:09 -0400] Damm: just file "something" do content foo.to_json end
[2014-07-20 05:35:14 -0400] Damm: quick and dirty
[2014-07-20 05:35:36 -0400] Damm: careful when referencing off of *node* but no template is really quired
[2014-07-20 05:35:38 -0400] Damm: required*
[2014-07-20 05:36:02 -0400] Damm: most are yaml or json now or something else you can easily output
[2014-07-20 05:42:24 -0400] Damm: if you have to call template "config/database.yml" do ... something is wrong
[2014-07-20 05:42:26 -0400] Damm: very wrong
[2014-07-20 05:47:35 -0400] phelms1: I'm talking about a config for the application on the node.
[2014-07-20 05:47:38 -0400] phelms1: like mysql for example
[2014-07-20 05:47:40 -0400] phelms1: the my.conf
[2014-07-20 05:48:01 -0400] Damm: my.cnf is in the mysql cookbook
[2014-07-20 05:48:02 -0400] Damm: or percona
[2014-07-20 05:48:07 -0400] Damm: you shouldn't store that
[2014-07-20 05:48:29 -0400] Damm: and .my.cnf shouldn't be on S3 it likely would require crednetials from Chef
[2014-07-20 09:18:53 -0400] seshagiri_naidu: Hi team,
[2014-07-20 09:20:48 -0400] seshagiri_naidu: I am working on a chef recipe to convert a log file on winodows target to unixt formate so that I can parse the log file for success/failure( i , e some thing like dos2unix convertion of the file
[2014-07-20 09:21:15 -0400] seshagiri_naidu: any help will be appriciated
[2014-07-20 09:23:44 -0400] seshagiri_naidu: file convertion using 1. ruby/powershell/cygwin using chef recipe?
[2014-07-20 09:24:17 -0400] jblack: if you have sed, just trim out the \r 's...
[2014-07-20 09:24:31 -0400] jblack: Oh, wait.. what kind of windows log file?  It may be unicoded
[2014-07-20 09:25:05 -0400] jblack: there are log aggregators, like logstash and fluentd (look for td-agent),   that will pass logs to a remote log server.
[2014-07-20 09:26:51 -0400] seshagiri_naidu: it is simple log file only but I could not parse the log file, but once converted to dos2unix then i could parse it
[2014-07-20 09:27:29 -0400] jblack: ok, so, windows ends each line with \r\n,  while in unix, it's just \n
[2014-07-20 09:27:49 -0400] jblack: if you strip those \rs out, you're good.  if dos2unix works for ya, then great. ;)
[2014-07-20 09:28:49 -0400] seshagiri_naidu: but I need to convert the file using chef recipe instead for directly logging into windows and converting it
[2014-07-20 09:29:27 -0400] jblack: as a one time thing, or every time you run chef, or... ?
[2014-07-20 09:29:41 -0400] jblack: do you want to write a script and have chef install it?
[2014-07-20 09:30:43 -0400] seshagiri_naidu: one time only
[2014-07-20 09:31:17 -0400] jblack: you can do a ruby script as a resource.
[2014-07-20 09:31:34 -0400] jblack: as in an inline script.
[2014-07-20 09:32:07 -0400] seshagiri_naidu: I could not get any ruby support for converting the file
[2014-07-20 09:32:27 -0400] jblack: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_ruby.html
[2014-07-20 09:32:39 -0400] jblack: ok, well, there's also a powershell resource
[2014-07-20 09:33:01 -0400] jblack: http://docs.opscode.com/resource.html
[2014-07-20 09:33:11 -0400] jblack: if you install dos2unix, you can use the execute resource to run it
[2014-07-20 09:33:47 -0400] jblack: Failing that, hire coderanger to do it. He'd probably give you a good price for something so small. =)
[2014-07-20 09:56:43 -0400] seshagiri_naidu: <jblack> Powershell does not have command dos2unix
[2014-07-20 09:57:08 -0400] jblack: no, but surely it has file handling and some sort of string replacement
[2014-07-20 10:00:21 -0400] ambientsound: vim has dos/unix/mac line ending conversion
[2014-07-20 10:00:27 -0400] ambientsound: :set fileencoding
[2014-07-20 12:56:07 -0400] hypnosb: does it make sense to use chef for continuous deployment?
[2014-07-20 12:56:19 -0400] hypnosb: versus fabirc or capistrano
[2014-07-20 13:02:51 -0400] ssd7: hypnosb: It depends a bit on your needs and desired workflow, but I think Chef is a great tool for continous deployment.
[2014-07-20 13:03:47 -0400] hypnosb: idk, small part of me things i could get more centralized control, and ability to scale better
[2014-07-20 13:04:10 -0400] hypnosb: shit
[2014-07-20 13:04:13 -0400] hypnosb: uhg
[2014-07-20 13:04:42 -0400] ssd7: ...anything I can help with?
[2014-07-20 13:06:02 -0400] hypnosb: is there a recipe that checks out from a github?
[2014-07-20 13:06:38 -0400] hypnosb: id think i could have a variable/environment variable that controls some of the app decision logic in production/testing
[2014-07-20 13:06:38 -0400] ssd7: hypnosb: We have a resource for that, let me find an example of it being used
[2014-07-20 13:07:08 -0400] hypnosb: then i could just bootstrap a box, apply as a role and there she is
[2014-07-20 13:07:21 -0400] ssd7: Here is the docs on the resource: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_git.html
[2014-07-20 13:07:41 -0400] hypnosb: hmm
[2014-07-20 13:15:16 -0400] ssd7: hypnosb: You might also be interested in the deploy_revision resource.  You can see an example of it being used here: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/supermarket/blob/master/recipes/_application.rb
[2014-07-20 16:19:56 -0400] davidski: Though there is a git resource as part of the core chef, it's still the cookbook's responsibility to ensure that the git binary is available?
[2014-07-20 16:20:24 -0400] davidski: I would have thought that inclusion in code meant that omnibus would have sufficient binaries to run it, but that looks not to be the case.
[2014-07-20 16:20:37 -0400] davidski: s/in code/in core/
[2014-07-20 16:36:27 -0400] heathsnow: Is there a "real" github cookbook out there?  I keep seeing partial cookbooks (ie they tackle one specific part of github...deploy keys for instance).  I'm looking for a cookbook that consumes either the 'octokit' gem or the 'github_api' gem and has a resource for everything.
[2014-07-20 16:37:08 -0400] gchristensen: unlikely.
[2014-07-20 16:37:12 -0400] gchristensen: that is a big task
[2014-07-20 16:38:38 -0400] heathsnow: yeah
[2014-07-20 16:39:48 -0400] heathsnow: I'll just write my own...that handles my specific task...as others have done.
[2014-07-20 16:40:22 -0400] heathsnow: I just want someone else to do all the work...is that too much to ask?    :]
[2014-07-20 16:41:19 -0400] gchristensen: to be fair, the only work remaining is hooking the pipes up
[2014-07-20 16:55:20 -0400] someara: heathsnow the maintainer of the git cookbook actually works at github
[2014-07-20 16:55:28 -0400] someara: I'm sure he'd be open to collaborating
[2014-07-20 16:55:42 -0400] heathsnow: :o
[2014-07-20 21:43:50 -0400] rhys: question for anyone. is there a resource to manage a directory in the same manner that you can do snippets of templates into the same file?
[2014-07-20 21:44:51 -0400] rhys: so with the template, theres template_init /etc/config/foo declared somewhere as a base. and multiple other things can say template_include /etc/config/foo, and give it a snippet, and when chef runs they all get put into the same file.
[2014-07-20 21:45:37 -0400] rhys: i want to do this with directories. directory_init foo, purge=> true, recursive=> true. so that any cookbook that doesn't say "directory_include" foo to add their files, will get wiped.
[2014-07-20 21:46:18 -0400] rhys: this is so i can have absolute control in a chaotic multi user environment over things like nginx's /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
[2014-07-20 21:56:46 -0400] rhys: template version is here: https://github.com/fujin/chef-template-snippet
