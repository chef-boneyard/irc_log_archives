[2014-07-19 00:03:09 -0400] someara: doug2 you don't have to stash data in a node attribute. just use a variable
[2014-07-19 00:04:23 -0400] someara: attributes are meant to be tweakable knobs. they're not really supposed to be dynamic during the course of a chef-run. square pegs and such
[2014-07-19 00:05:25 -0400] viglesias: someara: how is coordination of variables done between nodes
[2014-07-19 00:05:33 -0400] viglesias: lets say node1 comes up generates a pass
[2014-07-19 00:05:39 -0400] viglesias: then node2 needs to use it in its runlist
[2014-07-19 00:06:16 -0400] viglesias: i am currently save+search and now i feel like an idiot
[2014-07-19 00:06:52 -0400] someara: aaah. they yea you can stash it in a node attribute and search() for it
[2014-07-19 00:07:37 -0400] someara: aren't distributed systems fun
[2014-07-19 00:07:48 -0400] viglesias: someara: for some value of "fun"
[2014-07-19 00:08:00 -0400] viglesias: motherbrain and chef-metal have been a god sned
[2014-07-19 00:08:02 -0400] someara: the beatings shall continue until morale improves
[2014-07-19 00:08:07 -0400] viglesias: and the only thing that made my use caes possible
[2014-07-19 00:09:11 -0400] c_t: Chef Inc really needs to make chef-metal the responsibility of an employee living in Norway
[2014-07-19 00:09:28 -0400] c_t: so there can be "Scandinavian chef-metal"
[2014-07-19 00:09:39 -0400] viglesias: c_t: well done
[2014-07-19 00:10:16 -0400] someara: jkeiser wanna move go norway?
[2014-07-19 00:10:22 -0400] someara: s/go/to/
[2014-07-19 00:10:27 -0400] viglesias: someara: he has no choice at this point
[2014-07-19 00:10:29 -0400] viglesias: its destiny
[2014-07-19 00:10:52 -0400] someara: the metalocalypse is now stuck in your head
[2014-07-19 00:10:53 -0400] viglesias: http://www.businessinsider.com/map-of-metal-bands-by-country-2013-11
[2014-07-19 00:11:28 -0400] c_t: at minimum he needs to start wearing King Diamond makeup
[2014-07-19 00:13:46 -0400] viglesias: someara: youve still got me feeling weird about using save, so what are the gotchas?
[2014-07-19 00:33:21 -0400] someara: depends on what you're using it for, but the usual. race conditions and such
[2014-07-19 00:58:28 -0400] Damm: http://i0.wp.com/www.horrorsociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/King-Diamond-image-8.jpg?resize=468%2C362
[2014-07-19 00:59:00 -0400] Damm: but I'm biased
[2014-07-19 01:02:35 -0400] Damm: c_t, ever thought about coming to a Chef Conference dressed up as King Diamond?
[2014-07-19 01:04:10 -0400] c_t: hmm, tempting
[2014-07-19 01:04:17 -0400] c_t: I might be a little bald for it though
[2014-07-19 01:04:21 -0400] c_t: I can't rock the mulletude
[2014-07-19 01:04:47 -0400] Damm: c_t, it's a charecter so who cares if he's bald
[2014-07-19 01:05:37 -0400] Damm: he's about 58
[2014-07-19 01:05:43 -0400] Damm: so he could go bald
[2014-07-19 09:14:41 -0400] tomoyuki28jp: I wanna share some variables between Vagrantfile and chef recipe (attribute) because I wanna use the variable from Vagrant + chef or chef-solo. What's the right way to do it?
[2014-07-19 09:18:53 -0400] tomoyuki28jp: s/chef-solo/knife solo/
[2014-07-19 09:19:01 -0400] tomoyuki28jp: Anybody?
[2014-07-19 10:13:47 -0400] MartinCleaver: If someone adds a package (e.g. mutt) to a chef-provisioned server, thats not in the node definition, would the next converge detect it and remove it?
[2014-07-19 10:14:07 -0400] MartinCleaver: or does it only detect things that are missing?
[2014-07-19 12:06:19 -0400] banister: hey guys, waht is this error about? https://gist.github.com/banister/bef3b7e9780260056760
[2014-07-19 12:17:46 -0400] Mniot: banister: It says "cannot determine user id for 'deploy', does the user exist on this system?"
[2014-07-19 18:46:24 -0400] Damm: MartinCleaver, uh no
[2014-07-19 18:46:33 -0400] Damm: MartinCleaver, unless you have something to detect and remove unwanted packages
[2014-07-19 18:46:38 -0400] Damm: I don't think there's anything that would touch it
[2014-07-19 18:46:50 -0400] MartinCleaver: thats what I figured, Damm
[2014-07-19 18:47:02 -0400] MartinCleaver: Is there something that can detect such things?
[2014-07-19 18:47:12 -0400] Damm: not really with chef
[2014-07-19 18:47:23 -0400] Damm: but there are tools like tripwire and samhain that are file detection monitors
[2014-07-19 18:47:31 -0400] Damm: fairly good at detecting new packages being installed or files modified
[2014-07-19 18:47:35 -0400] coderanger: You _could_ write something in chef to detect that
[2014-07-19 18:47:38 -0400] Damm: and you can configure them to ignore certain files
[2014-07-19 18:47:42 -0400] coderanger: but it would be in your own code
[2014-07-19 18:47:46 -0400] Damm: nah but that would be pretty iffy
[2014-07-19 18:47:52 -0400] Damm: you'd have to own the whole package installation list
[2014-07-19 18:47:57 -0400] Damm: for the base basically
[2014-07-19 18:48:01 -0400] coderanger: Sure, not saying this is a good idea :)
[2014-07-19 18:48:03 -0400] Damm: that or create a whitelist of packages to ignore
[2014-07-19 18:48:07 -0400] coderanger: just that its vaguely possible
[2014-07-19 18:48:18 -0400] Damm: that's why I mentioned it above as a possibility
[2014-07-19 18:48:20 -0400] Damm: not a likelyhood
[2014-07-19 18:48:21 -0400] coderanger: MartinCleaver: Better solution is usually to set the root filesystem to read only :)
[2014-07-19 18:48:38 -0400] MartinCleaver: or use Docker
[2014-07-19 18:48:39 -0400] Damm: just deploy coreos and use chef-metal?
[2014-07-19 18:48:48 -0400] Damm: nothing to ssh into? heh
[2014-07-19 18:49:06 -0400] coderanger: MartinCleaver: That is not mutually exclusive with read-only slugs
[2014-07-19 18:49:36 -0400] Damm: I only deploy docker with coreos pretty much
[2014-07-19 18:49:40 -0400] Damm: too many bugs otherwise
[2014-07-19 18:49:45 -0400] MartinCleaver: tripwire - I havent used that in decades
[2014-07-19 18:50:04 -0400] Damm: http://www.la-samhna.de/
[2014-07-19 18:50:06 -0400] Damm: ^^ MartinCleaver
[2014-07-19 18:50:16 -0400] Damm: it's actually very good
[2014-07-19 18:50:26 -0400] Damm: it detected some rootkits at one point
[2014-07-19 18:59:21 -0400] Damm: I still have a beltane license afaik
[2014-07-19 18:59:40 -0400] shlant: aws question! anyone know why the create button for DB Security Groups is greyed out for me?
[2014-07-19 18:59:40 -0400] shlant: http://i.imgur.com/AQEfLIF.png
[2014-07-19 20:11:22 -0400] jblack: So, I have a bit of a non-technical question.. more of a process one....
[2014-07-19 20:11:42 -0400] jblack: How do you guys work with chef when doing R&D work?
[2014-07-19 20:13:34 -0400] jblack: For example, I've been playing with lxc a little bit lately.   I dont' want to chef it up until I have a deployment that's worth reproducing.
[2014-07-19 20:14:35 -0400] jblack: However, chef, trying to be as useful as always, kind of gets in the way ....   "Oh, I see the firewall isn't right any more. let me fix that for you!!"
[2014-07-19 20:16:00 -0400] jblack: I can always make a more limited role for just r&d stuff, but I thought I'd ask you guys how you normally play in a chef environment
[2014-07-19 20:18:02 -0400] coderanger: jblack: Just disable the recipes for things you don't want chef to control
[2014-07-19 20:18:06 -0400] ambientsound: jblack: I use test kitchen and vagrant.
[2014-07-19 20:18:21 -0400] ambientsound: and don't put the chef client in cron
[2014-07-19 20:18:31 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, TK ftw
[2014-07-19 20:18:44 -0400] jblack: Yeah. I'm getting pretty close to test kitchen
[2014-07-19 20:19:00 -0400] jblack: in fact, that's why I'm playing with lxc. =)
[2014-07-19 20:23:32 -0400] jblack: speaking of lxc... and chef-metal...   has anyone heard of some sort of chef-metal-lxc-remote type deal?
[2014-07-19 20:23:50 -0400] jblack: or even a knife-lxc-remote ?
[2014-07-19 20:24:02 -0400] coderanger: jblack: Thats not really want LXC is
[2014-07-19 20:24:16 -0400] coderanger: jblack: Docker and Mesos are both network APIs over LXC
[2014-07-19 20:24:59 -0400] jblack: I was looking at docker a few days ago. I haven't figured out yet how chef and docker work together
[2014-07-19 20:25:22 -0400] jblack: it looks like mesos is an orchestration layer?
[2014-07-19 20:25:52 -0400] Damm: docker isn't lxc anymore
[2014-07-19 20:25:53 -0400] Damm: fwiw
[2014-07-19 20:26:12 -0400] Damm: they made the model of containers a plugin so lxc or native
[2014-07-19 20:26:16 -0400] cheeseplus: jblack: lucky for you there is a blog post http://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/04/23/chef-docker-automating-container-workflows/
[2014-07-19 20:26:31 -0400] cheeseplus: libcontainer ftw
[2014-07-19 20:26:36 -0400] Damm: tbh chef and docker don't mix for me
[2014-07-19 20:26:45 -0400] Damm: different problems for different solutions
[2014-07-19 20:26:56 -0400] Damm: Docker is my single process entrypoint; anything complex is chef with lxc
[2014-07-19 20:27:02 -0400] coderanger: Damm: Its the same underlying stuff as LXC uses, so I just handwave
[2014-07-19 20:27:04 -0400] Damm: I gave up trying to make complex Docker stuff
[2014-07-19 20:27:19 -0400] Damm: Cassandra clusters and such
[2014-07-19 20:27:20 -0400] Damm: gore
[2014-07-19 20:27:35 -0400] jblack: That article looks like using chef to orchestrate a docker server to bring up gobs of containers.
[2014-07-19 20:27:51 -0400] Damm: coderanger, not really
[2014-07-19 20:28:04 -0400] jblack: Useful and great. But wouldn't that then mean that the actual deployment for an instance is now managed by docker instead?
[2014-07-19 20:28:08 -0400] cheeseplus: just an example of chef and docker working together, didn't promise magic
[2014-07-19 20:28:09 -0400] Damm: coderanger, the libcontainer stuff is a lot tighter than lxc ever was
[2014-07-19 20:28:21 -0400] Damm: especially post 1.0
[2014-07-19 20:29:34 -0400] Damm: tbh I was hoping Docker could get people to stop trying to own every nginx image; or redis cookbook
[2014-07-19 20:29:47 -0400] Damm: but it seems that really Docker only provided some isolation at a cost
[2014-07-19 20:29:52 -0400] cheeseplus: god getting riak to work in docker was a pain
[2014-07-19 20:29:56 -0400] jblack: I just spent the last year migrating everything to chef. I don't want to migrate it all to docker.
[2014-07-19 20:29:59 -0400] Damm: anything java like
[2014-07-19 20:30:01 -0400] cheeseplus: and so not even worth it
[2014-07-19 20:30:02 -0400] Damm: like ES
[2014-07-19 20:30:06 -0400] Damm: I have a ES cluster under Docker
[2014-07-19 20:30:13 -0400] cheeseplus: we have these containers, we call them machines
[2014-07-19 20:30:16 -0400] Damm: it's on metal in LV, then a no data node in AWS
[2014-07-19 20:30:32 -0400] Damm: having the nat hairpin in the DC was ugly
[2014-07-19 20:30:40 -0400] Damm: but then getting a secure clustering to AWS
[2014-07-19 20:30:49 -0400] Damm: and you have to set the publish port to be something routeable
[2014-07-19 20:30:52 -0400] Damm: err publish ip
[2014-07-19 20:31:00 -0400] Damm: Java + Docker = immense pain
[2014-07-19 20:31:26 -0400] cheeseplus: no surprise there
[2014-07-19 20:32:06 -0400] Damm: i mean I made https://github.com/damm/docker-ubuntu
[2014-07-19 20:32:12 -0400] Damm: because /etc/apt/sources.list is the default archive
[2014-07-19 20:32:20 -0400] Damm: I wonder how many hours and petabytes of data is lost there
[2014-07-19 20:32:35 -0400] Damm: super duper ricidulus
[2014-07-19 20:37:23 -0400] cheeseplus: the train internet spottiness probably means I should just read a book
[2014-07-19 20:51:34 -0400] sam_: Question: Is it possible to have multiple paths (array) in template resource?
[2014-07-19 20:55:41 -0400] nulleric: sam_: do you want to put the template in multiple destinations?
[2014-07-19 20:56:23 -0400] coderanger: sam_: No?
[2014-07-19 20:56:45 -0400] sam_: yeah. I want to put the same template in multiple locations
[2014-07-19 20:57:07 -0400] nulleric: you cant do it the way your thinking, but you could put a loop around the resource and pass it in different locations
[2014-07-19 20:57:18 -0400] coderanger: sam_: %w{/one /two}.each do |path| template path do source 'foo.erb' end end
[2014-07-19 20:57:18 -0400] sam_: aah
[2014-07-19 20:57:22 -0400] nulleric: %w(dir1 dir2).each do |dir|
[2014-07-19 20:57:23 -0400] nulleric: ya
[2014-07-19 20:57:43 -0400] sam_: thanks. let me try that
[2014-07-19 21:09:39 -0400] jblack: coderanger: This is you? https://coderanger.net/chef-open-source/
[2014-07-19 21:09:46 -0400] coderanger: Indeed
[2014-07-19 21:13:06 -0400] jblack: I don't agree with you. I think Chef meets a reasonable definition of free software.
[2014-07-19 21:15:23 -0400] jblack: Sure, one entity may be doing all the work, but it's still out there for the world to benefit from. My line in the sand for whether a project is open is "can I theoretically fork this". And I think that's an option
[2014-07-19 21:16:24 -0400] coderanger: jblack: It is an intentionally inflammatory statement designed to be clickbait moreso than factually correct, as stated in the post it is literally open source, it just is a cathedral/enterprise model
[2014-07-19 21:17:06 -0400] jblack: The cathedral model doesn't allow for how tight knit opscode is with the community. :P
[2014-07-19 21:17:51 -0400] coderanger: jblack: It isn't, in the past week some progress has been made but as demonstrated in the post, it is far from "tight knit"
[2014-07-19 21:18:05 -0400] coderanger: jblack: Case in point, you aren't paying me for the support you recieve
[2014-07-19 21:18:17 -0400] jblack: The lack of external code involvement is just a testament to how well you guys listen to the outside.  Nobody has a strong itch to scratch down in the boiler room section of the code, becuase you guys do so well at listening
[2014-07-19 21:19:09 -0400] jblack: Oh, absolutely. That's a great thing for me in the short term.  It's just plain bad for you and opscode, and bad for me long term.
[2014-07-19 21:19:53 -0400] jblack: I'll be honest. I never even checked to see if there is a way for me, as an individual developer, to help feed you
[2014-07-19 21:20:23 -0400] jblack: you guys are so low key about it, it just never even comes to mind
[2014-07-19 21:22:10 -0400] jblack: I think you're kinda doing it to yourself. I just went to http://www.getchef.com/support/ to see what sort of options I have to write you a check....
[2014-07-19 21:22:55 -0400] jblack: I see umpteen different ways opscode is trying to make my life easier. But I don't see even a single reference to actually purchasing support
[2014-07-19 21:23:38 -0400] coderanger: jblack: For the record, I don't work for Chef/Opscode
[2014-07-19 21:24:02 -0400] jblack: Huh?
[2014-07-19 21:24:33 -0400] coderanger: "what sort of options I have to write you a check" a support contract via Opscode is not that
[2014-07-19 21:24:41 -0400] coderanger: Unless you meant a more general "you"
[2014-07-19 21:25:05 -0400] jblack: Ok, so the problem is actually more of a personal one.
[2014-07-19 21:25:28 -0400] jblack: No. I thought it was a case of case of your boss, opscode, isn't getting enough revenue.
[2014-07-19 21:26:11 -0400] jblack: What sort of rates do you have?
[2014-07-19 21:26:46 -0400] jblack: sorry, that's probably not appropriate for this channel. Let's take this private?
[2014-07-19 21:26:47 -0400] coderanger: jblack: I do training and consulting on a daily basis or longer as needed
[2014-07-19 22:46:02 -0400] jblack: I don't suppose it's unacceptable to set up a single system to be both a provisioner and a docker server at the same time..
[2014-07-19 22:46:14 -0400] jblack: for development/testing type stuff
[2014-07-19 22:48:22 -0400] jblack: Oh, for anyone that watched Mandi  Wall's demo session of chef-metal + docker,  it looks like the git repo for the demo is here: https://github.com/tduffield/docker-demo
[2014-07-19 22:51:20 -0400] someara: jblack trust me.... if you want to give chef money, write sales and they'll be very happy to take it =)
[2014-07-19 22:52:07 -0400] jblack: I wonder if that can be generalized to "If you want to give X money, write X and they'll be very happy to take it"    =D
[2014-07-19 22:55:53 -0400] someara: probably
[2014-07-19 22:56:09 -0400] jblack: We should test that theory.
[2014-07-19 22:56:17 -0400] jblack: Hey someara:  I want to give you money.
[2014-07-19 22:56:34 -0400] someara: ill take it!
[2014-07-19 22:57:04 -0400] jblack: confirmed. I think we can convert the theory into the "law of self interest" =)
[2014-07-19 23:23:22 -0400] jblack: omg, docker chews up drive space like nobody's business.  I've run 2 different images  and /var/lib/docker is already at 2.7 gigs
[2014-07-19 23:24:50 -0400] coderanger: jblack: How are you calculating that?
[2014-07-19 23:25:27 -0400] jblack: du -sh
[2014-07-19 23:25:50 -0400] jblack: granted, there's some inode
[2014-07-19 23:28:43 -0400] rodolfojcj: is ther some way to unshare a specific version of a cookbook uploaded to supermarket?
[2014-07-19 23:28:54 -0400] rodolfojcj: unshare or delete, whatever
[2014-07-19 23:29:26 -0400] someara: knife cookbook site unshare
[2014-07-19 23:45:09 -0400] rodolfojcj: I saw no way to unshare a specific version with "knife cookbook site unshare"
[2014-07-19 23:47:19 -0400] coderanger: rodolfojcj: I think you need to do it from the webui. This should be done only very very rarely though
[2014-07-19 23:47:40 -0400] rodolfojcj: ok, I'll see
[2014-07-19 23:49:03 -0400] rodolfojcj: no problem, this time I shared some version that contains all the previous versions
[2014-07-19 23:49:28 -0400] rodolfojcj: so those previous are a waste of time for anyone who download any of them
[2014-07-19 23:52:22 -0400] rodolfojcj: I saw no way in the webui. Maybe it isn't possible to unshare a specific version
[2014-07-19 23:52:34 -0400] rodolfojcj: but no big deal, anyway
