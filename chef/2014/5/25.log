[2014-05-25 13:36:39 -0400] joelmoss: will chef-server-webui work with hosted chef server?
[2014-05-25 16:28:40 -0400] sarkis: hey guys so ive been using chef-solo w/ berkshelf
[2014-05-25 16:28:46 -0400] sarkis: actually knife-solo ;)
[2014-05-25 16:29:29 -0400] sarkis: so starting to read up on chef-zero, it looks like maybe i should be moving to use that instead... currently we do use this in production, was thinking move to chef-server on prod and continue chef-zero for dev and qa
[2014-05-25 16:29:49 -0400] sarkis: any advice?
[2014-05-25 16:34:17 -0400] sarkis: here's what got me thinking :) https://github.com/matschaffer/knife-solo/issues/297
[2014-05-25 17:50:36 -0400] jtimberman: sarkis: i'd use chef-zero instead of chef-solo.
[2014-05-25 17:50:53 -0400] jtimberman: sarkis: but i'm totally biased and work for Chef, and would use a Chef Server even for one machine :)
[2014-05-25 17:51:00 -0400] jtimberman: (because I do)
[2014-05-25 17:57:08 -0400] jidar: hahah
[2014-05-25 17:57:14 -0400] jidar: bias!
[2014-05-25 17:58:58 -0400] jtimberman: but, objectively, chef-zero and using chef-client's local mode with it is a much better way to go because it's API compatible, meaning you can use recipes written for using with a server w/o issues, and doesn't require extra things like 'chef-solo-search' (a cookbook)
[2014-05-25 18:00:58 -0400] sarkis: jtimberman: well then i trust u hha
[2014-05-25 18:01:48 -0400] sarkis: jtimberman: yea currently we use knife-solo + berkshelf way in prod, it kind of sucks
[2014-05-25 18:02:10 -0400] sarkis: we only have about 10 servers though
[2014-05-25 18:06:07 -0400] sarkis: that said ^ , jtimberman, i can't find enough reasons to switch to chef-server :P
[2014-05-25 18:06:21 -0400] sarkis: unfortunately i have to convince a few people :(
[2014-05-25 18:07:58 -0400] jidar: you can't just stand up an instance and do it?
[2014-05-25 18:07:59 -0400] jidar: I mean
[2014-05-25 18:08:08 -0400] jidar: it can't be more than $20/month
[2014-05-25 18:09:31 -0400] sarkis: well im thinking that workflows going to change no? can i still use berkshelf with chef server?
[2014-05-25 18:09:41 -0400] sarkis: we currently have app specific cookbooks...
[2014-05-25 18:17:10 -0400] sarkis: with chef-server i'd have to have a single chef repo now? does Berkshelf 3.x solve the issue of Berksfiles within cookbooks?
[2014-05-25 18:17:36 -0400] sarkis: the way Berkshelf is designed is that it will ignore Berksfiles for application cookbooks
[2014-05-25 18:22:00 -0400] jidar: so how do you now get the recipes over to the hosts?
[2014-05-25 18:26:29 -0400] sarkis: knife-solo cook
[2014-05-25 18:31:03 -0400] sarkis: looks like it rsyncs them over to the host i want to cook
