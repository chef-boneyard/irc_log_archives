[2014-05-17 05:16:39 -0400] stormerider: hey, does anyone know what's up with knife-block and chefdk? if i do a chef gem install knife-block, then most knife commands error out with "/opt/chefdk/embedded/apps/chef/lib/chef/version_class.rb:65:in `parse': '11.14.0.alpha.1' does not match 'x.y.z' or 'x.y' (Chef::Exceptions::InvalidCookbookVersion)"

[2014-05-17 16:03:47 -0400] Lindsey: hi all
[2014-05-17 16:04:33 -0400] Lindsey: does anyone have a moment to spare for what I hope is a simple question
[2014-05-17 16:07:46 -0400] Lindsey: ah it's OK I worked it out
[2014-05-17 16:07:58 -0400] Lindsey: knife cookbook test with -VV is my friend :)
[2014-05-17 16:40:53 -0400] xeno: Confused:  For some reason there are not two simple packages, chef-server, chef-client, on either Ubuntu or Debian.  What's the deal?
[2014-05-17 16:52:20 -0400] xeno: Hello?
[2014-05-17 16:52:28 -0400] xeno: Seems like a pretty simple question.
[2014-05-17 16:56:07 -0400] xeno: Okay, if not, there does seem to be a plethora of instruction out there, all either old or confusing, on how to install client/server chef.  The latest thing I found showed a server that is designed only for Ubuntu, not Debian, and only for a 2 year old version of Ubuntu.
[2014-05-17 17:00:03 -0400] jmreicha: Installing with the omnibus installer is usually the preferred method
[2014-05-17 17:08:39 -0400] xeno: jmreicha:  That's an interesting assertion that I've not seen elsewhere.
[2014-05-17 17:13:18 -0400] jmreicha: oh?  Where have you been looking?
[2014-05-17 17:58:06 -0400] eugenmayer: Hello. I have something odd happening. i have a recipe kw-monitoring:monit-openoffice which is deployed on a client, while it is not in the run-list of the client, nor in one of the roles.
[2014-05-17 17:58:44 -0400] eugenmayer: when i use the chef search, i find to clients with this recipe, odd enaugh. Using a search on roles, no role includes this. When i look an the direct run list of the node - not included
[2014-05-17 17:59:13 -0400] eugenmayer: i now just even delete the recipe form the repo - now i cant even run chef because "the recipe is missin"
[2014-05-17 17:59:21 -0400] eugenmayer: Any ideas how to simply get rid of it?
[2014-05-17 18:04:33 -0400] eugenmayer: knife node edit .. and searching..no hit.
[2014-05-17 18:05:07 -0400] eugenmayer: same for the roles. Pretty helpless right now ;/
[2014-05-17 18:10:07 -0400] eugenmayer: removin /var/cache/chef/cookbooks on the client didnt help either
[2014-05-17 18:26:37 -0400] eugenmayer: *solved*
[2014-05-17 18:47:08 -0400] xeno: Sorry if this sounds pedantic, but the wording to doc.opscode.com/install_server.html seems to imply you cannot imply server except for OS named by package manager.  I only see Ubuntu,
[2014-05-17 18:48:13 -0400] xeno: and I want to install on Debian.  From another reference, I presume it is okay to install the Ubuntu one on Debian.  If I am wrong in this extrapolation, I would appreciate being helpfully corrected.
[2014-05-17 19:38:03 -0400] xeno: http://pastebin.com/FFPNvgfN
[2014-05-17 19:38:32 -0400] xeno: I'm afraid this may indicate I cannot install chef server available for Ubuntu on Debian.  Please advise.
[2014-05-17 19:38:51 -0400] a13x212: where would i get support for hosted chef?
[2014-05-17 20:34:35 -0400] xeno: I am still looking for further explanation about "omnibus" and installations.  It appears the curl command install from the install_omnibus.html page is only for client installs.
[2014-05-17 20:35:19 -0400] xeno: On the other hand, there is an install on www.getchef.com/chef/install which indicates server, but only has server install for up to Ubuntu 12.10.
[2014-05-17 20:35:38 -0400] xeno: I cannot seem to find other resources.  Please advise.
[2014-05-17 20:39:13 -0400] xeno: And, furthermore, that address appears to have stopped functioning from my location.  What's with that?
[2014-05-17 20:39:35 -0400] xeno: (the omnibus install at opscode)
[2014-05-17 20:42:51 -0400] xeno: This is sure a dead group.
[2014-05-17 20:52:12 -0400] xeno: So it appears that, despite the sudo in the installer command, the sequence won't complete for me without it running on root.
[2014-05-17 20:52:39 -0400] xeno: However, I got it that way.  Please let me know if you want more information on this.
[2014-05-17 20:58:50 -0400] xeno: This is the failure I get with dpkg -i

[2014-05-17 21:00:18 -0400] eugenmayer: xeno: iam running chef 10.x on a debian squeeze, since we only have squeeze server. I really understand you want to avoid ubuntu, thats what i also usually do. retroperpective, i would not chose debian for chef once again.
[2014-05-17 21:00:47 -0400] xeno: Thank you eugenmayer.
[2014-05-17 21:00:59 -0400] xeno: I am sorry I am sometimes bad at responding quickly.
[2014-05-17 21:01:19 -0400] eugenmayer: you responded instantly? :)
[2014-05-17 21:01:21 -0400] xeno: So I am now trying the install on ubuntu, but it is 14.04.
[2014-05-17 21:01:44 -0400] xeno: Well, not earlier.  I just missed it, and was trying to get past too many blockages to notice.
[2014-05-17 21:01:49 -0400] xeno: Anyway, I now have 14.04.
[2014-05-17 21:02:07 -0400] xeno: Is that Ubuntu just not supported presently?
[2014-05-17 21:03:38 -0400] xeno2: Here is my checksum:  dc91ed1d798d78c76517eeeb0ced72f5  chef_11.12.4-1_amd64.deb
[2014-05-17 21:05:31 -0400] eugenmayer: http://www.getchef.com/chef/install/ you used this?
[2014-05-17 21:05:46 -0400] xeno: eugenmayer:  I don't see any debian server available for chef.
[2014-05-17 21:05:48 -0400] xeno: Yes.
[2014-05-17 21:05:54 -0400] eugenmayer: since, as you see, the latest version ist 12.10, and you should use 12.04 LTS
[2014-05-17 21:06:06 -0400] eugenmayer: it is not officially supported and hackish using debian.
[2014-05-17 21:06:44 -0400] xeno: Ok, so I really need an Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10 install.   That's rough.
[2014-05-17 21:08:38 -0400] eugenmayer: 64 only
[2014-05-17 21:08:43 -0400] eugenmayer: *bit

[2014-05-17 21:09:57 -0400] xeno: Okay, I have the iso download started.  I'll read that, and I need a break.  I appreciate your help eugenmayer.
[2014-05-17 21:10:08 -0400] eugenmayer: yw
[2014-05-17 21:13:17 -0400] xeno: Say, wait.  The omnibus install appears to work.  I may just be not seeing the correct next step...
[2014-05-17 21:23:10 -0400] coderanger: xeno2: The package should probably work, but its not tested
[2014-05-17 21:23:24 -0400] coderanger: xeno2: I would highly recommend using a supported platform
[2014-05-17 21:23:41 -0400] xeno: Okay, I am making a 12.04 vm right now to try that.
[2014-05-17 21:24:31 -0400] xeno: I really want to do something locally right now.  Looks like most people are just playing with cloud resources, but I want a system programmer perspective on it.
[2014-05-17 21:24:58 -0400] coderanger: xeno: If you are just trying out chef locally, you can use chef-zero
[2014-05-17 21:25:42 -0400] xeno: I know, but I think I'd like to see it cross two bridged vms so I can immediately extrapolate it to real work I have.
[2014-05-17 21:26:34 -0400] coderanger: Not sure what you mean, you can run zero just like you would chef-server
[2014-05-17 21:26:38 -0400] coderanger: its just much easier to setup
[2014-05-17 21:27:56 -0400] xeno: Yes, well, the setup is part of what I want to know about.
[2014-05-17 21:28:32 -0400] coderanger: Ahh, okay :-)
[2014-05-17 21:28:43 -0400] coderanger: It is fortunately pretty much just "install package"
[2014-05-17 21:28:58 -0400] fayesal: coderanger: thanks for the pointer yesterday, that was exactly my problem (re: berks version)
[2014-05-17 21:29:02 -0400] xeno: Well, maybe that's not what I mean.
[2014-05-17 21:29:53 -0400] xeno: Not that I claim to be smart enough to actually know what I mean.
[2014-05-17 21:32:16 -0400] xeno: Thank you for you kind patience, coderanger.
