[2014-05-04 08:23:49 -0400] i42n_: Hey, I want to use https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/database for my rails app. How can I configure it together with vagrant / chef-solo? I do not know where to put the examples shown for database creation on https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/database my current vagrantfile looks like this: https://gist.github.com/i42n/c744a4d28030fef5b334
[2014-05-04 08:54:04 -0400] aujt74: i42n_: You would need to create a cookbook yourself to setup your rails app. You could then move most/all of the add_recipe lines there into the cookbook as dependencies and include_recipe them there - you would probably have a few recipes in your cookbook for installing your stack, rvm, nginx, postgres etc. The examples for database creation would then also go into a recipe of your cookbook.
[2014-05-04 08:55:52 -0400] aujt74: Your runlist in your Vagrantfile could then just be chef.add_recipe "mycookbook". You are essentially creating what is known as an "application cookbook"
[2014-05-04 09:12:59 -0400] i42n_: aujt74: I have got this recipe in a new cookbook: https://gist.github.com/i42n/4711adbd965429677aff Runs through provisioning fine. However I still can not connect as this new user ot the DB.
[2014-05-04 09:13:06 -0400] i42n_: error log see also gist
[2014-05-04 09:17:50 -0400] i42n_: aujt74: works now. I had to create the rails user in the vm
[2014-05-04 09:41:53 -0400] luddite: How can i replace a single item in an attribute that I revieve from a databag :: This is what i use to display the dev svn project path : opts['dev']['svn']['project-path']
[2014-05-04 09:42:20 -0400] luddite: But if i wanted to replace dev with the environment attribute  "node.chef_environment"
[2014-05-04 09:42:55 -0400] luddite: I tried this :: opts[' + node.chef_environment + ']['svn']['project-path'] but it fails
[2014-05-04 09:42:59 -0400] luddite: any ideas?
[2014-05-04 10:04:53 -0400] aujt74: luddite: opts[node.chef_environment]['svn']['project-path'] or opts["#{node.chef_environment}"]['svn']['project-path'] ?
[2014-05-04 10:05:57 -0400] luddite: aujt74 - thanks illo try that now
[2014-05-04 10:06:08 -0400] luddite: illo = i'll
[2014-05-04 10:14:15 -0400] luddite: aujt74 :: Thank-you. opts["#{node.chef_environment}"]['svn']['project-path'] was the one that i needed.
[2014-05-04 10:14:43 -0400] luddite: the first option spat out an error.

[2014-05-04 21:27:55 -0400] fourthace: https://gist.github.com/4thAce/64270d307222409d13b1
[2014-05-04 21:28:35 -0400] fourthace: I updated my gems and did bundle install, still the same
[2014-05-04 22:15:14 -0400] Scrivener: Would anyone be willing to help me understand what this cookbook is doing to generate its files from templates? https://github.com/aws/opsworks-cookbooks/tree/release-chef-11.4/nginx
[2014-05-04 22:15:30 -0400] Scrivener: Because the generated file doesn't look anything like any of the templates in it.
[2014-05-04 22:15:31 -0400] coderanger: Scrivener: What do you mean?
[2014-05-04 22:16:18 -0400] Scrivener: coderanger, well, it might take a little while as I'm not very familiar with what I'm doing, but I don't understand what exactly is being sourced (and in what way) to construct the configuration file it outputs when I deploy an application on Opsworks.
[2014-05-04 22:16:54 -0400] coderanger: Scrivener: You write out templates use a template resource inside a recipe or similar
[2014-05-04 22:17:43 -0400] Scrivener: https://github.com/aws/opsworks-cookbooks/blob/release-chef-11.4/nginx/definitions/nginx_web_app.rb coderanger, would this be responsible for constructing the configuration file from the template "site.erb"?
[2014-05-04 22:18:06 -0400] coderanger: yep
[2014-05-04 22:18:11 -0400] Scrivener: Okay, that's what I thought.
[2014-05-04 22:18:31 -0400] Scrivener: Thing is, there are things in the generated template that don't appear anywhere within this entire cookbook (grep -R'd for some lines).
[2014-05-04 22:18:45 -0400] Scrivener: And there are large portions of the site.erb's configuration missing entirely.
[2014-05-04 22:19:23 -0400] Scrivener: I'm really pretty new to all of this, so I'm trying to step through and figure out where everything is getting pulled from.
[2014-05-04 22:19:40 -0400] Scrivener: If it would help for you to have a comparison, I can paste them.
[2014-05-04 22:19:54 -0400] Scrivener: What's in site.erb vs. what it outputs on deployment.
[2014-05-04 22:20:12 -0400] coderanger: Sure
[2014-05-04 22:20:18 -0400] Scrivener: Alright, I'll PM them.
