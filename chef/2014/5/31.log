[2014-05-31 03:39:03 -0400] TrinitronX: Seeing some weirdness with the version of test-kitchen in the ChefDK ... any VMs it creates with virtualbox were hidden
[2014-05-31 03:39:35 -0400] TrinitronX: turns out they were in /private/var/root/VirtualBox VMs/
[2014-05-31 03:39:46 -0400] TrinitronX: it was running vagrant as root
[2014-05-31 03:40:10 -0400] TrinitronX: [kitchen::driver::vagrant command] BEGIN (sudo -E vagrant up --no-provision --provider=virtualbox)
[2014-05-31 03:59:36 -0400] star_unicorn089: Hello. I have a issue with SPICEWEASEL insisting that I have certificates setup up on my Chef-Server when it starts uploading cooksbooks via Berkshelf. So I pass the option --no-ssl-verify. It still insist on certicates. Is this a bug?
[2014-05-31 04:02:18 -0400] coderanger: star_unicorn089: Please please please use real certs
[2014-05-31 04:02:26 -0400] coderanger: star_unicorn089: Run your own CA if you must, but use real certs
[2014-05-31 04:23:06 -0400] TrinitronX: I think I fixed my test-kitchen issue... The Solution:  Removed "use_sudo: true" from "driver_config" section of .kitchen.local.yml
[2014-05-31 04:24:04 -0400] TrinitronX: (had a local kitchen config for docker, but docker was commented out so test-kitchen was using kitchen-vagrant driver)
[2014-05-31 04:47:16 -0400] TrinitronX: @coderanger:  I'm going to take your advice to use a custom cert for Chef Server
[2014-05-31 04:48:15 -0400] coderanger: TrinitronX: Unverifed TLS should be considered an active security threat at this point
[2014-05-31 04:50:43 -0400] TrinitronX: @coderanger: Agreed
[2014-05-31 06:38:05 -0400] fveillette: Hi all. i have a code logic issue in chef and i looking for help
[2014-05-31 06:39:29 -0400] fveillette: i dowload a file with cookbook file and after that i do a md5 hash of the file and i compare it to an other one. If they are not the same i trigger an action after. the problem is that evaluation of the md5 hash seem to happen before the remote_file download
[2014-05-31 06:39:34 -0400] fveillette: how can i address that
[2014-05-31 06:55:02 -0400] TrinitronX: @fveillette:  Why don't you just get a known md5 sum and use it as 'checksum' in the 'remote_file' resource?
[2014-05-31 08:52:58 -0400] _jab_: ah, a remote_* question. I also have one:
[2014-05-31 08:53:24 -0400] _jab_: It seems that remote_directory dereferences files from within the directory to be copied.
[2014-05-31 08:54:27 -0400] _jab_: see error at http://pastebin.com/aJ4vNGpb
[2014-05-31 09:03:23 -0400] _jab_: mymistake - the directory name with space causes remote_directory to hickup.
[2014-05-31 19:34:00 -0400] sarkis: anyone look at using consul alongside chef?
[2014-05-31 19:59:34 -0400] iiro: sarkis, nope, but sounds interesting software...
[2014-05-31 21:28:54 -0400] EricL: Anyone have any experience with adding resources using the Poise cookbook?
[2014-05-31 21:30:57 -0400] coderanger: EricL: I might :)
[2014-05-31 21:34:11 -0400] EricL: coderanger: I was hoping you were lurking.
[2014-05-31 21:34:31 -0400] coderanger: Always
[2014-05-31 21:34:45 -0400] EricL: I have been messing with the code you gave me yesterday to run the recipe, but for some reason, I keep getting the following error and the recipe doesnt' run.
[2014-05-31 21:35:06 -0400] EricL: http://pastie.org/9244405
[2014-05-31 21:36:17 -0400] EricL: I'm wondering if it has something to do with the fact that the Provider already has an include_recipe and it doesn't like me including another one.
[2014-05-31 21:36:37 -0400] EricL: I tried adding the converge_cy and notifying_block and still get the same error.
[2014-05-31 21:36:58 -0400] coderanger: EricL: Your chef is tool old, you need at least 11.6 to use Poise
[2014-05-31 21:37:27 -0400] EricL: Ah, so there really is no way for me to do what I want to do.
[2014-05-31 21:37:57 -0400] EricL: I really just want to run a recipe if deploy_revision runs and deploys a new revision.
[2014-05-31 21:38:45 -0400] coderanger: EricL: Not sure what you mean, just upgrade chef-client
[2014-05-31 21:39:05 -0400] coderanger: EricL: You really need to upgrade for heartbleed if nothing else, your current chef version is actively dangerous
[2014-05-31 21:39:43 -0400] EricL: Seems like upgrading is a big deal, especially if something goes wrong and our current setup doesn't work properly.
[2014-05-31 21:40:20 -0400] coderanger: EricL: Technically true, but you really have no choice thanks to heartbleed
[2014-05-31 21:40:57 -0400] EricL: Is there any other way to do what I am trying to do so I can at least get done this project and then I can work on upgrading?
[2014-05-31 21:41:20 -0400] coderanger: EricL: You can copy-pasta the code out of Poise, but I really don't recommend that
[2014-05-31 21:41:39 -0400] coderanger: Or you can just remove the lazy eval lib file
[2014-05-31 21:41:40 -0400] EricL: Yea, that's always a bad idea.
[2014-05-31 21:41:59 -0400] EricL: Let me try that.
[2014-05-31 21:42:01 -0400] coderanger: https://github.com/poise/poise/blob/master/libraries/lazy_default.rb
[2014-05-31 21:42:05 -0400] coderanger: Comment out that whole file
[2014-05-31 21:44:54 -0400] EricL: Then I also have to comment out the "include LazyDefault" in the other files, no?
[2014-05-31 21:45:04 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, that too
[2014-05-31 21:45:29 -0400] coderanger: A somewhat less invasive soln is just comment out the set_or_return override
[2014-05-31 21:49:38 -0400] EricL: Ok, that did it.  At least now it's running the recipe.
[2014-05-31 21:49:53 -0400] EricL: Commenting out the set_or_return method and leaving the super() in there allowed it to run.
[2014-05-31 21:50:16 -0400] coderanger: EricL: With just the super it is a noop, so it should be the same either way :)
[2014-05-31 21:51:25 -0400] EricL: That was the goal
[2014-05-31 21:54:18 -0400] EricL: Now it's just a matter of getting the recipe to work.
[2014-05-31 22:01:02 -0400] EricL: I'm going to hack on this recipe.  Thanks for the help coderanger.
[2014-05-31 22:45:33 -0400] grepory: is it considered bad form to go around modifying the chef DSL for your internal cookbooks? e.g. replacing data_bag_item with something a bit more useful that makes sense to your workflow?
[2014-05-31 22:45:49 -0400] grepory: (while maintaining the original contract)
[2014-05-31 22:46:38 -0400] grepory: e.g. replacing data_bag and data_bag_item with new wrappers around Chef::DataBagItem that take care of encrypted databags for me
[2014-05-31 22:47:32 -0400] grepory: Right now I'm keeping these kinds of things in their own namespace, but was considering moving them into Chef::Recipe so that people can simply depend on my library cookbook to use the functionality.
[2014-05-31 22:47:48 -0400] coderanger: grepory: Yes, just make a new method
[2014-05-31 22:48:06 -0400] coderanger: grepory: Unless you can match existing semantics, you'll break all other cookbooks
[2014-05-31 22:48:34 -0400] grepory: coderanger: it would adhere to the original contract and include regression tests.
[2014-05-31 22:48:51 -0400] coderanger: grepory: Sure, then go for it :)
[2014-05-31 22:49:00 -0400] coderanger: grepory: You can also do it on a single-recipe basis
[2014-05-31 22:49:05 -0400] grepory: coderanger: i'm only _sort of_ crazy.
[2014-05-31 22:49:11 -0400] grepory: coderanger: that is another thing i've been considering.
[2014-05-31 22:49:29 -0400] grepory: coderanger: provide a helper method for inserting my helpers into the current recipe's namespace
[2014-05-31 22:49:46 -0400] coderanger: grepory: Just put your method in a module and use #extend
[2014-05-31 22:50:09 -0400] grepory: coderanger: does extend work differently than include?
[2014-05-31 22:50:42 -0400] grepory: wrt overrides. i have only tried this once before w/ include and crazy instance_method shenanigans.
[2014-05-31 22:50:58 -0400] coderanger: grepory: Yes
[2014-05-31 22:51:12 -0400] grepory: coderanger: yup. just read about it. hah. extend is what i should have been doing before.
[2014-05-31 22:53:07 -0400] grepory: i think this is what i'll probably end up doing... i kind of like the idea of people deliberately using the helpers as opposed to unknowingly using them.... so that if there is a problem, they look in the right place first.
[2014-05-31 22:53:28 -0400] grepory: i like the idea of the convenience, but convenience at the cost of clarity is a poor tradeoff in this case, imo.
[2014-05-31 22:53:57 -0400] grepory: so extend to override and then you're done updating your recipe. is not so bad.
[2014-05-31 22:54:22 -0400] grepory: coderanger: thanks :)
[2014-05-31 22:54:50 -0400] coderanger: grepory: No prob
