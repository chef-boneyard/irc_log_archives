[2014-05-03 00:01:27 -0400] dtrott: I am looking at the http_request resource, is there any way to get the result returned from the request (at the moment the request returns a single string and I just need the whole value - I dont need to parse it).
[2014-05-03 00:01:49 -0400] coderanger: dtrott: No, use Chef::HTTP directly
[2014-05-03 00:02:07 -0400] coderanger: resources don't have return values, they are declarations of converged state
[2014-05-03 00:02:36 -0400] dtrott: K, thank you.
[2014-05-03 00:06:56 -0400] sauraus: How can I 'log' the value of "kernel['machine'] ?
[2014-05-03 00:10:02 -0400] coderanger: sauraus: log node['kernel']['machine']
[2014-05-03 00:10:39 -0400] sauraus: Interesting, how come the java cookbook can work with this code: default['java']['arch'] = kernel['machine'] =~ /x86_64/ ? "x86_64" : "i586"
[2014-05-03 00:11:00 -0400] sauraus: Shouldn't that be node['kernel']['machine'] =~ .......
[2014-05-03 00:11:05 -0400] coderanger: sauraus: Poor life choices
[2014-05-03 00:11:22 -0400] coderanger: Its due to some old fallback systems, just ignore it
[2014-05-03 00:11:36 -0400] sauraus: moved to /dev/null ;)
[2014-05-03 00:13:02 -0400] sauraus: Any plans to extend the JAVA cookbook to support MAC OS? Looks like it would be quiet involved as the cookbook right now is built up around openjdk vs. oracle jdk
[2014-05-03 00:13:32 -0400] coderanger: sauraus: Not likely, mac usage is pretty minimal and its easier to make single-purpose stuff usually
[2014-05-03 00:13:44 -0400] sauraus: That makes sense :)
[2014-05-03 00:14:04 -0400] coderanger: Also just because I must, neither Java nor Mac OS are acronyms
[2014-05-03 00:27:23 -0400] luddite: Hi all - Im going nuts with svn+ssh checkout. I can perform a passwordless checkout from cmd line but chef prompts a password.
[2014-05-03 01:39:37 -0400] dtrott: Is there a way to deterime how a recipe is getting into the list of recpies, specifically what path is being taken through roles and includes that is bringing it into the list.
[2014-05-03 01:40:07 -0400] jameson__: i don't believe berkshelf shows that atm
[2014-05-03 01:44:42 -0400] coderanger: dtrott: If you use enterprise chef, the web ui has a nice, interactive tree view for that
[2014-05-03 01:45:00 -0400] dtrott: Cool I do and I shall, thanks
[2014-05-03 01:45:01 -0400] coderanger: dtrott: Otherwise, not really aside from doing the expansion manually
[2014-05-03 02:57:45 -0400] IWentOutside: Anyone here familiar with test-kitchen? For some reason it's hanging up SSH auth method: private key although converge still works.
[2014-05-03 02:59:29 -0400] IWentOutside: I'm even converging right now while it's waiting on that status.
[2014-05-03 06:39:21 -0400] root3: after using ansible, I don't know why somebody ever need puppet /chef
[2014-05-03 06:47:07 -0400] dtrott: root3: A fairly detailed review of 4 compeditive orchestration tools: http://www.infoworld.com/d/data-center/review-puppet-vs-chef-vs-ansible-vs-salt-231308?page=0,0
[2014-05-03 08:40:36 -0400] dtrott: Is there a good way to check if a new version of an RPM is available and if so:   Stop a service, install the RPM then restart the service ?  (note: the critical point is the stop I know I can use a notify/restart after the RPM is installed but I want the service stopped while the RPM is installed).
[2014-05-03 08:52:31 -0400] aujt74: dtrott: How about the package :upgrade action? http://docs.opscode.com/resource_package.html. If there was a new version, Chef would install the upgraded package via your package manager, whcih would restart the service (if the package restarts the service as a postinst action at least)
[2014-05-03 08:53:18 -0400] dtrott: aujt74: The point is that would not stop the service before trying to install the RPM.
[2014-05-03 08:53:58 -0400] aujt74: Ok, but why do you need to stop the service beforehand?
[2014-05-03 08:54:54 -0400] dtrott: The service has issues if the files get moved around while its still running.
[2014-05-03 08:57:08 -0400] luddite: i wish glennpratt would either disconnect permanently or stay connected permenently
[2014-05-03 08:57:15 -0400] digitalchild: just ignore him?
[2014-05-03 08:57:19 -0400] luddite: how
[2014-05-03 08:57:28 -0400] digitalchild: with /ignore his host?
[2014-05-03 08:57:33 -0400] luddite: cool - thanks
[2014-05-03 08:57:48 -0400] digitalchild: or turn of join/quit notices
[2014-05-03 09:00:13 -0400] luddite: digitalchild - thanks
[2014-05-03 09:00:18 -0400] luddite: that works
[2014-05-03 09:00:25 -0400] digitalchild: np
[2014-05-03 09:01:00 -0400] luddite: has anyone here had any luck with ssh wrapper and subversion?
[2014-05-03 10:09:42 -0400] glen: hey, i have built and installed chef-server from source at some point chef-server-11.0.8+20130618223354.git.14.1853585-1.pld.3.0.x86_64.rpm
[2014-05-03 10:09:54 -0400] glen: i would like to rebuild at least for the hearbleed problem
[2014-05-03 10:10:09 -0400] glen: but that old version does not build annymore, missing urls, outdated md5s
[2014-05-03 10:10:28 -0400] glen: also i'm not sure whether just rebuild would even use different openssl version, i believe it will not
[2014-05-03 10:11:36 -0400] glen: so, i should perhaps checkout different version of omnibus-chef-server git? currently i tried "11.0.8" tag
[2014-05-03 10:12:08 -0400] glen: but newer tags are betas...
[2014-05-03 18:46:20 -0400] sarkis_: is there a chef cookbook naming standard?
[2014-05-03 18:46:24 -0400] sarkis_: like chef-XXXX
[2014-05-03 18:51:31 -0400] double_p: why even chef-?
[2014-05-03 18:52:41 -0400] pipework: ^
[2014-05-03 18:53:43 -0400] double_p: sarkis_: there's no universe, so...
[2014-05-03 18:55:01 -0400] sarkis_: just wondering if theres a standard naming scheme
[2014-05-03 18:55:33 -0400] double_p: no, everyone pollutes until it becomes a problem
[2014-05-03 18:59:53 -0400] sarkis: ok actually that helped me.. ill name our internal chef-<company-name>-<cookbook-name>
[2014-05-03 19:00:03 -0400] regork: Hi all, any idea why an attribute would not be available in an ohai_plugin?
[2014-05-03 19:00:38 -0400] sarkis: regork: paste the relevant code, that is hard to answer :(
[2014-05-03 19:00:39 -0400] regork: Just checking for 'os' does not show anything in the namespace
[2014-05-03 19:02:12 -0400] regork: It's in the beginning of the plugin: if os == 'windows'....
[2014-05-03 19:02:46 -0400] pipework: sarkis: I probably wouldn't use a library with a company's name after it unless the chef cookbook is used for deploying a product that the company puts out.
[2014-05-03 19:04:36 -0400] regork: sarkis: Does something need to be imported? I had to use RUBY_PLATFORM to find out whether it's a Linux or Windows VM
[2014-05-03 19:40:28 -0400] roramirez: Hello
[2014-05-03 19:42:34 -0400] jtran: anyone know what search query i can use to find out which node has an ip address '172.29.11.11' , on any interface?
[2014-05-03 19:42:36 -0400] roramirez: i have a recipe with Chef for Vagrant. Is possible apply to recipe to not vm?
[2014-05-03 19:55:43 -0400] chip-: jtran: Only keys are indexed, not values, so you can't just search for "*:172.29.11.11".
[2014-05-03 19:55:55 -0400] jtran: :(
[2014-05-03 19:55:57 -0400] chip-: Probably have to look for ipaddress:172.29.11.11, and then expand out to interface names and do multiple queries.
[2014-05-03 19:56:09 -0400] jtran: kk thx chip-
[2014-05-03 19:56:25 -0400] chip-: knife search node 'ipaddress:172.29.11.11' should be a start.
[2014-05-03 19:56:57 -0400] jtran: chip-:   what if i iknow the exact int name it should be on.    search node 'ipaddress_bond1.2001:172.29.11.11'  assuming i have the network_plugin for ahi?
[2014-05-03 19:56:59 -0400] jtran: ohai
[2014-05-03 19:57:41 -0400] jtran: ya that seemed to work.  thx chip!
