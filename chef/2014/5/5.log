[2014-05-05 01:13:30 -0400] robawt: chef's channel is very much a M-F channel
[2014-05-05 01:21:33 -0400] digitalchild: robawt: well chef using it for work, that would kinda make sense no?
[2014-05-05 01:28:30 -0400] robawt: digitalchild: play too
[2014-05-05 01:28:44 -0400] robawt: you're never going to get ahead only trying 9-5
[2014-05-05 01:35:20 -0400] digitalchild: robawt: play during work hours :)
[2014-05-05 01:50:52 -0400] robawt: haha digitalchild
[2014-05-05 04:27:19 -0400] kristianpaul: jkess: https://github.com/opscode/chef-metal-lxc/blob/master/test/cookbooks/lxctests/recipes/simple.rb#L6 <-- is that last line actually required?
[2014-05-05 04:27:43 -0400] kristianpaul: It seems deleting it, finally got to run the chef-metal-lxc test
[2014-05-05 06:50:56 -0400] ignatz: hrm, hosted chef blowing up with a 404
[2014-05-05 06:51:34 -0400] ignatz: aha! missing THINGY
[2014-05-05 08:27:18 -0400] legal90: Hi, chefs! Please, give me an advice: how can I detect (in recipe) that specified data bag is encrypted or not?
[2014-05-05 08:47:37 -0400] Zhann: how do you search with knife for servers with a certain attribute with underscore? ie: node[:is_slave] -> knife node search 'is_slave:true' doesnt work as this will search for node[:is][:slave]
[2014-05-05 09:47:13 -0400] Zhann: anyone? :(
[2014-05-05 10:02:32 -0400] diginux_: Zhann: did you try knife node search 'is\_slave:true' ?
[2014-05-05 10:17:40 -0400] Zhann: diginux_: I have, did not work
[2014-05-05 10:26:50 -0400] laurent\: Zhann: search is_slave:true should also work
[2014-05-05 10:35:24 -0400] Zhann: I feel like an idiot. it does. I miss-typed my attributes
[2014-05-05 10:35:28 -0400] Zhann: thank you laurent\
[2014-05-05 10:35:50 -0400] laurent\: :)
[2014-05-05 10:39:48 -0400] arir: Is there a way to do attribute isolation, so that only part of the attributes/default.rb would be taken into use? A bit similar way as using case statement for platforms, but in this case based on run_list.
[2014-05-05 10:59:13 -0400] erthad: hiall
[2014-05-05 11:00:02 -0400] erthad: is there a way to remove element from an array using Chef::Mixin::DeepMerge now?
[2014-05-05 11:08:21 -0400] Zhann: arir: sure .. is this what you're looking for? if node.recipes.include? 'whatever'
[2014-05-05 11:18:15 -0400] fretb: !whereis sandbox-001
[2014-05-05 11:18:20 -0400] arir: Zhann: thanks, i'll try it out
[2014-05-05 12:04:55 -0400] shay-: hi, I want to update my clamav installation which consists out of 3 rpms. If I load it with rpm -Uhv <package1>; rpm -Uhv <package2>, I get dependency errors (same with package ressource of course). I have to install them with one command rpm -Uhv <package1> <package2> <package3>. How can I do that in my recipe?
[2014-05-05 12:31:47 -0400] woland: hi. i'm having problems with knife appending @hostname twice, e.g. root@slave@slave # slave being the hostname
[2014-05-05 12:36:46 -0400] fourthace: Hi. Has anyone seen where knife gives unintialized constant Chef::Knife::Core::MultiAttributeReturnOption (NameError)? https://gist.github.com/4thAce/64270d307222409d13b1
[2014-05-05 12:37:14 -0400] fourthace: Started happening when I upgraded to ubuntu 14.04
[2014-05-05 13:01:08 -0400] allaire: Anybody know what would cause this? https://github.com/gofullstack/backup-cookbook/issues/18
[2014-05-05 13:01:26 -0400] allaire: Here's the provider in question: https://github.com/gofullstack/backup-cookbook/blob/master/providers/model.rb#L26-L31
[2014-05-05 13:21:35 -0400] NukePuppy: whats best way to bulk edit node's environments? like change from envA to envB?
[2014-05-05 13:22:34 -0400] mjuszczak: If I want chef server to use a different hostname than what's on the box, can I temporarily change the hostname of the box, run chef-server-ctl reconfigure, then change it back?  Or is the better way to update the config files?
[2014-05-05 13:24:41 -0400] iiro: there is a knife plugin for a job changing the envs but havent tested it yet...
[2014-05-05 13:25:22 -0400] iiro: http://docs.opscode.com/community_plugin_knife.html - knife-bulk-change-environment
[2014-05-05 13:25:50 -0400] iiro: and I guess knife-flip is another. Need to test stuff before...
[2014-05-05 13:26:03 -0400] iiro: if anyone heres using those - please recommend :)
[2014-05-05 13:28:00 -0400] NukePuppy: i found this : knife exec -E 'nodes.transform("chef_environment:testing") { |n| n.chef_environment("production") }'
[2014-05-05 13:28:06 -0400] NukePuppy: works for what i needed.. thanks
[2014-05-05 13:28:58 -0400] NukePuppy: though knife flip sounds like a good option if you have a specific set of nodes
[2014-05-05 13:29:41 -0400] jpr_: NukePuppy: knife flip plugin maybe

[2014-05-05 14:47:30 -0400] mondo: Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong when trying to override default attributes with a wrapper cookbook?  I have the Opscode maven cookbook from here: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/maven  (never mind that this has been updated to install 3.1.1 by default)
[2014-05-05 14:47:47 -0400] mondo: I have a wrapper cookbook called cook-maven and a recipe called 3.1.1.rb that install 3.1.1
[2014-05-05 14:48:01 -0400] mondo: it looks like this: https://gist.github.com/andrewfraley/3e2fa636ecc83f52e5d1
[2014-05-05 14:48:20 -0400] mondo: my node looks like "recipe[cook-maven::3.1.1]"
[2014-05-05 14:49:26 -0400] mondo: When the maven cookbook executes, node['maven]['3']['version'] is correct, however, notice how the URL is built in maven/recipies/default.rb
[2014-05-05 14:49:28 -0400] mondo: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/maven/blob/master/attributes/default.rb
[2014-05-05 14:50:03 -0400] mondo: The URL being built has the default version of 3.1.0 (sorry they updated the recipe, pretend I'm trying to install 3.1.2 or something)
[2014-05-05 14:51:21 -0400] mondo: I guess I can just also override the URL in my wrapper cookbook, but is there a better way?
[2014-05-05 14:55:40 -0400] stormerider: question about ohai and IAM roles. if a role isnt assigned to an instance, then Ohai wont comprimise the key, because it wont be listed in the instance metadata, correct?
[2014-05-05 15:36:19 -0400] mmzyk: Hi all. Im the Chef engineer leading the next open source server release, 11.1.
[2014-05-05 15:36:36 -0400] mmzyk: Were working to have it out this week.
[2014-05-05 15:36:46 -0400] prometheanfire: colbeansyo
[2014-05-05 15:37:06 -0400] mmzyk: We realize its been a long time coming. I was around some last week talking about it, but if you missed it Ill be around.
[2014-05-05 15:37:53 -0400] mmzyk: Heres the changelog that documents what is in it: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef-server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
[2014-05-05 15:38:05 -0400] cwj: mondo: you'll need to set the url attribute in your wrapper cookbook as well. computing attribute values using other attributes is a terrible pattern.
[2014-05-05 15:38:12 -0400] prometheanfire: nice
[2014-05-05 15:38:13 -0400] mmzyk: The feature set is stable at this point, were just working on ironing out some bugs.
[2014-05-05 15:38:37 -0400] prometheanfire: mmzyk: that's oxymoronic :P it's stable, but has bugs :P:P:P
[2014-05-05 15:38:55 -0400] mmzyk: Feature set is stable. :)
[2014-05-05 15:39:20 -0400] prometheanfire: yaya, poking holes, ruining my world :D
[2014-05-05 15:39:36 -0400] mmzyk: The server itself is actually stable, we just trying to make sure the upgrade command works as expected.
[2014-05-05 15:39:56 -0400] mmzyk: And there is one webui bug Im trying to track down. But thats all I know of at this point.
[2014-05-05 15:40:07 -0400] mmzyk: We hope to have an RC out in the next day or two.
[2014-05-05 15:40:14 -0400] mmzyk: Release by the end of the week.
[2014-05-05 15:40:40 -0400] mmzyk: Nightlies are available via the omnitruck api (they are tagged 11.1.0-beta + timestamp)
[2014-05-05 15:41:00 -0400] mmzyk: http://docs.opscode.com/api_omnitruck.html
[2014-05-05 15:41:42 -0400] mmzyk: In fact, all builds we do of the open source chef server end up in the public s3 repo the omnitruck api pulls from, so if youre ever feeling adventurous you can always install a nightly.
[2014-05-05 15:42:14 -0400] mmzyk: If anyone has any specific question regarding the release, Ill do my best to answer.
[2014-05-05 15:49:38 -0400] mmzyk: So lets talk about highlights of the open source server 11.1 release: main features are full IPv6 support (all components of the server now speak IPv6, but the default is still IPv4)
[2014-05-05 15:49:55 -0400] mmzyk: There is the new upgrade command to try and make upgrades easier
[2014-05-05 15:50:21 -0400] mmzyk: The depsolver moves back to gecode from the erlang one, which turned out to not be powerful enough for everyones needs.
[2014-05-05 15:50:42 -0400] mmzyk: This also unifies the depsolver across all versions of Chef + Berkshelf (as of v3)
[2014-05-05 15:51:10 -0400] mmzyk: So the pain of difference cookbook dependency resolution should be eliminated.
[2014-05-05 15:51:46 -0400] mmzyk: There is also proxy support via some new bookshelf settings so clients can sit on one side of a proxy and the chef-server on the other.
[2014-05-05 15:52:00 -0400] mmzyk: A lot of bug fixes, of course.
[2014-05-05 15:52:28 -0400] mmzyk: That hits the highlights.
[2014-05-05 15:53:41 -0400] jidar: mmzyk: do you think the 11.1 release will make upgrades easier? I wonder if it could be a more CD sort of thing?
[2014-05-05 15:53:54 -0400] jidar: or it being open source will still always be a bit of a process to make it go
[2014-05-05 15:55:13 -0400] mmzyk: The entire point of the chef-server-ctl upgrade command is to make them easier. GIve you one command, you run it, your done (backups still recommended of course).
[2014-05-05 15:55:31 -0400] yixuan: hello everyone, i got one issue, when i register rhn on rhel6.5,then run chef knife os manage to deploy, it will cause yum don't work, prompt message like: Network error: ssl handshake failure
[2014-05-05 15:55:36 -0400] yixuan: any idea how to fix it?
[2014-05-05 15:55:38 -0400] mmzyk: I wouldnt call that CD, but we do want to make upgrades easier.
[2014-05-05 15:56:38 -0400] mmzyk: If you look at the source youll notice the upgrade command is actually a series of chef-solo recipes, so theres no reason you couldnt make it more CD driven, jidar.
[2014-05-05 15:56:47 -0400] jidar: indeed
[2014-05-05 15:56:51 -0400] jidar: I was skipping the notes
[2014-05-05 15:57:32 -0400] mmzyk: We actually use chef to manage chef in the case of Hosted Chef. Its a master Chef server that deploys out and managed the servers that make up hosted chef. And that master server is deployed using chef solo.
[2014-05-05 15:57:46 -0400] mmzyk: chef all the way down.
[2014-05-05 15:57:54 -0400] jidar: speaking of, I haven't run a chef server in a while
[2014-05-05 15:58:08 -0400] jidar: all of my work has been using solo on local deploys to test stuff
[2014-05-05 15:59:24 -0400] mmzyk: Yeah, were not putting much work into solo at this point. At some point in the future it might be replaced by chef zero, but we dont have any set plans around that.
[2014-05-05 15:59:55 -0400] mmzyk: Where chef zero is the same thing as chef client in local mode. (-z flag I believe)
[2014-05-05 16:00:11 -0400] jidar: yep, except zero is all in memory right?
[2014-05-05 16:00:19 -0400] mmzyk: Yeah.
[2014-05-05 16:00:23 -0400] jidar: or at least it emulates the server component as a server
[2014-05-05 16:00:31 -0400] jidar: I haven't played with it much, was very interested when it came out
[2014-05-05 16:00:51 -0400] mmzyk: Yeah, it mimics a chef server, but all locally in memory.
[2014-05-05 16:01:09 -0400] jidar: I had alot of trouble getting the debugger working in my early days, still not sure what use it serves today
[2014-05-05 16:01:19 -0400] jidar: I don't find or hear of people dropping into it often around here
[2014-05-05 16:01:20 -0400] jidar: wonder why
[2014-05-05 16:01:36 -0400] mmzyk: what do you mean by debugger?
[2014-05-05 16:01:44 -0400] mmzyk: the chef shell?
[2014-05-05 16:01:49 -0400] jidar: yea
[2014-05-05 16:02:24 -0400] jidar: I don't know if it's just the wrapper for irb that makes it difficult to use, or what
[2014-05-05 16:02:27 -0400] mmzyk: Its not something weve stressed in the docs. I think its also confusing to new users of chef.
[2014-05-05 16:02:41 -0400] jidar: but I found myself wanting to use it alot in the early days but getting lost
[2014-05-05 16:02:58 -0400] jidar: like when you're coding, I use debuggers heavily
[2014-05-05 16:03:29 -0400] mmzyk: right. I think that workflow has been largely supplimented by the Test Kitchen workflow.
[2014-05-05 16:03:45 -0400] mmzyk: Just different ways of working, neither right or wrong.
[2014-05-05 16:03:47 -0400] jidar: does test kitchen support breakpoints?
[2014-05-05 16:03:55 -0400] jidar: in recipes I mean
[2014-05-05 16:04:02 -0400] mmzyk: I have no clue. :)
[2014-05-05 16:04:08 -0400] jidar: hahah yea, got me thinking now
[2014-05-05 16:04:20 -0400] mmzyk: Im a horrible person to ask about writing recipes and the workflow, but its not something I do on a day to day basis.
[2014-05-05 16:04:53 -0400] Neozonz|Disc2: anyone know how to get the short_name of the app in awsopsworks for a chef recipe?
[2014-05-05 16:11:57 -0400] mjuszczak: Is there a knife status command or something that tells you the current server you're pointing to?
[2014-05-05 16:13:13 -0400] mallu: good morning, I copied chef server cert to a client and edited client.rb ssl_ca_file '/etc/chef/<server_name>.crt Still getting error knife ssl check -VV -c /etc/chef/client.rb
[2014-05-05 16:13:19 -0400] mallu: am I doing this correct?
[2014-05-05 16:14:16 -0400] mallu: or do I need to get ca/root certs as well?
[2014-05-05 16:17:55 -0400] double_p: mjuszczak: grep chef_server_url ~/.chef/knife.rb? :P
[2014-05-05 16:18:38 -0400] programmerq:  /go coreos
[2014-05-05 16:18:41 -0400] programmerq: whoops
[2014-05-05 16:26:18 -0400] mallu: anyone?
[2014-05-05 16:48:34 -0400] tapH20guru: i'm starting a new chef project ... any caveats with using chef dk to get things going?
[2014-05-05 16:48:50 -0400] coderanger: tapH20guru: Not really, just make sure you add it's bin folder to your path
[2014-05-05 16:48:57 -0400] tapH20guru: kk
[2014-05-05 16:49:18 -0400] tapH20guru: <3 the idea... been using all that stuff separately anyways
[2014-05-05 16:50:19 -0400] fourthace: That ubuntu 14.04 problem I mentioned a few hours back was fixed when I removed and re-installed the chef client, bumping the version from 11.8.2-2 to 11.12.4-1
[2014-05-05 16:53:16 -0400] mjuszczak: Is it bad to have a cookbook called "base"?  Wondeing if that conflicts with anything
[2014-05-05 16:54:20 -0400] jpr: mjuszczak: we just do <org>-base
[2014-05-05 16:55:42 -0400] coderanger: +1, anything site-specific should get prefixed
[2014-05-05 16:59:34 -0400] anthonyacquanita: knife search node 'cloud_public_ips:* AND role:r-haproxy' -a  ??????
[2014-05-05 16:59:53 -0400] anthonyacquanita: logic says -a cloud_public_ips, but that no workie
[2014-05-05 17:00:17 -0400] coderanger: anthonyacquanita: You can try cloud.public_ipv4
[2014-05-05 17:00:28 -0400] coderanger: but I don't think nested attributes work there
[2014-05-05 17:00:42 -0400] anthonyacquanita: worked!
[2014-05-05 17:00:51 -0400] anthonyacquanita: thks
[2014-05-05 17:00:53 -0400] coderanger: huzzah
[2014-05-05 17:02:07 -0400] mjuszczak: jpr: So if you're naming your repos chef-<blah> in git, you'd do chef-org-base?
[2014-05-05 17:04:21 -0400] jchauncey: jtimberman: have you seen kaiser around?
[2014-05-05 17:09:33 -0400] mmzyk: jchauncey Im talking to him. Hes here now.
[2014-05-05 17:09:42 -0400] jkeiser: jchauncey: YOU GET THREE WISHES. CHOOSE CAREFULLY
[2014-05-05 17:09:48 -0400] jchauncey: OH GAWD
[2014-05-05 17:10:00 -0400] jchauncey: haha i wanted to know if mandis chefconf demo of metal was open sourced?
[2014-05-05 17:10:22 -0400] jchauncey: we are working through use cases for building vapps of docker containers using chef
[2014-05-05 17:10:44 -0400] jchauncey: there is a peice in the demo that is interesting to us and is unclear on how she actually did it
[2014-05-05 17:12:11 -0400] mjuszczak: Does knife upload only work with .json files?  I'm trying to upload .rb environments and it's not giving me any error and/or success message.
[2014-05-05 17:13:00 -0400] davidordave: I think you have to do from file on .rb files? I could be mistaken.
[2014-05-05 17:13:18 -0400] davidordave: IE knife environment from file prod.rb
[2014-05-05 17:13:31 -0400] coderanger: mjuszczak: Correct, only JSON and silent fail
[2014-05-05 17:15:55 -0400] jkeiser: jchauncey: I don't think it's been open sourced (more due to embarrassment at the state of the code we hacked up in the week prior to chefconf than anything else)
[2014-05-05 17:16:03 -0400] jchauncey: haha alright
[2014-05-05 17:16:14 -0400] jkeiser: jchauncey: let me ask Tom, who wrote a lot of it. But we can answer any questions
[2014-05-05 17:16:21 -0400] jchauncey: sure
