[2014-03-08 00:07:44 -0500] dgarstang: Maybe it's me, but it seems like citadel is trying to use something called Chef::HTTP which doesn't exist, not even in 11.10.4/
[2014-03-08 00:19:20 -0500] werdnativ: Can you set test_base_path in .kitchen.yml? I want to clean up and move test/integration into spec/integration
[2014-03-08 00:51:44 -0500] coderanger: dgarstang: So how would go about checking if that exists in 11.10.4?
[2014-03-08 01:02:20 -0500] coderanger: werdnativ: I don't think so, nor should you
[2014-03-08 01:02:24 -0500] coderanger: werdnativ: They aren't spec tests
[2014-03-08 01:02:31 -0500] coderanger: (at least not normal spec tests)
[2014-03-08 01:02:42 -0500] coderanger: werdnativ: spec/ is where chefspec stuff should go
[2014-03-08 01:03:00 -0500] werdnativ: well, they're serverspec/*_spec, so that's arguable. ;-)
[2014-03-08 01:03:28 -0500] werdnativ: yeah, I was thinking spec/unit & spec/integration would be tidier...
[2014-03-08 01:03:29 -0500] coderanger: werdnativ: No, it isn't, if you run those with rspec spec/ it would be wrong
[2014-03-08 01:03:36 -0500] coderanger: they have to be run via busser on a remote system
[2014-03-08 01:03:56 -0500] coderanger: And busser supports many things that aren't serverspec
[2014-03-08 01:04:01 -0500] werdnativ: right, I was talking about the name but that makes sense.
[2014-03-08 01:04:48 -0500] coderanger: werdnativ: /me dislikes putting the tool name in paths anyway
[2014-03-08 01:04:57 -0500] coderanger: werdnativ: It is lib/, not ruby/
[2014-03-08 01:05:09 -0500] werdnativ: righto.
[2014-03-08 01:06:05 -0500] coderanger: <grumpyoldman>
[2014-03-08 01:06:09 -0500] werdnativ: another question, can a kitchen suite choose what tests to run when you run verify? does it always have to run everything under test/integration?
[2014-03-08 01:06:09 -0500] coderanger: er </>
[2014-03-08 01:06:29 -0500] coderanger: werdnativ: You can pass a regex to all kitchen commands to control which suites run
[2014-03-08 01:07:40 -0500] werdnativ: suite = "default" but ls test/integration/default/serverspec might have several files...
[2014-03-08 01:08:27 -0500] coderanger: Ahh no, busser-serverspec runs all specs in the suite folder
[2014-03-08 01:08:38 -0500] werdnativ: ok, thanks.
[2014-03-08 01:10:29 -0500] werdnativ: do you ever have 2 suites and test integration between them? app server can log into database via ENV var for example...
[2014-03-08 01:14:58 -0500] werdnativ: Everything I've seen seems to test what's installed inside the box. I'm wondering if it's possible or if it makes sense to test the boundaries between boxes (service_a on box_a should be configured and accessible to box_b)
[2014-03-08 01:15:58 -0500] coderanger: werdnativ: Test-kitchen has no support for multi-node tests
[2014-03-08 01:16:17 -0500] coderanger: werdnativ: Its something I actually started to look at earlier this week, but its really hard to do
[2014-03-08 01:16:33 -0500] coderanger: There is a ticket on github if you want to track it
[2014-03-08 01:17:08 -0500] werdnativ: I'll take a look, thanks.
[2014-03-08 01:18:12 -0500] cwj: https://github.com/chrisroberts/vagabond might be worth a look, i havent played with it lately though
[2014-03-08 01:18:32 -0500] spheromak: vagabond and some serverspec could get you there
[2014-03-08 01:22:57 -0500] werdnativ: thanks for that cwj, that looks like what I want: https://github.com/chrisroberts/vagabond#cluster-testing

[2014-03-08 01:27:54 -0500] 1JTAALJWM: anyone here using chef for elastic ips with in a databag?
[2014-03-08 01:28:16 -0500] rdobbsjrjr: does the chef-rewind modification work with hosted chef, or only your own chef server?
[2014-03-08 01:35:42 -0500] jkeiser: Should apt_package's :upgrade action work?  I'm not getting an updated lxc in this recipe, and it's causing lxc-templates to not install (because it wants a later lxc):
[2014-03-08 01:35:50 -0500] jkeiser: https://github.com/opscode/chef-metal-lxc/blob/test/test/cookbooks/lxctests/recipes/install_metal.rb
[2014-03-08 01:36:31 -0500] spheromak: jkeiser: worked for me last time i used it
[2014-03-08 01:36:48 -0500] spheromak: try not to do upgrades in recipes tho these days
[2014-03-08 01:37:24 -0500] jkeiser: I really just want to install some version of both lxc and lxc-templates, and don't care which (it's for tests, so I'm cool with the latest)
[2014-03-08 01:37:34 -0500] jkeiser: I guess I can just run apt-get upgrade lxc
[2014-03-08 01:40:28 -0500] zeknox: what file do LWRPs go in?
[2014-03-08 01:40:59 -0500] jkeiser: resources/x.rb and providers/x.rb, if your LWRP is named x
[2014-03-08 01:42:08 -0500] zeknox: jkeiser: so i could put something like rbenv_ruby "1.9.3-p194" in any of those files to install a ruby version with rbenv cookbook
[2014-03-08 01:43:31 -0500] spheromak:  zeknox no you use lwrp resources in recipes
[2014-03-08 01:44:06 -0500] spheromak: if you want to write a resource/prover you use those dirs/files.
[2014-03-08 01:44:20 -0500] spheromak: http://docs.opscode.com/resource.html
[2014-03-08 01:44:26 -0500] zeknox: i just want to know how to instal Ruby by using the rbenv_ruby LWRP from the docs
[2014-03-08 01:45:15 -0500] spheromak: zeknox: which rbenv cookbook ?
[2014-03-08 01:45:23 -0500] zeknox: spheromak: https://github.com/RiotGames/rbenv-cookbook
[2014-03-08 01:45:36 -0500] zeknox: spheromak: im trying to understand the 'installing a ruby' part
[2014-03-08 01:45:37 -0500] spheromak: https://github.com/RiotGames/rbenv-cookbook#resources--providers
[2014-03-08 01:46:03 -0500] spheromak: use rbenv_ruby in a recipe after you have included this cookbook in your runlist
[2014-03-08 01:46:27 -0500] zeknox: spheromak: gotya, let me test ir out
[2014-03-08 01:59:39 -0500] zeknox: looks like it installed, but now i seem to have this issue The `ruby' command exists in these Ruby versions: 1.9.2-p290
[2014-03-08 02:05:03 -0500] strictlyb: anyone here using aws databags for elastic ips have a sec to chat
[2014-03-08 02:34:12 -0500] zeknox: spheromak: thanks for the help, setting global to true fixed my issue, ruby is installed and good to go

[2014-03-08 05:36:35 -0500] jtran: i'm putting recipe[ohai] at the top of my run list, yet afaict ohai plugin network_addr isn't being installed anywhere so it's not creating the ipaddress_intfname shortcuts.
[2014-03-08 05:36:50 -0500] jtran: by default the network-addr ohai plugin should automatically be installed and run right?
[2014-03-08 06:21:42 -0500] coderanger: flaccid: No, I've not actually used the cookbooks in a while
[2014-03-08 06:23:16 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: np. do you use something different or just havnt worked on django projects lately?
[2014-03-08 06:23:45 -0500] coderanger: flaccid: Both-ish, the apps I touch these days are all getting converted over to omnibus builds
[2014-03-08 06:24:10 -0500] coderanger: flaccid: That + depot to manage the apt repo on S3 means the recipes are much simpler, just install package, write config file, start service
[2014-03-08 06:24:14 -0500] flaccid: coderanger: i see. all this reminds me of the packaging of pc-bsd
[2014-03-08 06:24:28 -0500] coderanger: flaccid: Yeah, its a ports system for sure
[2014-03-08 06:24:59 -0500] jtran: coderanger: do u ever sleep ? :)
[2014-03-08 06:25:19 -0500] coderanger: jtran: Sometimes, its only 22:30 here though
[2014-03-08 06:25:29 -0500] jtran: like that's not late enough?
[2014-03-08 06:25:36 -0500] jtran: that's PDT
[2014-03-08 06:25:40 -0500] jtran: same time as mine
[2014-03-08 06:25:56 -0500] jtran: oh that's right, chef is in SFO ;)
[2014-03-08 06:27:01 -0500] flaccid: yep its in the airport :p
[2014-03-08 06:27:21 -0500] jtran: coderanger: can u shed some light on ohai plugin?  i don't quite understand .. there's a README in ohai/files/default that says put custom plugins in there.   i put my custom plugins in there, and upload the cookbook, yet when i run chef-client -o ohai, it doesn't install the plugins
[2014-03-08 06:27:28 -0500] jtran: most notabley network_addr
[2014-03-08 06:27:56 -0500] jtran: reading thru recipe/default.rb it's not clear that ohai recipe default actually installs the plugins at all
[2014-03-08 06:28:10 -0500] coderanger: jtran: Chef the company is based in Seattle, though I don't work for them and live in SF
[2014-03-08 06:28:28 -0500] jtran: ooh, i thought u worked for them considering your knowledge of it
[2014-03-08 06:29:08 -0500] coderanger: jtran: I used to, but do not currently
[2014-03-08 06:29:14 -0500] jtran: aaah ok
[2014-03-08 06:29:26 -0500] coderanger: jtran: Anyways, you are trying to install a plugin, yes?
[2014-03-08 06:29:48 -0500] jtran: yes, codranger most notably network_addr
[2014-03-08 06:31:35 -0500] coderanger: jtran: Okay, so how are you setting this up, you have the ohai cookbook and then your own cookbook?
[2014-03-08 06:32:25 -0500] jtran: i just download the default ohai cookbook v 2.0.0 to my workstation, and then i download the network_addr.rb plugin and place it in the ohai/files/defaults folder
[2014-03-08 06:32:38 -0500] jtran: and then knife cookbook upload -o . ohai
[2014-03-08 06:32:47 -0500] coderanger: Are you using berkshelf or similar or just modifying upstream cookbooks?
[2014-03-08 06:33:35 -0500] coderanger: (either way works, though I would heeeeeavilly recommend using berkshelf)
[2014-03-08 06:34:08 -0500] coderanger: You know what, let me just make you an example using ohai
[2014-03-08 06:34:13 -0500] coderanger: Give me like 15m :)
[2014-03-08 06:34:24 -0500] jtran: i'm not really modifying the upstream.  just downloaded the plugin network_addr.rb, put it in the ohai/files/default folder, and then just knife upload the cookbook
[2014-03-08 06:34:46 -0500] jtran: i do use berkshelf in prod but right now in my dev env, just going thru this manually.
[2014-03-08 06:41:58 -0500] jidar: can I get a raw command output from a chef run?
[2014-03-08 06:42:41 -0500] jtran: jidar: sort of.  chef-client -l debug
[2014-03-08 06:43:06 -0500] jidar: heh, I was hoping to reduce the clutter
[2014-03-08 06:43:13 -0500] jidar: let me see how I run this from a vagrant provision
[2014-03-08 06:44:01 -0500] coderanger: jidar: chef.log_level = :debug
[2014-03-08 06:44:04 -0500] coderanger: in the vagrantfile
[2014-03-08 06:44:08 -0500] jidar: coderanger: yep, got it!
[2014-03-08 06:44:22 -0500] coderanger: jtran: Okay, let me run my kitchen tests on this example :)
[2014-03-08 06:44:39 -0500] jtran: thx coderanger, i feel bad about u putting so much work into it
[2014-03-08 06:45:46 -0500] coderanger: jtran: Its a good thing to have an example for :)
[2014-03-08 06:47:38 -0500] jidar: using a swap recipe, only the first time the recipe is run on a box it errors
[2014-03-08 06:47:39 -0500] jidar: haha
[2014-03-08 06:48:05 -0500] jidar: at least vagrant makes this pretty quick
[2014-03-08 06:49:52 -0500] jidar: ok so, the error only occurs after another command was run and I don't get to see what that command was
[2014-03-08 06:51:18 -0500] jidar: how can I figure out exactly what the 'mount' command is doing from a recipe
[2014-03-08 06:51:23 -0500] jidar: http://pastebin.com/CBhhKXNt
[2014-03-08 06:51:54 -0500] coderanger: jtran: https://github.com/coderanger/ohai-example
[2014-03-08 06:51:59 -0500] jidar: specifically, the action :enable for mount
[2014-03-08 06:52:17 -0500] jidar: the docs say, "add an entry to fstab" which is fine, but what is it doing to accomplish that
[2014-03-08 06:52:59 -0500] jtran: coderanger: oooh i get it thanks for showing me that
[2014-03-08 06:53:12 -0500] jtran: i put it in files/default, and overlooked the plugins subdir
[2014-03-08 06:53:20 -0500] jtran: that makes it much more clear. thanks again
