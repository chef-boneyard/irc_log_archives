[2014-03-30 00:29:10 -0400] mhenrixon: there is none
[2014-03-30 00:29:41 -0400] mhenrixon: wait
[2014-03-30 00:29:45 -0400] mhenrixon: I got this
[2014-03-30 00:29:46 -0400] mhenrixon: knife cookbook metadata from file metadata.rb
[2014-03-30 00:29:51 -0400] coderanger: yahr
[2014-03-30 00:31:23 -0400] mhenrixon: https://gist.github.com/b969f9be18c3ca256f6b
[2014-03-30 00:31:31 -0400] mhenrixon: that is for my cookbook
[2014-03-30 00:32:59 -0400] coderanger: What about ulimit, the one thats failing?
[2014-03-30 00:33:25 -0400] mhenrixon: oh I should have thought of that
[2014-03-30 00:33:30 -0400] mhenrixon: been a really long week
[2014-03-30 00:33:42 -0400] coderanger: https://github.com/bmhatfield/chef-ulimit/blob/v0.3.2/metadata.json
[2014-03-30 00:33:49 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, its got weird crud in it
[2014-03-30 00:34:14 -0400] coderanger: https://github.com/bmhatfield/chef-ulimit/commit/936d3c8ecba638de9a91a934de46347d31fcfdde
[2014-03-30 00:34:51 -0400] mhenrixon: https://gist.github.com/a87106ed082421100a16
[2014-03-30 00:35:24 -0400] mhenrixon: aha I should probably specify a higher version then
[2014-03-30 00:36:53 -0400] coderanger: There hasn't been a release since then
[2014-03-30 00:36:58 -0400] coderanger: so you'll have to use a git specifier
[2014-03-30 00:37:53 -0400] mhenrixon: gah all these git installs... :)
[2014-03-30 01:25:47 -0400] werdnativ: so, encrypted data bags: if I do node.default[:secret] = value_from_encrypted_bag_item does that get updated & stored in the clear on the chef-server?
[2014-03-30 01:26:23 -0400] helfire: werdnativ: Yes, it would be node attribute then saved in the node object
[2014-03-30 01:27:52 -0400] werdnativ: ok, thought so. thanks.
[2014-03-30 01:30:17 -0400] werdnativ: so if I want to merge a password into the "hash" without saving it, what do you do? I'm thinking something like dbconfig = node[:dbconfig].dup ; dbconfig[:password] = secret ?
[2014-03-30 01:31:27 -0400] helfire: do it in a ruby block or variable, that is only in memory
[2014-03-30 01:31:45 -0400] helfire: so like you describe, i think
[2014-03-30 01:32:31 -0400] werdnativ: ok. I'm passing it as a hash of keys/values to the template, so thinking of how to merge it in there without it ending up in the actual node object. Hoping dup works like I expect...
[2014-03-30 01:33:06 -0400] helfire: ya, check the full node object to be sure, but if your just putting it in a ruby hash and passing it to a template, should be fine
[2014-03-30 02:04:05 -0400] glen: why with definition (or anything else) i can't use such simple syntax: definitionname 'something', :extra_param => 123, but have to do "definitionname 'soemthing' do extra_param 123 end
[2014-03-30 02:04:28 -0400] glen: the former doesn't even give any indication i'm doing it wrong...
[2014-03-30 02:07:12 -0400] glen: and even short syntax does not work? definitionname 'something' { extra_param 123 }
[2014-03-30 02:18:25 -0400] werdnativ: glen: your last example is invalid ruby: definitionname('something') { extra_param 123 } # needs parentheses
[2014-03-30 02:22:41 -0400] werdnativ: I'm guessing that Berksfile doesn't have a "path" option for default locations, like it does for "site" and "chef_api"? You have to set the path for each cookbook?
[2014-03-30 02:26:24 -0400] glen: werdnativ: if so, then why this is valid: only_if { do_configs }
[2014-03-30 02:33:30 -0400] coderanger: werdnativ: The whole site/chef_api system is gone in berks 3, making it moot
[2014-03-30 03:14:15 -0400] tabolario: Yay, EC2 packer builds on travis is a go
[2014-03-30 03:17:41 -0400] tabolario: Except the amazon-instance builder sits too long on bundling the image without giving any output so travis kills it after awhile :/
[2014-03-30 03:18:17 -0400] tabolario: I wonder if I could trick it somehow..
[2014-03-30 03:45:40 -0400] chef410: hey is this a cooking chat or am i totally stupid?
[2014-03-30 03:51:01 -0400] coderanger: chef410: It isn't, but I can probably answer questions about that too
[2014-03-30 04:59:21 -0400] werdnativ: Looking at berkshelf 3, am I the only one who thinks it's gone crazy with the whole running an API server thing?
[2014-03-30 05:01:04 -0400] coderanger: werdnativ: No, in order to write a version solver in a mildly sane way, you need a list of all versions of everything that exist
[2014-03-30 05:01:13 -0400] coderanger: werdnativ: And building that list is a slow process at best
[2014-03-30 05:01:26 -0400] coderanger: werdnativ: makes sense to cache it, though you might want to just run the server on localhost
[2014-03-30 05:02:04 -0400] werdnativ: coderanger: is there no way to internalize that so we don't need to run dependencies for a dependecy resolver?
[2014-03-30 05:02:43 -0400] coderanger: werdnativ: Like I said, you could run it on localhost, but it eats a lot of RAM so you probably don't want to
[2014-03-30 05:03:33 -0400] werdnativ: yeah, I guess it just seems overly complicated for those of us with simpler needs.
[2014-03-30 05:03:46 -0400] coderanger: werdnativ: Your needs are complicated, you just don't know it yet :)
[2014-03-30 05:04:03 -0400] coderanger: werdnativ: The side effect of how berk2 worked was it cheated on dep solving
[2014-03-30 05:04:16 -0400] coderanger: and assumed the latest version worked unless directly contradicted
[2014-03-30 05:04:46 -0400] werdnativ: Isn't chef-api itself an index tho? Why does it need an extra layer of REST api?
[2014-03-30 05:05:11 -0400] coderanger: werdnativ: It is, but the community site API is  not so good :-(
[2014-03-30 05:05:48 -0400] werdnativ: yeah, just wondering...
[2014-03-30 05:06:58 -0400] coderanger: werdnativ: I've complained about it too
[2014-03-30 05:07:08 -0400] coderanger: and berkshelf should wrap the process of booting a local server
[2014-03-30 05:07:19 -0400] werdnativ: wonder if there's any hope of that functionality getting merged upstream.
[2014-03-30 05:07:33 -0400] werdnativ: right, that's what I was kind of thinking by "internalize" it.
[2014-03-30 05:07:50 -0400] coderanger: Yes, holoway has shown interest in making the universe/ API a formal part of the chef server as well as the community site
[2014-03-30 05:08:10 -0400] coderanger: There are at least nice cookbooks for setting up a berks-api server though
[2014-03-30 05:08:31 -0400] werdnativ: haha. can I install them with... berkshelf?
[2014-03-30 05:10:19 -0400] coderanger: Indeed, since it only relies on community-site cookbooks, it can be used with their server
[2014-03-30 06:51:25 -0400] tabolario: It's not much (seriously not much at all), but I just cleaned up and open sourced our curl cookbook :D https://github.com/americanhonors/chef-curl
[2014-03-30 07:05:50 -0400] PapaSierra: morning. i'm getting the dreaded "Data Bag Items must contain a Hash or Mash!", but this is not the solution http://strong-water-3107.herokuapp.com/articles/49
[2014-03-30 07:06:21 -0400] PapaSierra: what i mean is, my file name and my id match (minus the .json). so i'm not sure what else could be wrong
[2014-03-30 07:09:26 -0400] coderanger: PapaSierra: Please pastebin your json file
[2014-03-30 07:11:47 -0400] PapaSierra: coderanger: http://pastebin.com/Q5MDqz6Y <-- staging.json (there is also production.json... unless there's a better layout you can suggest)
[2014-03-30 07:13:48 -0400] coderanger: PapaSierra: What command are you running that gives that error?
[2014-03-30 07:15:27 -0400] PapaSierra: it happens while vagrant is provision via chef. as you can see here http://pastebin.com/99YhuCTL
[2014-03-30 07:17:32 -0400] PapaSierra: the goal is to get SSL certs onto the server using chef-solo/knife-solo. i found the atomic-penguin "certificates" cookbook which looked very helpful. unfortunately i had to roll back to chef 11.6.2 to avoid the Array to String conversion error as documented here https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4753
[2014-03-30 07:18:17 -0400] PapaSierra: ah right! i'm looking for the 'test' data bag which doesn't exist ;)
[2014-03-30 07:18:45 -0400] coderanger: That would do it :)
[2014-03-30 07:19:39 -0400] PapaSierra: coderanger: sure would! but i'm finding the bug-workaround combinations are starting to layer on top of each other, not very pretty. how is the rest of the world doing it? not using chef-solo i presume?
[2014-03-30 07:19:49 -0400] tabolario: I need to find a way to automate open sourcing the rest of these little install-one-package cookbooks
[2014-03-30 07:20:08 -0400] coderanger: PapaSierra: I don't use data bags at all, encrypted or otherwise
[2014-03-30 07:20:13 -0400] coderanger: tabolario: Check out stove
[2014-03-30 07:21:17 -0400] tabolario: coderanger: Oh wonderful :) Hadn't seen this before
[2014-03-30 07:22:55 -0400] tabolario: I have about 9 more cookbooks I want to clean up and open source now (very simple ones like unzip and libffi), and then the one big one that has our specific runit-unicorn-sidekiq-nginx setup in it
[2014-03-30 07:22:59 -0400] coderanger: Reminds me I need to submit a patch to make it use signed tags
[2014-03-30 07:23:28 -0400] tabolario: I just submitted a PR for kitchen-ec2 to pass the associate_public_ip option in to fog
[2014-03-30 07:23:51 -0400] tabolario: I'm not sure how anyone was actually using it with VPC otherwise
[2014-03-30 07:24:08 -0400] coderanger: tabolario: I don't give most of my VPC servers public IPs, nor should you :-)
[2014-03-30 07:24:17 -0400] coderanger: tabolario: Setup private subnets and router machines
[2014-03-30 07:24:54 -0400] tabolario: I usually don't ever, aside from bastion hosts and nat boxes, but lately I've been using an isolated VPC just for short-lived build machines
[2014-03-30 07:25:23 -0400] coderanger: tabolario: I just dump that stuff on to ec2-classic
[2014-03-30 07:26:59 -0400] tabolario: Does test-kitchen itself have an option to specify an SSH gateway?
[2014-03-30 07:27:53 -0400] tabolario: Nvm just reading through the code now
[2014-03-30 07:28:17 -0400] tabolario: Looks like the answer to my own question is no
[2014-03-30 07:28:27 -0400] coderanger: tabolario: It doesn't, but I have a pull req up for it
[2014-03-30 07:30:05 -0400] tabolario: coderanger: Ah I see it, you're use case is a bit different than mine, but that would solve the VPC issue in general
[2014-03-30 07:30:27 -0400] tabolario: your*
[2014-03-30 07:31:46 -0400] tabolario: Hmm I want to open source our packer stuff too that I use to build base AMIs because it has some nice stuff to support autoscaling.. Need to figure out how to make the autoscaling init script more generic first
[2014-03-30 07:32:36 -0400] tabolario: coderanger: Also could you elaborate on what you said earlier about not using data bags?
[2014-03-30 07:36:04 -0400] coderanger: tabolario: https://coderanger.net/2014/02/data-bags/
[2014-03-30 07:36:42 -0400] tabolario: coderanger: Ah thanks!
[2014-03-30 07:44:39 -0400] tabolario: coderanger: Very interesting, especially + citadel
[2014-03-30 07:46:14 -0400] PapaSierra: coderanger: "so why not just use that to distribute the original secret data and skip the whole bag thing?" <-- as a n00b to chef in general, this was a question nagging on my mind
[2014-03-30 07:47:35 -0400] coderanger: PapaSierra: :)
[2014-03-30 07:47:58 -0400] PapaSierra: reading your blog 15 hours ago would have saved me... 15 hours
[2014-03-30 07:54:56 -0400] coderanger: I try

[2014-03-30 10:12:02 -0400] Bloc: mhenrixon are you deleting instances and remaking them?
[2014-03-30 10:12:11 -0400] mhenrixon: Bloc yup that is the one
[2014-03-30 10:12:17 -0400] mhenrixon: I obviously missed a step :)
[2014-03-30 10:12:21 -0400] Bloc: knife client list
[2014-03-30 10:12:25 -0400] Bloc: knife node list
[2014-03-30 10:12:45 -0400] Bloc: that'll show you what instances are tied to opscode
[2014-03-30 10:13:00 -0400] Bloc: so you then need to run knife client delete [nodename]
[2014-03-30 10:13:10 -0400] Bloc: knife node delete .....same....
[2014-03-30 10:13:26 -0400] Bloc: in the docs, but they should highlight it with big rainbow gay colors
[2014-03-30 10:13:32 -0400] mhenrixon: amen!
[2014-03-30 11:30:11 -0400] mhenrixon: https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3940
[2014-03-30 11:30:23 -0400] mhenrixon: I am experiencing this problem me thinks
[2014-03-30 11:30:29 -0400] mhenrixon: chef 11.10.4
[2014-03-30 11:47:38 -0400] mhenrixon: for me it can't be the home variable thing though
[2014-03-30 12:11:03 -0400] PapaSierra: i've recently discovered berkshelf. i used to bring up my vms (plural) using vagrant by just saying vagrant up on a vagrantfile that had 3 machines configured. now each berkshelf cookbook has its own vagrant file. i don't want to have to cd into each cookbook and run vagrant up. there must be a better way, what does my "top level vagrantfile" look like?
[2014-03-30 12:49:31 -0400] mhenrixon: HAH! I found it I think we need port 9418 allowed as well
[2014-03-30 16:00:00 -0400] bruno-: Hey guys, I have a noob question. I'm a rails dev with a couple apps that need
[2014-03-30 16:00:00 -0400] bruno-: to be deployed. They are all single-server small apps. So far, I'm provisioning
[2014-03-30 16:00:01 -0400] bruno-: the servers with a simple role that basically just installs necessary packages.
[2014-03-30 16:00:01 -0400] bruno-: This works great and I'm happy...
[2014-03-30 16:00:26 -0400] bruno-: However, I'm worried that I'm not actually writing any recipes. Should I transfer a run list and attributes from role to a recipe? I'm asking because I wanna be set up properly for the time when I need to manage multi-node environments.
[2014-03-30 16:01:16 -0400] bruno-: So basically, question is: should I lean on writing recipes instead of just assembling roles? What is the "proper way"?
[2014-03-30 16:01:19 -0400] bruno-: thanks
[2014-03-30 16:02:25 -0400] PapaSier_: bruno-: http://dougireton.com/blog/2013/02/16/chef-cookbook-anti-patterns/
[2014-03-30 16:12:34 -0400] bruno-: spot on! thank you PapaSier
[2014-03-30 17:30:32 -0400] tabolario: coderanger: So in testing kitchen-ec2 with the 11 cookbooks I just open sourced on travis, didn't seem to have any launch issues so far
[2014-03-30 17:31:12 -0400] tabolario: And it also just occurred to me I should've made a -cookbooks org for us :/
[2014-03-30 17:33:34 -0400] tabolario: coderanger: Also I've been mulling over your blog post this morning, and how would you use citadel to store secret environment variable stuff for say runit? It occurred to me that I could store a JSON file up in the citadel bucket for each application for each environment, and just pull that down and run through JSON.parse to populate the env/ directories for the runit services
[2014-03-30 18:28:44 -0400] mhenrixon: anyone ever hear of a chef-client not fetching the latest cookbook from chef-server?
[2014-03-30 18:28:57 -0400] mhenrixon: my database slave seems to have some old reference to a cookbook
[2014-03-30 18:30:42 -0400] mhenrixon: it refreshed now never mind
[2014-03-30 18:30:49 -0400] mhenrixon: odd though
[2014-03-30 18:31:14 -0400] mhenrixon: it was screaming "I refuse to use the right cookbook versions" and then it just gave up
[2014-03-30 18:49:24 -0400] vegardx: So, when installing chef 0.10x on Wheezy, using the supplied packages, how do you get the thing actually working? When I try to do "knife configure -i" it fails on a "undefined method save".
[2014-03-30 18:50:41 -0400] vegardx: It seems it does not actually save the private key for the client.
[2014-03-30 19:30:34 -0400] coderanger: tabolario: runit_service 'foo' do options mykey: citadel['mykey'] end
[2014-03-30 19:31:23 -0400] tabolario: coderanger: Oh I didn't realize citadel deserialized stuff into hashes automatically
[2014-03-30 19:31:35 -0400] coderanger: tabolario: It doesn't
[2014-03-30 19:31:36 -0400] tabolario: * goes to look at code again
[2014-03-30 19:31:49 -0400] coderanger: tabolario: That just grabs a file called 'mykey' and returns it
[2014-03-30 19:32:17 -0400] tabolario: Oh gotcha, so I can just call JSON.parse on that I suppose
[2014-03-30 19:34:07 -0400] tabolario: I'm glad all the AWS-oriented cookbooks are starting to support IAM instance profile creds now
[2014-03-30 19:34:28 -0400] coderanger: If you wanted to, I suppose
[2014-03-30 19:34:45 -0400] coderanger: Or just put each secret in its own file
[2014-03-30 19:37:08 -0400] tabolario: Ah hmm
[2014-03-30 19:45:34 -0400] tabolario: Well this is slightly annoying, so I'm writing a wrapper cookbook for Chef server that creates an EBS raid array for /opt/chef-server, but there's no current way in the AWS cookbook to specify that volumes get terminated on instance termination (which I realize probably isn't a terribly common use case)
[2014-03-30 19:47:50 -0400] coderanger: tabolario: That kind of removes the only reason to use EBS
[2014-03-30 19:48:33 -0400] tabolario: coderanger: Yeah.. Oh I forgot to mention above that the only reason I want to specify that is for CI test-kitchen runs haha
[2014-03-30 19:48:57 -0400] tabolario: I wouldn't normally want to delete the volumes for that array if the chef server instance was terminated
[2014-03-30 19:50:04 -0400] coderanger: If its a special case anyway, just make it a special case to not use EBS?
[2014-03-30 19:52:51 -0400] tabolario: I was starting to think that.. It'd be a lot of hassle to find a way to keep track of the volumes that get created for the kitchen instance and then go get rid of them afterwards
[2014-03-30 19:56:46 -0400] tabolario: I feel like that leaves out an important piece in the integration test though, because otherwise the wrapper cookbook doesn't do anything but default the webui to being disabled for the chef-server recipe
[2014-03-30 19:59:44 -0400] tabolario: Ohhh but I suppose I could actually put a special test-only part into the recipe after the ebs_raid resource runs to modify the instance attributes to make them go on termination
[2014-03-30 20:26:45 -0400] mhenrixon: rsync error: error in socket IO (code 10) at clientserver.c(122) [sender=3.0.9] que?
[2014-03-30 20:46:38 -0400] coredump: guys, anyone uses the mysql cookbook from opscode? Why is the 'start on'  line commented on https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql/blob/master/templates/default/init-mysql.conf.erb ? Any reason you should not start it on boot?
[2014-03-30 20:55:17 -0400] davidski: Hey, gang. Anyone have a minute to explain a mystery of attribute override under chef-solo? I'm working with https://github.com/lusis/chef-logstash/tree/logstash_1.4 and I'm unclear how to override a default hash (instead of a merge).
[2014-03-30 20:56:54 -0400] davidski: Specifically, I'm trying to override ['logstash']['instance']['server']['config_templates'].
[2014-03-30 21:27:10 -0400] vegardx: I'm having an issue where knife search returns no nodes, while knife node list does. What could be wrong?
[2014-03-30 21:30:21 -0400] vegardx: Solr seems to answer, but doesn't have any data.
[2014-03-30 22:03:16 -0400] storme_away: so, question about local mode... is there a way to mock up data bags with it, or is that more a chef-zero style usage? we're trying to do more feature dev work "locally" and only push completed versions into git instead of developing on master
