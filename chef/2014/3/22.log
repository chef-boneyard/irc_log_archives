[2014-03-22 00:21:41 -0400] scalp42: kbarry that would be /var/chef/cache
[2014-03-22 00:21:52 -0400] scalp42: comes from knife config
[2014-03-22 00:22:19 -0400] scalp42: have a good weekend folks
[2014-03-22 02:50:32 -0400] llakey: Why do I get this error:   undefined method `owner' for Chef::Resource::Bash    I see owner and group used in the docs?  http://docs.opscode.com/resource_bash.html
[2014-03-22 03:25:36 -0400] coderanger: llakey: The correct name "user"
[2014-03-22 03:25:56 -0400] coderanger: llakey: file-like stuffs have an owner, execute-like stuffs have a user
[2014-03-22 03:26:07 -0400] coderanger: llakey: While technically correct, it is probably more confusing than it is worth
[2014-03-22 03:27:18 -0400] helfire: anyone familiar with the jenkins cookbook? If i use the example jenkins_script 'add_authentication', subsiquent jenkins_jobs or jenkins_plugins fail as the jenkins-cli.jar isnt authenticating to jenkins (which is expected, but how do i auth to converge now?)
[2014-03-22 03:28:14 -0400] llakey: coderanger: Thanks!
[2014-03-22 03:29:10 -0400] helfire: blah i found it:
[2014-03-22 03:29:10 -0400] helfire: node['jenkins']['executor']['private_key']
[2014-03-22 03:29:11 -0400] helfire: The underlying executor class (which all LWRPs use) intelligently adds authentication information to the Jenkins CLI commands if this attribute is set
[2014-03-22 03:31:08 -0400] helfire: also this jenkins cookbook is amazing
[2014-03-22 13:12:27 -0400] benner: how to make search in override atributes?
[2014-03-22 14:10:09 -0400] davidski: Good morning, can anyone see why my Berkshelf reference cookbook 'custom', github 'davidski/cookbooks' is failing to find the cookbook?
[2014-03-22 14:10:16 -0400] davidski: Ugly naming and code notwithstanding, that is. ;)
[2014-03-22 14:24:02 -0400] unicron_: if I am using out a cookbook_file resource is it better to use something like File.join(node['app']['dir'], 'subdir')
[2014-03-22 14:24:15 -0400] unicron_: or node['app']['dir'] + '/subdir'
[2014-03-22 14:24:32 -0400] unicron_: or would that purely be a style choice?
[2014-03-22 14:24:51 -0400] helfire: doesnt File actually read into a file object?
[2014-03-22 14:26:06 -0400] unicron_: Well both work as expected but I wondered if was is more efficient under the hood than the other
[2014-03-22 14:26:21 -0400] unicron_: s/if was/if one was/
[2014-03-22 14:27:21 -0400] helfire: well one is just constructing a string, other donno (not a ruby expert), but i'd think either way it's not much, unless your doing thousands of cookbook files ina loop or something :)
[2014-03-22 14:27:28 -0400] unicron_: helfire, so using File.join would introduce extra call (if that's the right terminology - I'm no exprt)
[2014-03-22 14:28:16 -0400] helfire: ya, but you may optimizing for something fairly small
[2014-03-22 14:28:37 -0400] unicron_: I know it wouldn't be much of an overhead but I'm just trying to stop getting into bad habits early on
[2014-03-22 14:30:54 -0400] unicron_: thanks for the reply - sorta confirmed what I was thinking
[2014-03-22 14:33:36 -0400] helfire: haha, ya dont know enough about the internals of ruby. I guess i've seen more examples without File in that resource
[2014-03-22 15:46:17 -0400] helfire: this is really weird, i converged the new jenkins cookbook yesterday, and now today i destroy/converge and get RemoteClass: 7: unable to resolve class GithubSecurityRealm when trying to run the auth groovy script
[2014-03-22 16:01:02 -0400] helfire: Figured it out, that class doesnt exist without the github plugin installed and jenkins restarted

[2014-03-22 18:39:28 -0400] AKS: Hey Guys I am trying to use Chef::Log.info("Message") in my chef recipe but during chef-client run I am not seeing any info message? Can anyone help ?
[2014-03-22 18:55:14 -0400] jidar: you sure it's getting loaded? log.info shouldn't require anything special to get displayed
[2014-03-22 18:55:38 -0400] near77: hi
[2014-03-22 18:55:48 -0400] near77: i have an infrastructure of over 11.000 ubuntu vms
[2014-03-22 18:56:13 -0400] near77: I need a way to know what packages are installed and check if they have security issues so they have to be updated
[2014-03-22 18:56:18 -0400] near77: is chef the right tool?
[2014-03-22 18:56:34 -0400] n1ko: nope
[2014-03-22 18:58:43 -0400] near77: whta tool do you recommend n1ko?
[2014-03-22 18:59:26 -0400] near77: and is it because of what I want to do, or because of the amount of vms?
[2014-03-22 19:00:12 -0400] jidar: nothing to do with number of vms
[2014-03-22 19:00:36 -0400] jidar: everything to do with chef really isn't a package reviosion/version management tool (you can shoe horn this, but its really not good at it)
[2014-03-22 19:00:53 -0400] jidar: revision* rather
[2014-03-22 19:01:25 -0400] mattupstate: that sounds like something you could simply script if you had an inventory of all the VM's
[2014-03-22 19:01:25 -0400] near77: I know ,the purpouse is to change software
[2014-03-22 19:01:45 -0400] near77: but if I find out there are some packages to upgrade
[2014-03-22 19:01:48 -0400] near77: wouldn't chef be useful?
[2014-03-22 19:02:03 -0400] mattupstate: no
[2014-03-22 19:02:53 -0400] mattupstate: it can install packages for you, but if all you want to do is deal with upgrading packages, then you dont need chef
[2014-03-22 19:03:50 -0400] mattupstate: do you know what packages you want to upgrade? or do you need to figure that out first?

[2014-03-22 21:16:42 -0400] atmatt: Hi guys. I've got Chef solo (using Berkshelf) provisioning a digital ocean box. It seems to have installed rbenv as the root user by default. Is that the standard way? If so do I just edit each user's .bashrc to include /usr/local/rbenv in $PATH?
[2014-03-22 21:46:59 -0400] coredu___: is there an integration between knife-spork and berks?
[2014-03-22 22:04:58 -0400] coredump: hmm
[2014-03-22 22:05:00 -0400] coredump: seems broken

[2014-03-22 23:20:15 -0400] jidar: github is returning 301 for some packages
