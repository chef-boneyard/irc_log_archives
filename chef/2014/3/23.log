[2014-03-23 01:18:51 -0400] Damm: some issue with 301 redirects and Chef recently? one of my cookbooks started failing downloading Diamond and the url works via wget fails in Chef
[2014-03-23 01:18:54 -0400] Damm: https://gist.github.com/damm/5b041c43c0ccf86d9f1a
[2014-03-23 01:19:15 -0400] Damm: 11.10.4
[2014-03-23 01:19:33 -0400] Damm: i'm not sure how to fix it short of not using the remote_File resource
[2014-03-23 02:54:50 -0400] jblack: Hi. I'm trying to install chef-server on a centos 6.3 install and reconfigure is bombing out on me on rabbitmq.
[2014-03-23 02:55:15 -0400] jblack: STDOUT: {error_logger,{{2014,3,22},{19,54,34}},"Protocol: ~p: register error: ~p~n",["inet_tcp",{{badmatch,{error,epmd_close}},[{inet_tcp_dist,listen,1,[{file,"inet_tcp_dist.erl"},{line,70}]}
[2014-03-23 03:10:26 -0400] jblack: I so hate rabbitmq.
[2014-03-23 04:55:14 -0400] paulmooring: jblack I seem to remember some option in the rhel/centos installer installs qpid by default and it looks like your error is because rabbit can't get the port
[2014-03-23 04:55:31 -0400] paulmooring: try checking for something (likely quid) listening on 5672
[2014-03-23 09:11:25 -0400] Abhishek__: Hey Guys how can we set chef_environment in chefspec files?
[2014-03-23 12:10:36 -0400] Abhishek__: Hey Guys how can i set environment in my chefspec test files ?
[2014-03-23 13:17:03 -0400] daxroc: Hey
[2014-03-23 13:18:45 -0400] daxroc: Any one know if it's possible to defer the reading of a file , content File.open(tmp_file).read until after the execute block that would create the tmp_file
[2014-03-23 13:19:19 -0400] daxroc: Using a lazy block fails as the file is created with no content.
[2014-03-23 13:21:22 -0400] daxroc: I've tried executing the execute resource that creates the tmp_file in the compile stage and notify the file resource ( in the compile stage too, using action :nothing to prevent execution. )

[2014-03-23 15:42:55 -0400] jidar: hmm, anybody else getting this? I think github changed some stuff
[2014-03-23 16:36:59 -0400] AKS: Hey guys i am writing unit test for my chef recipe using chefspec and I need to set node.chef_environment in my unit test and my recipe used node.chef_environment. How can i set node.chef_environment in my chefspec default_spec.rb file?
[2014-03-23 16:40:50 -0400] werdnativ: AKS: I know the answer for that in test-kitchen, but not sure about chefspec.
[2014-03-23 16:50:58 -0400] maxmanders: I can load an instance of the current cookbook with e.g. Chef::CookbookVersion.load(cookbook_name, cookbook_version); from here I can use introspection to get a list of files and templates associated with the cookbook.  However, this approach doesn't seem to work with chef-solo since it uses Chef::REST under the hood.  Any idea how I can get details such as the current cookbook's file and template list with Chef Solo.  I'm trying to write more
[2014-03-23 16:50:59 -0400] maxmanders:  testable cookbooks
[2014-03-23 16:53:45 -0400] werdnativ: hm. does it work with chef-zero?
[2014-03-23 16:56:46 -0400] maxmanders: werdnativ: Not got that far yet, it's worth I try I guess, since it's ostensibly an in-memory server.
[2014-03-23 16:57:27 -0400] maxmanders: werdnativ: I'd like to think though that there was an alternative to CookbookVersion::load that didn't depend upon the server, and could instead just look at the local files in the cookbook
[2014-03-23 16:58:02 -0400] werdnativ: yeah, fair point. I don't know, sorry.
[2014-03-23 16:58:21 -0400] maxmanders: All good, I'll give Chef Zero a shot and see how I get on

[2014-03-23 17:35:34 -0400] windows7_deploym: I have been following various blogs, trying to get chef working with vagrant.
[2014-03-23 17:35:42 -0400] windows7_deploym: I'm stuck, any suggestions?
[2014-03-23 18:26:44 -0400] jamesf_: you've installed vagrant-windows?  (really have no idea but trying basics to see what you've done)
[2014-03-23 19:17:00 -0400] paulczar: any pro tips for accessing cookbook library from attributes file ?      I get this - Undefined node attribute or method `service_ip' on `node'
[2014-03-23 19:17:36 -0400] paulczar: where service_ip is a function in my library
[2014-03-23 19:17:40 -0400] paulczar: works fine in recipe
