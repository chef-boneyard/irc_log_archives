[2013-08-25 02:46:22 -0400] gregf: Is there a way to have Mixlib::ShellOut work with an interactive command?
[2013-08-25 02:48:02 -0400] chris613: gregf: require 'expect'
[2013-08-25 02:48:12 -0400] chris613: IO.expect
[2013-08-25 02:49:27 -0400] gregf: chris613: I don't think I explained myself well enough. I want it to stay open for input. I'm using this outside of chef.
[2013-08-25 02:51:51 -0400] chris613: gregf: No idea then, sorry.
[2013-08-25 02:52:03 -0400] gregf: chris613: thanks anyways
[2013-08-25 02:52:07 -0400] chris613: I know just enough ruby to be dangerous in a kitchen
[2013-08-25 02:56:56 -0400] gregf: :)

[2013-08-25 09:39:24 -0400] SynchronE: i'm trying knife bootstrap on a not-so-widely used distro
[2013-08-25 09:39:41 -0400] SynchronE: it says i shout file a ticket
[2013-08-25 09:39:45 -0400] SynchronE: should*
[2013-08-25 09:40:54 -0400] SynchronE: the distro is redhat-based, with not so many differences. can i somehow install chef-client manually ?
[2013-08-25 11:08:05 -0400] ashish_: Turns out I had 1.0.0 version of application_java which was incompatible with application version 3.0.0. Getting new application_java cookbook fixed the issue
[2013-08-25 13:50:44 -0400] Glace: Hi, I was wondering how would that work if lets say I use berkshelf.. and 2 cookbooks have a common cookbook depencies but with 2 different hard versions.. like for example depend on "DatCookbook version = 1.0.0" and the other cookbook depends on "DatCookbook version 2.0.0"... all that using a chef server
[2013-08-25 17:44:41 -0400] chip-: Glace: JFW.
[2013-08-25 17:45:13 -0400] chip-: Berkshelf keeps versioned cookbooks in ~/.berkshelf; Chef server allows for versioned cookbooks. Just have to make sure you pin the version for your dependency in metadata.rb and you're all good.
[2013-08-25 18:48:22 -0400] daos: hey all anyone around have a bit to chat about the `git` resource?
[2013-08-25 19:10:21 -0400] Eric__: anyone here willing to help a chef newbie with a knife ec2 server create struggle?
[2013-08-25 19:15:22 -0400] lazyPower: Eric__: Please state the nature of your medical emergency
[2013-08-25 19:17:17 -0400] Eric__: when I use an ubuntu instance on ec2, everything works great, but when I try to create a centos6 instance, the ssh fails right before the bootstrap process - but I can still ssh on my own right after that without a problem.  Then, knife bootstrap also fails with same issue.
[2013-08-25 19:18:35 -0400] lazyPower: ee
[2013-08-25 19:18:39 -0400] lazyPower: that doesnt sound like fun
[2013-08-25 19:19:17 -0400] Eric__: seems like my creds, pem, keys, etc. are all good since it works great with ubuntu
[2013-08-25 19:19:18 -0400] lazyPower: does the knife bootstrap fail after you'e ssh'd in on your own?
[2013-08-25 19:19:25 -0400] lazyPower: or is this just a race condition when bootstrapping the node?
[2013-08-25 19:20:19 -0400] Eric__: hmm.  I was only trying that from my workstation.  If I ssh in and run it, what would the syntax be?  I know the knife command works there.
[2013-08-25 19:20:48 -0400] lazyPower: i mean, re-run knife bootstrap on the instance after you've verified you can get in
[2013-08-25 19:22:43 -0400] Eric__: yeah, I tried that from my workstation, and it fails with the same ssh error - like it can't find the public key for root - but then I use the same command to ssh on my own and it finds it just fine.
[2013-08-25 19:23:50 -0400] lazyPower: Odd. I'm not realy sure - i've bootstrapped several ubuntu instances but have not tried a centos install yet.
[2013-08-25 19:24:15 -0400] lazyPower: I'm fairly green - should probably disclaim any and all of my advice there while i'm at it.
[2013-08-25 19:25:37 -0400] Eric__: this is the output I get from both the bootstrap command and the create command:
[2013-08-25 19:25:40 -0400] Eric__: knife bootstrap ec2-54-226-180-92.compute-1.amazonaws.com Bootstrapping Chef on ec2-54-226-180-92.compute-1.amazonaws.com Failed to authenticate root - trying password auth
[2013-08-25 19:26:13 -0400] lazyPower: hmm. is there a way to get -vv output from the ssh command?
[2013-08-25 19:26:20 -0400] lazyPower: would be helpful to debug the handshake
[2013-08-25 19:26:42 -0400] Eric__: yeah, its making me just want to go ahead and use ubuntu instead of centos, but I've never used Ubuntu and have a bunch of centos servers already.  Oh well...
[2013-08-25 19:27:10 -0400] Eric__: Yeah, I have a crap ton of the -VV output, but I'd hate to put it all up here on this wall.  Is that okay?
[2013-08-25 19:27:22 -0400] lazyPower: gist.github.com
[2013-08-25 19:27:25 -0400] lazyPower: pastebin.ca
[2013-08-25 19:27:31 -0400] Eric__: got it

[2013-08-25 19:30:24 -0400] lazyPower: well its trying the public key and failing.
[2013-08-25 19:30:47 -0400] lazyPower: are you sudo'ing your knife command?
[2013-08-25 19:32:09 -0400] Eric__: no
[2013-08-25 19:32:36 -0400] lazyPower: i'm at a loss.
[2013-08-25 19:33:02 -0400] Eric__: yeah - especially since normal ssh and using Ubuntu work great.  Oh well.  Thanks for trying!
[2013-08-25 19:34:55 -0400] lazyPower: I'll keep brain bending on it, if you're around and i think of something i'll poke you
[2013-08-25 19:35:07 -0400] lazyPower: kind of split focus - troubleshooting a client's wordpress woes
[2013-08-25 21:19:50 -0400] daos: is there a way to adjust the checkout_branch in the git provider?
[2013-08-25 21:20:03 -0400] daos: specifically: https://github.com/jgoulah/chef/blob/bd9ab98001a65c3212706bfb9d67c87d35852b35/lib/chef/provider/git.rb#L163
[2013-08-25 21:20:29 -0400] daos: i want certain repositories to stay in wahtever branch they are checked out as and not to check out into a local 'deploy' branch
[2013-08-25 21:22:28 -0400] daos: woops
[2013-08-25 21:22:29 -0400] daos: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/provider/git.rb#L156
[2013-08-25 21:22:42 -0400] daos: it looks like this is hard-coded?
[2013-08-25 22:33:43 -0400] maek: how in the world do I use an lwrp in the same cookbook its defined in? I have a cask.rb for resources and provider. Ive tried using cask and cookbookname_cask, both with out luck.
[2013-08-25 22:57:41 -0400] jgoulah: daos: yeah i have been meaning to get the tests working so we can merge that (code works but tests failing), if you have time to help let me know
[2013-08-25 23:33:25 -0400] mydog2: hello? anyone here
[2013-08-25 23:33:51 -0400] gchristensen: hellloooooo (hello [hello])
[2013-08-25 23:34:05 -0400] mydog2: hey gchristensen
[2013-08-25 23:34:12 -0400] gchristensen: hi
[2013-08-25 23:34:42 -0400] mydog2: been reading a bit on chef.. trying to see if it would fit for a project.. are you a guru/schooled in the art of chef?
[2013-08-25 23:34:58 -0400] gchristensen: lol, I've been known to cook here and there
[2013-08-25 23:35:05 -0400] mydog2: cool.. here goes.
[2013-08-25 23:35:23 -0400] mydog2: the project would consist of a bunch of servers, centos
[2013-08-25 23:35:44 -0400] mydog2: i would need a way of basically, installing a different image as required..
[2013-08-25 23:35:56 -0400] mydog2: i take it chef could handle this with no issue..
[2013-08-25 23:36:08 -0400] mydog2: talking about 400-500 servers
[2013-08-25 23:36:20 -0400] gchristensen: a different image? no. chef will configure your servers after they are provisioned and running
[2013-08-25 23:36:21 -0400] mydog2: 10-15 different image types..
[2013-08-25 23:36:52 -0400] mydog2: gc.. so if i have a minimum centos os.. and i then want to copy a vm to it...
[2013-08-25 23:37:12 -0400] gchristensen: you could use chef to configure the software on the machine if you wanted
[2013-08-25 23:37:22 -0400] mydog2: ok.. so that could work..
[2013-08-25 23:37:26 -0400] gchristensen: you could use Docker or Packer (docker.io, packer.io) for making VM images though
[2013-08-25 23:37:28 -0400] mydog2: is chef ruby?
[2013-08-25 23:37:45 -0400] gchristensen: chef is written in ruby, yes, but it isn't difficult to grasp for basic to moderate levels of usage.
[2013-08-25 23:38:54 -0400] mydog2: does chef come with it's own management platform/app to manage the provisioned servers? i couldn't figure that out from the articles i saw.. i assume it does
[2013-08-25 23:39:25 -0400] mydog2: also, does the management console/platform come with the open source process.. or is that the fee based side?
[2013-08-25 23:39:27 -0400] gchristensen: what sort of platform are you looking for? chef-client can be configured to run automatically (on a regular basis)
[2013-08-25 23:39:48 -0400] mydog2: gchristensen,  - the project i'm considering is a distributed crawler...
[2013-08-25 23:39:54 -0400] gchristensen: and it communicates with a centralized chef-server
[2013-08-25 23:40:04 -0400] mydog2: i'm going to have a bunch of actual servers across the net..
[2013-08-25 23:40:30 -0400] mydog2: and i'm going to have a master repos of the fetch/parse apps that get run on the edgeservers
[2013-08-25 23:40:39 -0400] gchristensen: chef-client would be good for installing the crawlers, but wouldn't be suited for say, load balancing/distributing the work, or collecting the results
[2013-08-25 23:40:59 -0400] mydog2: so i'm going to need a way of populating/provisioning the edgeservers with the required software.. as well as the updates
[2013-08-25 23:41:08 -0400] gchristensen: that would be a good role for chef
[2013-08-25 23:41:34 -0400] mydog2: right.. but i'm also going to need a management UI/platform.. web based tool to be able to track/monitor all of this...
[2013-08-25 23:42:10 -0400] mydog2: i assumed it had this.. but couldn't tell..
[2013-08-25 23:42:25 -0400] gchristensen: chef is essentially for getting software deployed, and it has abilities to say, discover the master server your software should talk to.
[2013-08-25 23:42:46 -0400] gchristensen: if you're talking 500 nodes, I recommend setting up a test-bed of say, 15 nodes, to see what it does
[2013-08-25 23:43:15 -0400] mydog2: ok.. so i might need to take something like cacti/nagios/etc. and modify that to my needs to then track the apps on the client machine, and the status of the apps..
[2013-08-25 23:43:45 -0400] mydog2: the open chef.. does it have a limit for the number of client machines i can provision with it..?
[2013-08-25 23:43:58 -0400] gchristensen: yes! definitely. chef is good for configuring munin / nagios / cacti / etc, but does not implement it internally.
[2013-08-25 23:44:10 -0400] gchristensen: and no, I don't believe open source chef-server has any limitations.
[2013-08-25 23:44:45 -0400] mydog2: ok.. so this is a start.. now to find my ruby resource to pay him/her well!
[2013-08-25 23:44:54 -0400] mydog2: gota find a ruby guy!
[2013-08-25 23:45:33 -0400] gchristensen: perhaps not :) perhaps just a chef developer!
[2013-08-25 23:46:03 -0400] gchristensen: my experience suggests a /programmer/ does not necessarily constitute a good sysadmin, even if your sysadmin management tool is in ruby, mydog2
[2013-08-25 23:46:04 -0400] Glace: Hi, I was wondering how would that work if lets say I use berkshelf.. and 2 cookbooks have a common cookbook depencies but with 2 different hard versions.. like for example depend on "DatCookbook version = 1.0.0" and the other cookbook depends on "DatCookbook version 2.0.0"... all that using a chef server
[2013-08-25 23:46:21 -0400] mydog2: gchristensen,  - maybe.. but more than likely.. a ruby guy.. there's another app i'm also looking at - crowdhoster that's ruby...
[2013-08-25 23:46:52 -0400] mydog2: but i know have a bit more faith in chef as a potential tool
[2013-08-25 23:47:08 -0400] mydog2: thanks... plus, i know where to come for more questions/answers
[2013-08-25 23:47:13 -0400] gchristensen: indeed
[2013-08-25 23:48:49 -0400] mydog2: gchristensen,  - looking at creating a distributed crawler for class schedule data.. and to use that data to drive a college comparison textbook app... and to use that.. to provide textbooks that are 25-40% cheaper than the rest of the market..
[2013-08-25 23:49:05 -0400] gchristensen: fascinating idea
[2013-08-25 23:49:21 -0400] mydog2: but i need a powerful toolset/process to monitor the network, as well as the apps on the edgeservers..
[2013-08-25 23:49:39 -0400] gchristensen: I personally like to use Graphite or Munin, and Nagios
[2013-08-25 23:50:36 -0400] mydog2: i was looking at nagios before.. and then came across cacti.. which is similar..plus it's php.. so i could hack out the changes to the web interface..
[2013-08-25 23:51:11 -0400] mydog2: haven't checked graphite..
[2013-08-25 23:51:14 -0400] gchristensen: the nagios backend is not PHP, but I believe the frontend is. its separate tools - a backend and a frontend.
[2013-08-25 23:53:22 -0400] gchristensen: IMO its important to consider that nagios plays a very different role than Cacti: nagios is really good at answering "am I down?" - ie: it doens't graph so well, but its really great at supervising to ensure your systems are within operational parameters
[2013-08-25 23:54:11 -0400] gchristensen: mydog2: comparatively, Cacti and Munin and Graphite, are best at saying "how did I get into this state?" by remembering what happened over time. ie: "How did my database server become down?" "oh, because my disk filled up at about 5mb per second for the last day."
[2013-08-25 23:54:45 -0400] gchristensen: mydog2: munin / cacti / graphite may be capable of alerting, but they are really best at remembering. conversely, nagios may be capable of graphing, but it is really best at alerting.
[2013-08-25 23:55:14 -0400] gchristensen: that's my two cents, anyway. I'm sure someone out there disagrees with me :)
