[2013-08-24 12:29:18 -0400] mikeywaites: hey peeps! Anyone using the opscode postgresql cookbook?
[2013-08-24 16:24:20 -0400] jds_: Hi there
[2013-08-24 16:25:15 -0400] jbz: hallo
[2013-08-24 16:25:18 -0400] jds_: My run list looks like : [apt, git, mysql::server, java, jenkins, rvm::user].  For some reason, after running the java recipe, chef jumps straight to the rvm::user recipe, which fails because it's trying to install rvm for the jenkins user
[2013-08-24 16:25:33 -0400] jds_: Any suggestions why, or where I should look next?
[2013-08-24 16:27:14 -0400] jbz: Does it do this if you specify a recipe in jenkins as well?
[2013-08-24 16:27:54 -0400] jds_: How do you mean?
[2013-08-24 16:28:43 -0400] jbz: hm my first instinct (and that's all it is) would be to see if it ran a specified jenkins recipe - even jenkins::default - in the right place.
[2013-08-24 16:29:05 -0400] jbz: but I have to admit I don't have any experience with that problem.
[2013-08-24 16:34:23 -0400] jds_: Hmm, I tried requesting jenkins::default, which changed the run list to [apt, git, mysql::server, java, jenkins::default, rvm::user], but same problem
[2013-08-24 16:34:54 -0400] jbz: oh hm
[2013-08-24 16:35:03 -0400] jbz: do any of the other cookbooks *call* RVM?
[2013-08-24 16:35:28 -0400] jbz: i.e.include_recipe "rvm"
[2013-08-24 16:35:50 -0400] jbz: if they do, that would cause it to execute out of runlist order, I think, and execute where called.
[2013-08-24 16:36:17 -0400] jbz: So would Jenkins be calling it near the beginning?
[2013-08-24 16:43:04 -0400] jds_: not that I can find
[2013-08-24 16:45:06 -0400] jbz: hm. :-(
[2013-08-24 17:26:15 -0400] jds_: Oh.   I've been looking at the source for jenkins 0.6.3, which has a sane default recipe
[2013-08-24 17:27:01 -0400] jds_: turns out I'm actually using this version - https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/jenkins/blob/master/recipes/default.rb
[2013-08-24 17:27:11 -0400] jds_: which would explain why it's not having any effect...
[2013-08-24 19:12:52 -0400] Khazix: is this a bug? http://sprunge.us/UCCi
