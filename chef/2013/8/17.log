[2013-08-17 00:00:00 -0400] timsmith: you have something rather odd going on.  Out of the box that shouldn't happen
[2013-08-17 00:52:59 -0400] force: thanks for confirming my suspicions, timsmith. :) Migrating to Chef Server 11 is on my todo list, so I'll chop any weird behavior up to things that may be fixed bugs and the legacy diarrhea of chef config that I inherited. I appreciate your input! hasta.
[2013-08-17 02:44:48 -0400] rpcesar: using chef 11, is it possible to execute a recipe without adding it to the run list? i have a staging and production role set up. the staging autodeploys as part of its run list, i need a way to update live just when necessary so deploys not in its run list
[2013-08-17 03:35:07 -0400] StillReal: Greetings
[2013-08-17 03:37:41 -0400] StillReal: I have been using Puppet for a number of years now, and I have finally decided to give Chef a try, it looks really good from all the blog posts I've been reading etc, and I have already encountered first problem.  I am using Debian Wheezy, and I have added the apt.opscode repos and I find they are still using the 0.10 Chef packages not the latest Chef 11, the ones on the download page for Chef 11 only appear to be for Ubuntu 64 bit, are 
[2013-08-17 03:38:36 -0400] StillReal: Also there appears to be about five different ways to install Chef, from gems, from debs, etc ... with lots of conflicting info on the wiki, what is the *recommended* approach for a new Chef user?
[2013-08-17 03:39:51 -0400] StillReal: I had a quick flick through Instant Chef from PacktPub and it appearedto prefer using the out-of-date packages on apt.opscode
[2013-08-17 03:43:18 -0400] dschultz: StillReal: Omnibus installer is the best way to go. It essentially bundles everything needed for Chef and will not affect an already installed version of Ruby/gems/dependencies etc.
[2013-08-17 03:44:35 -0400] StillReal: Thanks Schultz
[2013-08-17 03:45:30 -0400] dschultz: You'll want to add the path to the Omnibus packages to your env PATH, of course. Or create aliases
[2013-08-17 03:50:22 -0400] StillReal: ok so the client appears to use an insta..sh script, the server only comes in a .deb for ubuntu64
[2013-08-17 03:52:34 -0400] StillReal: it's not the end of the world, I can easily install Ubuntu 12.04 to run as a chef server, it would ahve been nice to run it on Debian 7 like the rest of our environment though.
[2013-08-17 04:29:41 -0400] gkra: So What are the limits for what can be done in ruby in an only_if or not_if block?
[2013-08-17 10:19:38 -0400] SynchronE: hi everyone
[2013-08-17 10:19:49 -0400] SynchronE: i'm having issues with "application" cookbook
[2013-08-17 10:20:05 -0400] SynchronE: it states that "before_symlink" callback can be used
[2013-08-17 10:20:27 -0400] SynchronE: but I cannot find an example of specifying it
[2013-08-17 10:21:22 -0400] SynchronE: i tried "application "myapp" do \n before_restart do \n #something \n end \n end but it doesn't seem to work
[2013-08-17 10:21:43 -0400] SynchronE: can anyone hint me the required ruby "code block" syntax for that ?
[2013-08-17 13:15:33 -0400] moleculezz: Hi all
[2013-08-17 13:15:59 -0400] moleculezz: Got a small issue and I don't know where or who I need to contact.
[2013-08-17 13:16:21 -0400] moleculezz: My login on tickets.opscode.com has been removed or something
[2013-08-17 13:16:58 -0400] moleculezz: I tried to request new password.. no go.. request username.. says the email specified does not exists in the system
[2013-08-17 13:18:22 -0400] moleculezz: I haven't logged in since there was the breach on the wiki and tickets system.
[2013-08-17 13:19:01 -0400] moleculezz: Is there a specific opscode email that I can contact to get this sorted out?
[2013-08-17 13:25:26 -0400] moleculezz: Oh right.. it's the wknd lol
[2013-08-17 18:10:21 -0400] karter: hi all - chef newbie here - how does resolve dependencies in chef automatically - frequently i run into cookbook not found and resolve it by downloading it etc., (chef-solo)
[2013-08-17 18:11:57 -0400] bhggdd: Look up berkshelf
[2013-08-17 18:15:30 -0400] karter: bhggdd: i am looking , what will that do? will it attempt to resolve the dependent cookbook from a remote site like opscode?
[2013-08-17 18:17:14 -0400] bhggdd: Yeap.
[2013-08-17 18:48:57 -0400] karter: i just tried the berks - it does not seem to pick up the dependencies - for instance, when i did berks init jenkins - it injested it , then when i do berks contingent jenkins - does not print the other repos when the metadata.rb clearly has them listed
[2013-08-17 18:52:37 -0400] karter: any other way to figure this out programatically
[2013-08-17 18:53:04 -0400] karter: i am trying to do this: when there's a dependency how to pull all the related deps and install it automatically
[2013-08-17 19:09:47 -0400] miah: berks install usually does that ?
[2013-08-17 19:10:17 -0400] miah: then berks upload to install it to the chef server
[2013-08-17 19:25:02 -0400] karter: i tried it with jenkins does not seem to print the dependencies
[2013-08-17 19:31:41 -0400] karter: it appears it does not detect what is in metadata.rb and update the berksfile with dependencies in all cases
[2013-08-17 19:38:09 -0400] EricL: Has anyone written anything to export all data bags to Ruby format?
[2013-08-17 20:37:24 -0400] yfeldblum: librarian-0.1.1 is released; for the curious: https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian/compare/v0.1.0...v0.1.1#diff-1
