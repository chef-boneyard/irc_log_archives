[2013-08-11 01:05:42 -0400] kerouac: is private chef's latest version 1.4.6?
[2013-08-11 01:29:27 -0400] mdevolving: hey guys, having an issue with chef-client writing its client.pem in 10.18.2
[2013-08-11 01:30:01 -0400] mdevolving: the log line is ERROR: Chef::Exceptions::CannotWritePrivateKey: I cannot write your private key to /etc/chef/client.pem
[2013-08-11 01:30:17 -0400] mdevolving: however: INFO: Forked, in 551. Privileges: 0 0
[2013-08-11 01:30:51 -0400] mdevolving: and /etc/chef/ is root:root 0755
[2013-08-11 01:38:26 -0400] mdevolving: ah.. root cause seems to be that i'm trying to connect to the chef server with ssh -L and SSL doesn't play that game
[2013-08-11 05:49:55 -0400] julienphalip: Hi there. Is there any way to display what shell commands actually get executed and their output when running chef recipes?
[2013-08-11 05:52:56 -0400] julienphalip: The context is that I'd like to understand why "package[python] action install" is taking so long to run. Even when Python is already installed, that takes about 5-10 seconds... So I'm hoping to find more clues if only I could see exactly what gets executed.
[2013-08-11 06:47:41 -0400] lledet: Hi, I'm getting "Operation not permitted" when creating a directory but when I check the directory is actually created but it won't change permissions, what can I do?
[2013-08-11 13:40:03 -0400] yoshie902a: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_lwrp.html
[2013-08-11 13:40:23 -0400] yoshie902a: Does not seem to work, any idea if opscode moved the link?
[2013-08-11 14:54:32 -0400] fedgoat: what up with 11.0.8 and nginx config being screwed up and not starting
[2013-08-11 14:54:34 -0400] fedgoat: fix that
[2013-08-11 14:54:51 -0400] fedgoat: Enterprise Linux RPM
[2013-08-11 16:22:54 -0400] xrl: how can I get the cpu architecture using the automatic node attributes? node[:cpu] doesn't seem to have x86/x86_64 or similar
[2013-08-11 16:24:10 -0400] xrl: ah, I guess I was looking for node[:kernel][:machine]
[2013-08-11 16:24:34 -0400] xrl: tracked that down after looking at node[:cpu].automatic and see the word 'kernel'
[2013-08-11 18:44:34 -0400] mosez: hi
[2013-08-11 18:45:14 -0400] mosez: how can i detect within recipes if chef is executed on a vagrant instance? node["instance_role"] == "vagrant" didnt work, node.attribute? "vagrant" neither
[2013-08-11 19:55:28 -0400] mrk___: hey chefs, any cookbook you guys would recommend for Redis?
[2013-08-11 20:18:19 -0400] namidark: On chef-server-webui I make a few environments, add some packages, update it, and then when I go back to edit it, none of the packages show up - is this a known bug or am i doing something wrong?
[2013-08-11 20:33:29 -0400] mosez: is there a simple method to detect if a specific user exists within an only_if block?
[2013-08-11 20:45:02 -0400] gchristensen: mosez: you could do `id <user>`
[2013-08-11 21:11:13 -0400] sickdog: hi all! chef is awesome! ruby = (just ok)
[2013-08-11 21:13:22 -0400] sickdog: Has anyone else tried their luck with opscode EC2 bootstrap totorial?
[2013-08-11 21:13:33 -0400] sickdog: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/EC2+Bootstrap+Fast+Start+Guide
[2013-08-11 21:13:34 -0400] sickdog: ?
[2013-08-11 21:15:05 -0400] sickdog: ERROR: Excon::Errors::SocketError: getaddrinfo: Name or service not known (SocketError)
[2013-08-11 21:15:13 -0400] sickdog: Anyone else see that?
[2013-08-11 21:15:37 -0400] geggam: usually i see that when my hostname isnt defined correctly
[2013-08-11 21:15:46 -0400] sickdog: ah! ok
[2013-08-11 21:15:57 -0400] sickdog: lemme check
[2013-08-11 21:17:06 -0400] sickdog: interesting ..my working theory is that my workstation cannot connect to the (Hosted) chef server
[2013-08-11 21:17:21 -0400] sickdog: hosted by opscode
[2013-08-11 21:19:49 -0400] warreng: anybody use hosted chef with joyent?
[2013-08-11 21:20:59 -0400] sickdog: does the workstation need a dns entry?
[2013-08-11 21:32:36 -0400] pkwong: oh their proprietary stuff? the cf?
[2013-08-11 21:32:51 -0400] pkwong: (joyent's proprietary fabric)?
[2013-08-11 21:34:50 -0400] sickdog: How do I set up my hostname with EC2?
[2013-08-11 21:36:23 -0400] pkwong: that's an interesting question.  I noticed alot of people talking about properly setting up the hostname, but there really isn't any source of truth regarding it.
[2013-08-11 21:36:44 -0400] mosez: gchristensen: i thought there is a "chef" way :)
[2013-08-11 21:40:24 -0400] gchristensen: mosez: not from within an not_if / only_if
[2013-08-11 21:40:44 -0400] gchristensen: but mosez, you could create the user, notify your block, and make the block default to not doing anything.
[2013-08-11 21:41:42 -0400] mosez: gchristensen: i need to check if i'm on a vagrant vm... i dont want to create the user... if there already a vagrnt user exists i want to execute some blocks.
[2013-08-11 21:43:30 -0400] gchristensen: mosez: you may consider, instead, using a node attribute set by vagrant.
[2013-08-11 21:44:14 -0400] mosez: gchristensen: in the paste there was an attribute..... but it seems to be gone.
[2013-08-11 21:46:43 -0400] mosez: node[:virtualization] with {"system"=>"vbox", "role"=>"guest"} seems to be the only indicator.
[2013-08-11 21:49:11 -0400] gchristensen: mosez: and even then, fragile. I like to be explicit about it instead, and have vagrant set node attributes node['is_in_vagrant'] = true
[2013-08-11 21:54:59 -0400] mosez: gchristensen: i know.... in the past there was node["instance_role"] == "vagrant". but i dont know why it have been dropped.

[2013-08-11 23:23:15 -0400] ohlol: anyone use the jenkins cookbook?
[2013-08-11 23:23:42 -0400] ohlol: it installs my plugins but for some reason they don't get loaded
[2013-08-11 23:32:43 -0400] ohlol: oh, i need to make dependencies explicit
[2013-08-11 23:34:34 -0400] yfeldblum: indeed you do
