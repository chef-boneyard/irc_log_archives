[2013-08-04 01:16:36 -0400] coderanger: Lovely, I have test-kitchen reliably segfaulting
[2013-08-04 07:34:59 -0400] mackwerk_: Hello, I am trying to create a raid on an instance I've launched with knife but the aws cookbook is giving me this error: "ERROR: Missing gem 'right_aws'. Use the default aws recipe to install it first.", shouldn't it install it's dependncies by itself? How do I get chef to install it while it's cooking the recipies? :o
[2013-08-04 07:37:39 -0400] coderanger: mackwerk_: How are you trying to do it?
[2013-08-04 07:37:52 -0400] coderanger: You need to make sure recipe[aws] is getting run
[2013-08-04 07:38:31 -0400] mackwerk_: coderanger: ooooh, okay I only have it as a dependency in my own recipe's metadata.rb
[2013-08-04 07:38:38 -0400] mackwerk_: So I should add it to the run_list right?
[2013-08-04 07:39:35 -0400] coderanger: Or use include_recipe from your cookbook
[2013-08-04 07:40:41 -0400] mackwerk_: coderanger: in my recipes/default.rb for example?
[2013-08-04 07:40:46 -0400] coderanger: Yarp
[2013-08-04 07:40:51 -0400] coderanger: Probably at the top
[2013-08-04 07:40:58 -0400] coderanger: include_recipe 'aws'
[2013-08-04 07:41:09 -0400] mackwerk_: Cool, thanks I'll give this a try again
[2013-08-04 07:42:17 -0400] coderanger: Oh god, I'm doing TDD, someone stop me
[2013-08-04 07:43:01 -0400] mackwerk_: coderanger: TDD? :o
[2013-08-04 07:44:29 -0400] coderanger: mackwerk_: test driven development
[2013-08-04 07:49:22 -0400] mackwerk_: Can't be that bad :P
[2013-08-04 07:51:12 -0400] coderanger: It is usually a bad idea, in this particular case it works out well because I'm coding backwards from the interface I want to present to python devs
[2013-08-04 07:51:22 -0400] coderanger: Just need to figure out how to make that happen
[2013-08-04 10:11:49 -0400] mackwerk_: I'm  using th chef aws cookbook to attach 6 disks in raid with the xfs filesystem but I'm getting this back from chef wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/md0, I'm running xfs_repair /dev/md0 now though, just wondering if it's a known bug or something? :o
[2013-08-04 12:45:56 -0400] kvs: mackwerk_: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/aws/blob/master/providers/ebs_raid.rb#L394
[2013-08-04 12:46:31 -0400] kvs: mackwerk_: unfortunately, it only supports ext4 right now. it should be easy to add xfs-support, but if you don't want to fork etc., you could also just mkfs by hand
[2013-08-04 12:55:58 -0400] zrankfappa: hi all
[2013-08-04 12:56:18 -0400] zrankfappa: please for the love of all things good, is there anyone here who uses knife with ec2 pluggin?
[2013-08-04 12:56:40 -0400] zrankfappa: i've been posted the same question for 4 days in here and still not manged to answer what I suspect is a simple question
[2013-08-04 12:56:49 -0400] zrankfappa: sorry to keep repeating teh same question
[2013-08-04 12:56:54 -0400] zrankfappa: hi all, can anyone advise the best way to get my bootstrap target to use a http_proxy, it seems the --bootstrap-proxy 'http://10.0.1.50:3128' is not a valid option when using 'knife ec2 server create'
[2013-08-04 12:57:08 -0400] zrankfappa: i tried also using --user-data to append to /etc/environment
[2013-08-04 13:38:37 -0400] zrankfappa: oki, maybe another hopefully simple question someone could shed some light on
[2013-08-04 13:39:01 -0400] zrankfappa: pls bear in mind i'm completely new to chef/opscde/ruby etc.
[2013-08-04 13:39:13 -0400] zrankfappa: how can i make use of this on my current system, https://github.com/opscode/knife-ec2/pull/21/files
[2013-08-04 13:39:23 -0400] zrankfappa: i think this enables the option i want to use
[2013-08-04 13:54:16 -0400] serjs: Hello! Can i get all packages installed by package resource in chef?
[2013-08-04 15:23:50 -0400] ociuhandu: hi all, anyone could give me a clue on how to remove a role from a node from inside a recipe?
[2013-08-04 15:28:11 -0400] coderanger: ociuhandu: You can update node.run_list, but this only works in some cases, if the role was added via another role recursively then it won't work
[2013-08-04 15:33:30 -0400] ociuhandu: coderanger: the role is already applied from previous runs
[2013-08-04 15:34:50 -0400] coderanger: ociuhandu: https://github.com/mattray/mattray-cookbooks/blob/master/one-shot/recipes/default.rb#L28
[2013-08-04 15:35:56 -0400] ociuhandu: coderanger: thanks
[2013-08-04 15:44:42 -0400] ociuhandu: coderanger: just checked, in my case the role is added via another role's run_list. Is there any way to remove it in this case?
[2013-08-04 16:45:15 -0400] coderanger: ociuhandu: No, since thats just not the way things work
[2013-08-04 16:53:18 -0400] mikem: hey guys im new to chef, but i havent been able to solve this problem.  When i do a knife node list i return a list of hosts, however if i do a knife node show <nodename> it says object cannot be found.
[2013-08-04 16:59:06 -0400] coderanger: Are you using the node name or the node's hostname, the two are not always the same
[2013-08-04 16:59:19 -0400] mikem: i tried both ways
[2013-08-04 16:59:48 -0400] mikem: knife node list returns unbuntu54
[2013-08-04 16:59:53 -0400] mikem: among others
[2013-08-04 17:00:12 -0400] mikem: but knife node show unbuntu54 says object couldnt be found
[2013-08-04 17:00:25 -0400] coderanger: Unless your server is super mega busted, I'm not sure how that could happen
[2013-08-04 17:00:41 -0400] coderanger: Just be really sure you have the name right
[2013-08-04 17:00:49 -0400] mikem: its hosted at opscode
[2013-08-04 17:01:37 -0400] mikem: wish there was more debuging info
[2013-08-04 17:06:50 -0400] mikem: thanks coderanger
[2013-08-04 17:07:22 -0400] coderanger: mikem: knife node show -VV <node name>
[2013-08-04 17:07:31 -0400] coderanger: can haz pastebin?
[2013-08-04 17:08:34 -0400] mikem: 404 object not found
[2013-08-04 17:09:51 -0400] coderanger: Can you pastebin the output of that and the output of knife node list -VV?

[2013-08-04 17:13:33 -0400] coderanger: easy way to share large amounts of text without drowning out the channel

[2013-08-04 17:19:51 -0400] mikem: sigh
[2013-08-04 17:19:54 -0400] mikem: lol
[2013-08-04 17:20:13 -0400] mikem: thats why i like centos

[2013-08-04 17:20:49 -0400] gchristensen: why is that?
[2013-08-04 17:20:52 -0400] coderanger: I had one of my tk test boxes set as "cento-6.4" all of last night, so none are immune
[2013-08-04 17:21:16 -0400] gchristensen: coderanger: it doesn't magically fix pebcak errors?? ;)
[2013-08-04 17:21:25 -0400] mikem: thank you!
[2013-08-04 17:21:29 -0400] coderanger: Also a friend pointed out CoreOS == C...Oreos
[2013-08-04 17:22:06 -0400] mikem: oreos are awesome
[2013-08-04 17:23:14 -0400] mikem: thanks coderanger.  time to do some real chef work now
[2013-08-04 17:23:57 -0400] coderanger: Good luck

[2013-08-04 17:44:08 -0400] bleubeard: I am seeking guidance with this error https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6151148
[2013-08-04 17:55:32 -0400] gkarekinian: bleubeard: You're missing a "depends 'mysql'" in your cookbook's metadata.rb
[2013-08-04 17:58:07 -0400] bleubeard: I got the same error
[2013-08-04 18:00:18 -0400] bleubeard: And if I were to also add depends 'database' I still get the ERROR: Running exception handlers part without the full error text
[2013-08-04 18:01:59 -0400] gkarekinian: Oops, I forgot the providers moved to the database cookbook
[2013-08-04 18:18:23 -0400] bleubeard: gkarekinian: Figured it out, I think. Commented out postgresql, aws, and xfs depends from database's metadata.rb
[2013-08-04 18:19:41 -0400] bleubeard: I don't have those cookbooks installed
[2013-08-04 18:19:46 -0400] gkarekinian: Did you install the cookbook by hand? You should use something like librarian-chef or at least "knife site cookbook install"
[2013-08-04 18:20:13 -0400] bleubeard: i used knife-github-cookbooks
[2013-08-04 18:22:22 -0400] bleubeard: I'm working off of this tutorial http://chrislaco.com/devops-toolbox ; it is a bit dated so I've been having to figure out quite a bit on my own

[2013-08-04 19:10:20 -0400] tos9: Hi. The bug tracker appears completely down after the security breach? Does anyone know off-hand if the fact that knife doesn't appear to properly parse command line options before subcommands is a known issue?
[2013-08-04 19:10:44 -0400] tos9: i.e. `knife --config=~/my/config search stuff` tells me I need to provide a subcommand.
[2013-08-04 19:35:12 -0400] ssd7: tos9: Yes, it is down because of the sec. breach.  I believe that is a known issue, but I can check for you.
[2013-08-04 19:37:39 -0400] tos9: ssd7: OK, thanks for confirming. It's not a big deal at all -- I can wait until things settle down, unless you ahve it within close reach and wouldn't mind :)
[2013-08-04 19:59:00 -0400] ssd7: tos9: I wasn't able to find a bug that matched that but I've definitely seen the behavior before.  Once JIRA is back up, feel free to file it.  If someone with more JIRA search fu than I finds it later, we can just mark it as a dup
[2013-08-04 20:01:19 -0400] tos9: ssd7: Cool, thanks a lot for checking, I'll keep my eye out.
[2013-08-04 20:55:30 -0400] freedrull: can you override a template from a community cookbook without directly editing the community cookbook?
