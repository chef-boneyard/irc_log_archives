[2013-03-10 00:00:20 -0500] ranjibd: jtimberman: did you decided anything on the knife-google thing?
[2013-03-10 00:24:16 -0500] jtimberman: ranjibd: i have been out of the office this week at a training.
[2013-03-10 00:24:28 -0500] ranjibd: oh. oj
[2013-03-10 00:24:38 -0500] ranjibd: *ok
[2013-03-10 03:48:00 -0400] Guest5610: i'm trying to install the chef-server deb on digital ocean, but can't seem to load the web-ui... can anyone help?
[2013-03-10 03:37:03 -0400] mayank11g: hey Guys
[2013-03-10 03:37:31 -0400] mayank11g: So i am using private chef, which is running on a custom port (https://host:8991)
[2013-03-10 03:38:05 -0400] mayank11g: now I am not able to upload any cookbook even though I have changed the port in knife.rb
[2013-03-10 03:38:11 -0400] mayank11g: any suggestions?
[2013-03-10 03:42:19 -0400] mayank11g: anyone, has any suggestions please?
[2013-03-10 04:55:20 -0400] joshka: Hi #chef. I'm a chef n00b hoping for some answers to my questions. Hope there's someone around that might be able to help.
[2013-03-10 04:56:25 -0400] joshka: I'm aiming for a dev environment setup to move a small team (4 devs) away from shared server development (LAMP)
[2013-03-10 04:57:14 -0400] joshka: source code in bitbucket. thinking of using vagrant, ubuntu, chef for dev. then AWS for prod.
[2013-03-10 04:57:23 -0400] joshka: does this sound sensible
[2013-03-10 04:59:01 -0400] joshka: Q2. Is chef 11 the current recommended release?
[2013-03-10 06:03:16 -0400] avleen: yes.
[2013-03-10 08:34:01 -0400] alex__: Hi I'm creating raid ebs using the aws cookbook.  The raid configuration doesn't survive a reboot. Any idea how I can fix this?
[2013-03-10 10:47:51 -0400] pnorman: I'm following the learnchef guide but opscode\chef\bin\knife is looking for c:/opscode/chef/embedded/bin/ruby.exe. This is a problem because i didn't install to c:/opscode/, I installed to e:/opscode/
[2013-03-10 10:49:43 -0400] pnorman: I could fix the file, but it's the same with many other files
[2013-03-10 11:13:09 -0400] DinMamma: Gooooood Morning.
[2013-03-10 11:14:18 -0400] DinMamma: I have encountered a problem which Ive not had before just now. I cant bootstrap an EC2 node. I have the keys in my keyring so I can do a "ssh ubuntu@server" without any issues but when bootstrapping I get prompted for a password for the ubuntu user.
[2013-03-10 11:14:29 -0400] DinMamma: When running with high verbosity I get the following at the end
[2013-03-10 11:14:31 -0400] DinMamma: ERROR: all authorization methods failed (tried none, publickey, hostbased, password, keyboard-interactive)
[2013-03-10 11:15:07 -0400] DinMamma: Which is very odd, seeing how I actually have the key in my keyring.
[2013-03-10 11:15:32 -0400] DinMamma: Unfortunately there is no more debugging levels so I cant see which keys chef tried to use etc.
[2013-03-10 11:15:41 -0400] DinMamma: Anyone had similar issues?
[2013-03-10 11:17:02 -0400] DinMamma: AWh, hells no!
[2013-03-10 11:17:14 -0400] DinMamma: Just for fun I tried putting ubuntu as password, and lo and behold it worked.
[2013-03-10 11:17:21 -0400] DinMamma: Something weird is going on.
[2013-03-10 11:18:49 -0400] DinMamma: Removing my keys from my keyring and trying the same thing failed.
[2013-03-10 11:19:28 -0400] DinMamma: Actually, it seems like any password I put in is enough to make it work.
[2013-03-10 11:20:00 -0400] DinMamma:  knife bootstrap -x ubuntu --bootstrap-version=10.22.0 --sudo $HIGHLY_SECRET_SERVER
[2013-03-10 11:20:05 -0400] DinMamma: Is how I bootstrap the server.
[2013-03-10 14:44:30 -0400] RNC: Hi
[2013-03-10 14:44:36 -0400] RNC: any tips on how to solve this? "Unable to activate net-scp-1.1.0, because net-ssh-2.2.2 conflicts with net-ssh (>= 2.6.5)"
[2013-03-10 14:45:05 -0400] RNC: I've tried gem uninstalling and installing different combinations of versions for net-ssh, with no help
[2013-03-10 15:21:45 -0400] RNC: installing a newer version of Chef seems to have fixed it
[2013-03-10 15:53:45 -0400] bjensen: um where can I find usage information on how to define nested roles? I can't find it in the docs.. :-/
[2013-03-10 15:58:52 -0400] zts: bjensen: if you mean having Role B include Role A, you just need to add "role[A]" to B's run_list
[2013-03-10 15:59:07 -0400] bjensen: ah there we go. Thanks mate :)
[2013-03-10 16:00:23 -0400] zts: you're welcome :)
[2013-03-10 16:19:32 -0400] bjensen: um does anyone here use redid and have a link to their preferred redis cookbook? I see a lot of faulty ones when I google and on opscode..
[2013-03-10 16:20:47 -0400] bjensen: redid = redis ofcause
[2013-03-10 16:53:22 -0400] solarce: bjensen: i haven't used it, but i've heard good things about miah's cookbook, https://github.com/miah/chef-redis
[2013-03-10 16:53:40 -0400] bjensen: thanks. Thats actually the one I'm trying out with now :)
[2013-03-10 16:53:51 -0400] bjensen: but there are a lot of forks out there, so it was just dumb luck
[2013-03-10 17:21:56 -0400] mnoble: Hey everyone. Does anyone know if there's a (relatively) simple way of introspecting the progress of a chef-solo run? All I'm looking for is a really naive "percent done"; ie: current step / total steps.
[2013-03-10 17:25:58 -0400] siezer: mnoble try the nyan-cat formatter
[2013-03-10 17:28:10 -0400] mnoble: siezer: thanks
[2013-03-10 18:49:55 -0400] siezer: anyone around that has used test-kitchen 1.0 / jamie-ci?
[2013-03-10 18:50:05 -0400] siezer: trying to give it a whirl, but get stuck here: https://gist.github.com/someara/ff886ad240609c1f2c10
[2013-03-10 18:55:09 -0400] bjensen: has anyone successfully used  https://github.com/miah/chef-redis ?
[2013-03-10 18:59:11 -0400] siezer: coderanger you around?
[2013-03-10 18:59:18 -0400] coderanger: Yep

[2013-03-10 19:00:09 -0400] coderanger: Never used it, sorry
[2013-03-10 19:00:12 -0400] siezer: drat
[2013-03-10 19:00:26 -0400] coderanger: poke jtimberman or schisamo :)
[2013-03-10 19:00:29 -0400] siezer: I figured you'd be all up in that
[2013-03-10 19:00:46 -0400] coderanger: No, webui2 and pycon have been eating my brain for the last 6 months
[2013-03-10 19:00:49 -0400] coderanger: >_<
[2013-03-10 19:00:54 -0400] siezer: righto

[2013-03-10 20:56:31 -0400] bjensen: Im trying to install redis using  https://github.com/miah/chef-redis but when I do include_recipe "redis::server_package" then nothing happens.
[2013-03-10 20:57:43 -0400] serversideup: Hi all, I am getting a "configure: error: Cannot find libmysqlclient under /usr." when installing the PHP cookbook on an Ubuntu 12.04 x64 server. I am compiling PHP from source. Besides the output on the screen, where is a good place to look at the logs of where it is creating this error?
[2013-03-10 22:03:59 -0400] siezer: is berkshelf being super slow with vagrant for anybody else?
[2013-03-10 22:35:24 -0400] dsmit: hi, new to chef, looks great.  I'm trying to roll my first application, however i'm having issues getting chef to download from svn, i've created a recipe that inherits application but it doesnt like svn_username or svn_password, wonder what i'm doing wrong
[2013-03-10 23:55:05 -0400] ShawnMcCool: i just wanted to come in here and say thanks to everyone. i don't know what it was.. but after a bunch of struggling wrapping my mind around Chef the world just shifted 3 degrees and now I see clearly. thanks to everyone who has helped me, really appreciate it. now i must sleep.
