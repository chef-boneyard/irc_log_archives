[2013-03-17 02:24:35 -0400] mh`: should installing chef server omnibus result in the creation of a linux user 'chef'?
[2013-03-17 02:24:57 -0400] mh`: it didn't, and the chef-client recipe breaks as it seems to expect that
[2013-03-17 02:30:27 -0400] mh`: ah, it created a 'chef_server' user.
[2013-03-17 02:30:51 -0400] mh`: but the issue with the chef-client having this hardcoded expectation (afaict) still stands
[2013-03-17 02:44:09 -0400] mh`: ah i see the bug
[2013-03-17 02:44:10 -0400] mh`: heh
[2013-03-17 03:03:45 -0400] mh`: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-2607
[2013-03-17 04:01:12 -0400] mh`: if anyone is around that's qualified to hazard a guess as to the desired behavior here, in terms of picking a user to own the chef-client directories, I'll do a fix

[2013-03-17 08:29:16 -0400] pellis: this is a bit silly but looks like I can't find a cookbook for GraphicsMagick - anyone bumped into one?
[2013-03-17 08:52:52 -0400] me2resh: Hi,
[2013-03-17 08:52:59 -0400] me2resh: i am getting this error "gem_package[mysql] (mysql::client line 56) had an error: mysql requires Ruby version >= 1.8.7. " any help ?
[2013-03-17 09:57:32 -0400] sn0wb1rd: me2resh: specify a version for "mysql" ruby gem that is supported by Ruby 1.8.7
[2013-03-17 09:58:37 -0400] me2resh: sn0wb1rd: I did that, but once i restart the machine ruby switches back to the old version 1.8.6
[2013-03-17 10:01:40 -0400] kesor: is there a variable that I can use in my cookbook that has the name of the cookbook in it?
[2013-03-17 10:12:29 -0400] kesor: how can I use chef-rewind with application/application_ruby cookbooks? the resources are used in a deploy stage, and rewind can't find them. how do I rewind something from the deploy stage?
[2013-03-17 11:54:31 -0400] Gromit: Hi, I try to get familar with chef-solo and vagrant. While using the mysql-server recipe I get wrong constant name PlatformFamily? Where should I look for my mistake?
[2013-03-17 11:58:16 -0400] Gromit: the recipies for ntp/apt/apache2 are working, mysql-client too. Ich try to provision http://mathie-vagrant-boxes.s3.amazonaws.com/debian_squeeze_32.box to get a running LAMP
[2013-03-17 11:59:01 -0400] Gromit: And I assume, something does not get the distribution and architecture. The virtualization is done by virtualbox 4.2
[2013-03-17 11:59:13 -0400] Gromit: Does anyone have a hint?
[2013-03-17 12:27:04 -0400] railsraider: wired issue with template http://pastie.org/6580589 for some reason it adds a ? at the extension

[2013-03-17 12:27:35 -0400] railsraider: anyone has idea why?
[2013-03-17 12:41:27 -0400] railsraider: my bad forgoto to chomp
[2013-03-17 12:58:51 -0400] Gromit: ok, it works ... I had to update the chef's version on the client.
[2013-03-17 12:58:54 -0400] Gromit: Now it works.
[2013-03-17 13:17:39 -0400] pehlert: Hey folks, is there any easy way to upload my encrypted data bag secret to all nodes post bootstrap?
[2013-03-17 13:41:49 -0400] countdigi: scp? :-) how many nodes u talking?
[2013-03-17 13:48:15 -0400] kechagia: I'm trying to find the sourcecode for chef-server 0.11, without success. Is 0.11 not opensource anymore? Can it only be installed using the packages on http://www.opscode.com/chef/install?
[2013-03-17 13:48:22 -0400] kechagia: It's not on rubygems either
[2013-03-17 13:49:13 -0400] countdigi: https://github.com/opscode/chef/tree/11-stable
[2013-03-17 13:51:33 -0400] countdigi: looks like thats 11.4: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/11-stable/lib/chef/version.rb
[2013-03-17 13:53:38 -0400] pehlert: Hey, is there any Chef server upgrade guide?
[2013-03-17 13:53:46 -0400] pehlert: Or is the cookbook capable of that?
[2013-03-17 13:54:05 -0400] pehlert: Downtime is acceptable for me, so I hope it won't be a big deal ;-)
[2013-03-17 13:54:12 -0400] pehlert: 10 -> 11 that is, sorry
[2013-03-17 13:55:05 -0400] countdigi: google "upgrade chef 11": http://www.opscode.com/blog/2013/03/12/5106/
[2013-03-17 13:55:41 -0400] pehlert: countdigi: I googled almost the same term and didn't find it. Thank you very much
[2013-03-17 13:56:12 -0400] countdigi: no worries
[2013-03-17 13:57:01 -0400] kechagia: countdigi: I saw that, but that's only the client component, is'nt it?
[2013-03-17 13:58:25 -0400] kechagia: https://rubygems.org/gems/chef-server <- latest version 10.24.0
[2013-03-17 14:01:59 -0400] cwj: kechagia: what in particular are you trying to accomplish? the packaging system for chef 11 is kind of complex, so depending on what your aims are you might have to dig into those scripts
[2013-03-17 14:05:57 -0400] kechagia: cwj: 1/ I don't like the bundled-applicance approach, it's very unflexible, imo unprofessional and it takes away a lot of flexibility. It's nice to have it, but it shouldn't be the only way to be able to use chef.
[2013-03-17 14:06:56 -0400] kechagia: cwj: 2/ I thought the chef-server part is opensource too (which is important for me, especially for infrastructure-critical code). thus I'm wondering why it's so hart to get access to the sources/git repo. And why there isn't even a gem released or something.
[2013-03-17 14:08:03 -0400] kechagia: So I'm under the impression right now, that it's only posibbble to get chef running by using the bundled packages (which I think would be sad).
[2013-03-17 14:08:04 -0400] countdigi: did u look here?
[2013-03-17 14:08:06 -0400] countdigi: http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/
[2013-03-17 14:08:27 -0400] kechagia: The red chef-0.10-only note here kinda sounds like that http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installing+Chef+Server+using+Chef+Solo
[2013-03-17 14:08:31 -0400] countdigi: not sure ur platform, cheff 11.0.6 for el6 is there
[2013-03-17 14:08:40 -0400] countdigi: chef-server that is
[2013-03-17 14:09:48 -0400] kechagia: cwj: furthermore, I'd like to have the (apt) repositories updated too, as this makes (security) patching/upgrading less painful and just makes sense.
[2013-03-17 14:11:58 -0400] kechagia: countdigi: that's the bundled packages I'm talking about
[2013-03-17 14:13:38 -0400] cwj: kechagia: well chef-server has a few different components. i believe under chef 11 the api server piece previously distributed as the 'chef-server' gem is now an erlang program, available at https://github.com/opscode/erchef
[2013-03-17 14:14:05 -0400] cwj: the source is out there :)
[2013-03-17 14:14:43 -0400] cwj: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef/ is the source for the scripts used with the omnibus packaging system to generate those full stack installers
[2013-03-17 14:15:30 -0400] cwj: if you want to build a chef server manually you'll probably need to dig in there to figure out how its done
[2013-03-17 14:15:49 -0400] kechagia: cwj: ah thanks, so the component names have changed. But good to know it's still open.
[2013-03-17 14:16:04 -0400] mahrob: Hi guys
[2013-03-17 14:16:22 -0400] mahrob: I am having some trouble with chef, can I get some help please!
[2013-03-17 14:16:35 -0400] kechagia: building is not in my intention, but i'd like to have a repository that takes care of packaging chef as well as providing security updates over the how-it-suppoosed-to-be way in the used distribution (apt/yum)
[2013-03-17 14:17:23 -0400] kechagia: I'm wondering why opscode didn't yet update the apt.opscode.com repos, and I asked earlier if opscode plans to do it soon
[2013-03-17 14:17:49 -0400] cwj: kechagia: if you dig deep enough into the omnibus installer stack you should find everything needed to build your own full stack installers, or whatever you want to do
[2013-03-17 14:18:00 -0400] cwj: i dont know anything about opscode's intentions wrt distro packaging
[2013-03-17 14:18:24 -0400] mahrob: I am trying to bootstrap a node from workstation, hosted chef server, but the node is unable to find encrypted_data_bag_secret even though its copied in default location
[2013-03-17 14:19:06 -0400] kechagia: cwj: thanks. maybe someone else can comment on the repository intentions.
[2013-03-17 14:19:18 -0400] kechagia: cwj: great, omnibus-chef and erchef where the repositories i was looking for :)
[2013-03-17 14:19:48 -0400] kechagia: I may write a chef-solo recipe to do the installation, although I'd appreciate official repositories nonetheless :)
[2013-03-17 14:20:07 -0400] cwj: mahrob: if you can post your config/recipe/stacktrace to pastebin or gist, someone might be able to help you
[2013-03-17 14:22:43 -0400] mahrob: cwj: I have posted both bootstrap error as well the stack trace here : http://pastebin.com/5xQUr3su
[2013-03-17 14:25:41 -0400] mahrob: Another question is, once I create data bags from workstation, do I have to sync/commit anything before bootstrapping the node
[2013-03-17 14:33:00 -0400] cwj: mahrob: so you have put your key in place at /etc/chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret ?
[2013-03-17 14:33:38 -0400] mahrob: cwj: thats correct, the file is there, i have verfied that
[2013-03-17 14:33:52 -0400] cwj: on the remote node, to be clear
[2013-03-17 14:34:05 -0400] mahrob: exactly, on the remote node
[2013-03-17 14:34:43 -0400] mahrob: I added knife.rb the path value, so the same gets added to the client.rb on node, the secret file gets copied across as well
[2013-03-17 14:35:02 -0400] cwj: try my_secret = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load_secret('/etc/chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret') and http_ssl_creds = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("#{CHEF_ENV}", "http-ssl", my_secret) ?
[2013-03-17 14:36:03 -0400] mahrob: cwj: So I have to edit the recipe, re-upload it and then try bootstrapping?
[2013-03-17 14:36:38 -0400] cwj: mahrob: you could try it in chef-shell (aka shef prior to chef 11)
[2013-03-17 14:36:51 -0400] cwj: but otherwise yeah you'd need to do what you described
[2013-03-17 14:37:12 -0400] mahrob: cwj: so I have to run chef-shell on node, right
[2013-03-17 14:37:41 -0400] cwj: yeah
[2013-03-17 14:38:21 -0400] kechagia: mahrob: stupid question: did you upload the databags to the server using knife? :)
[2013-03-17 14:38:41 -0400] kechagia: that would explain the 404, i guess
[2013-03-17 14:38:51 -0400] cwj: yeah it probably would :)
[2013-03-17 14:39:16 -0400] mahrob: :kechagia: infact a good question, what I did was create data bags from workstation and then proceed to bootstrap
[2013-03-17 14:39:31 -0400] cwj: i guess i am accustomed to loading keys from a remote url so i mentally conflated the 404 with being unable to load the key :)
[2013-03-17 14:40:03 -0400] cwj: when using the chef client/server model you do need to ensure the data bags are uploaded to the server if they need to be available to client nodes
[2013-03-17 14:41:12 -0400] mahrob: cwj: humm..so after I create data bags, what should be next command..sorry I just started using chef!
[2013-03-17 14:41:37 -0400] kechagia: mahrob: you need to do something like "knife data bag create <yourdatabag>" "knife data bag from file <yourdatabag> *json"
[2013-03-17 14:41:56 -0400] cwj: mahrob: looks like you want to have a bag named http-ssl
[2013-03-17 14:42:03 -0400] cwj: so knife data bag create http-ssl
[2013-03-17 14:42:25 -0400] cwj: then knife data bag from file http-ssl /path/to/your/databagitem.json
[2013-03-17 14:42:34 -0400] cwj: just as kechagia suggested
[2013-03-17 14:42:48 -0400] kechagia: mahrob: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags_encrypt.html
[2013-03-17 14:44:17 -0400] mahrob: ok, this is how I created the data bag and http-ssl item:  knife data bag create test-env; knife data bag create --secret-file test_env.key test-env http-ssl
[2013-03-17 14:45:13 -0400] mahrob: and generated json: knife data bag show test-env http-ssl -Fj > $CHEF_HOME/data_bags/test-env/http-ssl.json
[2013-03-17 14:46:21 -0400] cwj: ok, then you modified $CHEF_HOME/data_bags/test-env/http-ssl.json
[2013-03-17 14:46:59 -0400] cwj: knife data bag from file test-env $CHEF_HOME/data_bags/test-env/http-ssl.json --secret-file test_env.key
[2013-03-17 14:47:02 -0400] mahrob: since we are using common repo in git, so do I have to commit this json file in order to get chef-server to pick it?
[2013-03-17 14:47:33 -0400] cwj: mahrob: unless you've wired up some magic (e.g. git post commit hooks), chef server is agnostic of your git repo
[2013-03-17 14:48:08 -0400] cwj: knife is the api client for the chef server, so 'knife data bag from file' is making authenticated requests against the chef server api, uploading your file
[2013-03-17 14:48:23 -0400] cwj: so you need to commit it to git for your team, and upload it with knife for chef
[2013-03-17 14:50:29 -0400] mahrob: ok, so when I will issue 'knife data bag test-env show http-ssl' it should show the contents, right, that would mean it got uploaded to chef-server
[2013-03-17 14:50:52 -0400] cwj: knife data bag show test-env http-ssl
[2013-03-17 14:51:53 -0400] mahrob: yeah yeah, sorry I got the order wrong..so if that is showing an output, that would mean its in the server right
[2013-03-17 14:52:38 -0400] mrvisser: I'm getting this error when using "sudo gem install knife-ec2":
[2013-03-17 14:52:45 -0400] mrvisser: ~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p318/lib/ruby/1.9.1/mkmf.rb:368:in `try_do': The complier failed to generate an executable file. (RuntimeError)
[2013-03-17 14:52:45 -0400] mrvisser: You have to install development tools first.
[2013-03-17 14:53:02 -0400] mrvisser: does anyone know what this implies?
[2013-03-17 14:53:51 -0400] mrvisser: also, a little above that:
[2013-03-17 14:54:02 -0400] mrvisser: ~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p318/bin/ruby extconf.rb
[2013-03-17 14:54:03 -0400] mrvisser: checking for libxml/parser.h... *** extconf.rb failed ***
[2013-03-17 14:55:03 -0400] mahrob: mrvisser: please check if you have libxml devel package installed..could be because of that..
[2013-03-17 14:55:13 -0400] mrvisser: ah, devel
[2013-03-17 14:55:30 -0400] cwj: yep, you're missing some headers
[2013-03-17 14:55:42 -0400] mrvisser: brew reports no
[2013-03-17 14:56:30 -0400] mahrob: mrvisser: yes please try after installing libxml devel, we have all been there :)
[2013-03-17 14:56:45 -0400] cwj: well homebrew doesnt really have  devel packages afaik, it typically provides the headers as part of installing from source
[2013-03-17 14:56:46 -0400] mrvisser: ok, thanks :) brew doesn't seem to know what it is
[2013-03-17 14:56:55 -0400] mrvisser: ok, that makes sense then
[2013-03-17 14:59:20 -0400] mahrob: cwj: so 'knife data bag show test-env http-ssl' if this has an output, that would mean data bag is the server, right
[2013-03-17 15:00:50 -0400] cwj: mrvisser: maybe you need libxml2 instead of libxml
[2013-03-17 15:01:01 -0400] cwj: mahrob: yeah
[2013-03-17 15:01:13 -0400] mrvisser: cwj: that might be it, I haven't found anything about libxml2-devel for macosx
[2013-03-17 15:01:16 -0400] cwj: mahrob: in your case it should have encrypted content
[2013-03-17 15:01:24 -0400] mrvisser: but I just tried brew link --force libxml2
[2013-03-17 15:01:27 -0400] mrvisser: that might work
[2013-03-17 15:01:55 -0400] mahrob: cwj: humm..I am able to get the output from workstatiion..
[2013-03-17 15:02:57 -0400] cwj: mahrob: and the output appears to be encrypted or no?
[2013-03-17 15:03:26 -0400] cwj: if you upload unencrypted data and ask chef to decrypt it, you'll get an error. but it should be different from the error you were seeing before
[2013-03-17 15:03:46 -0400] mahrob: cwj: thats correct, its encrypted output
[2013-03-17 15:04:16 -0400] cwj: so are you getting the same error on your chef-client node or a different one?
[2013-03-17 15:05:09 -0400] mahrob: cwj: the error I am getting when I bootstrap the node from workstation
[2013-03-17 15:07:19 -0400] cwj: ok, regardless, is it the same error you pasted before or a different one? maybe just pastebin it?
[2013-03-17 15:07:55 -0400] mahrob: cwj; nope its the same error!
[2013-03-17 15:08:27 -0400] cwj: whats the command line you are using for bootstrapping
[2013-03-17 15:10:01 -0400] mahrob: cwj: knife bootstrap --sudo -d chef-full -x username -i test-env.pem -r 'role[webapps]' -N test-env-DNS test-env-DNS
[2013-03-17 15:11:07 -0400] cwj: ok, you need to use the -E flag to specify the environment
[2013-03-17 15:11:16 -0400] cwj: by default the environment is "_default"
[2013-03-17 15:11:53 -0400] mahrob: cwj: humm..would that be a problems, if it is _default
[2013-03-17 15:12:19 -0400] cwj: CHEF_ENV = node.chef_environment
[2013-03-17 15:12:27 -0400] cwj: CHEF_ENV would be '_default'
[2013-03-17 15:12:36 -0400] cwj: http_ssl_creds = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("_default", "http-ssl")
[2013-03-17 15:12:53 -0400] cwj: is what your system is doing
[2013-03-17 15:13:02 -0400] cwj: your data bag is named test-env, not _default
[2013-03-17 15:14:13 -0400] mahrob: cwj: ok that would make sense! sure let me try that and see if it resolves the isssue. If not, I will be back here :) Thanks a lot for all the help!!
[2013-03-17 15:14:28 -0400] cwj: you're welcome
[2013-03-17 15:15:26 -0400] mahrob: cwj: one last thing, what would this mean: NoMethodError: undefined method `run_list' for nil:NilClass
[2013-03-17 15:16:08 -0400] cwj: please pastebin a stack trace with the command you are running :)
[2013-03-17 15:19:22 -0400] mahrob: cwj: ok that's probably something else, I will check on that, while I test bootstrapping with -E option. Thanks man!
[2013-03-17 15:20:50 -0400] cwj: mahrob: it sounds like http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3863 but without that information i can only guess
[2013-03-17 15:22:02 -0400] mahrob: cwj: most likely that one, thanks for the link!
[2013-03-17 15:26:39 -0400] mrvisser: I'm looking at chef right now to try and streamline the setup and teardown of a staging, QA and performance testing environment for my application
[2013-03-17 15:26:50 -0400] mrvisser: also a single-node demo environment
[2013-03-17 15:28:06 -0400] mrvisser: ideally, one would be able to: a) create an amazon ec2 account, b) install knife, c) run a command with an environment file that will create the instances needed to do the above
[2013-03-17 15:28:44 -0400] mrvisser: is this something that chef should be able to handle?
[2013-03-17 15:32:33 -0400] cwj: mrvisser: a file containing a chef environment doesn't specify what nodes should exist, its data sets cookbook versions and node attributes
[2013-03-17 15:32:46 -0400] cwj: mrvisser: you can however, use chef with cloudformation scripts
[2013-03-17 15:33:07 -0400] mrvisser: cwj: I see. I've been toying around with cloudify this weekend as well which looks interesting
[2013-03-17 15:33:21 -0400] mrvisser: I'll have a look at cloudformation scripts. do you have any experience with cloudify?
[2013-03-17 15:33:26 -0400] cwj: i do not
[2013-03-17 15:34:33 -0400] mrvisser: ok. seems kind of neat, and recently added chef support. I've been able to define my nodes in an environment file, and run a single command that sets up a chef server
[2013-03-17 15:34:59 -0400] mrvisser: pretty close to getting a chef-server+cassandra node deployed using the travis-ci chef cookbooks
[2013-03-17 15:35:40 -0400] mrvisser: though I wish cloudify would spend less resources trying to create their own recipes, and just build more into chef support. big potential there.
[2013-03-17 15:38:57 -0400] cwj: i think its interesting that they advertise no vendor lock-in but on some level it seems they are who you are getting locked into
[2013-03-17 15:39:20 -0400] cwj: of course cloudformation is the same situation
[2013-03-17 15:39:32 -0400] cwj: more or less
[2013-03-17 15:43:29 -0400] mrvisser: yea, must be just referring to the cloud host as they claim to be cloud agnostic (though nothing seems to be well tested outside of amazon ?)
[2013-03-17 15:43:56 -0400] mrvisser: their platform is open-source as well, ASL 2.0 it seems, so I guess you aren't locked into them, but they are the official support
[2013-03-17 15:44:16 -0400] mrvisser: so in general, I don't scoff too much at the claim... yet :) lets see how far I can get without giving them money :)
[2013-03-17 15:44:30 -0400] cwj: hehe
[2013-03-17 16:09:06 -0400] kesor: can I use the syntax          action :before_restart do  end       inside my recipes? or is that only for providers/x.rb files?
[2013-03-17 16:09:45 -0400] kesor: I want to add/remove something from application_ruby/unicorn before_restart action, but I don't really want to fork it  monkey patch or override is the better option, only I can't figure out how to do that.
[2013-03-17 16:16:50 -0400] cwj: kesor: the application_* cookbooks implement subresources of the application lwrp, so some of the actions available to you inside an application resource, like before_restart, do not exist elsewhere
[2013-03-17 16:17:30 -0400] cwj: kesor: what behavior in particular are you trying to change?
[2013-03-17 16:17:36 -0400] kesor: cwj: but what Is before_restart? it seems its a ruby_block, which is what? ruby code? chef code? why can't I use chef-rewind in it for example?
[2013-03-17 16:17:49 -0400] kesor: I try to get runit out of my cookbooks.
[2013-03-17 16:18:20 -0400] kesor: when I opted for chef, I didn't realize I was also agreeing to use runit everywhere.
[2013-03-17 16:18:50 -0400] kesor: and now it takes me weeks to try and get it out without forking everything and creating code duplication that will be hard to upgrade in the future  :(
[2013-03-17 16:19:22 -0400] cwj: the actions available are defined here https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application/blob/master/libraries/default.rb#L48
[2013-03-17 16:19:27 -0400] cwj: and then they are called here https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application/blob/master/providers/default.rb
[2013-03-17 16:20:04 -0400] cwj: if you have an aversion to runit you are probably going to have to write a lot of your own cookbooks
[2013-03-17 16:20:25 -0400] kesor: I know that, the question is  how do I take the content of https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application_ruby/blob/master/providers/unicorn.rb#L67 before_restart action, and change it with chef_rewind  or just add to it some code, from my cookbook. without changing application_ruby directly.
[2013-03-17 16:21:26 -0400] kesor: for example say I forked it and remove the runit_service block. But not I want to add just a simple "service[]" block instead and chef-rewind it to use upstart  but I can't :(
[2013-03-17 16:21:48 -0400] kesor: sorry for the spelling mistakes  i'm just crying ;(
[2013-03-17 16:22:17 -0400] cwj: i dont think the resources created inside an application resource actually exist at the point in time chef-rewind would try to modify them
[2013-03-17 16:22:25 -0400] cwj: are you using chef 10?
[2013-03-17 16:22:30 -0400] kesor: no, chef 11.4.
[2013-03-17 16:22:58 -0400] kesor: but can't I add more code to the same context from my own cookbook? like in a before_restart do..end block under my own application do..end block?
[2013-03-17 16:23:19 -0400] kesor: or that context exists only during the unicorn.rb before_restart and nowhere else?
[2013-03-17 16:23:43 -0400] kesor: oh, and what is use_inline_resources? is that relevant?
[2013-03-17 16:25:08 -0400] cwj: i dont understand how it works well enough to answer your question completely
[2013-03-17 16:25:36 -0400] kesor: ok. thank you, i'll go bang my head against the wall for a couple more days.
[2013-03-17 16:26:15 -0400] cwj: i seem to recall there is some mode in chef 11 that would compile the resources inside the application LWRP in order for chef-rewind to be able to act on them
[2013-03-17 16:26:20 -0400] cwj: or at least i think it would
[2013-03-17 16:26:30 -0400] cwj: but i cant remember the right phrases to google it up
[2013-03-17 16:26:31 -0400] kesor: interesting  i'll try and find about that.
[2013-03-17 16:26:54 -0400] cwj: its not specific to the application cookbook...
[2013-03-17 16:26:56 -0400] cwj: hrm
[2013-03-17 16:27:01 -0400] kesor: do you know why there is provider for runit like there is for upstart? with upstart you can just set it as a provider for service[] but with runit you must use runit_service.
[2013-03-17 16:27:16 -0400] kesor: I mean why there is no provider for runit.
[2013-03-17 16:28:06 -0400] cwj: well runit_service is powered by a provider from a cookbook
[2013-03-17 16:28:15 -0400] cwj: the others are providers from chef core
[2013-03-17 16:28:38 -0400] kesor: but can I write    --   service "somename" do provider Something::Runit end ?
[2013-03-17 16:28:53 -0400] cwj: i believe the provider being distributed in a cookbook has something to do with the way different distros ship runit
[2013-03-17 16:29:08 -0400] kesor: what a nightmare :(
[2013-03-17 16:29:42 -0400] cwj: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/runit/blob/master/libraries/provider_runit_service.rb
[2013-03-17 16:29:50 -0400] cwj: looks like it is Chef::Resource::RunitService
[2013-03-17 16:30:01 -0400] cwj: i dont think it will work the way you are thinking
[2013-03-17 16:30:30 -0400] cwj: for my own curiosity, why do you need to avoid runit?
[2013-03-17 16:31:39 -0400] kesor: because I have dozens of service that already use upstart, and my team knows how to use upstart. there is no reason to use something we don't already use and have no clue how to use, especially when it will create a mix of different tools  complexity is bad m'kay.
[2013-03-17 16:31:58 -0400] cwj: just asking :)
[2013-03-17 16:32:48 -0400] kesor: why was it logical for someone to hard-code such a dependency in half the opscode cookbooks?  why not just use "service[name]" and let the system decide? :/
[2013-03-17 16:34:23 -0400] cwj: i couldn't say, except that i am under the impression that the application cookbook pattern opscode has published was designed to meet the needs of their organization in helping their customers deploy apps
[2013-03-17 16:35:03 -0400] kesor: or even worse the way it is in nginx, where you have a huge switch/case/if that chooses runit/bluepill/whatever  its completely wrong to do it like that. just use "service[name]" and thats it.
[2013-03-17 16:58:45 -0400] kesor: for about 50 nodes, is it okay to use a small ec2 instance for a chef 11 server?
[2013-03-17 16:58:58 -0400] yfeldblum: on modern rubygems (1.8.25 or 2.0.3), even on older rubies (1.8.7), is Gem.clear_paths still required after installing a gem before requiring it?
[2013-03-17 16:59:19 -0400] yfeldblum: kesor, i would think so
[2013-03-17 16:59:26 -0400] kesor: yfeldblum: thanks.
[2013-03-17 17:01:26 -0400] yfeldblum: kesor, you can probably do `service "asdf" do ; provider Chef::Provider::RunitService ; ... end`
[2013-03-17 17:01:49 -0400] yfeldblum: kesor, hmmm or Chef::Provider::Service::Runit
[2013-03-17 17:02:16 -0400] kesor: yfeldblum: yeah, only question remains is why its not done like that in application_ruby/unicorn, and why even if it was done like that, I couldn't chef-rewrite it anyway.
[2013-03-17 17:03:07 -0400] yfeldblum: kesor, it's not done like that in ABCXYZ because nothing, not even ABCXYZ, is perfect, and of course they'd like your contribution :D
[2013-03-17 17:03:43 -0400] kesor: I just need to figure out how to actually do it so other people can have a "choice". once I got that, next thing is a pull request with a ticket.
[2013-03-17 17:03:56 -0400] yfeldblum: kesor, also the runit cookbook used to ship a definition named runit_service, *not* a resource & provider
[2013-03-17 17:04:12 -0400] kesor: yfeldblum: yeah, and that definition is still used in unicorn.rb
[2013-03-17 17:04:17 -0400] kesor: hardcoded
[2013-03-17 17:04:42 -0400] yfeldblum: kesor, i'm just suggesting why it's still that way: because of how all the different things evolved over time
[2013-03-17 17:07:26 -0400] Ash: sorry yfeldblum, evolution is just a theory
[2013-03-17 17:07:35 -0400] Ash: er i mean..
[2013-03-17 17:07:36 -0400] Ash: heheh
[2013-03-17 18:22:59 -0400] pehlert: Oh, does Chef Server 11 listen on standard http ports?
[2013-03-17 18:23:47 -0400] pehlert: i.e. is it not possible to run it side-by-side an Apache installation?
[2013-03-17 18:28:17 -0400] yfeldblum: pehlert, the opscode full-stack installer configures apache to listen on 80 and 443 and forward the requests to chef-server and chef-server-webui
[2013-03-17 18:28:31 -0400] yfeldblum: pehlert, however, you can certainly customize that
[2013-03-17 18:28:59 -0400] yfeldblum: pehlert, i'm not sure how much you can customize if you're using the full-stack installer, but you can certainly install the components yourself and customize it there
[2013-03-17 18:30:16 -0400] pehlert: yfeldblum: I see there is an ssl / non-ssl port configuration option
[2013-03-17 18:30:33 -0400] yfeldblum: pehlert, cool
[2013-03-17 20:12:42 -0400] _ci: hello.  can i reference an attribute from one cookbook in the attributes file in a different cookbook?
[2013-03-17 20:12:53 -0400] pehlert: Hey. In the 10 -> 11 server upgrade guide, it tells me to update my clients/chef-validator.json file. However, I don't have such a file and knife download doesn't fetch it.. Am I missing something? (Guide: http://www.opscode.com/blog/2013/03/12/5106/)
[2013-03-17 20:14:20 -0400] _ci: for example default["newcookbook"]["user"] = node[:othercookbook][:user]
[2013-03-17 20:14:35 -0400] _ci: is that possible? is the syntax correct?
[2013-03-17 20:59:56 -0400] pehlert: What I upgrade to chef server 11, do I have to bootstrap every single client again?
[2013-03-17 21:00:00 -0400] pehlert: *When
[2013-03-17 21:15:15 -0400] StormSilver: Anyone tried using Chef 10.24.0 on RubyGems 2.0.0?
[2013-03-17 21:15:35 -0400] StormSilver: You get a lovely error about a missing rubygems file, which apparently the rubygems provider needs.
[2013-03-17 21:29:28 -0400] yfeldblum: StormSilver, what about rubygems-2.0.3?
[2013-03-17 21:32:05 -0400] StormSilver: yfeldblum: I lied, it is rubygems 2.0.3
[2013-03-17 21:32:10 -0400] StormSilver: Ruby 2.0.0-p0
[2013-03-17 21:36:25 -0400] yfeldblum: StormSilver, then ... i don't know, sorry!
[2013-03-17 21:36:49 -0400] StormSilver: yfeldblum: No worries mate - I'll just fork for now and wait for the fix. :)
[2013-03-17 21:37:03 -0400] falcor84: ohai guys, last week I asked here for help after getting  "501 Not Implemented This method may not be used" on trying to upload cookbooks to chef 11. We finally solved it today
[2013-03-17 21:38:19 -0400] falcor84: seems that knife upload successfully talked to the erchef api, but was redirected to the bookshelf's hostname (actually same machine as erchef) to upload the cookbook files themselves
[2013-03-17 21:39:21 -0400] falcor84: too bad though, that the hostname of that machine wasn't registered in our dns (it was just a duplicate vm) and it pointed me to a whole different machine far and away (which obviously hadn't implemented the cookbook api)
[2013-03-17 21:40:16 -0400] yfeldblum: falcor84, nice
[2013-03-17 21:40:18 -0400] falcor84: finally solved this by changing the chef setup to redirect to the ip instead of hostname
[2013-03-17 21:40:23 -0400] falcor84: :)
[2013-03-17 21:40:35 -0400] falcor84: I wonder if this is something that might happen to others
[2013-03-17 21:41:08 -0400] falcor84: anyway, that's it for now. bye guys
