[2013-03-09 00:04:46 -0500] david415: miah: you rock!
[2013-03-09 00:05:08 -0500] david415: just now watching that #hangops video
[2013-03-09 00:08:31 -0500] miah: cool
[2013-03-09 00:08:41 -0500] miah: it was fun
[2013-03-09 00:08:58 -0500] david415: yeah looks fun; btw if you want nerdy sys admin reading then here: http://www.cs.tufts.edu/tech_reports/reports/2006-4/report.pdf
[2013-03-09 00:09:15 -0500] david415: someone's computer science dissertation
[2013-03-09 00:09:28 -0500] david415: it's about applying computational theory to sys admin
[2013-03-09 00:09:44 -0500] david415: hmm i might have mentioned this paper to you already
[2013-03-09 00:10:09 -0500] miah: http://cfengine.com/markburgess/cm.html
[2013-03-09 00:10:10 -0500] miah: =)
[2013-03-09 00:10:46 -0500] david415: wow sweet. i'll take a look and i'll give it a thorough read soon
[2013-03-09 00:11:10 -0500] miah: mark has some great papers
[2013-03-09 00:11:11 -0500] david415: looks sufficiently nerdy
[2013-03-09 00:11:54 -0500] miah: well. he has a phd
[2013-03-09 00:12:53 -0500] david415: yes but no formal proofs in that paper... ;-)
[2013-03-09 00:13:16 -0500] mattt: aw, phd beats my devry technical diploma
[2013-03-09 00:15:24 -0500] miah: http://cfengine.com/markburgess/cv.html =)
[2013-03-09 00:15:31 -0500] miah: mark is a really nice guy too
[2013-03-09 00:16:22 -0500] miah: i have a 'Good Enough Diploma' so ya. Devry beats me =)
[2013-03-09 00:18:08 -0500] david415: ha! i got the GED...
[2013-03-09 00:20:16 -0500] ozataman: hey all.. where do the standard resources like "file" or "cron" or "package" come from?
[2013-03-09 00:20:30 -0500] clundquist: chef core
[2013-03-09 00:20:45 -0500] ozataman: ah, ok. what's a good place to have documentation on all the little nice helpers like that?
[2013-03-09 00:20:47 -0500] clundquist: https://github.com/opscode/chef/tree/master/lib/chef/resource
[2013-03-09 00:21:09 -0500] clundquist: They have been moving the docs
[2013-03-09 00:21:19 -0500] clundquist: there was an awesome giant page you could Ctrl+F all over
[2013-03-09 00:21:23 -0500] clundquist: finding new one
[2013-03-09 00:21:32 -0500] zts: http://docs.opscode.com/resource.html
[2013-03-09 00:21:41 -0500] clundquist: http://docs.opscode.com/resource.html
[2013-03-09 00:21:42 -0500] clundquist: yeah
[2013-03-09 00:21:57 -0500] zts: or there's still a single page version here: http://docs.opscode.com/chef/resources.html
[2013-03-09 00:22:17 -0500] clundquist: thank you zts
[2013-03-09 00:22:40 -0500] ozataman: ah ok, thank you.. that's helpful
[2013-03-09 00:22:42 -0500] isotope: zts I'm going to bookmark that page
[2013-03-09 00:23:10 -0500] clundquist: probably the single most useful doc page
[2013-03-09 00:23:38 -0500] isotope: love they provide actual examples
[2013-03-09 00:24:15 -0500] clundquist: I think I have documentation stockholm syndrome, I miss the old one for some reason
[2013-03-09 00:24:46 -0500] isotope: Ha, "damn kids these days and their new documentation"
[2013-03-09 00:25:13 -0500] miah: git clone git://github.com/opscode/chef.git
[2013-03-09 00:25:17 -0500] miah: ^- all the documentation =)
[2013-03-09 00:25:57 -0500] ozataman: miah: probably a good idea to have that just in case :)
[2013-03-09 00:28:16 -0500] ozataman: what's a good way to manage code pushes using chef? they are not quite resources, I guess, as you may run them many times a day and not once per node setup
[2013-03-09 00:28:36 -0500] ozataman: (code push = app deployment)
[2013-03-09 00:28:56 -0500] ozataman: I'm trying to see if there's a better alternative to fabric on that front
[2013-03-09 00:29:01 -0500] isotope: I deploy our code with chef
[2013-03-09 00:32:29 -0500] ozataman: isotope: what's the workflow?
[2013-03-09 00:41:12 -0500] dbro: Hey everyone! Anybody have experience deploying django with the application_python cookbook? I'm getting Chef::Exceptions::Exec "returned 2, expected 0" on manage.py syncdb
[2013-03-09 00:41:20 -0500] dbro: wish I could see the console output that followed....
[2013-03-09 00:42:02 -0500] dbro: If I manually symlink the local_settings.y file I can get the command to execute successfully, so either the command isn't being run from the manage.py containing directory or local_settings.py isn't being copied properly
[2013-03-09 00:45:36 -0500] dbro: https://github.com/OpenWatch/ow-python-cookbook/blob/master/recipes/default.rb

[2013-03-09 04:10:27 -0500] tmichael: ProfFalken: still working on hpcloud metadata and implemented your ohai plugin.  here's what i'm getting.  curious if this makes any sense to you: https://gist.github.com/toddmichael/1fd43d5f183858e3ebcc
[2013-03-09 10:42:54 -0500] giorgian: hi; does anybody know why, suddenly, chef-client (and shef) on windows, when launched from powershell, open a new cmd window instead of running there? I'm seeing this with both 10.16.0 and 10.24.0
[2013-03-09 10:48:04 -0500] a_crazy_chef_use: in my vagrant file I have
[2013-03-09 10:48:06 -0500] a_crazy_chef_use:     postgresql_database_user 'rails' do       connection postgresql_connection_info       password 'rails'       privileges [:all]       action :create     end
[2013-03-09 10:48:22 -0500] a_crazy_chef_use: and I keep getting undefined method `postgresql_database_user'
[2013-03-09 10:48:30 -0500] a_crazy_chef_use: does anyone know how to fix this?
[2013-03-09 11:07:42 -0500] a_crazy_chef_use: anyone?
[2013-03-09 13:22:38 -0500] pnorman: I'm contemplating chef for my setup and I'm wondering if it's appropriate. I have a couple of ubuntu servers, both of which will be getting complete reinstalls as part of hardware upgrades. My software install and configuration is sufficiently complex that I expect reinstalling the OS and software to take the better part of a week (largly getting ./configure options correct for software not in PPAs). I also have a couple of windows workstati
[2013-03-09 13:23:49 -0500] ShawnMcCool: hey guys, sorry to bother. i've recently changed from a chef-solo to a hosted-chef setup. I'm very happy with it so far. I only have one error, and it otherwise works like a dream. I'm not exactly a chef guru and was wondering if a quick glance over this error gave anyone an idea how i can further troubleshoot this issue. http://paste.laravel.com/jUk thank you
[2013-03-09 13:34:42 -0500] zts: pnorman: your message was cut off at "couple of windos workstati"
[2013-03-09 13:35:47 -0500] zts: ShawnMcCool: thats a bit weird, it suggests that your node doesn't have permission to update its node data on the server
[2013-03-09 13:38:19 -0500] ShawnMcCool: I'm finding it to be a tough situation to understand. do you think that it'd be reasonable to upgrade to the 'Launch' plan with Opscode, pay the increased monthly rate, get their help with this task, then go back to free? (I'm mostly just doing this all for myself, for now)
[2013-03-09 13:40:26 -0500] zts: ShawnMcCool: I think it'd be reasonable to ask for support even on the free plan
[2013-03-09 13:40:45 -0500] zts: ShawnMcCool: one thing you might try is removing the mysql::server recipe from your list, and seeing if the chef-client run can complete successfully
[2013-03-09 13:40:56 -0500] ShawnMcCool: it can
[2013-03-09 13:41:07 -0500] ShawnMcCool: it's also the mysql recipe from the official set of repositories
[2013-03-09 13:41:35 -0500] zts: ShawnMcCool: sure, the point is that node.save is run automatically by Chef at the end of a successful run
[2013-03-09 13:42:26 -0500] zts: ShawnMcCool: so I'd have expected it to report some failure at the end of the run, given that the node.save in the mysql recipe is failing
[2013-03-09 13:42:39 -0500] ShawnMcCool: interesting
[2013-03-09 13:43:04 -0500] ShawnMcCool: ok, i'm going to rerun that as a test to verify that i'm not full of shit, thank you for your help
[2013-03-09 13:43:37 -0500] zts: no problem - but failing that, definitely just go ahead and open a support request: https://www.opscode.com/support/tickets/
[2013-03-09 13:43:48 -0500] ShawnMcCool: thanks, =) time to change venues. this cafe is getting sick of me
[2013-03-09 13:43:59 -0500] zts: enjoy :)
[2013-03-09 13:56:16 -0500] pnorman: workstations, where management isn't really needed. I can find lots of chef for cloud and large business use, but not for this kind of home use. Any pointers for reading up?
[2013-03-09 13:56:38 -0500] pnorman: had to fix an E_NOFOOD
[2013-03-09 14:01:42 -0500] zts: pnorman: it may be appropriate, but the cost/benefit equation will look different for you than in a larger environment.  Using Chef (or any similar tool) for a one-off job involves more time and effort than just doing it by hand
[2013-03-09 14:02:01 -0500] zts: pnorman: in bigger environments, that effort is offset by building (or rebuilding) many machines to the same specification
[2013-03-09 14:02:33 -0500] pnorman: Part of the problem I'm facing is I have *no* idea the extent of my config changes
[2013-03-09 14:03:46 -0500] zts: well, one benefit of Chef, having figured all that out, is that you have something that's effectively executable documentation
[2013-03-09 14:04:18 -0500] zts: and you'll have acquired Chef skills (if that's more generally useful to you)
[2013-03-09 14:04:40 -0500] pnorman: I have been meaning to learn enough ruby to at least read it
[2013-03-09 14:05:13 -0500] zts: on the other hand, if your main concern is being able to recover your hand-built systems in the event of a catastrophe, a good backup & recovery strategy might well be a good option
[2013-03-09 14:05:24 -0500] zts: though I suspect I'll be beaten up for saying that here :)
[2013-03-09 14:05:31 -0500] pnorman: well, there's the difference between data recovery and config recovery
[2013-03-09 14:06:00 -0500] zts: I guess the question to ask is: what's your motivation in considering Chef?  What are the problems you're trying to solve, or risks you want to address?
[2013-03-09 14:07:00 -0500] pnorman: The motiviation is being able to recreate a complex configuration in the future, or at least know what it is
[2013-03-09 14:11:58 -0500] zts: gotcha, you could certainly do that.  I'm just trying to find some good examples of recipes that are building and installing software from source, although most of them are hideously complex from dealing with cross-platform issues
[2013-03-09 14:12:03 -0500] zts: which I guess you won't need to worry about so much
[2013-03-09 14:13:39 -0500] zts: there's also the ark cookbook, which I haven't used but adds some features that can be useful there: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/ark
[2013-03-09 14:14:04 -0500] pnorman: no, i have to worry about linking against propritary SDKs that can't be distributed. i have one piece of software that *every* time i've had to rebuild has taken me at least 6 solid hours of ./configure fiddling for some reason or another
[2013-03-09 14:14:24 -0500] zts: ouch
[2013-03-09 17:03:42 -0500] awgross: hey weekend Chefs
[2013-03-09 17:10:06 -0500] mrFrog: ok i'm wondering what's happening when i'm using knife-solo, it prompts for my password four times when i bootstrap. why does it need it so many times? is there a way to have it only need it once?
[2013-03-09 17:11:26 -0500] awgross: mrFrog: it is probably running individual sudo commands to do things like install a package, install chef gem, and run chef-solo
[2013-03-09 17:11:42 -0500] awgross: mrFrog: You could probably find a way to wrap your whole script in 1 sudo command
[2013-03-09 17:11:59 -0500] awgross: not 100% sure, havent done Chef-Solo bootstrapping with knife, but seems similar to chef client

[2013-03-09 21:04:04 -0500] martinisoft: I'm slightly confused about loading Encrypted Data Bags into a recipe. There is #load and #encrypted_data_bag_item so im not sure which is best to use
[2013-03-09 21:05:54 -0500] martinisoft: Also with loading up the secret, the documentation is a little confusing about just assuming default locations.
[2013-03-09 21:05:59 -0500] martinisoft: im checking out this page http://rubydoc.info/gems/chef/Chef/EncryptedDataBagItem#
[2013-03-09 21:06:23 -0500] martinisoft: to look at the methods, but I am assuming the interface is the same as the DataBag interface
[2013-03-09 21:06:45 -0500] jtimberman: martinisoft: Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load(:bag, "item")
[2013-03-09 21:06:58 -0500] jtimberman: martinisoft: the location by default is Chef::Config[:encrypted_data_bag_secret]
[2013-03-09 21:07:04 -0500] martinisoft: jtimberman: ah gotcha
[2013-03-09 21:07:17 -0500] martinisoft: jtimberman: so do I call that with the load() method? or a separate one?
[2013-03-09 21:07:37 -0500] martinisoft: will it assume I want to load the default secret or do I have to explicitly call it?
[2013-03-09 21:07:47 -0500] jtimberman: martinisoft: it'll use the configured location by default.
[2013-03-09 21:08:00 -0500] martinisoft: because the example in the docs page demos using the secret param in the method call
[2013-03-09 21:08:10 -0500] jtimberman: if you don't store your secret file there, then you can pass that as an additional argument to #load, or change the configuration
[2013-03-09 21:08:15 -0500] martinisoft: jtimberman: ah cool, think I'll try to help clear that up in the docs
[2013-03-09 21:08:42 -0500] martinisoft: jtimberman: the docs make it seem like you have to custom load the secret every time, doesn't make the default very clear
[2013-03-09 21:09:33 -0500] martinisoft: jtimberman: thanks for the help! much appreciated :)
[2013-03-09 21:09:39 -0500] jtimberman: sure thing :)
[2013-03-09 21:09:44 -0500] martinisoft: jtimberman: look forward to seeing you at ChefConf this year :D

[2013-03-09 23:21:19 -0500] ozataman: does the ubuntu package provider implicitly perform and apt-get update?
[2013-03-09 23:21:23 -0500] ozataman: an*
[2013-03-09 23:26:51 -0500] ozataman: funny.. there's a "package" resource, but it doesn't know to update its cache. isn't that kind of a weird thing to miss?
[2013-03-09 23:27:58 -0500] ranjibd: ozataman: theres a long thread on this.. but you can use the apt resource to explicitly do this
[2013-03-09 23:29:31 -0500] ozataman: ranjibd: I see, thank you
[2013-03-09 23:58:49 -0500] jtimberman: ozataman: ranjibd: apt cookbook - default recipe, not resource :-).
