[2013-03-31 00:00:57 -0400] gansbrest: hi. Is there a way to reload ohai values after hotname modification?
[2013-03-31 00:01:09 -0400] flaccid: gansbrest: not really
[2013-03-31 00:01:18 -0400] gansbrest: what's the solution then?
[2013-03-31 00:01:34 -0400] flaccid: not sure if there is one, this annoyed me a lot; let me check
[2013-03-31 00:01:36 -0400] gansbrest: what if my cookbook changes system state?
[2013-03-31 00:01:46 -0400] gansbrest: adding new users
[2013-03-31 00:01:52 -0400] gansbrest: hostname change
[2013-03-31 00:01:53 -0400] gansbrest: etc
[2013-03-31 00:02:09 -0400] gansbrest: ohai reload doesn't seem to do anything
[2013-03-31 00:02:26 -0400] flaccid: i lodged a bug on this and that reload thing is not what it seems
[2013-03-31 00:02:52 -0400] flaccid: gansbrest: https://github.com/flaccid/cookbooks/blob/master/cookbooks/system/providers/hostname.rb#L109
[2013-03-31 00:03:12 -0400] flaccid: i'm not sure if even setting the hostname in compile time helps, but you could try
[2013-03-31 00:03:22 -0400] flaccid: severe limitation of chef imho
[2013-03-31 00:04:00 -0400] gansbrest: I found this example
[2013-03-31 00:04:01 -0400] gansbrest: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-1507
[2013-03-31 00:04:21 -0400] gansbrest: it seems like you can add user and reload ohai
[2013-03-31 00:04:30 -0400] gansbrest: didn't try it though
[2013-03-31 00:05:32 -0400] flaccid: not sure if that will work, give it a try though. that is really old
[2013-03-31 00:07:31 -0400] gansbrest: seems like essential feature, I wonder how other people avoiding this problem
[2013-03-31 00:08:03 -0400] flaccid: as you can see i went through it for a long time with no solution.
[2013-03-31 00:08:45 -0400] flaccid: the workaround i probably used was using the node attribute directly in recipes that i was using for the new hostname or simply shelling out to `hostname --fqdn`
[2013-03-31 00:11:27 -0400] flaccid: i'll try that ohai plugin create method soon though. would be good if you could and let me know how you go :)
[2013-03-31 00:11:59 -0400] gansbrest: thanks a lot for your help, have to run now
[2013-03-31 00:12:02 -0400] gansbrest: but will post updates
[2013-03-31 00:12:12 -0400] flaccid: kk
[2013-03-31 01:51:53 -0400] eydaimon: is it possible to make a package optional? iow. I don't want th erecipe to fail just because ti doesn't exist
[2013-03-31 02:00:55 -0400] coderanger: eydaimon: How could a package not exist?
[2013-03-31 02:07:21 -0400] eydaimon: coderanger: package 'tmux' existed on centos62 but not on centos63
[2013-03-31 02:07:27 -0400] eydaimon: is the question difficult to answer?
[2013-03-31 02:07:55 -0400] eydaimon: yum search tmux yields no results on 63, but I 'd like to installit where it's possible
[2013-03-31 02:08:01 -0400] eydaimon: but it's not required
[2013-03-31 02:08:20 -0400] coderanger: eydaimon: Just check what platform you are on
[2013-03-31 02:08:38 -0400] coderanger: only install it when you know it is correct, or use value_for_platform to lookup the right package name
[2013-03-31 02:09:57 -0400] eydaimon: Is my question didfficult to answer?
[2013-03-31 02:10:07 -0400] eydaimon: is it possible to make a package optional?
[2013-03-31 02:13:02 -0400] coderanger: You could use ignore_failure, but what you are asking makes no sense in the end since that isn't how chef works
[2013-03-31 02:13:14 -0400] coderanger: You have to determine what you want the state of the system to look like
[2013-03-31 02:13:23 -0400] coderanger: So there isn't such a thing as "optional"
[2013-03-31 02:13:43 -0400] coderanger: Just check the current platform and only setup the resource if the package should exist
[2013-03-31 02:19:59 -0400] eydaimon: thanks
[2013-03-31 02:21:28 -0400] eydaimon: I appreciate the help, but it's frustrating to have to explain a while use-case. sometimes just an answer is sufficient. For example, I don't know what will be avaialble on the final host, and I have no access to try it. I know some are optional so that's what I need
[2013-03-31 02:49:41 -0400] mattray: eydaimon: http://docs.opscode.com/chef/resources.html#attributes
[2013-03-31 02:49:48 -0400] mattray: use ignore_failure then
[2013-03-31 04:31:19 -0400] flaccid: coderanger, hope you have been well. i'm trying to understand my issue earlier i.e. https://github.com/rightscale-blueprints/mediawiki_lamp/blob/master/cookbooks/mediawiki_application/recipes/application.rb#L30 and wondering if you had any ideas?
[2013-03-31 05:10:46 -0400] mh`: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13186989/how-do-you-make-a-chef-resource-optional
[2013-03-31 05:10:52 -0400] mh`: first result for chef optional provider
[2013-03-31 05:10:53 -0400] mh`: _
[2013-03-31 05:10:57 -0400] mh`: @eydaimon
[2013-03-31 05:11:08 -0400] mh`: just realized that was 3 hours ago though
[2013-03-31 06:28:18 -0400] eydaimon: mh`:  ;)
[2013-03-31 15:36:26 -0400] kesor: why wont this work in chef 11.x?   knife search node 'recipes:"collectd::server"'   says "ERROR: knife search failed: invalid search query"
[2013-03-31 15:38:32 -0400] linssen: I'm using https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/python and I'd like to install from my requirements.txt file. I can only see how to do one at a time. Anyone show me how?
[2013-03-31 15:43:40 -0400] kesor: linssen: python cookbook does not support requirements, maybe you can use the application_python cookbook?
[2013-03-31 15:44:07 -0400] kesor: linssen: or copy from the example at https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application_python/blob/master/providers/django.rb#L61
[2013-03-31 15:45:33 -0400] linssen: kesor: so is this a bit of a hack? https://pastee.org/5ga4d I've just gotten that to work.
[2013-03-31 15:46:24 -0400] kesor: linssen: don't think that it will be idempotent that way ...
[2013-03-31 15:48:38 -0400] linssen: kesor: roger that, will have a go with something a bit more transferable
[2013-03-31 17:55:58 -0400] kesor: can I make knife freeze cookbooks on upload by default?
[2013-03-31 19:02:26 -0400] siezer: ~.
[2013-03-31 19:40:39 -0400] therealkasey: has anyone encountered this error from chef server? http://pastebin.com/URZ7dA8c
[2013-03-31 19:40:46 -0400] therealkasey: we've been fixing it by rebooting the server, not ideal!
[2013-03-31 19:44:11 -0400] kesor: therealkasey: its the chef client that gives this error, not the server, right?
[2013-03-31 19:44:33 -0400] therealkasey: yes this happens at bootstrap time
[2013-03-31 19:45:09 -0400] therealkasey: knife bootstrap mdb2.<domain> -N mdb2 -x kasey -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa --sudo --bootstrap-version 10.18.2 -E live -r role[allmdb]
[2013-03-31 19:45:16 -0400] kesor: this looks very similar to the ssl problems I had. can you verify that the ssl certificate your chef server answers with has the same common-name (CN) as the name you access with?
[2013-03-31 19:45:41 -0400] kesor: therealkasey: your .chef/knife.rb server_url is it "https://....something" ?
[2013-03-31 19:46:07 -0400] therealkasey: actually it's plain http
[2013-03-31 19:46:28 -0400] kesor: oh not the same problem then.
[2013-03-31 19:46:53 -0400] therealkasey: note to self, ssl sounds like a fine idea!
[2013-03-31 19:47:14 -0400] therealkasey: thanks anyhow kesor
[2013-03-31 19:47:40 -0400] kesor: therealkasey: is your server 11.x or 10.x?
[2013-03-31 19:47:53 -0400] therealkasey: 10.x
[2013-03-31 19:48:27 -0400] kesor: 11.x is using ssl by default for all the api calls. but for 10.x, I have no idea since I never hacked with it.
[2013-03-31 19:50:54 -0400] kesor: therealkasey: google found this https://bradmontgomery.net/blog/2012/02/05/nethttpserverexception-412-precondition-failed/
[2013-03-31 19:51:07 -0400] therealkasey: i am there now kesor, thanks
[2013-03-31 19:52:27 -0400] therealkasey: hmm, i think that is not the problem in my instance, i can do 'knife role show allmdb' and receive the expected response
[2013-03-31 19:53:20 -0400] therealkasey: it is a similarly opaque issue on the server side.  wonder if there is a more useful log over on the chef-server machine...
[2013-03-31 19:55:10 -0400] therealkasey: hmm, some useful stuff in here, an error about a non-existent cookbook
[2013-03-31 19:55:47 -0400] kesor: therealkasey: do you have non-existing or mispelled cookbooks? check with "knife cookbook list"
[2013-03-31 19:56:15 -0400] therealkasey: yes i think that is the problem (rather within the role itself, not the runlist specified to knife)
[2013-03-31 19:59:28 -0400] therealkasey: someone add the cookbook to git (so looked okay in the pull request) but failed to push up to chef-server
[2013-03-31 19:59:50 -0400] therealkasey: guess we need to get on top of using those knife plugins...
[2013-03-31 20:00:15 -0400] therealkasey: thanks for the help kesor
[2013-03-31 20:00:21 -0400] kesor: np
[2013-03-31 20:00:37 -0400] kesor: therealkasey: check health_inspector gem
[2013-03-31 20:01:05 -0400] therealkasey: ohh nice
[2013-03-31 20:02:46 -0400] therealkasey: wonder if there are tools to automatically upload to chef-server on a git post-commit or is that ill advised?  (too obvious to have not been debated in here)
[2013-03-31 20:03:24 -0400] kesor: therealkasey: one of my employees wrote something like that, I think its a good practice imho.
[2013-03-31 20:03:42 -0400] Mithrandir: I do it in a small setup I run.
[2013-03-31 20:03:46 -0400] kesor: I would also argue that when a git hook uploads cookbooks, it should use " --freeze "
[2013-03-31 20:05:50 -0400] therealkasey: kesor: that makes sense, prevent the server from getting inconsistent with the repo
[2013-03-31 20:06:43 -0400] kesor: and then don't give the admin key to anyone other than the git hook ;)
[2013-03-31 20:07:55 -0400] therealkasey: sounds like a plan
[2013-03-31 20:08:53 -0400] kesor: then also close the master branch for commits, and only allow pull-requests after a review of someone who didn't write the code 
[2013-03-31 20:10:14 -0400] therealkasey: that would be ideal
[2013-03-31 20:10:27 -0400] therealkasey: afk, thanks again kesor
[2013-03-31 22:44:15 -0400] yfeldblum: how are folks managing dns?
[2013-03-31 22:44:35 -0400] yfeldblum: anyone who's not on AWS...
[2013-03-31 22:57:59 -0400] therealkasey: the hellll.  mongodb config overwrote the upstart script somehow
[2013-03-31 22:59:44 -0400] therealkasey: which is to say, /lib/init/upstart-job now looks suspciously like the mongodb init script
