[2013-03-24 00:51:00 -0400] tshauck: hi...I saw I have two cookbooks (A and B)... if I call a recipe that's in A from B how do I override attributes in A with values in B?
[2013-03-24 10:36:18 -0400] null_route: Hey guys! I'm trying to keep 2 separate chef servers in sync (dev/production) . I'm using GIT to keep the recipes, roles, environments, databags, etc in sync. When I push my changes to the production server, I can manually run "knife upload -a", knife data bag from file, knife role from file, etc
[2013-03-24 10:36:27 -0400] null_route: .....but how do I manage deletions?
[2013-03-24 10:36:40 -0400] null_route: let's say I delete a databag item, etc
[2013-03-24 10:37:27 -0400] null_route: is anyone out there keeping multiple servers in sync and can shed light on tips&tricks?
[2013-03-24 14:24:41 -0400] learner: Hello Gurus, Any idea how long hosted chef (free trial : for 5 nodes) is valid for?
[2013-03-24 14:24:53 -0400] gchristensen: foreverL
[2013-03-24 14:24:55 -0400] gchristensen: ?
[2013-03-24 14:25:14 -0400] learner: Really? wow
[2013-03-24 14:25:37 -0400] gchristensen: at five nodes you're really not putting much strain on their systems :)
[2013-03-24 14:25:57 -0400] learner: makes sense.
[2013-03-24 14:26:00 -0400] learner: cheers mate
[2013-03-24 15:53:52 -0400] ickymettle: hey guys is there any platform support over the weekends ?
[2013-03-24 17:29:11 -0400] dstotijn: is it normal that package[python-dev] from the python cookbook takes a very long time install?
[2013-03-24 19:05:25 -0400] Axsuul: What happened with https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian? Did it move to a new project?
[2013-03-24 19:08:39 -0400] teukka: Axsuul: still on beta, but next release will split librarian-chef to own project
[2013-03-24 19:08:55 -0400] teukka: https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef
[2013-03-24 19:09:15 -0400] Axsuul: teukka: Why is it being split to its own project?
[2013-03-24 19:09:25 -0400] Axsuul: wasn't it its own project?
[2013-03-24 19:11:35 -0400] teukka: Axsuul: the "librarian" part is generic. there already exists librarian-puppet for example
[2013-03-24 19:13:59 -0400] okan_: hi
[2013-03-24 19:14:41 -0400] Axsuul: teukka: Cool thanks, also is Berkshelf similar?
[2013-03-24 19:15:25 -0400] okan_: I'm trying to setup my Vbox with vagrant.. I tried slide from Julien Philip... but his is ubuntu and I'm trying on centos5.8.
[2013-03-24 19:15:39 -0400] okan_: I'm trying to connect to centOS 5.8 from mac.. getting this error Cookbook windows not found. If you're loading windows from another cookbook
[2013-03-24 19:15:50 -0400] okan_: Error is: Cookbook windows not found. If you're loading windows from another cookbook
[2013-03-24 19:16:06 -0400] okan_: I don't see any reason to load windows here.. can anyone please help..
[2013-03-24 19:16:09 -0400] okan_: thanks in advance
[2013-03-24 19:28:23 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, "librarian" is 90% generic, i.e., having nothing to do with chef
[2013-03-24 19:29:00 -0400] Axsuul: yfeldblum: generic for what other uses?
[2013-03-24 19:29:03 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, "librarian-chef" is a much smaller program, but wraps up everything chef-related
[2013-03-24 19:29:09 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, bundler-like things
[2013-03-24 19:29:25 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, librarian-puppet, librarian-apt, librarian-yum, librarian-node, whatever
[2013-03-24 19:29:56 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, i did it that way because i was frustrated with bundler for *not* doing it that way, when i wanted to write a bundler for chef cookbooks
[2013-03-24 19:30:20 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, which meant i couldn't reuse the generic bits of bundler and add my own little adapter on top; i had to rewrite the whole thing
[2013-03-24 19:30:52 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, librarian-gem :D
[2013-03-24 19:32:14 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, from my reading of the Berkshelf code, my impression is that Berkshelf is tied to chef cookbooks the same way that Bundler is tied to ruby gems
[2013-03-24 19:33:12 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, the bin has always been named "librarian-chef", so your command-line usage wouldn't change; only the relevant gem to be installed is new
[2013-03-24 19:34:57 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, also a few people have been asking me to do the split into two separate gems
[2013-03-24 19:35:11 -0400] yfeldblum: Axsuul, hope that explains the motive
[2013-03-24 19:36:18 -0400] Axsuul: yfeldblum
[2013-03-24 19:36:21 -0400] Axsuul: Got it, thanks :)
[2013-03-24 19:37:23 -0400] teukka: yfeldblum: have planned any schedule for the release of the new gems?
[2013-03-24 19:39:30 -0400] yfeldblum: teukka, soonish; fujin was kind enough to point out some really silly bugs in the first beta, so perhaps once the shame fades :D
[2013-03-24 19:40:21 -0400] teukka: yfeldblum: ack
[2013-03-24 19:43:18 -0400] yfeldblum: teukka, primarily I forgot to include the `librarian-chef` bin in the "librarian-chef" beta.1 gem
[2013-03-24 19:43:55 -0400] teukka: yfeldblum: ah, I saw some tweet ;)
[2013-03-24 19:45:45 -0400] teukka: yfeldblum: I'll try to give the latest beta a spin in some projects
[2013-03-24 19:46:34 -0400] yfeldblum: teukka, thanks!
[2013-03-24 20:09:06 -0400] LeoSh: how would I get a fully expanded run_list with chef-solo? node.expand doesn't work since it tries to do a server call...
[2013-03-24 20:32:06 -0400] LeoSh: found it by digging at chef source - just for the record - node.expand!('disk')
[2013-03-24 20:32:48 -0400] rava: maybe my google fu is failing me, but i can't seem to find a better way (in 10.18) to do a search cleaner than a string of single attribute NOT statements
