[2013-03-02 00:06:00 -0500] kfox1111: I'm testing out open source shef server newest. Things seem to be working very well except one problem. chef cookbook upload is failing. It uploads all the files, then fails with an internal server error when "Committing sandbox". Any ideas?
[2013-03-02 00:10:09 -0500] skout: is it generally better to apply override attributes in a role, or apply node attributes in a recipe? just wanting to install java 7, and getting the feeling that manually changing the attribes/default.rb in the "official" cookbook is frowned upon
[2013-03-02 00:15:01 -0500] kfox1111: hmm.... tail is showing stuff like:
[2013-03-02 00:15:07 -0500] kfox1111: 2013-03-02_00:14:11.21145 Checking presence of checksum: <<"22dbb6c474dd16d2ae49a9d137625abc">> for org <<"00000000000000000000000000000000">> from bucket "bookshelf" has taken longer than 5000 ms
[2013-03-02 00:15:27 -0500] log1kal: skout: I personally put things like versions in the environment
[2013-03-02 00:15:40 -0500] log1kal: but you could put that in the environment, a role, or a wrapper cookbook
[2013-03-02 00:16:07 -0500] log1kal: it's generally not a good idea to edit the defaults of something like the java cookbook, since you'll lose it if you get the next version (or conflict)
[2013-03-02 00:17:27 -0500] skout: yea, while getting started this week I was manually making changes, after looking at some of the berkshelf docs and other examples I came to realize my folly.  So think wrapper cookbooks is how I am going to handle it.
[2013-03-02 00:21:19 -0500] kfox1111: ah. it was openstack not letting a floating ip be contacted from within the host. :/
[2013-03-02 00:23:30 -0500] sascha_d_: hi chefs, re: the yum cookbook, is there a reason why the :update action does not imply create? https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/yum/blob/master/providers/repository.rb#L69
[2013-03-02 00:27:57 -0500] miah: why not just call "action [:create, :update]"
[2013-03-02 00:43:16 -0500] sascha_d_: I could. It seems a little silly to have to. I mean Enable and start are two different things for services, but create, update are both telling the template to converge. So I was checking if it was on purpose or not.
[2013-03-02 00:48:10 -0500] rep0st1: hai guys. Anybody have a quick idea on what required ports need to be opened on a chef-server
[2013-03-02 00:48:15 -0500] rep0st1: chef-server 11 that is
[2013-03-02 00:50:54 -0500] sascha_d_: @miah also, apparently putting them together in the same array of actions doesn't help
[2013-03-02 00:51:19 -0500] sascha_d_: this can't be on purpose?
[2013-03-02 01:02:53 -0500] miah: no idea
[2013-03-02 01:12:00 -0500] rep0st1: anyone? bueller? bueller?
[2013-03-02 01:12:54 -0500] miah: netstat -pan
[2013-03-02 01:14:12 -0500] rep0st1: from the server?
[2013-03-02 01:14:25 -0500] skout: netstat -antp | grep -i listen
[2013-03-02 01:14:47 -0500] skout: running that on the server will list all the listening tcp services
[2013-03-02 01:14:52 -0500] rep0st1: so all of the ports taht the chef server is listneing to need to be opened.
[2013-03-02 01:15:11 -0500] rep0st1: i have a network admin that needs justification =T
[2013-03-02 01:15:14 -0500] miah: well, you need make a determination between 'ssh' and 'chef' in that netstat output
[2013-03-02 01:15:56 -0500] littleidea: miah: what has ruby done to you?
[2013-03-02 01:16:18 -0500] miah: made me cry
[2013-03-02 01:16:31 -0500] miah: im probably doing something the 'wrong way(tm)'
[2013-03-02 01:16:39 -0500] miah: or it could be my lack of clear understanding of modules
[2013-03-02 01:16:43 -0500] miah: so, what im trying to do is this
[2013-03-02 01:17:18 -0500] miah: i'm building a chef resource to configure logstash config files. there are various input, output, and filter plugins.
[2013-03-02 01:17:30 -0500] miah: i'd rather not define a unique resource for each plugin
[2013-03-02 01:17:45 -0500] skout: rep0st1: the listening ports should be a reasonable list.  Also the network admin should be involved in a devops system if you ask me a network admin :)
[2013-03-02 01:18:00 -0500] miah: so. my resource should dynamically include the correct module based on some parameters passed to the resource when you configure it
[2013-03-02 01:18:04 -0500] miah: except its fubar somewhere
[2013-03-02 01:18:20 -0500] littleidea: miah: gists?
[2013-03-02 01:18:24 -0500] miah: ya hold on
[2013-03-02 01:18:35 -0500] littleidea: fubar is a large parameter space to explore
[2013-03-02 01:20:03 -0500] miah: https://github.com/miah/chef_logstash/blob/master/libraries/resource_logstash_config.rb https://github.com/miah/chef_logstash/blob/master/libraries/inputs.rb
[2013-03-02 01:20:06 -0500] miah: ya
[2013-03-02 01:20:11 -0500] miah: im probably making some noob mistake =)
[2013-03-02 01:20:15 -0500] rep0st1: skout: agreed. they want to use some of the f5 cookbooks. so i dont think during bootstrap chef-client needs to connect to postgres. I just wish opscode had a doc listing the ports needing to be opened during bootstrap and chef-client runs. Currenly diagnosing why during bootstrap syncronizing the cookbooks has a certain ltency
[2013-03-02 01:20:18 -0500] miah: ive tried a couple different things
[2013-03-02 01:20:34 -0500] miah: i know that if i load up pry, and include the module its fine
[2013-03-02 01:20:43 -0500] miah: so my logic in the resource is likely at fault
[2013-03-02 01:23:59 -0500] miah: rep0st1: documentation lies / is always out of date. tcpdump never lies ;)
[2013-03-02 01:24:07 -0500] miah: also, you can configure different ports for everything
[2013-03-02 01:24:10 -0500] skout: rep0st1: currently I am running a 10. server still, and only needed to open 4000 and 4040 to the server... and one of those was not needed. sorry not more help on the 11 server
[2013-03-02 01:24:11 -0500] miah: but ya. a default list woudl be swell
[2013-03-02 01:24:21 -0500] littleidea: miah: reading code, is there a stack trace or how does it fail?
[2013-03-02 01:24:33 -0500] miah: so. my test fails
[2013-03-02 01:24:35 -0500] miah: let me push that
[2013-03-02 01:24:42 -0500] miah: it could be a faulty test even.
[2013-03-02 01:25:12 -0500] miah: https://github.com/miah/chef_logstash/blob/master/test/spec/libraries/resource_logstash_config_spec.rb
[2013-03-02 01:25:57 -0500] miah: https://gist.github.com/miah/5069212
[2013-03-02 01:25:59 -0500] miah: is the test fail
[2013-03-02 01:28:14 -0500] rep0st1: miah: i've been looking at packet captures for two weeks straight now. Setting up a datacenter with newly carved VLANs hurts my eyes.
[2013-03-02 01:28:18 -0500] miah: i should probably actually test to see if the module is in the ancestors list or something..
[2013-03-02 01:28:32 -0500] miah: rep0st1: =)
[2013-03-02 01:28:37 -0500] rep0st1: skout: no worries i apprecaite it
[2013-03-02 01:28:55 -0500] spheromak: rep0st1: whats the question ?
[2013-03-02 01:29:42 -0500] rep0st1: spheromak: i was wondering what ports are required for chef 11 during bootstrap and during chef-client runs. From private VLAN the only port i opened to the chef server is 443
[2013-03-02 01:29:57 -0500] spheromak: is everything running on one machine ?
[2013-03-02 01:30:01 -0500] miah: from my test results, i'm pretty sure the include isn't actually firing.
[2013-03-02 01:30:09 -0500] miah: so i probably need to do something 'more better'
[2013-03-02 01:30:24 -0500] rep0st1: spheromak: it currently works and bootstraps fine. but it takes time to syncronize the cookbooks. Chef-server is running on one machine yes
[2013-03-02 01:30:25 -0500] spheromak: miah: everything can always be more better :|
[2013-03-02 01:30:31 -0500] miah: yes, of course
[2013-03-02 01:30:49 -0500] littleidea: miah: so this is what does work https://github.com/miah/chef_logstash/blob/master/libraries/resource_logstash_config.rb#L41-43
[2013-03-02 01:30:56 -0500] littleidea: brb, pizza guy
[2013-03-02 01:31:05 -0500] spheromak: rep0st1: it should only really need 443 (chef11) with all services on 1 host.  there are some issues with internal redirects. on 11.0.6  which
[2013-03-02 01:31:05 -0500] miah: littleidea: ya. so i dont think it is :/
[2013-03-02 01:31:19 -0500] miah: or i should say
[2013-03-02 01:31:23 -0500] miah: i dont think that is working
[2013-03-02 01:31:26 -0500] spheromak: i should
[2013-03-02 01:31:30 -0500] spheromak: miah: it should
[2013-03-02 01:31:41 -0500] miah: ya. thats what i'd think.
[2013-03-02 01:32:17 -0500] miah: i have that 'newbie' problem where you think you're doing things right, but your not really sure because you dont have the experience to backup your knowledge
[2013-03-02 01:32:40 -0500] miah: programming is hard
[2013-03-02 01:32:43 -0500] spheromak: yeap i hit it all the time in ruby
[2013-03-02 01:32:47 -0500] rep0st1: spheromak: interesting. i guess it's back to the drawing board one why syncin'g the cookbooks take atleast 20 seconds.
[2013-03-02 01:32:51 -0500] spheromak: esp wrt metaprogramming
[2013-03-02 01:32:58 -0500] spheromak: rep0st1: syncing from client to server ?
[2013-03-02 01:33:15 -0500] rep0st1: spheromak: correct during the bootstrap
[2013-03-02 01:33:16 -0500] spheromak: rep0st1: if its working, then its just alot of chatter.
[2013-03-02 01:33:20 -0500] spheromak: bootstrap on a client
[2013-03-02 01:33:21 -0500] miah: ya. metaprogramming requires some brain twists
[2013-03-02 01:33:37 -0500] rep0st1: spheromak: yeap.
[2013-03-02 01:34:08 -0500] miah: https://github.com/miah/chef_logstash/blob/master/test/spec/libraries/resource_logstash_config_spec.rb#L38-L47
[2013-03-02 01:34:12 -0500] miah: is the test that is failing
[2013-03-02 01:34:15 -0500] miah: so that could be totally wrong
[2013-03-02 01:34:21 -0500] spheromak: rep0st1: and its taking 20s ? how many cooks and how big. that doesn't seem really out of the ordinary depending
[2013-03-02 01:34:50 -0500] rep0st1: spheromak: syncing 2 cookbooks. chef-client and cron. =T
[2013-03-02 01:35:33 -0500] miah: brb
[2013-03-02 01:37:31 -0500] spheromak: rep0st1: thats strange. I can think of some exotic reasons something like that would happen, but they are left feiled stuff. Ususally on some lookup. Like pam user-> uid  lookups (if you got ldap or something else in there).  or host/nss breakage.
[2013-03-02 01:37:53 -0500] spheromak: or jsut io saturation
[2013-03-02 01:38:26 -0500] rep0st1: hm that's interesting.
[2013-03-02 01:38:50 -0500] spheromak: rep0st1: those are shots in the dark, but all things i've been afflicted with in the past :D
[2013-03-02 01:39:06 -0500] rep0st1: spheromak: but this is during the initial bootstrap. machine hasn't been joined to AD either. So it hasn't pulled down a list of users.
[2013-03-02 01:39:40 -0500] spheromak: is pam configured to talk @ that poiunt to ldap at all ?
[2013-03-02 01:39:49 -0500] rep0st1: spheromak: negative sir
[2013-03-02 01:40:12 -0500] spheromak: yea prob not the issue then.
[2013-03-02 01:40:14 -0500] miah: k
[2013-03-02 01:41:10 -0500] rep0st1: spheromak: like i said the problem goes away when i bootstrap a client in a different VLAN that is more open. Hence the reuqired ports question. In the old docs i read that a port needed to be open for api communication. but doc is doc
[2013-03-02 01:41:27 -0500] spheromak: everything between the 2 should be on 443
[2013-03-02 01:41:31 -0500] spheromak: 80/443
[2013-03-02 01:41:48 -0500] rep0st1: spheromak: well thing is i don't have 80 openend
[2013-03-02 01:42:00 -0500] spheromak: it makes me thinkg something else is trying ot hit somethign and timing out  (like ldap)
[2013-03-02 01:42:03 -0500] spheromak: :D
[2013-03-02 01:42:07 -0500] spheromak: shouldn't matter
[2013-03-02 01:42:14 -0500] rep0st1: spheromak: heh i wish it was that easy.
[2013-03-02 01:42:16 -0500] spheromak: but i mean easy to test if you can
[2013-03-02 01:42:33 -0500] spheromak: and like miah said i would just dump on your client
[2013-03-02 01:42:35 -0500] spheromak: and see
[2013-03-02 01:42:41 -0500] rep0st1: spheromak: i could turn on tcpdump and see what else is going on
[2013-03-02 01:42:47 -0500] spheromak: where i would go
[2013-03-02 01:43:11 -0500] rep0st1: spheromak: heh yea like  i said i've been looking at tcp pack streams for a awhile now. my eyes want to bleed
[2013-03-02 01:43:27 -0500] spheromak: just dont
[2013-03-02 01:43:40 -0500] spheromak: dont restict it to going to the chef server. My gut says its something outside chef
[2013-03-02 01:43:59 -0500] spheromak: is the resolver working @ that point in time ?
[2013-03-02 01:44:14 -0500] rep0st1: yes because it needs to resolve in order to pulldown the omnibus installer
[2013-03-02 01:44:29 -0500] spheromak: are all nameserver that are configured working ?
[2013-03-02 01:44:30 -0500] spheromak: :D
[2013-03-02 01:44:40 -0500] spheromak: again shots in the dark :D
[2013-03-02 01:44:59 -0500] ssd7: The last few times I have dug into slow cookbook operations it was some sort of dns/resolution issue
[2013-03-02 01:44:59 -0500] spheromak: no log info either ?
[2013-03-02 01:45:00 -0500] rep0st1: spheromak: no worries. i apprecite the help. im pulling my hair out on this one.
[2013-03-02 01:45:29 -0500] rep0st1: ssd7: ill give it one more shot. i'll specify one nameserver to rule it out. Atleast it's something i can do right now
[2013-03-02 01:46:07 -0500] ssd7: rep0st1: If you really want to rule it out, edit /etc/host with the info for your chef server
[2013-03-02 01:46:20 -0500] spheromak: ^^
[2013-03-02 01:48:15 -0500] ssd7: Even a small cookbook can be a dozen http downloads.  If your lookups are taking 1-2 seconds each, that accounts for a large portion of your time.  If it isn't that, I would check the nginx logs (this is Chef 11, yes?) which should have the total request time for each request, which will at least let you quantify what "slow" means a bit more exactly.
[2013-03-02 01:49:27 -0500] rep0st1: ssd7: ill take a look at the logs next
[2013-03-02 01:51:20 -0500] rep0st1: i wonder when sync'ing the cookbooks it trys port 80 first and if it fails trys port 443
[2013-03-02 01:51:42 -0500] spheromak: rep0st1: it should trying chef server uri
[2013-03-02 01:55:12 -0500] ssd7: rep0st1: Hrmm.  The chef debug log (client side) should tell you that
[2013-03-02 01:55:20 -0500] ssd7: You shoudl see where it is downloading from
[2013-03-02 01:59:36 -0500] rep0st1: nope not resolving issue
[2013-03-02 01:59:49 -0500] rep0st1: im willing to bet i need port 80 opened.
[2013-03-02 01:59:56 -0500] rep0st1: only difference between the two vlans
[2013-03-02 02:00:00 -0500] rep0st1: one's open the other isnt
[2013-03-02 02:00:12 -0500] rep0st1: going to hang my hat on this one. Can't open ports my self =T
[2013-03-02 02:00:24 -0500] rep0st1: appreciate the help folks.
[2013-03-02 02:00:45 -0500] ssd7: Interesting, I'll take a poke at that later since I think the intent is for clients to only communicate over 443 in the default config.
[2013-03-02 02:01:08 -0500] rep0st1: appreciate it.

[2013-03-02 06:51:28 -0500] ranjibd: meckadocious, can you try doing minimal stuff first?

[2013-03-02 06:59:03 -0500] coderanger: Should be 11.4.0 or higher preferably
[2013-03-02 06:59:07 -0500] coderanger: Good enough
[2013-03-02 07:01:24 -0500] ranjibd: meckadocious, can you share the output of `knife bootstrap $HOST -x ubuntu -i ~/key --sudo  -VV " ?
[2013-03-02 07:02:36 -0500] meckadocious: it's exactly the same from what i can tell
[2013-03-02 07:02:42 -0500] meckadocious: anything in particular i should point out?
[2013-03-02 07:03:16 -0500] coderanger: That wouldn't change anything
[2013-03-02 07:03:25 -0500] coderanger: just uses sudo in the bootstrap template
[2013-03-02 07:03:28 -0500] meckadocious: fwiw, sudo !! doesn't change anything :)
[2013-03-02 07:03:50 -0500] coderanger: How did you install chef on your workstation?
[2013-03-02 07:03:57 -0500] coderanger: Omnibus?
[2013-03-02 07:04:16 -0500] meckadocious: gem :-/ probably not ideal i guess
[2013-03-02 07:04:25 -0500] coderanger: If you did a manual gems install you might have a broken version of net-ssh
[2013-03-02 07:04:40 -0500] coderanger: Yeah, uninstall the chef gem, and grab the omnibus installer
[2013-03-02 07:04:55 -0500] meckadocious: ok
[2013-03-02 07:05:07 -0500] coderanger: https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/workstation-setup/
[2013-03-02 07:05:11 -0500] coderanger: Shows how to do the install
[2013-03-02 07:05:11 -0500] meckadocious: awesome thanks
[2013-03-02 07:05:29 -0500] coderanger: You don't need git possibly
[2013-03-02 07:05:33 -0500] coderanger: but the bottom part
[2013-03-02 07:06:36 -0500] meckadocious: hmmm it does look like i have 2 versions of net-ssh installed
[2013-03-02 07:08:20 -0500] coderanger: They released some non-backwards-compatible versions, caused no small bit of issues
[2013-03-02 07:08:27 -0500] coderanger: this is why we recommend omnibus so strongly :)
[2013-03-02 07:08:41 -0500] coderanger: it has everything bundled with known working versions top to bottom
[2013-03-02 07:10:06 -0500] rep0st1: coderanger: maybe you know the answer to my question. for open source chef-server what are the required ports that need to be opened during initial bootstrap as well as regular chef-client runs?
[2013-03-02 07:10:09 -0500] meckadocious: same issue :-/
[2013-03-02 07:10:32 -0500] coderanger: rep0st1: Should only require 443
[2013-03-02 07:10:41 -0500] meckadocious: it's got to be something to do with net-ssh
[2013-03-02 07:10:47 -0500] coderanger: rep0st1: 80 is nice as a redirector
[2013-03-02 07:11:00 -0500] coderanger: meckadocious: Just to be sure, knife --version?
[2013-03-02 07:11:03 -0500] rep0st1: oooo
[2013-03-02 07:11:18 -0500] rep0st1: coderanger: can we elaborate on the redirector?
[2013-03-02 07:11:20 -0500] coderanger: Should be newer, I think 11.6 is up on the install system
[2013-03-02 07:11:28 -0500] coderanger: rep0st1: http -> https
[2013-03-02 07:11:35 -0500] meckadocious: Chef: 11.4.0
[2013-03-02 07:11:42 -0500] meckadocious: hmmm
[2013-03-02 07:11:48 -0500] coderanger: meckadocious: Let me check what latest is
[2013-03-02 07:11:57 -0500] coderanger: I might be confusing internal release announcements with public ones
[2013-03-02 07:12:32 -0500] rep0st1: coderanger: since the client im bootstrapping can only reach my chef server over 443 and nothing more, would that explain why my total of 2 cookbooks are slow to syncronize?
[2013-03-02 07:12:53 -0500] coderanger: meckadocious: Yeah, ignore me, .4 is latest :)
[2013-03-02 07:13:11 -0500] coderanger: rep0st1: Hmm?
[2013-03-02 07:13:16 -0500] meckadocious: :) alrighty
[2013-03-02 07:13:33 -0500] coderanger: meckadocious: So okay, and you are sure you're running the knife from the omnibus install?
[2013-03-02 07:13:50 -0500] meckadocious: i'm totally uninstalling everything once more just to make sure
[2013-03-02 07:14:30 -0500] rep0st1: coderanger: yea the client im bootstrapping isin a heavily segmented VLAN by default it cannot access anything other than 443 to my chef server. When i boot a client in a more open VLAN my initial bootstrap of 2 cookbooks takes 2 seconds. While my segmented VLAN is a total of 40+ seconds. Just trying to confirm if i have all the ports open necessary on my VLAN
[2013-03-02 07:15:01 -0500] meckadocious: ugh same issue
[2013-03-02 07:15:01 -0500] rep0st1: coderanger: let me clarify it can reach DNS NTP and SMTP perfectly fine as those are the default allowed ports
[2013-03-02 07:15:40 -0500] meckadocious: other fun facts: net-ssh (2.6.5), net-ssh-gateway (1.2.0), net-ssh-multi (1.2.0, 1.1)
[2013-03-02 07:15:42 -0500] coderanger: rep0st1: If it works at all, then its happy as far as chef is concerned
[2013-03-02 07:16:15 -0500] rep0st1: gotcha
[2013-03-02 07:16:31 -0500] coderanger: meckadocious: Locally? As long as you are running /opt/chef/bin/knife (or whereever it installs on your OS) it should be using internal ones
[2013-03-02 07:16:32 -0500] rep0st1: yea it works bootstrap completes
[2013-03-02 07:16:39 -0500] rep0st1: just an odd behavior im noticing
[2013-03-02 07:16:44 -0500] coderanger: rep0st1: Sounds like it just is a very slow connection
[2013-03-02 07:17:11 -0500] meckadocious: oh it isn't using the system versions? interesting
[2013-03-02 07:18:07 -0500] rep0st1: it's a VM in the same datacenter as the chef server. 1 rack over connected to the same cisco switch ;D
[2013-03-02 07:19:15 -0500] meckadocious: just for fun i ran it directly with the same result: /opt/chef/bin/knife bootstrap $HOST -x ubuntu -i ~/.ssh/knifekey.pem   -VV
[2013-03-02 07:21:07 -0500] meckadocious: found this online, which has basically the same output as me: http://www.binbox.info/post/165615-debug-zen-xxxx-knife-bootstrap-vv-n-i-xxx-d-ubuntu11-04-apt.html
[2013-03-02 07:21:59 -0500] coderanger: rep0st1: Break out ye olde iperf :)
[2013-03-02 07:22:39 -0500] rep0st1: coderanger: lol ive been staring at iperf data and tcpdump data for 2 weeks now. my eyes want to bleed
[2013-03-02 07:25:25 -0500] coderanger: rep0st1: That will be me in a few weeks
[2013-03-02 07:25:44 -0500] coderanger: hg.python.org randomly sees huge slowdowns to some parts of the world >_<
[2013-03-02 07:28:41 -0500] rep0st1: coderanger: godspeed to you sir
[2013-03-02 07:41:04 -0500] meckadocious: well i tried uninstalling chef, installing rvm with ruby 2.0.0, installing chef into that, and running the same command exact same result
[2013-03-02 07:58:05 -0500] meckadocious: man i fired up an ubuntu vm, copied my ~/.chef dir over to it, installed chef with omnibus, and i get the SAME output
[2013-03-02 07:58:12 -0500] meckadocious: the only commonality is ~/.chef
[2013-03-02 07:58:27 -0500] meckadocious: (and chef version)
[2013-03-02 07:59:08 -0500] meckadocious: gonna sleep on it i think, and try to figure out if ~/.chef is causing me trouble
[2013-03-02 07:59:15 -0500] meckadocious: thanks fro your help coderanger!
[2013-03-02 07:59:22 -0500] meckadocious: also for
[2013-03-02 08:03:39 -0500] rep0st1: anybody familiar with the gem plugin knife-xenserver or any equivalent?
[2013-03-02 08:03:47 -0500] rep0st1: im hitting a weird 30 second timeout when my VM spins up
[2013-03-02 12:01:44 -0500] smdahlen: do default attributes defined within a cookbook used by one its recipes take precedence over default attributes named the same in another cookbook?

[2013-03-02 15:41:46 -0500] tmichael: anyone have a link for chef 11 system requirements (cpu, mem, etc).  can't seem to find via "the google"
[2013-03-02 16:30:47 -0500] amrnt: Please recommend me a good "haproxy" cookbook
[2013-03-02 16:56:14 -0500] aruntomar: tmichael: 1 cpu and 1 gig is bare min, i guess. I tried running on 512 mb, but was unsuccessful.
[2013-03-02 16:56:34 -0500] tmichael: exactly what i built this on for new cloud env
[2013-03-02 16:56:40 -0500] tmichael: chose xmall :)
[2013-03-02 16:56:46 -0500] tmichael: cuz on the cheap right now
[2013-03-02 16:56:53 -0500] tmichael: but afraid it's not gonna scale very far
[2013-03-02 16:56:55 -0500] aruntomar: tmichael: :0
[2013-03-02 16:56:57 -0500] aruntomar: :)
[2013-03-02 16:57:26 -0500] tmichael: and really don't want to wait til we have a hundred nodes before i decide we need more server
[2013-03-02 17:20:53 -0500] mswart: what is the best way to check inside a recipe/template whether an attribute value is a array, a other hash or something else?
[2013-03-02 17:27:38 -0500] cwj: mswart: node['foo'].class.name returns the class as a string
[2013-03-02 17:27:53 -0500] cwj: so you can do a comparison on it
[2013-03-02 17:28:56 -0500] cwj: you could also make use of respond_to?
[2013-03-02 17:30:28 -0500] mswart: cwj: i thought about kind_of? Array or so, but was unsure if chef emulates this method good enough to rely on this
[2013-03-02 17:30:56 -0500] cwj: i think that should work also
[2013-03-02 17:31:24 -0500] mswart: thx
[2013-03-02 17:31:28 -0500] cwj: are you familiar with chef-shell (formerly shef)? its a good way to experiment with stuff like this in a REPL
[2013-03-02 21:25:38 -0500] leifmadsen: I have an existing directory, and I want to link all the files from one directory into this existing directory. I don't really want to loop through a list of files just to link.... is it possible to tell the link resource ot just link all the files in a directory into another directory?
[2013-03-02 21:34:20 -0500] evxd: leifmadsen: you should just be able to symlink the directory itself
[2013-03-02 21:34:37 -0500] matti: coderanger: ? :)
[2013-03-02 21:34:54 -0500] pcn: leifmadset in case you can't do what evxd suggests, have you tried just writing a loop on top of reading all the files in a directory?
[2013-03-02 21:36:06 -0500] coderanger: matti: mistab because the person already left chan :)
[2013-03-02 21:42:28 -0500] matti: coderanger: Haha, OK ;[

[2013-03-02 21:44:29 -0500] leifmadsen: pcn: ya, I didn't really want to have to generate and maintain a list in chef though :
[2013-03-02 21:44:31 -0500] leifmadsen: :\
[2013-03-02 21:48:19 -0500] leifmadsen: ah, is an open issue :\  http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2383
[2013-03-02 21:48:29 -0500] leifmadsen: seems I have no choice but to generate the list
[2013-03-02 22:21:08 -0500] leifmadsen: hmmm, well thanks ruby :)
[2013-03-02 22:23:14 -0500] leifmadsen: ended up using the Dir.entries method to link the files from a directory using the link resource:  https://gist.github.com/leifmadsen/5073538

[2013-03-02 22:49:36 -0500] spheromak: this is all recent history (like thursday/friday of last week)
[2013-03-02 22:49:37 -0500] coderanger: spheromak: There was no activity for 12 months until this week, that means it was abandoned, glad to see it fixed, but there was still 12 months of no coordinated development
[2013-03-02 22:49:45 -0500] spheromak: yeap
[2013-03-02 22:50:08 -0500] spheromak: just saying It is not as of this minute abandoned. There are real interests and skills involved in making sure it moves foward.
[2013-03-02 22:50:12 -0500] spheromak: *forward.
[2013-03-02 22:50:26 -0500] spheromak: I only argue this cause it has alot of potential.
[2013-03-02 22:50:36 -0500] coderanger: Sure, I was very sad to see it adrift
[2013-03-02 22:50:37 -0500] coderanger: Noah too
[2013-03-02 22:50:38 -0500] spheromak: and im super glad it's getting love
[2013-03-02 22:50:54 -0500] coderanger: Noah is probably just staying that way permanently :-/
[2013-03-02 22:51:06 -0500] coderanger: But real competition for ZK is a very good thing
[2013-03-02 22:51:07 -0500] spheromak: lol
[2013-03-02 22:51:39 -0500] spheromak: yea i like it as an alternative to zk for  anumber of reasons. Size and ease of deploy is one.  Simplicity of use is another :D
[2013-03-02 22:51:47 -0500] spheromak: actual timeouts on locks is another :D
[2013-03-02 22:53:47 -0500] Izet: I installed server 11.06 but cant hit web page on port 4040 anyone had this issue?
[2013-03-02 22:53:59 -0500] spheromak: Izet: it all runs on 443
[2013-03-02 22:54:08 -0500] spheromak: 80/443
[2013-03-02 22:54:31 -0500] Izet: cool let me try
[2013-03-02 22:54:39 -0500] Izet: thanks
[2013-03-02 22:57:49 -0500] Izet: spheromak thank you very much
[2013-03-02 22:57:58 -0500] spheromak: np
