[2013-09-21 02:37:08 -0400] broconne: Looking at the docs, don't see how its possible, but figured I would ask.  Is there a way to capture the output from a perl resource?
[2013-09-21 03:46:01 -0400] jhujhiti: if i use the resources() to look up something, how can i add to its 'notifies' list?
[2013-09-21 04:01:15 -0400] jhujhiti: r.notifies :restart, 'service[apache2]' <- appends to the list, presumably?

[2013-09-21 17:45:02 -0400] acts_human: i am wanting to copy a node specific template (templates/default/server1.properties.erb, server2.properties.erb,...etc) onto each machine in my recipe.  I decided that setting a "normal" attribute per node and then using source "#{node.my_attr}.properties.erb" in my recipe would be a good idea, but when I run chef-client on my node I get a NoMethodError on node.my_attr.  What do?
[2013-09-21 17:53:27 -0400] acts_human: looks like I wasn't editing the right node, :(  I must have messed up my bootstrap
