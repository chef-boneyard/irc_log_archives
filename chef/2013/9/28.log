[2013-09-28 00:23:34 -0400] mahmoudimus: So, this might be a really bad idea, but is there a way to temporarily fool ohai into thinking that Amazon Linux is actually CentOS 6? :)
[2013-09-28 00:30:34 -0400] mahmoudimus: sudo runuser -l root -c 'echo "CentOS release 6.4 (Final)" > /etc/redhat-release'
[2013-09-28 00:40:29 -0400] joonas: try it and see ;)
[2013-09-28 03:22:40 -0400] savant: Hi all
[2013-09-28 03:23:08 -0400] savant: I'm on aws. Is there a way to get the current node's public ip address?
[2013-09-28 03:25:54 -0400] petecheslock: savant might be stored in node.public_ipv4
[2013-09-28 03:26:21 -0400] savant: hmmm
[2013-09-28 03:26:54 -0400] petecheslock: hrm - maybe not - let me check a node
[2013-09-28 03:28:48 -0400] savant: looks like i can do this curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
[2013-09-28 03:39:59 -0400] savant: petecheslock: any luck?
[2013-09-28 03:40:58 -0400] petecheslock: the nodes i'm looking at are inside a VPC so they don't have a public address
[2013-09-28 03:41:18 -0400] savant: how would I test this?
[2013-09-28 03:41:52 -0400] petecheslock: easiest way would be to run ohai on your EC2 node - you'll see it return back the node data
[2013-09-28 03:43:12 -0400] petecheslock: from there you can find your IP address - might be like this:    "ipaddress": "10.1.1.2,
[2013-09-28 03:45:49 -0400] jtimberman: savant: node['ec2']['public_hostname']
[2013-09-28 03:45:58 -0400] jtimberman: or public_ipv4
[2013-09-28 03:46:06 -0400] savant: how do I run ohai?
[2013-09-28 03:46:16 -0400] savant: oh nevermind
[2013-09-28 03:46:19 -0400] savant: im a fucking noob
[2013-09-28 03:46:21 -0400] savant: thank you sir!
[2013-09-28 03:47:50 -0400] savant: i think that works
[2013-09-28 03:47:52 -0400] savant: you're great
[2013-09-28 03:48:01 -0400] savant: <3
[2013-09-28 03:50:13 -0400] pontiki: 10.1.1.2 would not be a public IPv4 address
[2013-09-28 03:52:09 -0400] savant: looks like public_ipv4 would work
[2013-09-28 03:52:54 -0400] savant: its also in node['cloud']['public_ipv4']
[2013-09-28 03:53:08 -0400] savant: also node['cloud']['public_ips']
[2013-09-28 04:53:15 -0400] petecheslock: jtimberman; <3 hugops
[2013-09-28 10:36:08 -0400] arussel`: I'm having a lag of more than a minute between the time I can see the role of a node in the web ui and the time knife search "role:foo" returns the node. Why is that ?
[2013-09-28 14:58:15 -0400] patcon: anyone at opscode know any details about this: https://github.com/andytinycat/puppet-omnibus#what-are-omnibus-packages
[2013-09-28 14:59:12 -0400] patcon: This person seemed to be having issues getting PRs accepted that would have made their puppet-omnibus project work with the same stuff that chef-omnibus uses
[2013-09-28 14:59:31 -0400] patcon: Just wondering if anyone knows the story behind the PRs he claims couldn't be accepted :)
[2013-09-28 15:05:26 -0400] cheeseplus: patcon: where are said claims?
[2013-09-28 15:05:56 -0400] cheeseplus: kind of confused, there is a chef-omnibus but opscode also released generic omnibus builders so you could do it for any package regardless of the software
[2013-09-28 15:06:19 -0400] cheeseplus: so not sure why he would need to land PRs for that, it's already there for you to use with whatever you like
[2013-09-28 15:07:14 -0400] patcon: cheeseplus: not sure. they just sound a little resentful in the readme (not in the mean way). "v1 was built on the omnibus gem, but opscode wouldn't accept my PRs", then also "credits: thanks for fpm-cookery for accepting my PRs"
[2013-09-28 15:07:36 -0400] patcon: anyhow, guess I might search through the queues to find out
[2013-09-28 15:10:51 -0400] cheeseplus: omnibus evolved from being a chef specific thing to being abstracted so it may have just been a timing thing
[2013-09-28 16:39:15 -0400] chip-: Only pull from him I see is https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-ruby/pull/27, which is a good catch, and was merged 5 months ago.
[2013-09-28 16:39:23 -0400] chip-: But it did sit open for 2 months.
[2013-09-28 18:44:47 -0400] geggam: anyone run a chef server on openbsd ?
[2013-09-28 20:21:49 -0400] xtristan: does anyone have a solid/configurable uwsgi + nginx cookbook?
[2013-09-28 22:20:16 -0400] dysinger: fyi: latest test-kitchen fights with berkshelf 2.0.10 (latest)
[2013-09-28 22:20:34 -0400] dysinger: fights about celluloid gem version & bails the bundle install
[2013-09-28 22:26:59 -0400] dysinger: this commit is the breaker https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen/commit/a617a89e3f6210f3cff451164b4e3d4b7cde8f0a#diff-f374cef982d4ed71564b639da720a330
[2013-09-28 23:59:30 -0400] broconne: do people tend to store common permissions (user,group,perms) that are pervasive across multiple cookbooks in a data_bag or in a base cookbook?
