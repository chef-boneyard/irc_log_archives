[2013-09-01 00:07:23 -0400] kim___: hi, is anyone using capistrano with chef (capistrano-chef gem)?
[2013-09-01 00:50:28 -0400] yields: How do you override a template ?
[2013-09-01 00:50:41 -0400] yields: do you have to wrap the cookbook ?
[2013-09-01 04:33:02 -0400] walkah: hey, anyone using dmg_package know a trick to force upgrade/install of a specified version?
[2013-09-01 04:33:22 -0400] walkah: seems if the package is already installed, no action is taken
[2013-09-01 04:43:28 -0400] pontiki: no :(
[2013-09-01 04:45:34 -0400] stormerider: havent had time to play with chef on my osx box yet
[2013-09-01 04:48:41 -0400] walkah: tough to keep machines in sync if you can't get them to install new versions :-/
[2013-09-01 05:08:03 -0400] pontiki: well, new versions is something else
[2013-09-01 05:08:14 -0400] pontiki: i thought you meant you wanted to reinstall the same version
[2013-09-01 05:08:48 -0400] pontiki: new version you bump the version in the metatdata file in the recipe, and again in the node
[2013-09-01 15:00:30 -0400] ezotrank: Good day all! I'm using chef-solo and it possible to bootstrap chef with one user(root) and run some recipe by another user(it's simple deploy recipe). I want something like that `knife solo cook user@192.168.3.24 -N test_app_server -o "recipe[app::deploy]" ` ?
[2013-09-01 15:18:08 -0400] jchauncey: @ezotrank I'm pretty sure all recipes execute as root
[2013-09-01 15:19:58 -0400] ezotrank: jchauncey, yes I know that, but maybe solotuin for do this(run recipe without root permission) or maybe has best practice for deploy app with chef
[2013-09-01 15:22:19 -0400] jchauncey: we have a  knife plugin for deployment that places the resource (in our case jar files) on the box and then we write out a shell script to do the execution. I'm pretty sure the shell scripts get executed as user we want
[2013-09-01 15:55:01 -0400] cwj_: chef will run as a non-root user
[2013-09-01 15:55:15 -0400] cwj_: you just have to be mindful of the user permissions when writing your recipe
[2013-09-01 16:33:28 -0400] walkah: jtimberman: hey, looks like you maintain dmg at this point - any trick to support upgrades? (or plans to?)
[2013-09-01 16:56:13 -0400] jbz_: oh wait, no, it's there between the sidebars, just 1 inch wide and offset outside the pane
[2013-09-01 16:56:15 -0400] jbz_: wat
[2013-09-01 16:56:22 -0400] jbz_: whoops sorry, wrong channel lol
[2013-09-01 18:47:59 -0400] chip-: Random: I just forked a community cookbook and made it pass tailor, rubocop, and foodcritic with 0 violations, mostly so I could see how tailor & Rubocop differed.
[2013-09-01 18:48:12 -0400] chip-: Rarely have I ever felt so much like I had a stick up my ass.
[2013-09-01 19:01:21 -0400] joonas: chip-: you should throw https://github.com/square/cane in to the mix as well ;)
[2013-09-01 19:01:58 -0400] chip-: joonas: I was setting it up with code climate right now
[2013-09-01 19:02:30 -0400] joonas: code climate is a little different
[2013-09-01 19:03:23 -0400] joonas: cane is kind of like rubocop
[2013-09-01 19:03:54 -0400] chip-: But really it's not going to find much, since chef doesn't really have classes to inspect.
[2013-09-01 19:04:09 -0400] chip-: I guess I have minitest modules, but that's like 5 lines long
[2013-09-01 19:05:34 -0400] joonas: I wasn't being serious about Cane though, it's a bit of an overkill in this case :)
[2013-09-01 19:05:42 -0400] joonas: great for ruby projects though
[2013-09-01 19:06:10 -0400] chip-: I put it in for giggles, passes. :)
[2013-09-01 19:06:14 -0400] chip-: No modifications!
[2013-09-01 19:07:17 -0400] joonas: ha
[2013-09-01 19:07:49 -0400] joonas: https://coveralls.io/ ;)
[2013-09-01 20:11:42 -0400] subway: Is there a good way to deal with a workstation that needs to regularly communicate with multiple chef servers/orgs?
[2013-09-01 20:12:27 -0400] subway: Right now I have an alias that specifies the server url and client key on the command line for knife-foo and knife-bar
[2013-09-01 20:12:30 -0400] subway: but it seems janky
[2013-09-01 20:12:52 -0400] storme_out: subway: knife-block
[2013-09-01 20:13:40 -0400] storme_out: alternatively you can create .chef/knife.rb files inside your repo (assuming a 1:1 server:repo match) and it will use that instead of the $HOME/.chef/knife.rb
[2013-09-01 20:14:49 -0400] subway: I assume that would rely on the pwd being the chef repo?
[2013-09-01 20:15:07 -0400] subway: ...I kinda like that solution, since I do have a 1:1 server:repo ratio
[2013-09-01 20:15:27 -0400] storme_out: you'd have to be inside the repo, but not at the top of the repo necessarily, iirc
[2013-09-01 20:15:37 -0400] subway: cool.
[2013-09-01 20:15:49 -0400] subway: I'll check that out, and if it doesn't work well enough for me, I'll try out knife-block
[2013-09-01 20:15:50 -0400] storme_out: much like rake tasks will work inside subdirectories
[2013-09-01 20:15:53 -0400] subway: Thanks
[2013-09-01 20:15:55 -0400] storme_out: np
[2013-09-01 20:16:09 -0400] subway: nod, just searches up the tree until it hits a .chef directory, I'd assume
[2013-09-01 20:16:11 -0400] storme_out: i ran into this with personal and professional setups
[2013-09-01 20:16:13 -0400] subway: similarly to git
[2013-09-01 20:16:13 -0400] subway: etc
[2013-09-01 20:16:16 -0400] storme_out: yeah
[2013-09-01 20:16:23 -0400] subway: yup, that is exactly the situation I'm in.
[2013-09-01 20:16:46 -0400] storme_out: :) good luck, im off to take a break.
[2013-09-01 20:16:51 -0400] subway: enjoy
[2013-09-01 21:49:13 -0400] mveitas: quick question about deleting the validation certificate, if this runs and the chef run fails, will subsequent runs be able to connect?
[2013-09-01 22:18:40 -0400] JoshuaMiller: mveitas: if you're referring to bootstrapping, you won't need the validation key once the node object is created, which is at the very start of the run.  subsequent runs should be able to connect, but note that when the chef run fails during bootstrapping the node usually has an empty run list
[2013-09-01 22:19:09 -0400] JoshuaMiller: mveitas: so it can connect but it won't actually do anything to the client system
[2013-09-01 22:19:27 -0400] mveitas: JoshuaMiller: I have noticed that, but just wanted to make sure
[2013-09-01 22:58:54 -0400] MartinCleaver: Anyone know why Chef Server doesn't seem to be officially supported on Debian?
[2013-09-01 23:19:26 -0400] RJ2: trying to use partial .erb templates in chef 11.4.0
[2013-09-01 23:19:55 -0400] RJ2: i do <%= render "file", :local => true %>  but it can never find the file
[2013-09-01 23:20:12 -0400] RJ2: do i have to include it with the recipe somehow
[2013-09-01 23:20:22 -0400] RJ2: i don't have a template directive for the partial atm
[2013-09-01 23:22:44 -0400] storme_out: MartinCleaver: i believe because they're trying to limit the amount of platforms right now to focus on better isolating bugs.
[2013-09-01 23:24:14 -0400] MartinCleaver: storme_out: would you agree that Ubuntu LTS server is "pretty weak" for a server OS?
[2013-09-01 23:24:32 -0400] MartinCleaver: that's what I was told (see https://github.com/opscode/chef-docs/issues/72#issuecomment-23634431)
[2013-09-01 23:25:01 -0400] MartinCleaver: but I'd be surprised if Opscode would pick something at all weak
[2013-09-01 23:25:04 -0400] storme_out: no, i wouldn't.
[2013-09-01 23:25:41 -0400] MartinCleaver: Am I asking for trouble running the Ubuntu version on Debian?
[2013-09-01 23:25:51 -0400] storme_out: im running ~50 AWS instances on Ubuntu server for $work and we do even more ubuntu on VMs
[2013-09-01 23:26:40 -0400] MartinCleaver: given this will be a new virtual machine, I'm driving to keep it as simple as possible
[2013-09-01 23:26:42 -0400] storme_out: havent tried it. debian's been so far behind the curve until wheezy imo.
[2013-09-01 23:27:20 -0400] storme_out: id email the mailing list, given this is a holiday weekend, and ask for suggestions about a debian chef server if that's what you want to stick with.
[2013-09-01 23:28:06 -0400] MartinCleaver: the complaint I heard re: Ubuntu was that the "Network Manager is a big mess; takes control of all networking, and doing server-y things that no user would ever need are impossible"
[2013-09-01 23:28:40 -0400] MartinCleaver:  but as I don't get that low down, I wouldn't know
[2013-09-01 23:28:49 -0400] MartinCleaver: I do know we run on a lxc based platform
[2013-09-01 23:29:17 -0400] MartinCleaver: but I can't see whether that would cause a difficulty
[2013-09-01 23:30:05 -0400] MartinCleaver: Given you run 50+ instances I assume that's not your experience...
[2013-09-01 23:33:17 -0400] storme_out: chef@lists.opscode.com
[2013-09-01 23:34:41 -0400] MartinCleaver: thanks storme_out
[2013-09-01 23:48:29 -0400] storme_out: np. *goes back to poking vagrant with a stick*
[2013-09-01 23:54:09 -0400] MartinCleaver: ok, asked as http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2013-09/msg00002.html
