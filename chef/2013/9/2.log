[2013-09-02 08:41:52 -0400] girishb: Guys need help
[2013-09-02 08:42:16 -0400] girishb: new to Chef .. can some one please give an example role file
[2013-09-02 08:44:22 -0400] n1ko: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_roles.html
[2013-09-02 08:55:06 -0400] girishb: n1ko:  thanks  so where will be these role file bydefault
[2013-09-02 09:07:54 -0400] n1ko: girishb: read the url
[2013-09-02 09:07:58 -0400] n1ko: all explained there
[2013-09-02 09:20:52 -0400] prognostikos: how are you managing the configuration of your chef-server? using opscode/chef-server and chef-solo to bootstrap it? other clever ways?
[2013-09-02 09:28:58 -0400] s2r2: prognostikos: http://fnichol.github.io/knife-server/ << great
[2013-09-02 09:46:34 -0400] tugce: I want to use a bash script output as input in a file. But I couldn't find a way to do it. I'm not sure if templates can do this. Any ideas?
[2013-09-02 09:47:44 -0400] s2r2: tugce: "input in a file"? you want to capture the output of a bash script?
[2013-09-02 09:52:01 -0400] ichilton: Can node only be used from recipes, not from attribute files?
[2013-09-02 10:03:38 -0400] tugce: s2r2: oh my bad. Nope. What I need to do is simple. I want to create a file with some content in it.
[2013-09-02 10:04:07 -0400] s2r2: ok.  what content?
[2013-09-02 10:04:22 -0400] tugce: another file.
[2013-09-02 10:05:52 -0400] s2r2: so, you want to copy it? ;)
[2013-09-02 10:11:03 -0400] tugce: s2r2: yeap :)
[2013-09-02 10:11:48 -0400] tugce: content attribute is not working because it only copies a string.
[2013-09-02 10:11:54 -0400] s2r2: you could use the file resource with the content read in using File.read("/local/file")... or (never tested that) just pretend it was a template with the source stored locally (i.e. pass "local true")
[2013-09-02 10:19:08 -0400] tugce: hmmm okay i'll give it a try, hope it works! I think it's simple thing to do and it took lots of time already. thanks for advice!
[2013-09-02 10:47:50 -0400] tugce: Using a template worked fine.
[2013-09-02 11:07:54 -0400] SynchronE: hi everyone
[2013-09-02 11:08:34 -0400] SynchronE: i'm trying to upload databag secret key to vagrant, but it says Failed to upload a file to the guest VM via SCP due to a permissions error
[2013-09-02 11:08:54 -0400] SynchronE: i'm sure my local file is accessible just fine
[2013-09-02 11:09:06 -0400] SynchronE: how can I diagnose this ?
[2013-09-02 11:13:10 -0400] tugce: SynchronE: Umm I'm not quite sure but secret keys usually should have permissions as you can read but anyone else shouldn't be read or write it. So secret key file permission should be 600. I noticed sometimes permission mode 644 cause a problem.
[2013-09-02 11:13:37 -0400] SynchronE: it's not an SSL private key
[2013-09-02 11:13:46 -0400] SynchronE: it's encrypted data bag secret key
[2013-09-02 11:27:26 -0400] bigbigbang: Ohai ! I didn't find a way to get a "sub-attribute" and I need it to do "a case"  in recipe . I can get the "main" attribute but that doesn't interest me ... Can someone help ? (currently i'm trying to get it with "knife node show bb-b22-12.p.infra.arkea.com -a ARKEA:env" but did not work :-(
[2013-09-02 11:28:08 -0400] bigbigbang: i can get knife node show bb-b22-12.p.infra.arkea.com -a ARKEA which list my sub attribute but how to get it directly ?
[2013-09-02 11:41:02 -0400] prognostikos: is the knife-rackspace plugin not compatible with chef 11.6.0? i'm getting a load error for chef/knife/winrm which indeed is missing from the chef gem's lib/chef/knife directory
[2013-09-02 11:59:18 -0400] gsandie: bigbigbang: you can use a . - e.g. knife node show example.com -a foo.bar
[2013-09-02 12:00:01 -0400] bigbigbang: gsandie: great ! Thx !!
[2013-09-02 12:00:24 -0400] gsandie: bigbigbang: np
[2013-09-02 12:04:04 -0400] bigbigbang: gsandie: and do you know how I can do this in a recipe ? I was doing this but doesn't work ... begin case node[:ARKEA.env]   when "REC"   include_recipe "Hadoop::rec"   end end
[2013-09-02 12:06:51 -0400] RJ2: trying to use partials in a template.. my template contains:  <%= render "header.inc.erb", :local => true %>  but i get "No such file or directory - header.inc.erb" when chef runs
[2013-09-02 12:07:32 -0400] RJ2: do i have to deploy the header.inc.erb somehow using a directive in the recipe? atm i only have a template directive for the main template (the one that includes the render call)
[2013-09-02 12:07:40 -0400] RJ2: (chef 11.4.0)
[2013-09-02 12:19:58 -0400] bigbigbang: ff
[2013-09-02 12:26:28 -0400] bigbigbang: Please does somone knows how to do this in a recipe : case node["attr"]["subattr"] .. i can't find the syntax to resolve a "sub"attribute ..
[2013-09-02 12:26:54 -0400] bigbigbang: it seems to only work with one argument ..
[2013-09-02 12:27:33 -0400] s2r2: bigbigbang: it could just fail because node["attr"] is nil; have you checked that?
[2013-09-02 12:27:44 -0400] s2r2: cause what you wrote is ok
[2013-09-02 12:27:44 -0400] fooJBar: bigbigbang: the syntax you show is correct and works (unless the node actually doesn't have the "attr" attribute)
[2013-09-02 12:33:11 -0400] bigbigbang: no it doesn't work.. and i'm pretty sure my attribute exists (and subattribute too) when performing "knife node show bb-b22-12.p.infra.arkea.com -a ARKEA.env" it answer me well . But when case node["ARKEA"]["env"] when "REC" it doesn't work      ERROR MESSAGE : NoMethodError ------------- undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass

[2013-09-02 12:57:18 -0400] fooJBar: gregf: it could eb a problem in the grid1 cookbook, cookbooks are compiled to check for errors before they're uploaded
[2013-09-02 12:57:44 -0400] fooJBar: girishb1: check by trying to upload only that cookbook

[2013-09-02 13:00:20 -0400] fooJBar: girishb1: yups, looks like --server-url flag is not working? Tried setting the URL in knife.rb?
[2013-09-02 13:01:24 -0400] fooJBar: girishb1: never seen this breaking tbh so it's a long shot...
[2013-09-02 13:02:37 -0400] girishb1: fooJBar : yep the same url in knife.rb  some problem with url parse in ruby
[2013-09-02 13:03:02 -0400] fooJBar: girishb1: can you confirm if it's only the grid1 cookbook?
[2013-09-02 13:03:48 -0400] girishb1: fooJbar: same with all cookbooks .. tried uploading individually

[2013-09-02 13:08:20 -0400] fooJBar: you can try upgrading to 1.9.3 but doubt it will fix it, somehow your chef-server url not picked up...
[2013-09-02 13:13:11 -0400] girishb1: we have other server setup .. which is having same version of ruby
[2013-09-02 13:13:28 -0400] fooJBar: girishb1: and knife works correctly there?
[2013-09-02 13:13:47 -0400] girishb1: fooJBar:  yes
[2013-09-02 13:14:37 -0400] girishb1: yeah but ruby patch level is differrent
[2013-09-02 13:15:15 -0400] fooJBar: girishb1: long shot, don't think it would affect such a fundamental thing as unsetting the chef server url
[2013-09-02 13:16:34 -0400] girishb1: fooJBar : ok
[2013-09-02 13:17:19 -0400] fooJBar: girishb1: can u paste the full log of "knife cookbook upload  --server-url  "https://192.168.96.105/" grid1 -VV"

[2013-09-02 13:26:19 -0400] fooJBar: girishb1: it looks like this is caused by an incomplete bootstrap... Try nuking the node/client and re-installing chef-client manually
[2013-09-02 13:27:06 -0400] girishb1: fooJBar: sure
[2013-09-02 14:02:13 -0400] ichilton: Anyone manage (ipables) firewalls with chef? - it seems to be a topic with hardly any discussion?
[2013-09-02 14:07:57 -0400] mvollrath: yes, but not with a community cookbook unfortunately
[2013-09-02 14:34:31 -0400] tugce: require => Package["sudo"] This is puppet syntax. How can I write it in Chef?
[2013-09-02 14:34:50 -0400] tugce: I thought about only if but I wanted to learn if there is other way
[2013-09-02 14:36:12 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: Hi...
[2013-09-02 14:37:21 -0400] drrk: package "sudo" do action:install end
[2013-09-02 14:37:32 -0400] drrk: tugce: ^^
[2013-09-02 14:37:49 -0400] drrk: you will want line breaks in that, after so and install
[2013-09-02 14:38:53 -0400] tugce: drrk: Well I'vde already done it. But I'm converting some Puppet classes into Chef cookbooks.
[2013-09-02 14:39:08 -0400] tugce: drrk: class sudo {   package { sudo : ensure => installed }   file { "/etc/sudoers":     owner   => root,     group   => root,     mode    => 440,   } }
[2013-09-02 14:40:12 -0400] tugce: drrk: oh how stupid I am. sorry. After 7 hours of working I just mixed different classes in my head and trying to figure it out.
[2013-09-02 14:40:36 -0400] drrk: I don't know puppet syntax very well i'm afraid
[2013-09-02 14:41:56 -0400] tugce: drrk: package sudo do   action :install end  file "/etc/sudoers" do   owner "root"   group "root"   mode 00440   action :create end it was simple after all :)
[2013-09-02 14:42:23 -0400] drrk: sounds about right
[2013-09-02 14:42:35 -0400] drrk: there is a sudo comunity cookbook too
[2013-09-02 14:50:09 -0400] Raboo: I have a package and a execute. I want to run execute before the package only if i should run the package
[2013-09-02 14:50:41 -0400] Raboo: if it use notifies it tries to run after it tries to install the package?
[2013-09-02 14:51:15 -0400] tugce: drrk: well we don't want to use community cookbooks, we want to write cookbooks for only our needs.
[2013-09-02 14:51:46 -0400] drrk: good luck!
[2013-09-02 14:54:25 -0400] tugce: drrk: thanks a lot!
[2013-09-02 14:56:24 -0400] tugce: Raboo: as far as I know, if you use notifies it tries to execute then sends install command to package if needed.
[2013-09-02 15:37:38 -0400] fclausen: hello all - is it safe to run knife 11.6.0 against a 11.4.4 Chef server?
[2013-09-02 15:51:34 -0400] storme_out: fclausen: no such thing
[2013-09-02 15:51:45 -0400] storme_out: fclausen: server is 11.0.8
[2013-09-02 15:52:04 -0400] storme_out: but yes, they interoperate fine
[2013-09-02 15:52:56 -0400] fclausen: storme_out: My bad, I was looking at the chef-client by accident
[2013-09-02 15:53:04 -0400] fclausen: thanks for the info
[2013-09-02 15:53:37 -0400] fclausen: we are using 11.0.6 but I imagine that will be fine if 11.0.8 is OK
[2013-09-02 15:53:48 -0400] storme_out: yeah
[2013-09-02 16:19:49 -0400] nodie: hi
[2013-09-02 16:20:14 -0400] nodie: when I run "knife cookbook download <cookbook>"
[2013-09-02 16:20:25 -0400] nodie: I always end with a <cookbook>_<version> directory
[2013-09-02 16:20:29 -0400] nodie: is this right?
[2013-09-02 16:36:10 -0400] nodie: hello?
[2013-09-02 16:56:34 -0400] cwj: nodie: that seems like expected behavior to me. did you expect something different?
[2013-09-02 17:06:10 -0400] nodie: hi cwj
[2013-09-02 17:06:34 -0400] nodie: I can't find anywhere where it says that that's the way it works
[2013-09-02 17:06:53 -0400] nodie: and a friend is telling me that when he download the cookbooks they don't have version number :-/
[2013-09-02 17:07:12 -0400] nodie: I just one another person to tell me if the _<version> in the cookbook directory is right
[2013-09-02 17:07:27 -0400] nodie: and if I need to remove the _<version> before uploading again
[2013-09-02 17:09:25 -0400] cwj: nodie: https://gist.github.com/cwjohnston/6415103
[2013-09-02 17:09:53 -0400] cwj: i am using chef 11.4.4, you might compare your version with your friend's
[2013-09-02 17:11:27 -0400] nodie: mine is 10.12 his version is 11.x
[2013-09-02 17:16:12 -0400] mutombo: greetings, i've got a very weird problem ;)
[2013-09-02 17:16:47 -0400] mutombo: when i start an ec2 instance via knife, "ohai ec2" works fine and show me the metadata
[2013-09-02 17:17:22 -0400] mutombo: when i start an instance via autoscaling and install chef omnibus, "ohai ec2" fails
[2013-09-02 17:17:34 -0400] mutombo: because the arp mac is different
[2013-09-02 17:18:20 -0400] mutombo: im unsing hints now and it works fine that way, but its very weird nontheless
[2013-09-02 17:19:13 -0400] cwj: mutombo: in think that kind of corner case detecting ec2 nodes is one of the reasons the hints system was implemented
[2013-09-02 17:19:16 -0400] cwj: s/in/i/
[2013-09-02 17:20:11 -0400] cwj: similar problems with rackspace
[2013-09-02 17:21:01 -0400] mutombo: hm ok
[2013-09-02 17:21:36 -0400] mutombo: i guess it has something to do with the change that all ec2 instances are now running in a VPC environment
[2013-09-02 17:21:42 -0400] cwj: if your autoscaling nodes are in vpc
[2013-09-02 17:21:42 -0400] cwj: yeah
[2013-09-02 17:22:16 -0400] mutombo: but the weird thing is i can reliably start intances via knife and they are always ok
[2013-09-02 17:22:17 -0400] cwj: if you are interested in the historical details, http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/OHAI-267 and http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/OHAI-310
[2013-09-02 17:22:52 -0400] mutombo: ah thanks a lot, hadnt found the second ticket
[2013-09-02 17:23:03 -0400] cwj: i think knife ec2 might drop off a hint, since it knows you are starting an ec2 node
[2013-09-02 17:23:04 -0400] cwj: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KNIFE-148
[2013-09-02 17:25:03 -0400] mutombo: m(
[2013-09-02 17:25:23 -0400] mutombo: you're absolutely right, it does :)

[2013-09-02 17:37:48 -0400] JoelMcCracken: is there a good way to copy a file into place while maintaining a backup if a file exists?
[2013-09-02 17:46:59 -0400] douglaswth: JoelMcCracken: as far as I know all of chef's file resources have that behavior; check out yhe backups attribute
[2013-09-02 19:06:35 -0400] gondoi: btm_: you around?
[2013-09-02 19:07:32 -0400] gondoi: anyone else getting this error with minitest-handler-cookbook: Cannot find a resource for action_run on ubuntu version 12.04
[2013-09-02 19:25:34 -0400] arussel: I'm following https://learnchef.opscode.com/starter-use-cases/wordpress/
[2013-09-02 19:26:19 -0400] arussel: where does the Ferkfile should be exactly ? I understand ~/repo-chef, but then I don't want to freeze the version for all cookbooks ...
[2013-09-02 19:42:39 -0400] jchauncey: arussel: typically you have 1 repo per cookbook when working with Berkshelf
[2013-09-02 19:42:58 -0400] jchauncey: so each cookbook has its own Berksfile that lists out its dependencies
[2013-09-02 19:43:26 -0400] jchauncey: although unless you are doing something like referencing a path or github url for your dependent cookbooks I would just list them in the metadata.rb
[2013-09-02 19:43:47 -0400] jchauncey: and just let your Berksfile reference your metadata.rb
[2013-09-02 19:44:22 -0400] jchauncey: oh and its at the root of the cookbook
[2013-09-02 19:47:58 -0400] arussel: jchauncey: root of cookbooks mean ~/chef-repo/cookbooks or ~/chef-repo/ ?
[2013-09-02 19:50:02 -0400] mikeb2: hello, can anyone give me a hand to understand why chef won't compile any source recipes?
[2013-09-02 19:50:47 -0400] jchauncey: ~/chef-repo/cookbooks/foo-cookbook
[2013-09-02 19:51:35 -0400] jchauncey: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYt0E84kYUI - watch that, its by the guy who created berkshelf
[2013-09-02 19:52:35 -0400] arussel: jchauncey: thanks
[2013-09-02 19:52:57 -0400] jchauncey: i think the whole 1 repo for cookbooks is a bad idea, and he explains why that is
[2013-09-02 21:06:55 -0400] rafaelmagu: Howdy
[2013-09-02 21:07:07 -0400] rafaelmagu: Seeing strange behaviour with chef-client this morning
[2013-09-02 21:07:43 -0400] rafaelmagu: I just patch-level bumped a cookbook in my own repo and promoted it on the node's environment but chef-client run on the node still uses the previous version
[2013-09-02 21:08:09 -0400] rafaelmagu: I know I can just delete the /var/cache/chef/cookbooks folder to get it right again but wanted to understand what's going on
[2013-09-02 21:52:46 -0400] stormerider: rafaelmagu: did you bump the version?
[2013-09-02 21:53:07 -0400] rafaelmagu: Manually editing the json, not through spork
[2013-09-02 21:54:20 -0400] stormerider: I've noticed that if the version doesn't change, the chef-client caching will not always notice a difference and xfer the cookbook over from the chef server.
[2013-09-02 21:54:40 -0400] stormerider: moral of the story: always bump the version.
[2013-09-02 21:58:23 -0400] rafaelmagu: Yeah, that I did
[2013-09-02 21:58:33 -0400] rafaelmagu: I'm bumping every version from now on
[2013-09-02 22:19:28 -0400] Guest24779: :(
[2013-09-02 22:19:32 -0400] rafaelmagu: Figured it out
[2013-09-02 22:19:36 -0400] rafaelmagu: And I feel pretty dumb
[2013-09-02 22:19:56 -0400] paiige: been there
[2013-09-02 22:20:10 -0400] rafaelmagu: Cookbook I was updating was not in the run list :D
[2013-09-02 22:20:39 -0400] paiige: I quit using environment specific run lists because of that
[2013-09-02 22:20:46 -0400] paiige: made me mad
[2013-09-02 22:21:45 -0400] paiige: not that they're not useful but it was just more hassle than it was worth
[2013-09-02 22:22:09 -0400] paiige: things don't need to be that abstract
[2013-09-02 22:29:07 -0400] rafaelmagu: Nah, this was the node in particular
[2013-09-02 22:29:15 -0400] rafaelmagu: Hate non-standard nodes
[2013-09-02 22:29:25 -0400] rafaelmagu: This one's getting decommissioned soon anyway :D
[2013-09-02 22:30:21 -0400] paiige: rafaelmagu: another thing that will screw you is the versioning
[2013-09-02 22:30:49 -0400] rafaelmagu: I'm using env versioning because it's not just me working on cookbooks anymore
[2013-09-02 22:32:32 -0400] miah: you can version in cookbook metadata and the chef environment, both should work fine
[2013-09-02 22:33:34 -0400] paiige: not interested at all
[2013-09-02 22:33:54 -0400] paiige: I like things to be kept simple
[2013-09-02 22:34:26 -0400] rafaelmagu: With knife spork it is :)
[2013-09-02 22:35:43 -0400] paiige: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2163402/tips-for-a-programmer-with-dyslexia
[2013-09-02 22:35:53 -0400] miah: software development isn't simple, so by definition neither is chef.
[2013-09-02 22:37:53 -0400] paiige: whats the hardest part of your job miah
[2013-09-02 22:38:08 -0400] paiige: FYI I got laid off
[2013-09-02 22:38:22 -0400] paiige: and moved to eugene where there's like no tech jobs
[2013-09-02 22:38:29 -0400] paiige: I don't know if I care though
[2013-09-02 22:38:44 -0400] ekarlso-: where's eugene?
[2013-09-02 22:38:57 -0400] miah: oregon
[2013-09-02 22:39:03 -0400] paiige: getting laid off really made me think that maybe I don't want to be a programmer
[2013-09-02 22:39:13 -0400] paiige: or do any kind of tech job
[2013-09-02 22:39:18 -0400] paiige: because I tried so hard
[2013-09-02 22:39:28 -0400] miah: hardest part of my job is keeping focused despite wanting to build all the things
[2013-09-02 22:40:07 -0400] paiige: I don't want to work on anything except opensource stuff
[2013-09-02 22:40:10 -0400] miah: work gets easier the longer you do it, in my case i've been working in sysadmin/security for ~16 years
[2013-09-02 22:40:15 -0400] paiige: I'm fine with selling hosting
[2013-09-02 22:40:33 -0400] miah: its really hard to compare yourself to others because you're not them
[2013-09-02 22:40:37 -0400] paiige: I don't want to work on anything that isn't opensource though
[2013-09-02 22:40:40 -0400] stormerider: hardest part of my job has been hitting the off switch at night / on weekends
[2013-09-02 22:40:58 -0400] miah: off switch. lol that doesn't exist.
[2013-09-02 22:41:33 -0400] miah: not wanting to work on aything that isn't open source is fine. but you have to get to the point in your career where people will pay you based on your kills to do just that. otherwise you have to settle.
[2013-09-02 22:41:40 -0400] stormerider: my new coworkers are leading by example and im starting to adapt.
[2013-09-02 22:41:55 -0400] stormerider: hah, nice typo "based on your kills" :)
[2013-09-02 22:42:16 -0400] paiige: miah: I was trying to tell you that I was gonna move to SF / bay area but I got 900 bucks stolen from me and a bunch of other shit happened and it would have been fucked anyway because it was a bigger hassle to get my unemployment straightened out than I thought it was going to be
[2013-09-02 22:42:16 -0400] stormerider: that usually is pretty convincing ;)
[2013-09-02 22:42:34 -0400] UForgotten: paiige: what do you have against open source?  chef is open source...
[2013-09-02 22:42:39 -0400] paiige: 900 bucks, a coach purse and coach wallet my id and all my cards
[2013-09-02 22:42:49 -0400] paiige: I don't have anything against opensource
[2013-09-02 22:42:53 -0400] stormerider: UForgotten: they said anything that "isn't" open source
[2013-09-02 22:42:57 -0400] paiige: I only want to work on opensource projects from now on
[2013-09-02 22:43:05 -0400] miah: drama llama. i avoid people who are drama llamas, and thus i dont have those types of issues in my life.
[2013-09-02 22:43:11 -0400] paiige: the software I worked on at my last job wasn't opensource even though it would have been better off
[2013-09-02 22:43:36 -0400] paiige: miah: it'll find you sooner or later :)
[2013-09-02 22:44:14 -0400] miah: just keep searching for yourself, you're better off
[2013-09-02 22:44:29 -0400] paiige: searching for..
[2013-09-02 22:44:32 -0400] paiige: ?
[2013-09-02 22:44:33 -0400] stormerider: i love working is OS stuff but not everything i do is built from scratch, we have a lot of vendors.
[2013-09-02 22:44:40 -0400] stormerider: working on*
[2013-09-02 22:45:15 -0400] miah: paiige: clearly you dont know where you fit in the career world, so you're still searching =)
[2013-09-02 22:45:23 -0400] paiige: oh
[2013-09-02 22:45:28 -0400] paiige: yeahhhh
[2013-09-02 22:45:37 -0400] stormerider: like we're currently speccing out what it will take to acquire enterprise chef, for example
[2013-09-02 22:45:46 -0400] miah: so, if you want to be a programming /quit and go write code. dont let yourself easily be distracted by drama and bullshit
[2013-09-02 22:45:47 -0400] paiige: it would help if I wasn't so burnt out and picky
[2013-09-02 22:45:58 -0400] paiige: for sure
[2013-09-02 22:46:01 -0400] miah: remove the shit that burns you out from your life
[2013-09-02 22:46:20 -0400] miah: sometimes that takes work
[2013-09-02 22:46:24 -0400] paiige: thats pretty sound advice
[2013-09-02 22:46:39 -0400] paiige: I think Im definitely searching, getting out of seattle should help
[2013-09-02 22:46:43 -0400] miah: i found that i'm pretty hardcore introvert
[2013-09-02 22:47:22 -0400] miah: and that i just cant deal with people who whine all the time instead of helping themselves. much of why i dont affiliate myself with noisebridge and such anymore
[2013-09-02 22:47:55 -0400] stormerider: i like being affiliated with seattle but not being in seattle.
[2013-09-02 22:48:23 -0400] stormerider: but working from home is pretty much a necessity given my disability
[2013-09-02 22:48:24 -0400] paiige: stormerider: it just like any other place but I have a lot of bad history there
[2013-09-02 22:48:26 -0400] miah: i am affiliated with san francisco but live in the east bay where cost of living is a bit more sane
[2013-09-02 22:48:48 -0400] miah: and where mission hipster kids avoid because its not the mission
[2013-09-02 22:49:11 -0400] paiige: I want to come check it out I was looking at places on craigslist it doesn't seem much worse than seattle
[2013-09-02 22:49:23 -0400] miah: you can't move here without a job
[2013-09-02 22:49:34 -0400] paiige: yeah
[2013-09-02 22:49:37 -0400] miah: the job market is fuckkkked unless you are a total badass
[2013-09-02 22:49:46 -0400] paiige: that I'm not
[2013-09-02 22:49:47 -0400] paiige: lol
[2013-09-02 22:49:52 -0400] miah: and the housing market is in the landlords favor. if you dont like something they can rent to _anybody else_
[2013-09-02 22:50:18 -0400] miah: people sometimes show up to open houses and offer landlords 20k cash site unseen
[2013-09-02 22:50:38 -0400] paiige: wot
[2013-09-02 22:50:39 -0400] paiige: lol
[2013-09-02 22:50:46 -0400] paiige: thats a good idea
[2013-09-02 22:50:52 -0400] miah: yes, dont fuck with san francisco renters
[2013-09-02 22:51:02 -0400] miah: you will get stabbed. but if you have cash you have the upperhand
[2013-09-02 22:51:45 -0400] UForgotten: thats crazy
[2013-09-02 22:52:07 -0400] miah: you _have_ to show up to open houses with _all of your background checks_ and forms already filled out, and a signed check if you even want a chance
[2013-09-02 22:52:29 -0400] miah: getting a place in the east bay was much easier and less hassel
[2013-09-02 22:52:39 -0400] paiige: yeah I would imagine
[2013-09-02 22:52:55 -0400] miah: its pretty horrible
[2013-09-02 22:53:04 -0400] miah: i dont know that i'll ever live in SF proper again
[2013-09-02 22:53:07 -0400] paiige: are you close enough to the train
[2013-09-02 22:53:14 -0400] miah: i live <1 mile from bart
[2013-09-02 22:53:19 -0400] paiige: right I wasn't thinking of doing sf proper myself when i was gonna go
[2013-09-02 22:53:35 -0400] paiige: do you have roommates?
[2013-09-02 22:53:38 -0400] miah: no
[2013-09-02 22:53:47 -0400] paiige: right on
[2013-09-02 22:53:53 -0400] paiige: yeah thats perfect
[2013-09-02 22:54:01 -0400] miah: well, my gf is technically my roommate
[2013-09-02 22:54:01 -0400] paiige: I like living alone
[2013-09-02 22:54:40 -0400] miah: 1 gf, two cats, and on weekends 2 daughters
[2013-09-02 22:55:11 -0400] paiige: fun :)
[2013-09-02 22:55:36 -0400] paiige: yeah I don't have any kids or a gf I'm separated
[2013-09-02 22:55:41 -0400] miah: and UForgotten im right there with you. working remotely is where its at.
[2013-09-02 22:55:48 -0400] paiige: Ive been meaning to file the divorce but Ive been too lazy
[2013-09-02 22:57:09 -0400] taion809: miah: how do you like working there specifically (not living)
[2013-09-02 22:57:44 -0400] paiige: I secretly like not having a job and having unemployment
[2013-09-02 22:58:50 -0400] paiige: I have a lot of freedom right now
[2013-09-02 22:58:55 -0400] miah: taion809: i like working here, i get paid well, the challenges are typically interesting, and the people tend to be smart and dedicated
[2013-09-02 22:59:04 -0400] miah: but there are tons of dipshits and dumb startups too
[2013-09-02 22:59:19 -0400] miah: its just harder to weed them out because there are sooooooooooooooo many
[2013-09-02 22:59:27 -0400] paiige: dipshits and dumb startups == ponzi schemes
[2013-09-02 22:59:33 -0400] paiige: its really demotivating
[2013-09-02 22:59:46 -0400] miah: i've worked for one of those already, but that was in Houston
[2013-09-02 23:00:02 -0400] miah: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Financial_Group
[2013-09-02 23:00:33 -0400] taion809: :\
[2013-09-02 23:00:52 -0400] paiige: miah: my attention is demanded, I want to talk to you though I'll catch you later
[2013-09-02 23:01:50 -0400] miah: taion809: i've been through several really bad startups
[2013-09-02 23:02:13 -0400] taion809: im in one now, thought about trying my luck in SF next year hah
[2013-09-02 23:02:20 -0400] miah: but my problem is that im interested in building technology and doing cool shit
[2013-09-02 23:02:33 -0400] miah: there are lots of startups that just want to get their product to market and dont really care about the technology at all
[2013-09-02 23:02:40 -0400] miah: and are just willing to do all the worst things
[2013-09-02 23:03:39 -0400] miah: eg, take massive pride in android/ios apps, but the infrastructure is like the PruittIgoe
[2013-09-02 23:03:57 -0400] miah: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruitt%E2%80%93Igoe
[2013-09-02 23:05:02 -0400] taion809: :\ ya been there, im pretty sure i'm building vaporware hah
[2013-09-02 23:10:57 -0400] paiige: miah: the company I was working for needed to have a business model (a plan for making money)
[2013-09-02 23:11:00 -0400] paiige: and they didn't
[2013-09-02 23:11:04 -0400] paiige: and I worked there for a year and a half
[2013-09-02 23:12:23 -0400] paiige: I think the only way they can make it work is if they opensource it and sell private hosting for it
[2013-09-02 23:12:32 -0400] paiige: and I suggested that and they thought it was a ludacris idea
[2013-09-02 23:12:36 -0400] paiige: now they don't have anything
[2013-09-02 23:13:01 -0400] paiige: and I didn't really get much more than salary and unemployment out of it and I'm pretty disappointed
[2013-09-02 23:13:13 -0400] yfeldblum: paiige, works for some projects; witness #chef
[2013-09-02 23:13:20 -0400] paiige: exactly
[2013-09-02 23:13:23 -0400] paiige: its not just chef
[2013-09-02 23:13:42 -0400] paiige: there's a lot of PHP apps that do that we should have done it with ours but
[2013-09-02 23:14:04 -0400] paiige: they didn't wanna go that way so
[2013-09-02 23:37:53 -0400] rafaelmagu: !info prestige
[2013-09-02 23:38:00 -0400] rafaelmagu: Jeebus
[2013-09-02 23:38:03 -0400] rafaelmagu: Wrong channel
[2013-09-02 23:38:05 -0400] rafaelmagu: One of those days
[2013-09-02 23:38:06 -0400] rafaelmagu: :D
