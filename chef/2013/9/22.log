[2013-09-22 05:57:12 -0400] Mallok: hello
[2013-09-22 05:57:49 -0400] Mallok: Someone could give me a hand dealing with newrelic on opsworks?
[2013-09-22 16:37:23 -0400] strictlyb: anyone here using opscode/openldap cookbook?
[2013-09-22 17:39:01 -0400] subway: strictlyb: I just started looking at using it yesterday.
[2013-09-22 17:39:10 -0400] subway: Unfortunately it feels kind of janky.
[2013-09-22 17:39:14 -0400] strictlyb: it seems so right
[2013-09-22 17:39:17 -0400] strictlyb: like it instals properly
[2013-09-22 17:39:20 -0400] strictlyb: but theres no database,
[2013-09-22 17:39:33 -0400] strictlyb: theres no clear way on how to initiate a admin user based on this structure.
[2013-09-22 17:39:40 -0400] strictlyb: i was wondering how people were handling this
[2013-09-22 17:40:02 -0400] subway: no database?
[2013-09-22 17:40:17 -0400] strictlyb: hdb or bdb
[2013-09-22 17:40:20 -0400] subway: You should wind up with a default openldap setup using the basedn specified in your attrs
[2013-09-22 17:40:21 -0400] strictlyb: generally the admin user is added
[2013-09-22 17:40:23 -0400] subway: that's odd
[2013-09-22 17:40:27 -0400] strictlyb: its not there,
[2013-09-22 17:40:30 -0400] strictlyb: i tried to auth with it
[2013-09-22 17:40:33 -0400] strictlyb: and it doesnt work
[2013-09-22 17:41:16 -0400] subway: Huh. I hadn't actually gotten around to installing it, I've just read through it, and it appeared that it would properly create the db. My beef with it was the weird undocumented stuff going on in login_access for openldap::auth
[2013-09-22 17:46:42 -0400] strictlyb: so when you try and do an add with ldap
[2013-09-22 17:46:50 -0400] strictlyb: with the binddn `/pass
[2013-09-22 17:46:53 -0400] strictlyb: it doesnt work
[2013-09-22 17:46:56 -0400] strictlyb: anyhow ill ifgure it out
[2013-09-22 17:47:06 -0400] strictlyb: just wanted to know what / of people were using it
[2013-09-22 17:47:30 -0400] subway: good luck. I'm probably going to write my own cookbook for it, using cn=config
[2013-09-22 17:48:08 -0400] strictlyb: yeah
[2013-09-22 17:48:23 -0400] strictlyb: well see might do the same,
[2013-09-22 17:48:26 -0400] strictlyb: thanks for your input
