[2013-09-29 02:49:04 -0400] broconne: Something I am not quite understanding about berkshelf..  I create/init cookbooks with berkshelf.

[2013-09-29 07:20:22 -0400] zenloop: question, how do I run a cookbook file from command line of chef node.  I do not want to use the version on the chef server.
[2013-09-29 07:24:51 -0400] zenloop: I guess I could use chef-solo and change cookbooks on a chef-repo checked out on the node.
[2013-09-29 14:42:31 -0400] brimstone: i'm new to chef, trying to wrap my mind around it. are admins really expected to run "sudo chef-client" on every node every so often? is there a recommend way to automagically run chef-client on every node periodically?

[2013-09-29 19:19:29 -0400] alunduil: Is it possible or desirable to refer to a recipe and store a recipe such that it resolves via a name such as foo::bar::baz?  If it is doable, how is it done?
[2013-09-29 21:01:12 -0400] martinisoft: Having some weird inconsistency with the users cookbook

[2013-09-29 21:06:09 -0400] knuckolls: martinisoft, as i recall there are two different actions in the lwrps in the users cookbook
[2013-09-29 21:06:45 -0400] knuckolls: the :remove i believe is the one that notices changes and fixes stuff
[2013-09-29 21:06:52 -0400] knuckolls: this is from memory, so.. good luck :)
[2013-09-29 21:10:32 -0400] martinisoft: remove just removes
[2013-09-29 21:10:35 -0400] martinisoft: so I don't want to go there
[2013-09-29 21:24:57 -0400] martinisoft: knuckolls: went with a PR :D https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/users/pull/31

[2013-09-29 22:44:38 -0400] alunduil: How does one check if a package is available from inside of a resource and then use that to determine if another installation method should be tried?
[2013-09-29 22:44:47 -0400] alunduil: s/resource/recipe/
[2013-09-29 22:51:00 -0400] joe____: hi if we put include_recipe 'recipename' does it actually run the recipe itself?
[2013-09-29 22:55:21 -0400] alunduil: joe____, yes it does.
[2013-09-29 22:55:50 -0400] joe____: thanks alunduil :)
[2013-09-29 22:55:59 -0400] alunduil: joe____, no problem.
