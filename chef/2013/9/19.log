[2013-09-19 21:00:38 -0400] jtimberman: ugh
[2013-09-19 21:00:53 -0400] jtimberman: twitter is so not the appropriate medium for that conversation.
[2013-09-19 21:04:49 -0400] doomviking: yow
[2013-09-19 21:06:26 -0400] jameson__: this is going to be a show.
[2013-09-19 21:06:28 -0400] matticulous: can anyone help troubleshoot the registering of a chef-client to the server? if doing 'chef-client -S [url] -K [validation key], I am getting ERROR: Server returned error for https://[server_url]
[2013-09-19 21:06:51 -0400] ssd7_: matticulous: Is this for a server you are running yourself?
[2013-09-19 21:07:01 -0400] matticulous: sussd7_: correct
[2013-09-19 21:07:03 -0400] stormerider: jtimberman: i think out loud is not an appropriate medium for most of that conversation...
[2013-09-19 21:07:27 -0400] fak3r: jameson__: if you're getting a drink, might want to get two, this keeps scrolling down and down... https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz/status/380394450746216448
[2013-09-19 21:07:47 -0400] gchristensen: ahh that is awesome ... if you have a search-defined hostgroup in nagios, and no matching nodes, it doesn't write the hostgroup out... but if you have a service databag item for that hostgroup, it does write it out, causing nagios to blow up.
[2013-09-19 21:07:47 -0400] matticulous: ssd7_: correct
[2013-09-19 21:08:31 -0400] ssd7_: matticulous: Can you run that again with -ldebug and then post the end of the log somewhere, it should let us see what API call is failing which will allow us to provide some guidance
[2013-09-19 21:08:46 -0400] ssd7_: also note that the -k option is for the client key, not the validator key
[2013-09-19 21:08:57 -0400] ssd7_: I don't think there is a -K option
[2013-09-19 21:09:04 -0400] ssd7_: oh nvm
[2013-09-19 21:09:06 -0400] ssd7_: there is
[2013-09-19 21:09:09 -0400] ssd7_: (facepalm)
[2013-09-19 21:10:06 -0400] matticulous: ssd7_: yeah, i'm trying to create the client. the ultimate object is to use the chef_client vagrant provisioner, which is failing. i'm not just moving closer by troubleshooting on the client.
[2013-09-19 21:11:05 -0400] ssd7_: So, Server returned error likely means something is up on your server.  Is this Chef 11 server
[2013-09-19 21:11:31 -0400] ssd7_: if so, check /var/log/chef/erchef/current and perhaps post anything that looks like an error message to pastebin or gist
[2013-09-19 21:12:17 -0400] matticulous: ssd7_: yes, chef 11
[2013-09-19 21:12:49 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: Twitter is bad at everything except animated gifs, hasn't stopped us yet.
[2013-09-19 21:16:16 -0400] matticulous: ssd7_: gist - https://gist.github.com/matticulous/6629941

[2013-09-19 21:17:25 -0400] jtimberman: stormerider: indeed
[2013-09-19 21:18:02 -0400] ssd7_: matticulous: Thanks.  What version of chef-client are you using?
[2013-09-19 21:18:36 -0400] matticulous: ssd7_: 11.6.0
[2013-09-19 21:18:49 -0400] ssd7_: kk, taking a look at your stacktrace now
[2013-09-19 21:29:42 -0400] ssd7_: matticulous: Hrm, haven't seen this one before.  Gonna look at it a bit longer and will let oyu know if I come up with anything
[2013-09-19 21:30:56 -0400] matticulous: ssd7_: thank you for the help. i have to disconnect and drive home (EST), but will be back on in a while.
[2013-09-19 21:31:57 -0400] dgarstang: Anyone tried sticking haproxy/nginx in front of chef to get an cookbook upload to go to multiple chef servers?
[2013-09-19 21:32:42 -0400] coderanger: dgarstang: Not sure how that would work
[2013-09-19 21:33:55 -0400] dgarstang: coderanger: me neither
[2013-09-19 21:34:04 -0400] coderanger: So "no" then
[2013-09-19 21:34:21 -0400] dgarstang: coderanger: ok, no from you.
[2013-09-19 21:34:45 -0400] coderanger: You can load balance but any given file upload goes to one server because those how a RRLB works
[2013-09-19 21:36:53 -0400] gchristensen: this line in the nagios cookbook makes ponies and babies and cute raccoons cry: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nagios/blob/master/templates/default/services.cfg.erb#L17
[2013-09-19 21:40:04 -0400] tscanausa: dgarstang: something like https://github.com/wangbin579/tcpcopy is what you may want to look into
[2013-09-19 21:40:26 -0400] tscanausa: there are also things you can do with arp and iptables
[2013-09-19 21:41:48 -0400] coderanger: Or just use a normal LB and some kind of distributed file system (drbd, gluster, ceph, etc)
[2013-09-19 21:42:06 -0400] coderanger: Pretty standard fare for scaling a webapp :)
[2013-09-19 21:43:14 -0400] gchristensen: I would say *most* webapps these days don't need to scale the FS these days
[2013-09-19 21:43:44 -0400] coderanger: Sure, but for those that do, its pretty standard stuffs
[2013-09-19 21:43:59 -0400] coderanger: I still want to see support for S3 in FOSS chef-server though
[2013-09-19 21:44:13 -0400] gchristensen: +1
[2013-09-19 21:47:24 -0400] cheeseplus: that would be nice, if it supported S3 then I could hook it up to RiakCS ;)
[2013-09-19 21:50:08 -0400] tjr9898: masteinhauser
[2013-09-19 21:51:23 -0400] thekev: coderanger, I think what dgarstang is after is distributed chef servers, think one per continent.  drbd/gluster/ceph would be a bad idea (latency)
[2013-09-19 21:51:49 -0400] thekev: but if we can otherwise cause underlying filesystem to become in sync, that could work
[2013-09-19 21:51:52 -0400] dgarstang: chef-client isn't supposed to touch /usr/bin/ruby.... right?
[2013-09-19 21:51:59 -0400] coderanger: cheeseplus: That was the unwritten next step alongside supporting Swift too
[2013-09-19 21:52:08 -0400] dgarstang: thekev: you read my mind. it'a almost like we work... a few feet apart. :-O
[2013-09-19 21:52:17 -0400] thekev: creepy huh
[2013-09-19 21:52:23 -0400] dgarstang: spooky
[2013-09-19 21:52:54 -0400] coderanger: thekev: RiakCS + inter-DC replication :)
[2013-09-19 21:53:00 -0400] thekev: oh fear
[2013-09-19 21:53:20 -0400] thekev: and then a fuse driver to speak riakcs http
[2013-09-19 21:53:32 -0400] thekev: [link to rube goldberg device]
[2013-09-19 21:53:58 -0400] coderanger: Well or adding S3 support into FOSS chef directly, Hosted already uses S3 for file storage and bookshelf is just a local S3 clone
[2013-09-19 21:54:05 -0400] thekev: rephrase question: advice for distributing cookbooks to a half dozen disparate chef-servers?
[2013-09-19 21:54:47 -0400] coderanger: thekev: but going back the use case, my vote would be to have Jenkins or similar manage your cookbook uploads
[2013-09-19 21:54:52 -0400] coderanger: and just have it upload to each independently
[2013-09-19 21:55:08 -0400] thekev: k
[2013-09-19 21:55:31 -0400] coderanger: Also for bonus points you can run your foodcritic and test-kitchen passes before uploaded :)
[2013-09-19 22:04:34 -0400] gchristensen: storme_out: do you have intentions of getting back to COOK-3262?
[2013-09-19 22:07:57 -0400] Majost: how does one reference node attributes in a ruby_block?
[2013-09-19 22:10:54 -0400] Majost: can I set a variable before the block section within the ruby_block to the value of an attribute?
[2013-09-19 22:13:11 -0400] coderanger: Majost: Not sure what you are trying to do, can you pastebin?
[2013-09-19 22:14:47 -0400] djXternal: is there a way to set the chef_environment in a test-kitchen run?
[2013-09-19 22:20:12 -0400] Akiva-Thinkpad: o_O
[2013-09-19 22:20:29 -0400] Akiva-Thinkpad: anyone know where I can find the cooking irc channel
[2013-09-19 22:20:39 -0400] Akiva-Thinkpad: ?
[2013-09-19 22:20:42 -0400] doomviking: heh
[2013-09-19 22:21:10 -0400] doomviking: reminds me of chefconf, in the elevator. "I think its some kind of culinary convention"
[2013-09-19 22:23:41 -0400] gchristensen: too bad there wasn't some sort of delicious pastebin for cooks
[2013-09-19 22:28:55 -0400] thekev: akiva-thinkpad: try #puppet
[2013-09-19 22:33:17 -0400] matticulous: ssd7_: sorry for the abrupt departure. any suggestions on some tests I can try? of note, i upgraded the server from 11.0.0 to 11.0.8 yesterday afternoon.
[2013-09-19 22:33:36 -0400] Rapzid: Hi Guys!  Is anyone aware of information on how to encrypt data bag items without using knife?
[2013-09-19 22:34:35 -0400] coderanger: Rapzid: What is your end goal
[2013-09-19 22:34:46 -0400] coderanger: There is a nearly 99% chance what you want instead is chef-vault
[2013-09-19 22:35:26 -0400] Rapzid: I want to encrypt data bag items in .net and upload them to the chef server through the API.
[2013-09-19 22:36:00 -0400] coderanger: Hmm, don't know any other impl for that, sorry, best bet is to shell out to knife
[2013-09-19 22:36:22 -0400] tabolario: The way I'm doing it now Rapzid: https://gist.github.com/tabolario/6512068
[2013-09-19 22:36:34 -0400] tabolario: My reason is so I can commit them to the repo though
[2013-09-19 22:40:32 -0400] Rapzid: tabolario: Thanks... I may have a look at the chef methods and see if I can implement them in .net
[2013-09-19 22:41:27 -0400] Rapzid: Or shell out.
[2013-09-19 22:41:38 -0400] Rapzid: :)
[2013-09-19 22:44:33 -0400] coderanger: Its a pretty straightforward use of openssl, I would imaging there is a C# binding for it
[2013-09-19 22:44:44 -0400] coderanger: just make sure you get all the IV handling correct and the cipher modes, etc
[2013-09-19 22:48:01 -0400] ssd7_: matticulous: How did you install 11.0.8?  That error is basically claiming that a function we are trying to call doesn't exist, but as I am staring right at the function, it must exist.  Wondering if you had some issue upgrading.
[2013-09-19 22:48:11 -0400] joemiller: minitest or chefspec?
[2013-09-19 22:59:27 -0400] Rapzid: I see
[2013-09-19 22:59:55 -0400] Rapzid: so it encrypts all the values except for the id
[2013-09-19 23:00:11 -0400] coderanger: Rapzid: Indeed
[2013-09-19 23:00:26 -0400] Rapzid: That's pretty straight forward.
[2013-09-19 23:00:40 -0400] Rapzid: Now just to convince my .net counterpart
[2013-09-19 23:00:42 -0400] Rapzid: :)
[2013-09-19 23:20:23 -0400] Rapzid: Hrm.
[2013-09-19 23:21:14 -0400] Rapzid: I wish plaintext_data wasn't used to refer to the data before it's encoded as plain text
[2013-09-19 23:23:22 -0400] yfeldblum: Rapzid, plaintext isn't "plain text"
[2013-09-19 23:28:01 -0400] Rapzid: yfeldblum, I'm educated now :)
[2013-09-19 23:29:15 -0400] yfeldblum: Rapzid, awesome
[2013-09-19 23:29:55 -0400] Rapzid: thanks for the tip, it makes a lot more sense now
[2013-09-19 23:35:31 -0400] Majost: Does include not work within a ruby_block?
