[2013-11-04 02:04:13 -0500] zz__: this is a pretty RTFM question, but generally what network protocol is used (usually) when talking to nodes with chef?
[2013-11-04 02:08:32 -0500] alunduil_: Anyone know where bugs on knife-rackspace should be reported or discussed?
[2013-11-04 02:19:05 -0500] ziftytodd: Just installed Chef on my workstation. Trying to use knife rackspace server list/create/etc, but all variations result in ERROR: TypeError: wrong argument type Symbol (expected Module). Any ideas on what might be wrong?
[2013-11-04 02:29:33 -0500] alunduil_: ziftytodd, I'm submitting a patch for that in a couple minutes.
[2013-11-04 02:29:49 -0500] alunduil_: Looks like the call to include in rackspace_base needs to be replaced with has_key instead but I'm not sure why.
[2013-11-04 02:30:02 -0500] alunduil_: I'll submit and see what they say about pulling it in.
[2013-11-04 02:35:19 -0500] alunduil_: ziftytodd, pull request away.  Give that a shot on your box and let me know if it works.  https://github.com/opscode/knife-rackspace/pull/61
[2013-11-04 02:36:39 -0500] ziftytodd: alunduil_ great! I'll take a look at the pull request now!
[2013-11-04 02:37:26 -0500] alunduil_: ziftytodd, Thanks!  Now to go look into fog.io not accepting non-numerical flavor IDs.
[2013-11-04 02:41:25 -0500] chip-: zz__: Nodes communicate with the chef-server via HTTPS.
[2013-11-04 02:45:05 -0500] zz__: thanks chip :P probably just need to comb through the docs to learn a little bit more. mostly interested in the difference between chef's communication to nodes compared to salt/puppet
[2013-11-04 02:49:11 -0500] ziftytodd: alunduil_, I'm still getting the same error after applying your patch, rebuilding and reinstalling.
[2013-11-04 02:49:31 -0500] alunduil_: Same error?  What's -VV say when you run it?
[2013-11-04 02:49:59 -0500] mveitas: how do I reference the current cookbook?
[2013-11-04 02:50:16 -0500] mveitas: that is how do I reference the current cookbook in a recipe
[2013-11-04 02:51:11 -0500] alunduil_: ziftytodd, I'm heading to bed.  Feel free to post anything you find on that pull request and I'll look into it tomorrow afternoon.
[2013-11-04 02:51:25 -0500] ziftytodd: Will do! Thanks for the help. Have a good night
[2013-11-04 04:23:39 -0500] gowen: Hi, I have a question about a not_if in a recipe looking for an attribute.  I see that it is set, but maybe my syntax is wrong not_if {node[:attribute_name]}
[2013-11-04 04:23:54 -0500] gowen: I have this set to "true" in my attributes file
[2013-11-04 04:49:03 -0500] jhgaylor: when setting attributes for a community cookbook (sudo in particular) the website says node[key] = value and the attributes file in the cookbook say default[key] = value.  what's the difference? which do i use in my files? (I'm pretty new to this)
[2013-11-04 04:57:16 -0500] flaccid_: jhgaylor: what you trying to do exactly?
[2013-11-04 04:57:44 -0500] jhgaylor: flaccid_:add a user to my sudoers file using the sudo community cookbook
[2013-11-04 04:58:53 -0500] flaccid_: jhgaylor: are you using chef solo or chef server?
[2013-11-04 04:59:54 -0500] jhgaylor: flaccid_: atm im using chef server.  i'm using chef enterprise.  i downloaded the starter kit etc.  in the future i may move to chef solo. i didn't know about it when i started
[2013-11-04 05:00:40 -0500] flaccid_: jhgaylor: so you want to set https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/sudo#usage with roles or attributes
[2013-11-04 05:01:22 -0500] flaccid_: there should be doc on using chef server for setting those
[2013-11-04 05:01:40 -0500] jhgaylor: can i jsut add something like node['authorization']['sudo']['users'] = ['foo'] to my attributes file?
[2013-11-04 05:09:29 -0500] flaccid_: jhgaylor: i guess so

[2013-11-04 09:15:01 -0500] domad: does anyone know how I can start supervisord as a user other than root using the opscode cookbook? I can't see anything in the docs or even looking through the code.
[2013-11-04 09:31:59 -0500] s2r2: domad: just had a quick glance, but what does that do? >> https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/supervisor/blob/master/templates/default/program.conf.erb#L17-L19
[2013-11-04 09:32:46 -0500] s2r2: hmm I suppose its for supervised programs right?  so, you're looking for a way to have the supervisord process run as an unprivileged user...
[2013-11-04 09:34:49 -0500] s2r2: domad: but why?  thinking about it, if the supervisord's user is non-root, it cannot start supervised processes as any user but itself...
[2013-11-04 09:37:45 -0500] domad: s2r2: i would be able to start processes as a user in the same group wouldn't i?
[2013-11-04 09:39:11 -0500] s2r2: domad: hm no idea, sorry.
[2013-11-04 09:46:48 -0500] domad: s2r2: thanks anyway

[2013-11-04 10:14:12 -0500] slicknick: maybe this http://community.opscode.com/chat/chef/2012-01-26#id-40359
[2013-11-04 10:14:46 -0500] GreatSUN: hi all
[2013-11-04 10:15:17 -0500] GreatSUN: I have a problem documented a little bit in https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2694
[2013-11-04 10:15:21 -0500] slicknick: tboerger: if node['kernel']['modules'].has_key('ip6_tables') is an example from http://community.opscode.com/chat/chef/2012-01-26#id-40380
[2013-11-04 10:16:06 -0500] GreatSUN: but as far as I can see, whenever this RegexpError: Stack overflow in regexp matcher occurs, I am neither able to handle it, nor the variables that have been existing before are still there
[2013-11-04 10:16:40 -0500] GreatSUN: so anytime this error occurs, there is an error it results in, that would not exist, if the error didn't occur
[2013-11-04 10:16:51 -0500] GreatSUN: do you have any idea on what I could do?
[2013-11-04 10:17:05 -0500] GreatSUN: I already tried to catch the error, but this is not possible :-(

[2013-11-04 10:23:52 -0500] Stefan____: Hi All, Is there a way I can prevent a cookbook editor from deploying to the production environment but still be able to upload the cookbook to the chef server?
[2013-11-04 10:26:17 -0500] arussel: what if you don't give him permission to modify the env in which you have set the cookbook version ?
[2013-11-04 10:26:26 -0500] arussel: this might be possible with hosted chef
[2013-11-04 10:27:52 -0500] kraM: Hi, I've a search verification on at least one AND at most one node objects returning. -- I need to break that and want to say: If there are more than 1 nodes from search everything is okay IF node['fqdn'] is part of the search results. What's the best/simplest way to verify that current node is part of the Array of node objects?
[2013-11-04 10:34:35 -0500] Stefan____: arussel: Where do I set user permissions? All I have is admin or not. What can an non-admin do?
[2013-11-04 10:35:24 -0500] arussel: Stefan____ are you on hosted chef or open source ?
[2013-11-04 10:35:42 -0500] Stefan____: arussel: open source
[2013-11-04 10:36:12 -0500] arussel: so you can't do much, hosted chef has much more fine grain permissions
[2013-11-04 10:36:32 -0500] arussel: where you can set permission on envs, clients, nodes ...
[2013-11-04 10:36:33 -0500] Stefan____: arussel: ok, thanks
[2013-11-04 10:41:57 -0500] arussel: where can I find the source code for the service lwrp ?
[2013-11-04 10:44:23 -0500] slicknick: auto first search most def must check git
[2013-11-04 10:50:48 -0500] tboerger: slicknick: thx... i think i've got to enhance my kernel cookbook :D
[2013-11-04 10:51:20 -0500] tboerger: slicknick: https://github.com/tboerger/chef-kernel/blob/master/providers/modules.rb
[2013-11-04 10:52:13 -0500] tboerger: i think i can integrate the ohai information into the not_if and only_if blocks.
[2013-11-04 11:14:24 -0500] arussel: I'm having  a hard time debugging a lwrp I've written: https://github.com/arussel/chef-java-wrapper/
[2013-11-04 11:15:03 -0500] arussel: If I use it like this: https://github.com/arussel/chef-java-wrapper/blob/master/test/fixtures/cookbooks/test_java_wrapper/recipes/default.rb
[2013-11-04 11:16:11 -0500] arussel: this work as expected, but if I switch  the play and jetty resource, the jetty service get started, but he play service doesn't;
[2013-11-04 11:16:21 -0500] arussel: any idea ?
[2013-11-04 11:16:36 -0500] mrhjkim: s2r2 : Thanks for information, I am following that tutorial but I got that errors in some recipes, and I deleted those recipes. I don't know the reason why failed.
[2013-11-04 11:47:17 -0500] gavala: Chefs. Is there a way to make a chef run restart mid-way?
[2013-11-04 11:48:39 -0500] arussel: why would you want this ?
[2013-11-04 11:50:10 -0500] gavala: because i'm changing the gem sources for the embedded ruby to a local gem repository, and chef-client will not pick this up until the next chef-client run for some reason
[2013-11-04 11:57:12 -0500] arussel: gavala are you using chef to set up the local repo ? wouldn't it be easier to bootstrat the node with that repo ?
[2013-11-04 11:57:51 -0500] gavala: yeah chef is changing the repos in a recipe that runs right at the start of the chef run
[2013-11-04 12:02:04 -0500] arussel: you could do a chef run for install and then another 'normal chef run', but personnaly, I would use a customized bootstrap script
[2013-11-04 12:10:29 -0500] gavala: hmm
[2013-11-04 12:10:54 -0500] gavala: the bootstrap drops an init script for an initial chef run anyway
[2013-11-04 12:11:16 -0500] gavala: so i guess i could modify that to also run the specific gem sources recipe by itself first
[2013-11-04 12:17:14 -0500] arussel: can't the first-boot.json be used for this ?
[2013-11-04 12:17:29 -0500] arussel: (not that this is an over documented feature)
[2013-11-04 12:20:17 -0500] gavala: possibly, this is my first time trying to fix something like this. Will read up, ta.
[2013-11-04 13:45:07 -0500] ocholetras: hi guys!
[2013-11-04 13:45:14 -0500] ocholetras: Dashes or underscores
[2013-11-04 13:45:23 -0500] ocholetras: to  use on cookbook names?
[2013-11-04 13:45:32 -0500] arussel: when I 'service 'foo' do; action [:enable, :start];end  , chef tells me '(up to date)', what could cause this ?
[2013-11-04 13:45:41 -0500] arussel: (the service isn't running)
[2013-11-04 13:46:03 -0500] ocholetras: we are using underscores, because i think it is more legible
[2013-11-04 13:46:07 -0500] ocholetras: and clean
[2013-11-04 13:46:17 -0500] ocholetras: is there any pattern about this?
[2013-11-04 13:46:38 -0500] arussel: you can't use dash as method name I believe
[2013-11-04 13:46:43 -0500] cpuguy83: ocholetras: Underscores
[2013-11-04 13:46:48 -0500] arussel: so underscore would be better
[2013-11-04 13:47:10 -0500] ocholetras: ok
[2013-11-04 13:47:40 -0500] ocholetras: we are walkin the right way  then ^^
[2013-11-04 13:48:02 -0500] arussel: how does the service resource check if the resource is up to date ?
[2013-11-04 13:48:09 -0500] ocholetras: arussel: actually there are some opscode cookbooks that uses dashes
[2013-11-04 13:48:41 -0500] ocholetras: so you can use either dash or underscore
[2013-11-04 13:49:27 -0500] arussel: you can, but then can't use method missing on the cookbook name
[2013-11-04 13:50:11 -0500] arussel: default.apache.dir          = "/etc/apache2"  => ok
[2013-11-04 13:50:30 -0500] arussel: default.apache-ocholetras.dir          = "/etc/apache2"  => not sure it works
[2013-11-04 13:50:54 -0500] arussel: default.apache_ocholetras.dir          = "/etc/apache2"  => ok
[2013-11-04 13:52:14 -0500] ocholetras: ok but default['apache-ocholetras']['dir'] = "whatever" is the right way, right?
[2013-11-04 13:54:19 -0500] arussel: not sure this it right, more a matter of taste I believe. the a.b.c is faster
[2013-11-04 13:54:29 -0500] ocholetras: yes
[2013-11-04 13:54:42 -0500] ocholetras: agree with that ^^
[2013-11-04 13:54:50 -0500] arussel: the example I've pasted are from the opscode site
[2013-11-04 13:55:10 -0500] ocholetras: from the docs=?

[2013-11-04 16:33:30 -0500] fak3r: anyone done centrify with chef? Not finding much online
[2013-11-04 16:34:21 -0500] fveillette: can someone help with  Registry_key ressource of opscode
[2013-11-04 16:37:28 -0500] gchristensen: is there a way to stub a recipe in chefspec?
[2013-11-04 16:38:05 -0500] fveillette: can someone help with  Registry_key ressource of opscode
[2013-11-04 16:38:48 -0500] tomduffield: fveillette - dont ask if someone can help, just ask your question :) what is your problem?
[2013-11-04 16:39:07 -0500] fveillette: when i specifies multiple value for a key
[2013-11-04 16:39:34 -0500] tomduffield: gchristensen: have you checked out http://sethvargo.com/chefspec/?
[2013-11-04 16:39:40 -0500] fveillette: those value are not validated because the check is only on the key
[2013-11-04 16:39:45 -0500] fveillette: not on the value
[2013-11-04 16:40:50 -0500] fveillette: if i take one of my server... the key exist but the value under the key are not ok... but my chef run don't change it since the check it's just on hte key if it's exist...
[2013-11-04 16:45:07 -0500] tomduffield: okay, still not quite sure what your question is fveillette? :)
[2013-11-04 16:45:30 -0500] tomduffield: are you wondering how to update the value?
[2013-11-04 16:48:56 -0500] tomduffield: fveillette: looking at the actual provider code it looks like the :create action is designed to update your key values each run if they need updating: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/provider/registry_key.rb#L96
[2013-11-04 16:49:40 -0500] supercom32: In chef, when I try to specify a source for my windows_package, is there a way to use network paths? Such as "\\hostName\Share\Executable.exe"?
[2013-11-04 16:51:31 -0500] tomduffield: supercom32: have you tried it and had it fail for you?
[2013-11-04 16:52:04 -0500] supercom32: tomduffield: Yep, it failed all right. I tried changing the slash directions too, but I might not be escaping them right.
[2013-11-04 16:53:51 -0500] tomduffield: supercom32: I dont see any reason why windows_package wouldn't support network paths
[2013-11-04 16:54:24 -0500] supercom32: Do "\" characters need to be escaped?
[2013-11-04 16:54:51 -0500] supercom32: For example, is this valid? "\\\\localhost\\myshare\\executable.exe"?
[2013-11-04 16:56:10 -0500] gchristensen: tomduffield: I have. I want to stub an entire third party cookbook. I don't want to have to stub every not_if command and data bag search that the third party cookbook happens to executue
[2013-11-04 16:59:43 -0500] tomduffield: gchristensen: are you using include_recipe here?
[2013-11-04 17:00:12 -0500] tomduffield: supercom32: I'm not sure. I would maybe try using chef-shell or --why-run to debug
[2013-11-04 17:00:34 -0500] gchristensen: tomduffield: yes
[2013-11-04 17:01:34 -0500] fveillette: Supercom32: yes \ need to be escaped the way you did
[2013-11-04 17:02:24 -0500] supercom32: Ah sweet. thanks for the advice. I'll follow up on those leads.
[2013-11-04 17:05:28 -0500] tomduffield: gchristensen: try this: `Chef::Recipe.any_instance.stub(:include_recipe).with("cookbook:recipe")
[2013-11-04 17:06:58 -0500] gchristensen: tomduffield: where cookbook::recipe is the recipe I want to skip the inclusion?
[2013-11-04 17:07:10 -0500] tomduffield: gchristensen: yeah
[2013-11-04 17:19:20 -0500] gchristensen: tomduffield: ah I see what you're doing. I appreciate the tip.
[2013-11-04 17:25:48 -0500] heathsnow_: Does Chef Minitest stay in your run_list in PROD or just during testing?
[2013-11-04 17:26:09 -0500] heathsnow_: I can see value in PROD because it's testing the desired end-state of my cookbooks
[2013-11-04 17:28:20 -0500] tomduffield: heathsnow_ its up to you really. if you want to test end-state though I would recommend checking out serverspec
[2013-11-04 17:29:07 -0500] heathsnow_: tomduffield thx I'll take a look now
[2013-11-04 17:45:50 -0500] zaargy: probably with minitest on prod is that a lot of teh gems etc require a c toolchain which can be infeasible for some envs
[2013-11-04 17:45:55 -0500] zaargy: s/probably/problem/
[2013-11-04 17:46:42 -0500] zaargy: which is why i favour testing from the 'outside'
[2013-11-04 17:49:04 -0500] jmartin: anyone from opscode around? got a few questions about on premise ent. chef
[2013-11-04 17:51:18 -0500] heathsnow_: zaargy yeah I think I'll just have to get a real monitoring solution going
[2013-11-04 17:51:39 -0500] zaargy: heathsnow_: or use you can use something like serverspec
[2013-11-04 17:52:20 -0500] heathsnow_: zaargy have mostly Windows boxes so then I'd need to install an SSH client on everything...not sure IT would dig it
[2013-11-04 17:52:28 -0500] zaargy: winrm or winexe
[2013-11-04 17:52:51 -0500] zaargy: we have a serverspec thing that works over winexe
[2013-11-04 17:52:56 -0500] heathsnow_: oh
[2013-11-04 17:53:41 -0500] heathsnow_: I'll give it shot
[2013-11-04 17:53:55 -0500] zaargy:   Scenario: Check OS Version
[2013-11-04 17:53:56 -0500] zaargy:     When I run the command "wmic os get name"
[2013-11-04 17:53:56 -0500] zaargy:     Then check it returns "Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard
[2013-11-04 17:53:57 -0500] zaargy: etc :)
[2013-11-04 17:54:11 -0500] heathsnow_: sweet
[2013-11-04 18:07:02 -0500] adam-_-: if I'm using hosted chef, can I print out the attributes of a node? I want to double check that the attributes listed in the hosted chef interface are the same as on the server itself
[2013-11-04 18:10:59 -0500] tomduffield: adam-_- we are experiencing some indexing slowness on Hosted Enterprise Chef. If there are some discrepancies that may be why.
[2013-11-04 18:11:28 -0500] tomduffield: but you can always do `knife node show <nodename> -l` to print out all the attributes
[2013-11-04 18:11:52 -0500] adam-_-: ah ha, thanks. I'm not 100% if that would be the issue, it could be a problem in one of our recipes
[2013-11-04 18:13:10 -0500] jmartin: tomduffield: mind if i pm? had a question about on premise ent chef
[2013-11-04 18:13:18 -0500] tomduffield: jmartin: sure
[2013-11-04 18:25:13 -0500] arussel: when I 'service 'foo' do; action [:enable, :start];end  , chef tells me '(up to date)', what could cause this ?
[2013-11-04 18:32:18 -0500] dgarstang: If I was to clone a server running chef, is changing it's identity simply a matter of changing the hostname and restarting?
[2013-11-04 18:35:17 -0500] tomduffield: arussel: that typically means the service is already enabled and started
[2013-11-04 18:35:41 -0500] arussel: @tomduffield but it isn't, I can't find out what I'm doing wrong
[2013-11-04 18:35:53 -0500] tomduffield: dgarstang: no - you'll need to make sure that when the new server is launched it generates a new client key
[2013-11-04 18:35:56 -0500] chip-: dgarstang: Each client gets its own client key and identity.
[2013-11-04 18:36:19 -0500] chip-: dgarstang: You would delete /etc/chef/client.pem, make sure there's not a node name field in /etc/chef/client.rb, and ensure that /etc/chef/validator.pem is correct and in place
[2013-11-04 18:36:24 -0500] chip-: dgarstang: At that point you'd be good to clone
[2013-11-04 18:37:38 -0500] tomduffield: arussel: wrong service name could be an issue. the service resource may not know the commands to enable and start the service, especially if its not a packaged service from a pkg mnger
[2013-11-04 18:38:30 -0500] arussel: @tomduffield I've sent a mail on the ml about it: https://github.com/arussel/chef-java-wrapper/blob/master/test/fixtures/cookbooks/test_java_wrapper/recipes/default.rb
[2013-11-04 18:38:40 -0500] arussel: I've wrote a lwrp, this is the test for it
[2013-11-04 18:39:00 -0500] arussel: this, as it is will start 2 services, play and jetty.
[2013-11-04 18:39:38 -0500] arussel: change the order, jetty/play, this will start the jetty service, but the play service won't start because 'up to date'
[2013-11-04 18:43:20 -0500] dgarstang: tomduffield: got a process for that?
[2013-11-04 18:44:55 -0500] tomduffield: arussel: not quite sure. you may need to add 'use_inline_resources'
[2013-11-04 18:45:34 -0500] tomduffield: dgarstang: in the context of cloning servers? is there a reason you are cloning servers as opposed to bootstrapping them with the same run_list?
[2013-11-04 18:53:25 -0500] troyready: dgarstang, see chip- 's responses re: the cloning process ^
[2013-11-04 18:54:45 -0500] dgarstang: tomduffield: Well, it's a chef server....
[2013-11-04 18:57:24 -0500] troyready: dgarstang, that terminology may be a bit confusing. When you say 'it's a chef server', do you mean that it's a virtual machine running the chef-client? Or do you mean that it's a virtual machine with the chef-server package(s) installed?
[2013-11-04 18:57:33 -0500] phutchin1: hi
[2013-11-04 18:57:48 -0500] dgarstang: troyready: it's a virtual machine with the chef-server package(s) installed.
[2013-11-04 18:58:01 -0500] troyready: ok, just wanted to make sure :)
[2013-11-04 18:58:10 -0500] dgarstang: installed: chicken and egg...
[2013-11-04 18:58:21 -0500] dgarstang: oops
[2013-11-04 18:58:31 -0500] dgarstang: s/installed/troyready/
[2013-11-04 18:58:49 -0500] fveillette: Supercom32: yes \ need to be escaped the way you did
[2013-11-04 19:00:03 -0500] troyready: dgarstang, my apologies -- not sure what all the implications of cloning the chef-server would be. It's a little weird in practice, I'd imagine, 'cause it's going to have all kinds of indexed data for other nodes that may or may not be talking to it still. But nothing that you couldn't technically manage
[2013-11-04 19:00:26 -0500] dgarstang: troyready: i'll just spin a new one. it takes a little hand massaging.
[2013-11-04 19:00:48 -0500] fveillette: can someone help with  Registry_key ressource of opscode
[2013-11-04 19:03:54 -0500] chip-: dgarstang: Yeah, I would not be cloning a chef-server. It's too easy to make one.
[2013-11-04 19:04:20 -0500] chip-: dgarstang: There's a knife plugin AND a cookbook to just turn machines into chef-servers. You could inject it on EC2 via user data.
[2013-11-04 19:04:33 -0500] chip-: Lots of ways to handle it dynamically in about 5 minutes.
[2013-11-04 19:04:47 -0500] chip-: as opposed to cloning images and running into key duplication and other issues.
[2013-11-04 19:06:28 -0500] dgarstang: chip-: This is GCE, but thanks
[2013-11-04 19:06:38 -0500] phutchin1: I'm getting Unable to create Chef::RunList::RunListItem from NilClass:nil: must be a Hash or String (ArgumentError) when trying to do...
[2013-11-04 19:06:41 -0500] phutchin1: n.run_list( updated_data["run_list"])
[2013-11-04 19:07:01 -0500] phutchin1: looks like updated_data["run_list"] is an array of strings, does it have to be a hash or a string? or will an array work?
[2013-11-04 19:07:30 -0500] supercom32: So I went to this address "https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/windows" and copied the example recipe for firefox, and when I run it says "Cannot find a resource for windows_package on windows versions xxxx".  The URL actually exists, so any ideas what's wrong?
[2013-11-04 19:07:36 -0500] chip-: dgarstang: Could still use the "knife server" plugin. http://fnichol.github.io/knife-server/
[2013-11-04 19:08:12 -0500] phutchin1: Maybe i should mention this is in a block like... @updated_node = Node.new.tap do |n|
[2013-11-04 19:08:20 -0500] chip-: knife server bootstrap standalone
[2013-11-04 19:08:23 -0500] dgarstang: chip-: no gce support
[2013-11-04 19:09:08 -0500] dgarstang: chip-: and it just worked terribly on ec2. the ssh proxy stuff just didn't work. Gave up on it after a few weeks
[2013-11-04 19:09:37 -0500] chip-: dgarstang: or knife google -r 'recipe[chef-server]'
[2013-11-04 19:11:26 -0500] dgarstang: chip-: last i checked, knife google was an API version behind and didn't work
[2013-11-04 19:11:35 -0500] chip-: Ah, fun.
[2013-11-04 19:14:25 -0500] tomduffield: phutchin1: do you have a full code gist?
[2013-11-04 19:14:57 -0500] phutchin1: tomduffield: yeah, let me post it... it would be much easier... I'm missing something because i kinda took pieces of code from a few places but I'm not seeing it. One sec.
[2013-11-04 19:16:59 -0500] phutchin1: tomduffield: http://pastebin.com/Z3Qe8r6E
[2013-11-04 19:17:37 -0500] phutchin1: getting this: /opt/junkdrawer/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/chef-10.26.0/lib/chef/run_list/run_list_item.rb:67:in `initialize': Unable to create Chef::RunList::RunListItem from NilClass:nil: must be a Hash or String (ArgumentError)
[2013-11-04 19:17:53 -0500] phutchin1: and related last line in my plugin is here: from /Users/phutchins/.chef/plugins/knife/mass_vi.rb:70:in `block in apply_updates'
[2013-11-04 19:18:41 -0500] tomduffield: phutchin1: what does your inspect statement say?
[2013-11-04 19:19:32 -0500] phutchin1: ["role[role_name_here]", "recipe[mywrapper::recipe_name@0.1.127]"]
[2013-11-04 19:19:35 -0500] phutchin1: replaced with generic names...
[2013-11-04 19:19:43 -0500] phutchin1: so its an array of strings
[2013-11-04 19:19:55 -0500] phutchin1: which i understand that the error says it has to be a hash or string
[2013-11-04 19:19:59 -0500] phutchin1: so maybe i'm formatting it incorrectly?
[2013-11-04 19:20:10 -0500] phutchin1: But I've seen other code doing it this way so i tink i'm missing something else
[2013-11-04 19:22:47 -0500] phutchin1: tomduffield: but actually I think its talking about the n being a hash so that should be ok...
[2013-11-04 19:27:47 -0500] tomduffield: phutchin: you are basically tapping into the .new method with your .tap. With what you are doing you need to imagine you are inside the initalize method of Chef::Node. So instead of using methods for run_list, environment, etc imagine you are actually inside the Chef::Node object
[2013-11-04 19:28:56 -0500] phutchin1: Let me go find the source for initialize of Chef::Node
[2013-11-04 19:31:54 -0500] phutchin1: Ok, got it. So I see the initialize block but still don't quite understand what i'm doing wrong
[2013-11-04 19:32:20 -0500] phutchin1: I thought it may have been that I wasn't populating all of the needed attributes for the node to be created. All i'm trying to change is the run_list
[2013-11-04 19:32:49 -0500] tomduffield: right
[2013-11-04 19:33:00 -0500] tomduffield: but its the way you are accessing the object
[2013-11-04 19:33:06 -0500] tomduffield: that is causing you problems
[2013-11-04 19:33:37 -0500] phutchin1: as in n. ?
[2013-11-04 19:34:02 -0500] tomduffield: not really
[2013-11-04 19:34:10 -0500] tomduffield: so inside your .tap block
[2013-11-04 19:34:23 -0500] tomduffield: you are doing n.run_list(updated_data) right?
[2013-11-04 19:34:52 -0500] phutchin1: updated_data["run_list"] but yes.
[2013-11-04 19:35:24 -0500] tomduffield: well, because you are using .tap what you are actually doing is passing updated_data into the Chef::RunList.new function (https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/node.rb#L66)
[2013-11-04 19:35:37 -0500] tomduffield: and Chef::RunList.new only accepts Strings and Hashes
[2013-11-04 19:35:40 -0500] phutchin1: I see in the initialize block its doing = Chef::Runlist>new
[2013-11-04 19:35:40 -0500] fveillette: did someone ever had an issue of copying file over c:\Windows\System32 with cookbook_files ressource?
[2013-11-04 19:35:41 -0500] phutchin1: yeah
[2013-11-04 19:36:11 -0500] tomduffield: that is why you are failing
[2013-11-04 19:36:19 -0500] tomduffield: you are passing in type Array when its expecting String or Hash
[2013-11-04 19:36:28 -0500] phutchin1: ok thats kinda what i thought
[2013-11-04 19:36:34 -0500] phutchin1: I"m using this as an example... https://codeclimate.com/github/opscode/chef/Chef::Knife::NodeEditor
[2013-11-04 19:36:37 -0500] phutchin1: FYI...
[2013-11-04 19:36:56 -0500] supercom32: Hi everyone. Does anyone know what "Cannot find a resource for windows_package" means?
[2013-11-04 19:37:02 -0500] phutchin1: so I guess i coudl convert to a string which would be the easiest but not sure how to delimit
[2013-11-04 19:37:12 -0500] supercom32: Somekind of dependency I'm missing to do windows specific functions?
[2013-11-04 19:39:13 -0500] tomduffield: phutchin1: right, and in that case updated_data["run_list"] might be a String
[2013-11-04 19:39:49 -0500] phutchin1: tomduffield: ok. let me give that a shot...
[2013-11-04 19:40:10 -0500] supercom32: Is coderanger in?
[2013-11-04 19:40:18 -0500] coderanger: supercom32: Indeed
[2013-11-04 19:41:01 -0500] supercom32: coderanger: Hey. Thanks for helping me the other day. I was hoping you could solve the roadblock I am having. I can't get "windows_package" to work.
[2013-11-04 19:41:09 -0500] fveillette: did someone ever had an issue of copying file over c:\Windows\System32 with cookbook_files ressource?
[2013-11-04 19:41:49 -0500] supercom32: coderanger: I keep getting "Cannot find a resource for windows_package" and I have no idea what it means.
[2013-11-04 19:42:24 -0500] coderanger: supercom32: It probably means you don't have the windows cookbook loaded
[2013-11-04 19:42:50 -0500] phutchin1: tomduffield: you happen to know what the hash should look like? I tried simply doing a .to_s and it barf'd but gave me a error I can understand :).
[2013-11-04 19:42:57 -0500] supercom32: coderanger: Is there a cookbook for windows specific functionality that I should be downloading? That would explain it.
[2013-11-04 19:43:11 -0500] phutchin1: tomduffield: seems it would be cleaner to just create a hash and feed it that
[2013-11-04 19:43:17 -0500] coderanger: supercom32: It is called "windows", and is generally pulled in automatically via dependencies
[2013-11-04 19:43:18 -0500] fveillette: cookbook_file work in other directory but not in c:\windows\system32 :(
[2013-11-04 19:43:25 -0500] supercom32: coderanger: but I thought it was just all bundled into chef.
[2013-11-04 19:43:32 -0500] coderanger: supercom32: No
[2013-11-04 19:44:04 -0500] tomduffield: phutchin1: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/run_list/run_list_item.rb -- hopefully that helps
[2013-11-04 19:44:09 -0500] supercom32: coderanger: ah that explains it then. Is there any other base cookbooks  you recommend I obtain as well?
[2013-11-04 19:44:19 -0500] fveillette: powershell
[2013-11-04 19:45:49 -0500] coderanger: supercom32: Depends entirely on what you are doing
[2013-11-04 19:46:18 -0500] supercom32: coderanger: Hrmm.. Ok, I added the cookbook to my system, but it still can't reference it. I assume my project must have a 'depends' somewhere as well pointing to that cookbook?
[2013-11-04 19:46:35 -0500] coderanger: supercom32: Indeed, if you are using berkshelf thats the only thing you need to do
[2013-11-04 19:46:39 -0500] coderanger: (hint: use berkshelf)
[2013-11-04 19:47:06 -0500] supercom32: coderanger: berkshelf? What is that? (I'm kind of green when it comes to chef).
[2013-11-04 19:47:36 -0500] coderanger: berkshelf.com, its a package manager for chef basically
[2013-11-04 19:47:57 -0500] phutchin1: tomduffield: ok so I already understand how a runlist item should look like. Where i'm not quite connecting it is that I'm trying to feed back in a run list where it is two or more items. if its a string, can it only be one runlist_item?
[2013-11-04 19:48:00 -0500] supercom32: coderanger: Ah, as opposed to gem?
[2013-11-04 19:48:13 -0500] supercom32: coderanger: oh, gem is for ruby stuff only.
[2013-11-04 19:49:03 -0500] dgarstang: This keeps happening.... I bring up a new chef server. I regenerate the validator client key. I use that client key on my workstattion etc. Works fine. I go back to the server, paste the new validator key back in and try and get the chef-client to to itself as the server and get a 'Failed to authenticate to the chef server (http 401)'.
[2013-11-04 19:50:10 -0500] supercom32: coderanger: Ah, no wonder. The metadata says depends 'windows', but I thought they were refering to your operating system, not an actual cookbook. :-)
[2013-11-04 19:51:25 -0500] mondo: is node['os_version'] the only place I can get the arch the node is running?
[2013-11-04 19:51:39 -0500] mondo: like x86_64 vs i386
[2013-11-04 19:54:50 -0500] fveillette: did someone ever had an issue of copying file over c:\Windows\System32 with cookbook_files ressource?
[2013-11-04 19:58:00 -0500] tomduffield: fveillette: it might be more helpful for us to know what issues you are having. someone without personal experience in the area may still be able to help you
[2013-11-04 19:59:14 -0500] mondo: Found it at node['kernel']['machine']

[2013-11-04 20:03:10 -0500] dgarstang: This keeps happening.... I bring up a new chef server. I regenerate the validator client key. I use that client key on my workstattion etc. Works fine. I go back to the server, paste the new validator key back in and try and get the chef-client to to itself as the server and get a 'Failed to authenticate to the chef server (http 401)'.

[2013-11-04 20:07:19 -0500] dgarstang: and, if I regenerate it SECOND time, the client is ok with it
[2013-11-04 20:09:51 -0500] arussel: @tomduffield a bit late, but I'm not sure what inline resource would do to https://github.com/arussel/chef-java-wrapper/blob/master/test/fixtures/cookbooks/test_java_wrapper/recipes/default.rb
[2013-11-04 20:10:25 -0500] arussel: @tomduffield the problem is that the service resource believe it is up to date, when it isn't
[2013-11-04 20:11:40 -0500] tomduffield: phutchin1: I think your issue might be that n.run_list is expecting a JSONCompat.from_json String object where you are giving it an Array object
[2013-11-04 20:12:08 -0500] Holos: I'm getting started with chef, and starting with the users cook book, I have a user's databag filled out, and have them in the users_manage "sysadmin" do group_id 2300 action [ :remove, :create ]
[2013-11-04 20:12:40 -0500] tomduffield: phutchin1: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/core/ui.rb#L179

[2013-11-04 20:14:30 -0500] tomduffield: arussel: does that status command for that service actually give back the correct status? Because that is what Chef is going to use
[2013-11-04 20:15:23 -0500] tomduffield: Holos: okay. do you have a question? :)
[2013-11-04 20:15:34 -0500] arussel: @tomduffield would that explain that play then jetty works, but jetty then play doesn't ?
[2013-11-04 20:16:05 -0500] tomduffield: maybe? but if one is working and the other isn't its probably an issue specific to play
[2013-11-04 20:16:19 -0500] tomduffield: because the code underneath both of them on the Chef side is going to be the same
[2013-11-04 20:16:36 -0500] tomduffield: so it may be something to do with the data you are passing in or something
[2013-11-04 20:18:16 -0500] arussel: I'll check if the status is returned correctly
[2013-11-04 20:21:59 -0500] tomduffield: dgarstang: make sure you fully understand the authentication model: http://docs.opscode.com/auth_authentication.html. its possible that you are missing a step (I can't tell from your description)
[2013-11-04 20:32:00 -0500] fak3r: trying to install splunk-forwarder, getting: "NoMethodError: Undefined method or attribute `cookbook_collection' on `node'" do I need to define something in the recipe to fix that?
[2013-11-04 20:42:10 -0500] dgarstang: What could cause a knife upload to do nothing, even when -VV is supplied?
[2013-11-04 20:43:49 -0500] alexbst_: maybe it is having a hard time running ruby/chef gems ?
[2013-11-04 20:45:22 -0500] dgarstang: alexbst_: knife cookbook list works fine.
[2013-11-04 20:46:45 -0500] heathsnow_: dgarstang I'm guessing it's an issue w/your knife.config
[2013-11-04 20:50:54 -0500] dgarstang: heathsnow_: This is with a coworker. He just copied my knife.rb (and it's working for me), changed details accordingly, and it still happens to him
[2013-11-04 20:51:49 -0500] jperry: ohai
[2013-11-04 20:52:02 -0500] jperry: how do you make use of a library in another cookbook?
[2013-11-04 20:52:11 -0500] tomduffi_: jmartin msg
[2013-11-04 20:52:17 -0500] jperry: say for example I'm creating a helper that will be used by several cookbooks
[2013-11-04 20:52:23 -0500] jperry: what is the best approach for this
[2013-11-04 20:53:06 -0500] heathsnow_: jperry just depend on it in your metadata no?
[2013-11-04 20:54:42 -0500] jperry: yeah I depended on the cookbook then tried accessing the helper method in a recipe and it couldn't find it
[2013-11-04 20:54:49 -0500] cwj: jperry: take a look at the opscode openssl cookbook, it provides a secure_password helper which other opscode cookbooks like mysql make use of
[2013-11-04 20:55:03 -0500] jperry: cwj: thanks, I'll check it out
[2013-11-04 20:55:18 -0500] jperry: does the mysql cookbook need to have a depends on it?
[2013-11-04 20:55:21 -0500] cwj: yes
[2013-11-04 20:55:24 -0500] jperry: ok
[2013-11-04 20:55:34 -0500] jperry: thx
[2013-11-04 20:55:49 -0500] cwj: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql/blob/master/metadata.rb#L27
[2013-11-04 20:56:22 -0500] heathsnow_: dgarstang I feel like that happened to me and it was my knife.config.  perhaps he hasn't been added as a chef admin?
[2013-11-04 20:56:52 -0500] jperry: cwj: then I see this is required?
[2013-11-04 20:56:53 -0500] jperry: ::Chef::Recipe.send(:include, Opscode::OpenSSL::Password)
[2013-11-04 20:57:17 -0500] jperry: that is probably to avoid having to type it out each time right?
[2013-11-04 20:58:37 -0500] cwj: yeah i think thats right
[2013-11-04 21:00:15 -0500] cwj: otherwise you would do "include Opscode::OpenSSL::Password in your recipe
[2013-11-04 21:01:33 -0500] btm_: @opscode looks like everyone's on the road today, no COOK code review.

[2013-11-04 22:10:23 -0500] Skeletor1: faker do you want to happen when a chef0run happens ?
[2013-11-04 22:10:43 -0500] Skeletor1: chef-client run occurs sorry, looking at two things

[2013-11-04 22:17:11 -0500] fak3r: doomviking: thanks, giving that a go
[2013-11-04 22:20:57 -0500] AcesWayUpHigh: does the chef-server maintain a copy of the the chef-repo, or is everything stored in the database?
[2013-11-04 22:24:44 -0500] opstrong: AcesWayUpHigh: Chef server is completely separate from a repo
[2013-11-04 22:24:58 -0500] opstrong: uploading to Chef server doesn't touch git
[2013-11-04 22:25:56 -0500] AcesWayUpHigh: ah. makes sense, just wanted to confirm. thanks opstrong

[2013-11-04 22:40:03 -0500] GeoffC_: Can anyone assist with some basic chef + nagios configuration?
[2013-11-04 22:40:31 -0500] gchristensen: GeoffC_: only if you ask
[2013-11-04 22:40:47 -0500] flaccid_: how long is a piece of string? :p
[2013-11-04 22:41:48 -0500] GeoffC_: I have setup a nagios server with the quick start guide, not much more added to it.  If the IP address of my nagios server is going to change, how do I update the localhost to point to the correct server IP?
[2013-11-04 22:41:57 -0500] GeoffC_: I tried just chef-client and that doesn't seem to impact it
[2013-11-04 22:43:12 -0500] GeoffC_: I mean I could just do it manually in the hosts.cfg file I know but I assume there is a config file that will update it from chef
[2013-11-04 22:54:23 -0500] flaccid_: GeoffC_: do you have a link to the cookbook source?
[2013-11-04 22:54:50 -0500] GeoffC_: https://github.com/opscode/nagios-quick-start

[2013-11-04 22:56:44 -0500] flaccid_: looking at https://github.com/opscode/nagios-quick-start/blob/master/cookbooks/nagios/recipes/server.rb i think it uses roles to determine n
[2013-11-04 22:56:57 -0500] fveillette: powershell_script depends on wich provider?
[2013-11-04 22:57:21 -0500] fveillette: Cannot find a resource for powershell_script on windows version 6.1.7601[0m
[2013-11-04 22:57:45 -0500] GeoffC_: flaccid I see that file but shouldn't it automatically update the nagios config if I just run chef-client?
[2013-11-04 22:57:50 -0500] GeoffC_: I do that and it doesn't change the IP
[2013-11-04 22:58:13 -0500] flaccid_: did you change the role it uses?
[2013-11-04 22:58:25 -0500] GeoffC_: no
[2013-11-04 22:58:37 -0500] flaccid_: i guess thats why
[2013-11-04 22:58:46 -0500] GeoffC_: confused
[2013-11-04 22:59:11 -0500] GeoffC_: < just a beginner
[2013-11-04 23:07:38 -0500] GeoffC_: Ok next question, how do I add a chef client to nagios
[2013-11-04 23:08:35 -0500] GeoffC_: when I do for instance <knife bootstrap clientip -r 'role[base]'> I get an error about resolving cookbooks
[2013-11-04 23:08:44 -0500] GeoffC_: even though I just uploaded those same cookbooks on the nagios box
