[2013-11-17 00:06:39 -0500] strictlyb: anyone using aws_raid  with aws cookbookj i am running into a brick wall and had a question for anyone who is using it
[2013-11-17 00:09:02 -0500] strictlyb: my devices are being created as /dev/xvdm
[2013-11-17 00:09:13 -0500] strictlyb: however it thinks it should be /dev/xvdi*
[2013-11-17 00:09:22 -0500] strictlyb: and i cant seemto figure out how to handle this
[2013-11-17 00:09:38 -0500] strictlyb: any help would be greatly appreciated
[2013-11-17 00:16:27 -0500] slicknick: created as m -- where?   define "it" ..
[2013-11-17 00:17:00 -0500] strictlyb: hey
[2013-11-17 00:17:05 -0500] strictlyb: how can you define it
[2013-11-17 00:17:06 -0500] strictlyb: ?
[2013-11-17 00:17:12 -0500] strictlyb: slicknick you mind if i message you?
[2013-11-17 00:17:16 -0500] slicknick: yes i do mind
[2013-11-17 00:17:26 -0500] slicknick: what is it
[2013-11-17 00:17:47 -0500] strictlyb: nothing thanks,
[2013-11-17 00:17:47 -0500] slicknick: you tell us what "it" is -- in your head
[2013-11-17 00:17:48 -0500] slicknick: heh
[2013-11-17 00:18:00 -0500] strictlyb: ;)
[2013-11-17 00:18:05 -0500] slicknick: it can be the OS. the AWS instance ...
[2013-11-17 00:18:11 -0500] slicknick: wtf is "IT"
[2013-11-17 00:18:31 -0500] strictlyb: so im running centos6.4 i have a single ephermal drive as xvdf
[2013-11-17 00:19:07 -0500] strictlyb: ebs raid i create with 4 drives and they attach as xvdi1/2/3/4 according to right_aws gem
[2013-11-17 00:19:17 -0500] strictlyb: but the OS is seeing it as xvdm
[2013-11-17 00:19:25 -0500] strictlyb: i wonder if its something with my AMI
[2013-11-17 00:19:59 -0500] slicknick: right
[2013-11-17 00:20:25 -0500] slicknick: AFAIK and experienced -- thats normal
[2013-11-17 00:20:40 -0500] slicknick: theres some aws doc on it i skimmed at some point
[2013-11-17 00:21:12 -0500] strictlyb: problem is mdadm is trying to create an array based off xvdi{1..4}
[2013-11-17 00:22:41 -0500] slicknick: thats not a problem, more a discussion why youve chosen to.   your problem is still unclear
[2013-11-17 00:23:01 -0500] strictlyb: what is not clear about my problem?
[2013-11-17 00:23:13 -0500] slicknick: regarding the OS and chef, ignore what AWS shows the devives as
[2013-11-17 00:23:21 -0500] slicknick: you care what the OS seems them as
[2013-11-17 00:23:24 -0500] slicknick: fdisk -l
[2013-11-17 00:24:06 -0500] strictlyb: the OS is showing the 4 volumes as as /dev/xvdm1 /dev/xvdm2 /dev/xvdm3 /dev/xvdm4
[2013-11-17 00:24:16 -0500] strictlyb: thats what i said before.
[2013-11-17 00:24:51 -0500] slicknick: after much poking prodding and prying that is now clear
[2013-11-17 00:25:09 -0500] slicknick: so whats the problem
[2013-11-17 00:25:47 -0500] slicknick: yet to find why this is a chef discussion but the build up sure has been great
[2013-11-17 00:28:56 -0500] strictlyb: your too cool bro
[2013-11-17 00:29:11 -0500] strictlyb: i didnt say it was a chef issue or an amazon issue
[2013-11-17 00:29:23 -0500] strictlyb: its my issue and i asked if anyone would mind helping me out
[2013-11-17 00:29:29 -0500] strictlyb: what your doing is being a doosh
[2013-11-17 00:29:29 -0500] slicknick: i recognize my replies arent the kidnest
[2013-11-17 00:29:30 -0500] strictlyb: but thanks
[2013-11-17 00:29:43 -0500] slicknick: but youre not going to get help here without pointed specific precise questions
[2013-11-17 00:29:58 -0500] strictlyb: hence why i said PM?
[2013-11-17 00:29:59 -0500] slicknick: especially presented to the wrong audience
[2013-11-17 00:30:00 -0500] strictlyb: u said no
[2013-11-17 00:30:02 -0500] slicknick: just trying to help you out
[2013-11-17 00:30:07 -0500] strictlyb: so i am not going to paste 400 lines of code here
[2013-11-17 00:30:12 -0500] slicknick: we dont want you to
[2013-11-17 00:30:19 -0500] slicknick: i dont want to see that either
[2013-11-17 00:30:24 -0500] slicknick: i wont be able to help you with that
[2013-11-17 00:30:46 -0500] strictlyb: this is an easier question
[2013-11-17 00:31:03 -0500] strictlyb: is there a way to specify what device you want volumes to be created on within attributes
[2013-11-17 00:31:09 -0500] slicknick: ~3 months experience with chef/aws myself - so my mileage is likely limited -- but getting you down the right road i can likely assist with
[2013-11-17 00:31:29 -0500] strictlyb: i have been using chef for a while, i just wasnt sure why this was happening in aws,
[2013-11-17 00:31:47 -0500] strictlyb: i know AWS sees drives as X and the OS sees them as Y
[2013-11-17 00:31:51 -0500] slicknick: within 'waht' attributes?
[2013-11-17 00:31:58 -0500] strictlyb: sec
[2013-11-17 00:32:00 -0500] slicknick: what are you using to cretae the volumes?
[2013-11-17 00:32:04 -0500] slicknick: chef?
[2013-11-17 00:38:55 -0500] strictlyb: yes
[2013-11-17 00:39:05 -0500] strictlyb: i am using chef cookbook aws to create volumes
[2013-11-17 00:39:37 -0500] strictlyb: chef is writing the volumes to my node config as /dev/xvdi1,2,3,4
[2013-11-17 00:39:57 -0500] strictlyb: they are really being shown as xvdm1,2,3,4
[2013-11-17 00:40:28 -0500] strictlyb: thats my confusion as to how / why its reporting like this,  im not specifically hard coding the device letter to use,
[2013-11-17 00:41:33 -0500] slicknick: where is chef getting the i from
[2013-11-17 00:41:48 -0500] strictlyb: moment
[2013-11-17 00:42:33 -0500] strictlyb: https://gist.github.com/mikemaring/3735af9b70a42ffd4f91#file-mdb-rb-L26-L28
[2013-11-17 00:42:45 -0500] slicknick: like i said, i dont know chef well -- but somehow feed it the devices as m. maybe use chef to someone get the right label from fdisk and feed it to your volume creation
[2013-11-17 00:43:31 -0500] slicknick: better luck inquiring with the author of the code
[2013-11-17 00:43:35 -0500] strictlyb: thats the thing you arent supposed to have to do that
[2013-11-17 00:43:41 -0500] strictlyb: you realize your in a chef chat room right ;)
[2013-11-17 00:43:43 -0500] slicknick: im not versed enough to understand that link
[2013-11-17 00:43:58 -0500] strictlyb: np tho thanks tho anyway for your heklp
[2013-11-17 00:44:00 -0500] strictlyb: help*
[2013-11-17 00:44:10 -0500] slicknick: yeah, im well aware thanks
[2013-11-17 00:44:36 -0500] strictlyb: haha
[2013-11-17 00:44:44 -0500] slicknick: not sure i helped you, but youre welcome nonetheless. hope you have a bit more to go on now
[2013-11-17 00:45:13 -0500] strictlyb: not really but thanks ;)
[2013-11-17 00:55:43 -0500] Zauberfisch23: good day gents
[2013-11-17 00:57:26 -0500] Zauberfisch23: I am just getting started with chef, and am trying to build a role for a dhcp server. I think with templates and service I have everything I need regarding the configuration of the dhcp, but one thing I can't find is how would I go about configuring the IP adress for the interface on which the dhcp is running?
[2013-11-17 00:57:52 -0500] Zauberfisch23: I have looked at several existing dhcp cookbooks, but none seem to adress the issue of setting a static IP
[2013-11-17 00:58:28 -0500] Zauberfisch23: and the only thing I found so far regarding setting the IP with chef was using a template for /etc/network/interfaces
[2013-11-17 00:59:17 -0500] Zauberfisch23: however, this would only work if the interfaces on all dhcp servers are equal
[2013-11-17 00:59:36 -0500] Zauberfisch23: isn't there a way to say like "make sure that eth1 has this ip address"?
[2013-11-17 01:04:38 -0500] slicknick: decouple the eth1 configuration from the dhcp configuration
[2013-11-17 01:05:40 -0500] strictlyb: slicknick fyi
[2013-11-17 01:05:42 -0500] strictlyb: heres whats happening
[2013-11-17 01:05:43 -0500] strictlyb: http://note.io/HWXOEM
[2013-11-17 01:07:41 -0500] slicknick: Zauberfisch23: not sure my usage of the following component words are correct (just starting myself) .. same cookbook, same role, just different recipe? err .. one extra 'thing' to do for configuring an additional interface in eth1 with a specific (i assume static) IP address
[2013-11-17 01:09:13 -0500] slicknick: strictlyb: do an fdisk -l on the box
[2013-11-17 01:09:35 -0500] slicknick: are they i or m
[2013-11-17 01:09:41 -0500] strictlyb: m
[2013-11-17 01:09:42 -0500] strictlyb: fdisk -l|grep dm

[2013-11-17 01:10:17 -0500] slicknick: so tell your creating raid device action run to use M noT I
[2013-11-17 01:10:45 -0500] strictlyb: right i can do that, but shouldnt have to ;) is all
[2013-11-17 01:11:08 -0500] slicknick: im not here to debate that
[2013-11-17 01:11:16 -0500] strictlyb: ;)
[2013-11-17 01:11:17 -0500] strictlyb: np
[2013-11-17 01:21:53 -0500] slicknick: strictlyb - btw -- that last url provides a place to find more information about why it may be failing.  more helpful would be the contents of the code/script/recipe/etc that fails.
[2013-11-17 01:22:13 -0500] slicknick: NOT in the channel as a friendly reminder L>
[2013-11-17 01:22:19 -0500] slicknick: :>
[2013-11-17 01:25:22 -0500] strictlyb: i pasted it earlier,
[2013-11-17 01:25:32 -0500] strictlyb: https://gist.github.com/mikemaring/3735af9b70a42ffd4f91#file-mdb-rb-L26-L28
[2013-11-17 01:29:10 -0500] Zauberfisch23: slicknick: uhm, basicly my questiion is, "is there a propper way of setting the IP for an interface in chef"
[2013-11-17 01:30:58 -0500] strictlyb: i would handle ip assignments in something like cobbler,
[2013-11-17 01:30:59 -0500] Zauberfisch23: so yes, I have no problem with keeping that in the same cookbook, I just want to set eth1 without overwriting eth0, eth2, eth...
[2013-11-17 01:31:25 -0500] slicknick: Zauberfisch23: very well.  while id wager there are more than two ways, unfortunately i lack the knowledge thus experience to offer a suggestion
[2013-11-17 01:33:22 -0500] Zauberfisch23: strictlyb: from first glance, cobbler could be the tool I run before running chef?
[2013-11-17 01:33:41 -0500] strictlyb: you usse cobbler to provision a base built system before handing off to chef
[2013-11-17 01:33:47 -0500] strictlyb: installs the os
[2013-11-17 01:33:54 -0500] strictlyb: setups partitions and ip info
[2013-11-17 01:34:17 -0500] strictlyb: you base snippets to your systems to install chef
[2013-11-17 01:34:18 -0500] Zauberfisch23: as in doing the things I currently do manually (installing the OS, setting the IP of eth0 which is connected inetnet, ...)
[2013-11-17 01:34:25 -0500] strictlyb: yeah
[2013-11-17 01:34:28 -0500] Zauberfisch23: hmmm
[2013-11-17 01:34:29 -0500] strictlyb: dont do that
[2013-11-17 01:34:30 -0500] Zauberfisch23: intesting
[2013-11-17 01:34:31 -0500] strictlyb: check ths out
[2013-11-17 01:34:52 -0500] strictlyb: http://www.cobblerd.org/
[2013-11-17 01:34:59 -0500] strictlyb: you use centos or ubuntu /
[2013-11-17 01:35:02 -0500] Zauberfisch23: already have it open
[2013-11-17 01:35:12 -0500] Zauberfisch23: manly ubuntu
[2013-11-17 01:35:18 -0500] Zauberfisch23: *mainly
[2013-11-17 01:35:22 -0500] strictlyb: ya np
[2013-11-17 01:35:26 -0500] strictlyb: yeah look at that
[2013-11-17 01:36:29 -0500] Zauberfisch23: thanks for the tip
[2013-11-17 01:37:21 -0500] Zauberfisch23: and damn it, another tool that I have too look into, spent the better part of the last week just on setting up my new base infrastructure, puppet vs chef and then learning chef
[2013-11-17 01:38:55 -0500] Zauberfisch23: well, I am going to hack it together with just using cookbook_file for /etc/network/interfaces for now
[2013-11-17 01:39:02 -0500] Zauberfisch23: cobbler has to way
[2013-11-17 01:39:24 -0500] Zauberfisch23: some of the services need to be up and running by monday
[2013-11-17 01:41:20 -0500] Zauberfisch23: well, strictlyb & slicknick thanks

[2013-11-17 04:30:01 -0500] jchauncey: Adam said there was more people this year than last but it was hard to tell how many people were actually there
[2013-11-17 04:30:23 -0500] coderanger: From the raffle it sounded like it was around 150
[2013-11-17 04:30:35 -0500] coderanger: since she said the number picked had to be below 156 or something
[2013-11-17 04:31:04 -0500] jchauncey: cool

[2013-11-17 12:22:26 -0500] slicknick: my bad
[2013-11-17 13:55:14 -0500] b0c1: a question, what is the type of the new_resource in provider ?
[2013-11-17 13:55:43 -0500] b0c1: its not hash beacause erb said no [] method
[2013-11-17 14:20:15 -0500] strictlyb: hey anyone around that uses aws cookbook for ebs_raid?
[2013-11-17 14:21:29 -0500] storme_out: dev1x: did that work?
[2013-11-17 14:21:46 -0500] dev1x: still working on the recipe stormerider
[2013-11-17 14:21:48 -0500] dev1x: :)
[2013-11-17 14:22:01 -0500] stormerider: ok :) just wanted to check in
[2013-11-17 14:24:27 -0500] dev1x: this is for chef-server
[2013-11-17 14:24:29 -0500] dev1x: not chef-solo
[2013-11-17 14:24:40 -0500] dev1x: not sure if it has any implications, but i'm taking a guess it doesnt
[2013-11-17 14:30:21 -0500] micgo: b0c1: I believe it's a resource object
[2013-11-17 14:35:40 -0500] stormerider: dev1x: i don't use solo or zero myself
[2013-11-17 14:36:17 -0500] stormerider: i have two OSC servers at the moment, working on consolidating down to one
[2013-11-17 14:42:27 -0500] dev1x:  btw stormerider
[2013-11-17 14:42:30 -0500] dev1x: wondering something
[2013-11-17 14:42:38 -0500] dev1x: can i declare a variable within a case statement
[2013-11-17 14:42:44 -0500] dev1x: that will be used in that recipe after?
[2013-11-17 14:42:46 -0500] dev1x: i.e.
[2013-11-17 14:42:54 -0500] dev1x: case node[:foo][:bar]
[2013-11-17 14:43:06 -0500] dev1x: when "f01"
[2013-11-17 14:43:15 -0500] dev1x: leetvar = 100,
[2013-11-17 14:43:22 -0500] dev1x: when "f02"
[2013-11-17 14:43:28 -0500] dev1x: leetvar = 200,
[2013-11-17 14:43:30 -0500] dev1x: end
[2013-11-17 14:43:58 -0500] stormerider: yes, my coworker does that for managing what packages to install on different versions of ubuntu
[2013-11-17 14:44:42 -0500] dev1x: so to use it after inside a command execution, how do i use it? [:leetvar] ?
[2013-11-17 14:45:13 -0500] dev1x: (sorry i'm fairly new to this, and my new job requires me to learn chef with hands on, so I'm kind of navigating in the wild... )
[2013-11-17 14:45:20 -0500] dev1x: (waiting on that o'reilly book to come out)
[2013-11-17 14:49:48 -0500] stormerider: #{leetvar} inside a string, or just leetvar in general usage
[2013-11-17 14:50:36 -0500] dev1x: thnks! :)
[2013-11-17 14:51:14 -0500] stormerider: that's actually a ruby thing in general... and i believe the chef orielly book got cancelled, iirc
[2013-11-17 16:30:03 -0500] dev1x: stormerider, i'm having a wierd issue, i'm using ohai to load a value into a variable
[2013-11-17 16:30:07 -0500] dev1x: so in attributes.rb i have
[2013-11-17 16:30:12 -0500] dev1x: hostname = node['net']['hostname']
[2013-11-17 16:30:22 -0500] dev1x: and in the recipe.rb i'm using
[2013-11-17 16:30:26 -0500] dev1x: require 'ohai'
[2013-11-17 16:30:48 -0500] dev1x: shouldnt this load the hostname of the machine to that var?
[2013-11-17 16:31:46 -0500] stormerider: i've not seen local vars defined like that. those will already be populated to the recipe, you should just reference it in the recipe itself, and you dont need to require ohai
[2013-11-17 16:32:09 -0500] stormerider: the ohai data is already populated before you start any recipe.
[2013-11-17 16:32:54 -0500] dev1x: humm
[2013-11-17 16:32:57 -0500] dev1x: i think i know the error
[2013-11-17 16:32:59 -0500] dev1x: should be
[2013-11-17 16:33:08 -0500] dev1x: :hostname => node['net']['hostname']
[2013-11-17 16:33:10 -0500] dev1x: i think
[2013-11-17 16:35:25 -0500] stormerider: realistically, i think that's a bad practice, the attributes files should be used only for defining node attributes
[2013-11-17 16:42:14 -0500] martz_: hi looking for a reference on how to create dynamic default attributes by reading from a file
[2013-11-17 16:42:32 -0500] martz_: for example I have a csv file and I want / need them to become attributes in my cookbook - is there a reference on how to do that ?
[2013-11-17 16:44:49 -0500] adnichols: martz_ if the file is on the host you're running chef-client on that sounds like ohai - check out http://docs.opscode.com/ohai.html
[2013-11-17 16:45:13 -0500] adnichols: There are links to some community plugins at the bottom which may give you some ideas how you can do that
[2013-11-17 16:46:11 -0500] dev1x: so how would you suggest to add the hostname of the server to that variable?
[2013-11-17 16:47:33 -0500] martz_: hmm ... I was looking at getting the file from s3 at the begiining of the recipe and then parsing it and setting attributes so following recips have them, are you sure ohai is suitible for this ?
[2013-11-17 16:47:35 -0500] dev1x: :hostname => node['hostname']
[2013-11-17 16:47:35 -0500] dev1x:  ?
[2013-11-17 16:47:56 -0500] adnichols: martz_ then no - I wasn't sure of the source of the file :)
[2013-11-17 16:48:49 -0500] martz_: my file has the follwing syntax "product_name%%%filename%%%pathtofile"
[2013-11-17 16:49:40 -0500] adnichols: martz_ you could write a resource provider that pulls down the file & parses it into node attributes I assume. I'd have to experiment
[2013-11-17 16:50:20 -0500] martz_: @ adnichols  so I need to create attributes like so: node[product_name.to_sym][:filename] = 2nd ard and node[product_name.to_sym][:path]
[2013-11-17 16:52:41 -0500] adnichols: martz_ I'm not going to be able to tell you how to parse the csv into those node attributes - but you can assign the values however you want. It'll probably involve writing some ruby
[2013-11-17 16:53:16 -0500] martz_: I know was looking for a hint / reference on that here ... :)
[2013-11-17 16:53:57 -0500] adnichols: Yeah, I'd look at creating a resource provider. You could probably start with a ruby block or a method in a recipe or something to get your logic working
[2013-11-17 16:54:16 -0500] martz_: thanks for all your help
[2013-11-17 18:03:28 -0500] clakeb: Can chef server provision ARM nodes?
[2013-11-17 18:16:51 -0500] teukka: clakeb: server doesn't care. the communication is via http api. as long as you can run the chef-client on the node you should be fine. I don't think there are omnibus packages for arm, but you can `gem install chef`
[2013-11-17 18:17:42 -0500] clakeb: teukka: that is what I was thinking since it was a gem.
[2013-11-17 18:19:12 -0500] clakeb: I've got this new idea to help schools get more computers and devices in classrooms and chef is the obvious choice for provisioning linux desktops but was then thinking "they need tablets too"
[2013-11-17 18:21:58 -0500] clakeb: I think it will take some work though
[2013-11-17 19:56:12 -0500] ermajn: hello, what is the best practice to put ssh key (id_rsa.pub) on client
[2013-11-17 20:20:03 -0500] alop: ermajn: there is a users cookbook
[2013-11-17 20:20:41 -0500] alop: users are added as data bag items in the "Users" data bag, the pubkey is added as an element in the json
[2013-11-17 20:21:15 -0500] alop: ermajn: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/users
[2013-11-17 20:24:42 -0500] ermajn: alop: that way authorized_keys are generated, right? I want to put already kenerated key in id_rsa.pub
[2013-11-17 20:25:52 -0500] alop: ermajn: your id_rsa.pub can go into your user's json file, and chef will render the appropriate .ssh/authorized_keys
[2013-11-17 20:36:28 -0500] pabst^: is it possible to set an attribute from a bash block in a recipe?
[2013-11-17 20:37:38 -0500] someara: nope, you'll need a ruby_block
[2013-11-17 20:38:01 -0500] someara: you can have a ruby_block that does it, with action :nothing, that the bash block notifies
[2013-11-17 20:38:08 -0500] ermajn: alop: maybe you did not understand. I want to put generated key file on client, not key in authorized_keys...
[2013-11-17 20:38:34 -0500] ermajn: so, I want to create ida_rsa.pub not by generating key, but to take it from data bag
[2013-11-17 20:38:48 -0500] pabst^: someara: thanks! makes sense... I think... ill give it a shot and come back with questions
[2013-11-17 20:58:44 -0500] gclark85: can anyone help me with a chef deregistration script?
[2013-11-17 20:59:06 -0500] gclark85: I have a script to knife node delete upon shutdown but I am having trouble actually getting it to run on shutdown
[2013-11-17 21:11:12 -0500] ermajn: i have to server instances that needs to "talk" to each other password less, and I need to make that with chef scripts.. what's best approach?
[2013-11-17 22:16:30 -0500] mr`spock: last week i knew zero about chef. this week i'm provisioning dozens of servers.
