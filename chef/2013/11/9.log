[2013-11-09 00:00:39 -0500] Cope: jmickle: emacs does exactly that :)
[2013-11-09 00:00:42 -0500] jmickle: haha
[2013-11-09 00:00:44 -0500] garrett__: vim, sublimetext, emacs.. all of those should work
[2013-11-09 00:01:01 -0500] jmickle: il try sublime text i guess
[2013-11-09 00:01:12 -0500] Cope: that's a popular choice
[2013-11-09 00:01:29 -0500] jmickle: text mate looks pretty good too but it doesn't autosense
[2013-11-09 00:01:32 -0500] garrett__: pretty much every editor should be able to apply the appropriate syntax highlighting/indent patterns/autocomplete stuff based on file extension/pragmas/whatever.
[2013-11-09 00:01:39 -0500] jmickle: yeah
[2013-11-09 00:02:15 -0500] Cope: I haven't found anything that handles multiple buffers, and easy splitting and switching between them that can match emacs
[2013-11-09 00:02:21 -0500] garrett__: echo "sy on" >> ~/.vimrc ?
[2013-11-09 00:02:49 -0500] Cope: so while i've used textmate and sublime, and they're great, I always prefer emacs if I have a choice
[2013-11-09 00:03:08 -0500] garrett__: Cope: yeah, everyone has their favorite shoes ;)
[2013-11-09 00:03:22 -0500] Cope: i'm fluent in vi(m) so happy to pair with anyone on vim if that's their choice
[2013-11-09 00:03:40 -0500] Cope: $colleague is using eclipse atm though and really liking it
[2013-11-09 00:03:52 -0500] Cope: his doesn't seem to crash
[2013-11-09 00:04:14 -0500] garrett__: i used eclipse for some android dev ages ago, but it felt really clunky on my machine at the time.
[2013-11-09 00:04:25 -0500] jmickle: ha ok
[2013-11-09 00:05:39 -0500] garrett__: alright, well, 6pm on a friday is probably not a good time to start porting dns zones. so i retire to beer.
[2013-11-09 00:12:22 -0500] doomviking: wisdom
[2013-11-09 00:18:06 -0500] MattMaker: how do I get a dmg cookbook to work when the dmg contains an entire folder, not ending in ".app", to be copied to /Applications ?
[2013-11-09 00:24:29 -0500] nickmeharry: Hi all, new to Chef. Possibly stupid question, but why do I need to install the "dmg" cookbook for "git" when all my servers are running Linux?
[2013-11-09 00:24:48 -0500] nickmeharry: knife cookbook upload complains if I don't.
[2013-11-09 00:26:26 -0500] manfred: because it is required by one of the recipes for the git cookbook
[2013-11-09 00:26:39 -0500] manfred: so in the event that it gets applied, you have to have all dependencies
[2013-11-09 00:27:06 -0500] nickmeharry: So there's no harm in installing it?
[2013-11-09 00:27:10 -0500] nickmeharry: Even though it won't run?
[2013-11-09 00:27:12 -0500] manfred: i don't even use libcups, or the things that gtk3 uses it for, but because the package is built against libcups in my distro, I have to have libcups installed
[2013-11-09 00:27:41 -0500] doomviking: no harm
[2013-11-09 00:27:45 -0500] nickmeharry: Ok. A large part of my concern was that I had to install each package individually, which was becoming quite annoying.
[2013-11-09 00:27:54 -0500] nickmeharry: Just found that knife can do that part too.
[2013-11-09 00:27:58 -0500] manfred: you just have to make sure you have the cookbooks
[2013-11-09 00:28:02 -0500] manfred: don't need the packages though
[2013-11-09 00:28:07 -0500] nickmeharry: Err, I meant cookbooks.
[2013-11-09 00:28:18 -0500] manfred: yar
[2013-11-09 00:28:40 -0500] nickmeharry: The tutorial I'm following does `knife cookbook site download <thing>` `tar xzf thing*.tar.gz`
[2013-11-09 00:28:56 -0500] nickmeharry: Then when I try to upload to the server, it complains about a missing cookbook.
[2013-11-09 00:29:13 -0500] nickmeharry: Dug around a bit and found `knife cookbook site install`, which makes things much easier.
[2013-11-09 00:29:28 -0500] nickmeharry: Not sure why the tutorial didn't just use that.
[2013-11-09 00:29:35 -0500] nickmeharry: Anyways, thanks.
[2013-11-09 00:29:43 -0500] manfred: should always read the cookbooks first, remember that they can be written by anyone
[2013-11-09 00:29:54 -0500] manfred: and you could be installing a rootkit or terrible things :)
[2013-11-09 00:54:01 -0500] loco-yokel: Anyone running chef solo/client under a user other than root?
[2013-11-09 01:27:13 -0500] fak3r: I want a VAR in a name of a file in a recipe, so:
[2013-11-09 01:27:40 -0500] fak3r: cookbook_file "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ssl."<%= node['app_environment'] %>".hostname.com.key" do
[2013-11-09 01:28:00 -0500] fak3r: so it'd come out like ssl.qa.hostname.com.key on the node where it gets installed
[2013-11-09 01:31:08 -0500] bean: fak3r, use string interpolation?
[2013-11-09 01:31:40 -0500] bean: cookbook_file "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ssl.#{node['app_environment']}.hostname.com.key" do
[2013-11-09 01:48:17 -0500] fak3r: bean: ok, thanks!
[2013-11-09 01:56:42 -0500] fak3r: bean: yes! that worked - thank you
[2013-11-09 01:57:01 -0500] bean: np
[2013-11-09 01:57:06 -0500] bean: just standard ruby
[2013-11-09 02:02:42 -0500] mr`spock: this week I get to delve into Chef and learn all about it.  woot.
[2013-11-09 02:04:15 -0500] gchristensen: w00t
[2013-11-09 03:17:53 -0500] jjfro: hello
[2013-11-09 04:23:01 -0500] mr`spock: jjfro, hi
[2013-11-09 04:58:28 -0500] michael_mbp: hi all
[2013-11-09 04:58:33 -0500] michael_mbp: anyone abuot?
[2013-11-09 05:03:20 -0500] manfred: nope
[2013-11-09 05:03:26 -0500] manfred: leave it
[2013-11-09 05:03:28 -0500] manfred: beeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
[2013-11-09 05:23:50 -0500] michael_mbp: guys where can I find the 10.x docs for chef?
[2013-11-09 05:32:53 -0500] manfred: wikihttps://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef10/Home
[2013-11-09 05:32:55 -0500] manfred: bah
[2013-11-09 05:32:58 -0500] manfred: https://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef10/Home
[2013-11-09 05:58:39 -0500] michael_mbp: hmm
[2013-11-09 05:58:46 -0500] michael_mbp: clicking links take me back to 11
[2013-11-09 16:28:17 -0500] cjs226: is it possible to perform compound searches of encrypted data bag items?  http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2013-11/msg00121.html
[2013-11-09 16:38:37 -0500] geggam: any chance omnibnus will ever be ported to openbsd ?
[2013-11-09 21:16:01 -0500] cruisemaniac: Hi, is this the right place to ask about knife-ec2 plugin?
[2013-11-09 21:16:24 -0500] cruisemaniac: I'm trying to help a friend with her project and both of us are clueless about a few things on the knife-ec2 plugin!
[2013-11-09 21:17:22 -0500] cruisemaniac: I know I can use knife-ec2 and chef to create a new instance. is there a way to power up an existing instance via knife-ec2 ?
[2013-11-09 21:19:00 -0500] manfred: https://github.com/opscode/knife-ec2
[2013-11-09 21:19:15 -0500] manfred: does not look like it has any information booting one, other than creating a new one
[2013-11-09 21:25:48 -0500] cruisemaniac: @manfred guessed as much!
[2013-11-09 21:34:52 -0500] manfred: since i have never used it, do you actually save money having an ec2 image powered off?
[2013-11-09 21:39:59 -0500] gchristensen: manfred: they bill you for having it, even if it is off
[2013-11-09 21:40:29 -0500] manfred: kk
[2013-11-09 21:59:34 -0500] otakup0pe: two questions. first one : does cookbook_versions not apply at the node level ?
[2013-11-09 21:59:50 -0500] otakup0pe: and second question : is there an easy way to see why depsolver came up with a particular solution ?
[2013-11-09 22:00:06 -0500] otakup0pe: trying to track down some issues where chef is picking an ancient cookbook all of a sudden
[2013-11-09 22:00:13 -0500] otakup0pe: (let's ignore why we have ancient cookbooks on the server :v )
[2013-11-09 22:21:04 -0500] otakup0pe: seems silly that there is no straightforward way to get more info on a 412
[2013-11-09 22:21:14 -0500] otakup0pe: especially on a sunny saturday.
[2013-11-09 23:23:14 -0500] xargs: I'm using hosted chef, how often do the chef-clients query the server to check for updates?
[2013-11-09 23:23:41 -0500] jbz: xargs: That depends entirely on your settings on the clients.
[2013-11-09 23:23:50 -0500] jbz: It's a pull-based system.  The client on the nodes determines that.
[2013-11-09 23:23:51 -0500] xargs: so that's the client.rb ?
[2013-11-09 23:24:02 -0500] jbz: Possibly, although it depends how you're running the client
[2013-11-09 23:24:04 -0500] xargs: So i'm bootstrapping using knife
[2013-11-09 23:24:12 -0500] xargs: where would the settings be to configure the client.rb file
[2013-11-09 23:24:31 -0500] jbz: ah, likely (unless you specifically put a cookbook in the runlist to set up chef-client) it's not set up to run right now
[2013-11-09 23:24:52 -0500] jbz: There are several ways to do it - cron, run it as a daemon process, or run it as a managed service
[2013-11-09 23:25:09 -0500] jbz: I suggest you have a look at the chef-client cookbook in the community repo, which should be able to set it up in any of those ways.
[2013-11-09 23:25:10 -0500] xargs: chef-client does seem to be available to run manualy
[2013-11-09 23:25:14 -0500] jbz: But you have to tell it to do so
[2013-11-09 23:25:24 -0500] jbz: knife bootstrap won't leave the client running or configured to run by default.
[2013-11-09 23:25:33 -0500] xargs: Ah
[2013-11-09 23:25:37 -0500] xargs: Hm that's odd
[2013-11-09 23:25:41 -0500] jbz: It will leave the client able to run against your set server
[2013-11-09 23:25:42 -0500] jbz: nah
[2013-11-09 23:26:05 -0500] jbz: it assumes you're going to pick which way you want the node set up.
[2013-11-09 23:26:08 -0500] jbz: So
[2013-11-09 23:26:11 -0500] xargs: So allot of people bootstrap chef to only ever run once?
[2013-11-09 23:26:16 -0500] jbz: no
[2013-11-09 23:26:25 -0500] jbz: but if you want to bootstrap all the way to an automatically running chef-client
[2013-11-09 23:26:32 -0500] jbz: you need to put in cookbooks into the runlist that will do that part for you.
[2013-11-09 23:27:08 -0500] jbz: There are lots and lots of ways people might want to do that, so it doesn't assume.
[2013-11-09 23:27:17 -0500] xargs: I guess
[2013-11-09 23:27:30 -0500] xargs: You could just keep rebuilding the hosts when you make a change
[2013-11-09 23:27:39 -0500] xargs: A bit like a rightscale type approach
[2013-11-09 23:27:52 -0500] jbz: well, that's pretty inefficient, but possible, sure
[2013-11-09 23:28:06 -0500] xargs: inefficient in what way
[2013-11-09 23:28:13 -0500] jbz: well depends on what you're trying to do
[2013-11-09 23:28:20 -0500] xargs: it gives you a more guaranteed build state.
[2013-11-09 23:28:25 -0500] jbz: if you just want to use chef for initial provisioning, then no, it's not
[2013-11-09 23:28:33 -0500] jbz: but if you want to use chef to actively manage your running nodes, then it is.
[2013-11-09 23:28:52 -0500] xargs: I guess if you are using chef correctly, you don't need to actively manage your nodes
[2013-11-09 23:28:58 -0500] xargs: because everything should be built from scratch
[2013-11-09 23:28:59 -0500] jbz: Really?
[2013-11-09 23:29:02 -0500] xargs: sure
[2013-11-09 23:29:16 -0500] xargs: why change a server when you can rebuild it
[2013-11-09 23:29:18 -0500] jbz: So you want to rebuild a node to, say, add a route?
[2013-11-09 23:29:26 -0500] jbz: well, because I run on iron, and rebuilding is non trivial.
[2013-11-09 23:29:43 -0500] jbz: Also, because sometimes I just want to deplyo code, not change the base config, so why rebuild the whole node and interrupt service?
[2013-11-09 23:29:44 -0500] xargs: your question is wrong
[2013-11-09 23:30:00 -0500] xargs: the question should be how can i gaurentee that this server will build correctly with the route change
[2013-11-09 23:30:01 -0500] xargs: :)
[2013-11-09 23:30:23 -0500] jbz: Answer: You test the chef cookbook, and you know that changing the databag which tells your machines what routes to add will work properly.
[2013-11-09 23:30:42 -0500] jbz: Rather than have to tear down your whole infrastructure just to make a minor setting change.
[2013-11-09 23:30:55 -0500] xargs: testing a cookbook does not guarantee a build state.
[2013-11-09 23:30:59 -0500] jbz: nope
[2013-11-09 23:31:00 -0500] jbz: but
[2013-11-09 23:31:02 -0500] jbz: as I said
[2013-11-09 23:31:10 -0500] jbz: I have web nodes running at scale
[2013-11-09 23:31:14 -0500] jbz: and I can't have them interrupted
[2013-11-09 23:31:23 -0500] xargs: heard of load balancing?
[2013-11-09 23:31:24 -0500] jbz: so it makes more sense, in my case, to just have chef make the change
[2013-11-09 23:31:26 -0500] jbz: Sure I have
[2013-11-09 23:31:29 -0500] xargs: ok..
[2013-11-09 23:31:45 -0500] jbz: and you're doing real well at being condescending while assuming that everybody has your infrastructure requirements. :-)
[2013-11-09 23:32:03 -0500] xargs: sorry, i'm just playing devils advocate
[2013-11-09 23:32:05 -0500] jbz: I didn't tell you you had to do it a particular way
[2013-11-09 23:32:15 -0500] jbz: I just said that Chef isn't going to force you to do it a particular way.
[2013-11-09 23:32:19 -0500] xargs: I'm just interested in peoples approaches.
[2013-11-09 23:32:34 -0500] jbz: When I'm using cloud-based servers behind load balancers, yes, sure, I can tear down the nodes
[2013-11-09 23:32:35 -0500] jbz: but
[2013-11-09 23:32:37 -0500] jbz: in several cases
[2013-11-09 23:32:51 -0500] jbz: the complexity and risk of tearing down the server and bringing it back up isn't worth it.
[2013-11-09 23:32:58 -0500] jbz: What if the server has data I don't want to have to restore from backup?
[2013-11-09 23:33:07 -0500] jbz: And can't just detach/reattach the volume safely?
[2013-11-09 23:33:09 -0500] jbz: Well, then...
[2013-11-09 23:33:16 -0500] jbz: I change rather than replace.
[2013-11-09 23:33:24 -0500] jbz: If a machine gets out of whack enough that I can't converge it back
[2013-11-09 23:33:25 -0500] xargs: Then you've designed your infrastructure incorrectly
[2013-11-09 23:33:25 -0500] jbz: then sure
[2013-11-09 23:33:29 -0500] xargs: and you'd use memcached
[2013-11-09 23:33:30 -0500] jbz: heh
[2013-11-09 23:33:30 -0500] xargs: or something.
[2013-11-09 23:33:34 -0500] xargs: but i get you
[2013-11-09 23:33:35 -0500] jbz: again
[2013-11-09 23:33:37 -0500] xargs: i'm in the same boat.
[2013-11-09 23:33:42 -0500] xargs: it depends on your application constraints.
[2013-11-09 23:33:47 -0500] jbz: and you assume that my infrastructure is always going to be what I would love in my perfect world?
[2013-11-09 23:33:50 -0500] jbz: :-)
[2013-11-09 23:33:52 -0500] xargs: lol
[2013-11-09 23:33:55 -0500] jbz: I'm supporting dev teams
[2013-11-09 23:33:58 -0500] jbz: and qa teams
[2013-11-09 23:34:00 -0500] jbz: and db teams
[2013-11-09 23:34:06 -0500] jbz: and they didn't ask me before setting up their stuff. :-)
[2013-11-09 23:34:14 -0500] xargs: hmm, not playing devops huh
[2013-11-09 23:34:22 -0500] jbz: devops is one of those wonderful words
[2013-11-09 23:34:40 -0500] jbz: which, when you're lucky enough to be in a place where it can be safely and effectively applied, might make your life easiedr
[2013-11-09 23:34:59 -0500] jbz: but also, I find, blinds people to the realize of dirty real-world ops with constraints other than "I want to be buzzword-compliant and I can start from scratch."
[2013-11-09 23:35:03 -0500] jbz: *reality
[2013-11-09 23:35:28 -0500] jbz: DevOps is a tool.
[2013-11-09 23:35:33 -0500] xargs: it's a mentality
[2013-11-09 23:35:34 -0500] jbz: Used properly, a very very powerful one.
[2013-11-09 23:35:46 -0500] xargs: chef is the tool :)
[2013-11-09 23:35:52 -0500] jbz: I disagree.  They're both tools.
[2013-11-09 23:36:02 -0500] jbz: DevOps is a way of approaching a problem space
[2013-11-09 23:36:03 -0500] xargs: some dev's are tools.
[2013-11-09 23:36:07 -0500] xargs: :>
[2013-11-09 23:36:08 -0500] jbz: which sometimes offers huge advantages
[2013-11-09 23:36:18 -0500] jbz: and sometimes gets you spun into a terrible cycle of navel-gazing bullshit.
[2013-11-09 23:36:25 -0500] jbz: It depends on where you are, and who you're working with, and what you're working with.
[2013-11-09 23:36:42 -0500] jbz: But hey
[2013-11-09 23:36:44 -0500] jbz: the market is good enough
[2013-11-09 23:36:52 -0500] jbz: that you can pick and choose only those gigs where it applies, right now.
[2013-11-09 23:36:54 -0500] xargs: depends on where you are based
[2013-11-09 23:37:22 -0500] xargs: banks are still working on mainframes.
[2013-11-09 23:37:28 -0500] jbz: Yeah. Know why?
[2013-11-09 23:37:29 -0500] jbz: :-)
[2013-11-09 23:37:46 -0500] jbz: For some tasks, they remain unbeaten for speed and reliability.
[2013-11-09 23:37:46 -0500] xargs: because change is seen as risk
[2013-11-09 23:37:50 -0500] jbz: Not just seen.
[2013-11-09 23:38:05 -0500] jbz: It's seen as risk because it is always risk.
[2013-11-09 23:38:09 -0500] xargs: the best use cases for chef and cloud are web shops
[2013-11-09 23:38:13 -0500] jbz: The question is whether the rewards make it worth it.
[2013-11-09 23:38:28 -0500] xargs: the greatest risk in life is to risk nothing.
[2013-11-09 23:38:29 -0500] jbz: Maybe.
[2013-11-09 23:38:32 -0500] jbz: Well
[2013-11-09 23:38:41 -0500] xargs: that's why all banks suffer epic failures.
[2013-11-09 23:38:44 -0500] xargs: with thei rit
[2013-11-09 23:38:52 -0500] jbz: the stupidest risk in life is to risk things because 'that's old school.'
[2013-11-09 23:39:04 -0500] jbz: Managing risk doesn't mean avoiding change
[2013-11-09 23:39:14 -0500] jbz: it means making those changes in a manageable way, and testing for results as you go.
[2013-11-09 23:39:34 -0500] xargs: managing risk is to bank on smaller changes more frequent.
[2013-11-09 23:39:37 -0500] jbz: I use Chef.  I really like it.
[2013-11-09 23:39:47 -0500] jbz: But I don't think it's the solution for every problem.
[2013-11-09 23:39:53 -0500] jbz: And in some cases
[2013-11-09 23:40:12 -0500] xargs: So i've come from managing a large puppet estate - i'm new to chef.
[2013-11-09 23:40:16 -0500] jbz: there are areas of infrastructure which work well enough, compared to the areas around them, that they should absolutely be left alone until the bigger problems are solved.
[2013-11-09 23:40:23 -0500] xargs: just trying it with spinning up some aws nodes
[2013-11-09 23:40:36 -0500] xargs: might look at ansible too
[2013-11-09 23:40:39 -0500] jbz: Sure
[2013-11-09 23:40:41 -0500] jbz: look at all of 'em
[2013-11-09 23:40:46 -0500] jbz: find the one that works best for you.
[2013-11-09 23:41:04 -0500] xargs: so i hate the dependency hell with puppet
[2013-11-09 23:41:16 -0500] xargs: but it's great at managing active configuration on large estates.
[2013-11-09 23:41:52 -0500] jbz: I've used chef to provision, to manage state, and to deploy code.
[2013-11-09 23:41:54 -0500] xargs: i like the guaranteed state of chef, which i think is important when using public/private clouds
[2013-11-09 23:42:07 -0500] xargs: ordering is important
[2013-11-09 23:42:22 -0500] jbz: In my experience, using it only to provision means you're probably going to do more work than you need to.
[2013-11-09 23:42:46 -0500] jbz: I mostly use it for provisioning and management. Code deployments only in specific cases where it makes sense.
[2013-11-09 23:43:05 -0500] jbz: also heh
[2013-11-09 23:43:09 -0500] jbz: ordering is sometimes my bugbear in chef
[2013-11-09 23:43:26 -0500] xargs: how so
[2013-11-09 23:43:26 -0500] jbz: but that's mostly 'cuz I'm more dogged than bright.
[2013-11-09 23:43:28 -0500] jbz: well
[2013-11-09 23:43:35 -0500] jbz: the multi-phase nature of the chef run
[2013-11-09 23:43:46 -0500] jbz: and the compilation phase
[2013-11-09 23:43:53 -0500] jbz: means that sometimes things can get confusing
[2013-11-09 23:43:57 -0500] jbz: involving ordering.
[2013-11-09 23:44:08 -0500] jbz: Sure, the cookbooks are evaluated in the order they're placed in the runlist
[2013-11-09 23:44:21 -0500] jbz: but tracing execution order can be a real PITA
[2013-11-09 23:44:33 -0500] xargs: i guess so
[2013-11-09 23:44:35 -0500] jbz: precedence matters, resource vs. exterior code matters, etc.
[2013-11-09 23:44:44 -0500] jbz: It's worth it (or has been for me, so far)
[2013-11-09 23:44:45 -0500] xargs: also, how do you specify the version of cookbooks etc when using the run lists
[2013-11-09 23:45:02 -0500] xargs: do it always use head
[2013-11-09 23:45:41 -0500] jbz: You can't specify the version in the runlists.  You can specify the versions available to the client on the server using environments, and you *might* be able to put version constraints in the metadata, but I can't recall off the top of my head.
[2013-11-09 23:45:55 -0500] jbz: The '_default' environment will always use the latest version available on the server.
[2013-11-09 23:46:29 -0500] jbz: If you don't specify an environment, that's the one it'll use, so in a sense, yep, by default it does.
[2013-11-09 23:47:15 -0500] xargs: hmm
[2013-11-09 23:47:41 -0500] xargs: how do you test a build of a machine when cookbooks you are testing
[2013-11-09 23:47:45 -0500] jbz: I like this scheme because it lets me promote cookbook versions across my infrastructure without having to change runlists
[2013-11-09 23:47:48 -0500] jbz: well
[2013-11-09 23:48:03 -0500] jbz: I keep my prod instrastructure in the 'production' environment, which has specifically pegged cookbook versions
[2013-11-09 23:48:12 -0500] jbz: so uploading new versions won't affect what those machines are doing
[2013-11-09 23:48:27 -0500] jbz: until I decide the new version is ready, and then change the production environment to reflect the new version.
[2013-11-09 23:48:46 -0500] xargs: do you don't use _default and have a production and nonproduction?
[2013-11-09 23:49:06 -0500] jbz: I have production, staging, development and _default
[2013-11-09 23:49:10 -0500] xargs: but if i'm using knife to launch a server using run_list, how do i specify the old cookbook versions
[2013-11-09 23:49:23 -0500] jbz: you can't, but you can specify what environment to put it in
[2013-11-09 23:49:37 -0500] xargs: hmm
[2013-11-09 23:50:05 -0500] jbz: You could spin up a new environment with the specific version set you want
[2013-11-09 23:50:11 -0500] jbz: and then spin up nodes in that environment
[2013-11-09 23:50:14 -0500] jbz: or you could use local testing
[2013-11-09 23:50:35 -0500] jbz: using berkshelf and test-ktichen, say, which will let you specify versions using files in the cookbook repo.
[2013-11-09 23:51:34 -0500] xargs: with rightscale for example, you can specify the versions of the recipes which are tied to a revision control of a servertemplate.
[2013-11-09 23:51:52 -0500] jbz: okay
[2013-11-09 23:52:02 -0500] xargs: which allows you to specify a new revision of a servertemplate with new revisions of the recipes so you can test them out.
[2013-11-09 23:52:14 -0500] xargs: using HEAD is dangerous in my opinion
[2013-11-09 23:52:21 -0500] jbz: yah, they build their stuff atop base chef.
[2013-11-09 23:52:26 -0500] xargs: chef solo yea
[2013-11-09 23:52:40 -0500] xargs: but it goes back to my argument of building everything over and over.
[2013-11-09 23:52:41 -0500] jbz: The biggest issue, in my relatively uninformed opinion, is the chef server and the repo being unconnected.
[2013-11-09 23:52:57 -0500] jbz: chef-solo means I give up one of my favorite things about chef, namely search.
[2013-11-09 23:53:21 -0500] xargs: they've written ruby connectors that do all that for you though.
[2013-11-09 23:53:24 -0500] jbz: Sure
[2013-11-09 23:53:32 -0500] jbz: which is a reason to use Rightscale, if you want to pay them. :-)
[2013-11-09 23:53:51 -0500] xargs: they're not too expensive in the grand scheme of things.
[2013-11-09 23:54:13 -0500] jbz: If you can use 'em, sure.
