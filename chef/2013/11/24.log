[2013-11-24 00:27:40 -0500] codepython777: anyonehere?
[2013-11-24 00:27:58 -0500] robawt: a little bit
[2013-11-24 00:28:25 -0500] codepython777: robawt: can chef allow me to run a machine with certain packages, and define a version for the entire machine. Then i can move back and front on those?
[2013-11-24 00:28:57 -0500] robawt: codepython777: i'm new to chef but not to config management, maybe we can step through it together
[2013-11-24 00:29:39 -0500] robawt: are you saying you want to call the columnation of packages one version, then change the package versions and call that another version, then change between them?
[2013-11-24 00:30:39 -0500] codepython777: robawt: Lets say i've a Machine with nginx 1.xand python 2.x- and i define it machine version 1.0
[2013-11-24 00:30:50 -0500] codepython777: then i'd like to define machine version 2.0 with python 3.x and ...
[2013-11-24 00:30:57 -0500] codepython777: and like to move forth and back if i wwant
[2013-11-24 00:31:25 -0500] robawt: that doesn't sound like it'd be too difficult to do
[2013-11-24 00:32:36 -0500] robawt: codepython777: i'm trying to pull a specific doc right now to back up what i'm saying
[2013-11-24 00:33:01 -0500] robawt: you could cheat and have two different cookbooks and run one over the other, but there may be a way to specify a version
[2013-11-24 00:36:15 -0500] codepython777: robawt: why chef compared to puppet or salt?
[2013-11-24 00:36:29 -0500] robawt: codepython777: i'm using salt currently
[2013-11-24 00:36:37 -0500] robawt: i really like it and i think it's a great tool
[2013-11-24 00:36:59 -0500] robawt: it is free form enough that it can cause people to write themselves into a corner, and not be specific or consistent across states
[2013-11-24 00:37:55 -0500] robawt: i'm looking at chef to keep an open eye to config management as whole, and I like how there's cookbook templates automatically and the DSL is nice and compact enough that people arn't going nuts across a team
[2013-11-24 00:38:08 -0500] robawt: so far I'm liking it but i think everyone should keep an open mind
[2013-11-24 00:43:11 -0500] codepython777: robawt: i've read reviews and it seems puppet excels chef at many things?
[2013-11-24 00:43:20 -0500] robawt: codepython777: for example?
[2013-11-24 00:44:46 -0500] chip-: codepython777: Chef lets you write code that declares a state for a machine. If you need to automate transition between two states, then you'd need to write code paths both ways. That is, a Chef recipe isn't atomic; it will take whatever the current state is, and then if possible move a system config to the state you declared.
[2013-11-24 00:45:15 -0500] chip-: codepython777: So you don't declare "Machine v1.0," "Machine v2.0," and then when you remove 2.0 it reverts to 1.0. You'd need to write a rollback path, which is expensive.
[2013-11-24 00:46:00 -0500] codepython777: chip-: do you know if this is possible in puppet?
[2013-11-24 00:46:02 -0500] chip-: You are much better off writing code to automate from a common starting state (say, your kickstarted config or a base AMI) to v1.0, and also code to automate to v2.0, and just stand up new 1.0 machines instead of trying to migrate state.
[2013-11-24 00:46:05 -0500] chip-: It is not.
[2013-11-24 00:46:17 -0500] chip-: What you're asking for is actually a ridiculously hard problem, right?
[2013-11-24 00:46:36 -0500] codepython777: yes of course
[2013-11-24 00:46:46 -0500] robawt: chip-: hey good point
[2013-11-24 00:46:51 -0500] chip-: The first time you release you write zero-to-1.0
[2013-11-24 00:47:03 -0500] robawt: like if you installed both systems and decided alternatives would redo the paths to your executables
[2013-11-24 00:47:06 -0500] chip-: then when 2.0 is ready, you have to write 3 additional programs, and if you're like most shops I have worked for, they're not budgeted
[2013-11-24 00:47:18 -0500] chip-: zero-to-2.0, 1.0-to-2.0, and 2.0-to-1.0
[2013-11-24 00:47:27 -0500] chip-: and in a best case scenario, you never even use one of those!
[2013-11-24 00:47:37 -0500] chip-: So that's 3 additional programs for every release, managing those state transitions.
[2013-11-24 00:48:05 -0500] chip-: So instead, I'd say look at patterns that let you write zero-to-1.0, zero-to-2.0, and then if you need 1.0 machines after 2.0 is up, just spin up new VMs or wipe-and-reimage some 2.0 machines.
[2013-11-24 00:48:19 -0500] chip-: Look for ways to make that pattern cheap enough to work, instead of writing 2 additional state transitions.
[2013-11-24 00:48:21 -0500] codepython777: another question, lets suppose i've a recipe, can i deploy on bare metal?
[2013-11-24 00:48:24 -0500] chip-: You'll be happier. :)
[2013-11-24 00:48:35 -0500] codepython777: if my data store is not on that machine, then i can just move from 1.0/2.0 easily
[2013-11-24 00:48:54 -0500] chip-: Right. Putting your datastore behind an API of some kind is probably part of "making that pattern cheap enough to work"
[2013-11-24 00:48:55 -0500] chip-: :)
[2013-11-24 00:49:17 -0500] codepython777: someone told me this 1.0/2.0 transition was possible using puppet, hence i got curious
[2013-11-24 00:49:23 -0500] chip-: codepython777: Chef can automate bare metal installation via Dell's Crowbar. There's also PXE-dust automation and a ton - I mean a TON - of Chef code for the Openstack community.
[2013-11-24 00:49:41 -0500] chip-: You can totally write 1.0 to 2.0 in Chef or Puppet. But going from 2.0 to 1.0 isn't atomic in either language.
[2013-11-24 00:49:53 -0500] chip-: you don't just remove 2.0 in your puppet config and replace it with 1.0 and magically your machine is 1.0 again
[2013-11-24 00:49:59 -0500] chip-: you have to write the state change.
[2013-11-24 00:50:07 -0500] chip-: Sure it's possible, in Chef or Puppet, it's just expensive.
[2013-11-24 00:50:59 -0500] chip-: codepython777: Generally though, most of what Chef does is handled by an interpreter running in userspace, so it's installed post-bootstrap.
[2013-11-24 00:53:28 -0500] codepython777: i see
[2013-11-24 00:53:41 -0500] codepython777: can i define a machine in chef and deploy it on bare metal easily?
[2013-11-24 00:55:12 -0500] robawt: codepython777: yep that's quite easy
[2013-11-24 00:55:27 -0500] robawt: you can see examples from the learnchef.opscode.com site of that in both the documentation and the web screencasts
[2013-11-24 00:59:14 -0500] chip-: codepython777: Well, wait. Are you talking machine provisioning, or are you talking configuration?
[2013-11-24 00:59:18 -0500] chip-: These are separate actions.
[2013-11-24 00:59:30 -0500] codepython777: chip-: I want to do both
[2013-11-24 01:00:17 -0500] chip-: Chef out-of-the-box is a configuration engine, not a provisioning engine. It doesn't have a PXE server or anything, although you can use it to build PXE servers.
[2013-11-24 01:01:04 -0500] robawt: chip-: but it also supports 'bootstrapping' chef into a system
[2013-11-24 01:01:28 -0500] chip-: Sure, but you still have to have a running userland to bootstrap into.
[2013-11-24 01:01:49 -0500] robawt: just say f' it and run it in the cloud ;)
[2013-11-24 01:02:02 -0500] chip-: Virtualization layers for fun and profit!
[2013-11-24 01:02:09 -0500] codepython777: so i guess it kicks in after an OS is installed
[2013-11-24 01:02:10 -0500] robawt: or configure debconf/kickstart to auto-install chef at end of operation
[2013-11-24 01:02:43 -0500] chip-: Yes, although you CAN use Chef in some frameworks built around it to define a machine config for a node before it ever gets an OS.
[2013-11-24 01:02:57 -0500] chip-: (again, Crowbar || Razor || etc)
[2013-11-24 01:04:09 -0500] robawt: this is the second time i've heard of razor, i should check it out
[2013-11-24 01:04:32 -0500] chip-: It's Puppet's provisioning tool, but it's an open framework so it's easy to deploy things with Chef in Razor.
[2013-11-24 01:05:28 -0500] robawt: much the same as vagrant has been doing with different provisioners?
[2013-11-24 01:05:44 -0500] chip-: EMC initially wrote Razor, and gave it to Puppet Labs as an OSS project to shepherd.
[2013-11-24 01:06:18 -0500] codepython777: Currently I use python to maintain my versioning system. Python commands move machines to newer versions.
[2013-11-24 01:06:29 -0500] chip-: We'll see. Puppet Labs are rewriting Razor, I would bet that the new version makes it a lot harder to install competitors' products. :)
[2013-11-24 01:06:37 -0500] robawt: chip-: haha
[2013-11-24 01:06:39 -0500] chip-: Cool! Python is fun.
[2013-11-24 01:07:38 -0500] codepython777: This is how i do things now, python creates and deploys the machine - then uses mercurial to load code into it, then runs it. At updates, the machines run commands using python - say (apt-get update/upgrade) etc.
[2013-11-24 01:07:57 -0500] codepython777: Any reason i should move to chef/puppet?
[2013-11-24 01:08:21 -0500] codepython777: If i could go back to older states of the hardware, that would be cool. - python doesnt allow me to do that.
[2013-11-24 01:09:04 -0500] robawt: codepython777: yeah use a tool that is designed to do all of that for you for better documentation of the process
[2013-11-24 01:09:21 -0500] chip-: codepython777: You're asking in #chef, so the answer of course is going to be "Yes, you should use Chef!"
[2013-11-24 01:09:26 -0500] robawt: plus security and not to mention the time to onboard someone on your system
[2013-11-24 01:09:28 -0500] chip-: loaded question. :)
[2013-11-24 01:09:36 -0500] codepython777: of course, what are the disadvantages of using python - perfect place to ask
[2013-11-24 01:09:51 -0500] robawt: codepython777: human error is #1
[2013-11-24 01:10:15 -0500] robawt: i'd rather worth with a bigger project with many eyes and brains than roll my own and find the same elementary problems they've already solved
[2013-11-24 01:10:18 -0500] chip-: From a programmer's POV, Chef is a set of base primitives, along with the sugar necessary to easily build similar primitives, oriented around system configuration and administration tasks.
[2013-11-24 01:10:31 -0500] chip-: So, the real place to start I would argue is Mark Burgess' paper on Promise Theory.
[2013-11-24 01:11:14 -0500] chip-: But the Chef primitive set is designed to make it easy to write well-formed, idempotent code, such that you can run the program 1 time or 100 times, and get the same result (the code is idempotent).
[2013-11-24 01:11:51 -0500] chip-: So if I write a program that installs, configures, and then starts Apache, and I run that on a machine that's new, it will (install->configure->start Apache)
[2013-11-24 01:12:00 -0500] chip-: and if I run it again, it'll no-op, because that's already happened
[2013-11-24 01:12:23 -0500] chip-: but if friendly junior sysadmin comes in and mucks the Apache config, then the next time the code runs, it'll revert that config back to the state declared in my Chef codebase
[2013-11-24 01:13:07 -0500] chip-: upshot: If I daemonize Chef, and have that code run on a scheduled interval, then over time my machine configs will tend toward correctness instead of entropy.
[2013-11-24 01:13:36 -0500] chip-: Bonus: Chef is designed so that each part of your config can be layered on. Layer on the ntp settings, then layer on the sshd settings, then layer on DNS resolvers, etc.
[2013-11-24 01:13:57 -0500] chip-: Centralize that config, and you have code that ensures the DNS resolvers for all machines in a datacenter will always be correct.
[2013-11-24 01:14:01 -0500] chip-: and so on.
[2013-11-24 01:15:16 -0500] chip-: Also also: Chef is not a central-observer system. Chef-server is a datastore, but it takes no action. Clients connect, and either download or upload data or code, or search that data, but that's all that happens (mostly). Each client is an independent actor responsible for configuring a single object, usually a host/node in your infrastructure.
[2013-11-24 01:15:41 -0500] chip-: So you upload to the Chef server "This is what a webserver looks like, this is the code to make the webserver happen, node 42 is a webserver."
[2013-11-24 01:16:01 -0500] chip-: When Chef-client runs on node42, it will pull down data, see that it's a webserver, then download the necessary code, and configure itself.
[2013-11-24 01:16:18 -0500] chip-: But you never push the button that says "made node42 a webserver." Node42 handles it for you.
[2013-11-24 01:16:23 -0500] chip-: In short: Scales like a mofo.
[2013-11-24 01:16:35 -0500] chip-: </spam>
[2013-11-24 01:17:32 -0500] robawt: chip-: really well done
[2013-11-24 01:17:38 -0500] chip-: I do this a lot. :)
[2013-11-24 01:17:43 -0500] robawt: i kept wanting to say "no but"
[2013-11-24 01:17:58 -0500] robawt: then read until the end and go "waaay better than how I would've said it"
[2013-11-24 01:19:33 -0500] chip-: Friendly Junior Sysadmin is my personal chaos gorilla :)
[2013-11-24 01:20:58 -0500] chip-: Oh, last awesome thing: When a client configures a node successfully, it will send a full system inventory back to the Chef server. So you wind up with a self-reported CMDB for all the infrastructure managed by your Chef server. :)
[2013-11-24 01:21:15 -0500] chip-: * Lies, this is nowhere near the last awesome thing
[2013-11-24 01:21:29 -0500] robawt: chip-: is that from ohai or from the chef client run itself?
[2013-11-24 01:21:35 -0500] chip-: both.
[2013-11-24 01:21:58 -0500] chip-: When you start chef-client, and it says "starting chef-client run" and then nothing happens for about 2 seconds, ohai is running under the hood.
[2013-11-24 01:22:29 -0500] chip-: That data gets merged with the run_list and any human-generated attributes from the node saved on the chef server.
[2013-11-24 01:22:51 -0500] chip-: (Don't human-generate attributes on your nodes. It's a bad plan. But if you do, that's what happens.)
[2013-11-24 01:24:18 -0500] robawt: interesting
[2013-11-24 01:24:30 -0500] robawt: salt has a whole series of human identified attributes called 'grains'
[2013-11-24 01:25:49 -0500] chip-: It's totally appropriate to set those attributes, just use a metadata object (cookbook, role, environment) instead of editing a node and setting something directly on it.
[2013-11-24 01:25:52 -0500] chip-: Otherwise you make snowflakes.
[2013-11-24 01:27:23 -0500] robawt: wow
[2013-11-24 01:27:28 -0500] robawt: metasnowflakes
[2013-11-24 01:27:32 -0500] robawt: that explains a lot
[2013-11-24 01:28:38 -0500] chip-: It's like defining a class instead of an instance of that class, right? All webservers must... instead of This Webserver Must...
[2013-11-24 01:28:49 -0500] chip-: and then you can say Webserver Type A Must...
[2013-11-24 01:29:09 -0500] chip-: Keeps you from doing anything in a non-repeatable way, so if you blow out a server then you can just make a new one.
[2013-11-24 01:35:17 -0500] robawt: the learnchef site is good
[2013-11-24 01:35:24 -0500] robawt: does anyone have any favorite books?
[2013-11-24 02:03:08 -0500] juliancdunn: robawt: the TDD one from Stephen Nelson-Smith is good
[2013-11-24 03:37:58 -0500] robawt: who do i contact about a chef tshirt?
[2013-11-24 05:12:55 -0500] holms: is centos supported by chef-solo?
[2013-11-24 05:18:24 -0500] robawt: holms: there's a package for it
[2013-11-24 05:18:27 -0500] robawt: so i would assume so
[2013-11-24 05:19:07 -0500] holms: knife-solo actually should prepare vm
[2013-11-24 05:19:13 -0500] holms: which probably does same as chef-solo
[2013-11-24 05:19:20 -0500] holms: it's installing somekind of rpm package
[2013-11-24 05:19:25 -0500] holms: and in /opt/ it's empt
[2013-11-24 05:19:41 -0500] holms: i don't even know where to start from, probably will wipe vm, try again, then install it manually
[2013-11-24 05:19:59 -0500] robawt: holms: are you using the installer?
[2013-11-24 05:21:15 -0500] holms: http://pastie.org/8504567
[2013-11-24 05:32:28 -0500] holms: k found a problem
[2013-11-24 05:36:13 -0500] robawt: holms: just looked at the pastebin
[2013-11-24 05:36:33 -0500] robawt: it said it was already installed at the bottom, shouldn't it have been installed by the boostrap?
[2013-11-24 05:38:40 -0500] holms: i've found a problem and it's rather strange
[2013-11-24 05:38:47 -0500] holms: first of all my berksfile was empty
[2013-11-24 05:39:05 -0500] holms: so first time it's actually complained that now cookbook found which i've asked to install
[2013-11-24 05:39:24 -0500] holms: but the second time, when i tried to "cook" machine, it said that chef-client not found :)
[2013-11-24 05:39:31 -0500] holms: and it's actually repeatable situation
[2013-11-24 05:39:47 -0500] holms: after i've wiped out vm, and added cookbook to berksfile, everything went smooth
[2013-11-24 05:41:49 -0500] robawt: weird
[2013-11-24 05:42:05 -0500] robawt: glad you were able to see somewhat of the cause
[2013-11-24 05:43:52 -0500] holms: i'll first report to knife-solo author, if he able to reproduce it maybe we can open a ticket regardin chef-solo
[2013-11-24 06:23:20 -0500] holms: No such file or directory - chef-server-ctl reconfigure
[2013-11-24 06:23:21 -0500] holms: =(
[2013-11-24 07:24:25 -0500] holms: on which ports chef runs?
[2013-11-24 07:24:28 -0500] holms: is it only 443?
[2013-11-24 07:26:04 -0500] holms: chef-server*

[2013-11-24 10:35:07 -0500] pradeep: anybody there.?
[2013-11-24 10:36:49 -0500] Zauberfisch23: hmmm, I had this error once
[2013-11-24 10:36:55 -0500] Zauberfisch23: if I just could recall what the problem was
[2013-11-24 10:38:42 -0500] pradeep: sounds great @Zauberfisch23 how you have fixed that.?
[2013-11-24 10:40:04 -0500] Zauberfisch23: thats the problem, I can't recall what was going on and I can't recall how I fixed it
[2013-11-24 10:40:11 -0500] Zauberfisch23: but I think I was doing something wrong
[2013-11-24 10:40:16 -0500] Zauberfisch23: also, it was not on EC2
[2013-11-24 10:40:24 -0500] Zauberfisch23: was on a mac
[2013-11-24 10:41:38 -0500] Zauberfisch23: things I am finding on the internet on that topic:
[2013-11-24 10:41:50 -0500] Zauberfisch23: make sure the env var HOME is set
[2013-11-24 10:41:59 -0500] Zauberfisch23: make sure you have the correct ruby version
[2013-11-24 10:43:32 -0500] Zauberfisch23: but no sorry, I can't recall what I was doing wrong
[2013-11-24 10:47:19 -0500] pradeep: I can able to install the cookbooks from site and i can upload them to the chef server, but what i wanted develop my own cookbook i am stuck any other help.?
[2013-11-24 10:47:31 -0500] pradeep: my ruby version is : ruby 1.9.3p448 (2013-06-27 revision 41675) [x86_64-linux]
[2013-11-24 14:20:36 -0500] sgtpepper: morning guys... quick question here, I'm trying to retrieve some values from a databag in an execute/command from recipe, but I'm having trouble nailing the syntax
[2013-11-24 14:21:27 -0500] sgtpepper: I'm using command "/usr/bin/runme --value key['value']"
[2013-11-24 14:21:36 -0500] sgtpepper: and value was loaded with data_bag_item
[2013-11-24 14:21:52 -0500] sgtpepper: sorry, key was initialized using data_bag_item
[2013-11-24 14:22:15 -0500] sgtpepper: I cannot seem to find any documentation on it, or maybe I'm not using the databag in the right way
[2013-11-24 14:28:37 -0500] gyre007: sgtpepper: why are you loading that value in an execute resource ?
[2013-11-24 14:28:40 -0500] gyre007: just curious
[2013-11-24 14:29:05 -0500] gyre007: normally you'd load the item in the recipe during compile time and use the value inside the resource for the convergence...
[2013-11-24 15:57:34 -0500] sgtpepper: gyre007, not sure if I understand you
[2013-11-24 16:11:46 -0500] sgtpepper: gyre007, should I just hardcode the key in the recipe... doesn't sound right
[2013-11-24 16:12:15 -0500] gyre007: sgtpepper: sorry went a way for a bit...can you give us a gist or code sample ?
[2013-11-24 16:18:16 -0500] sgtpepper: gyre007, sure
[2013-11-24 16:18:24 -0500] sgtpepper: let me put in pastebin
[2013-11-24 16:20:42 -0500] sgtpepper: gyre007, http://pastebin.com/DhQRVbfy
[2013-11-24 16:20:56 -0500] sgtpepper: am I using it right? (besides the fact that is not encrypted)
[2013-11-24 16:22:19 -0500] gyre007: sgtpepper: looks correct...what's wroing with this again ?
[2013-11-24 16:23:34 -0500] sgtpepper: well I think its taking the variables as literal
[2013-11-24 16:24:03 -0500] gyre007: oh yeah
[2013-11-24 16:24:06 -0500] gyre007: quotes...
[2013-11-24 16:24:11 -0500] gyre007: try this...
[2013-11-24 16:24:12 -0500] gyre007: sec
[2013-11-24 16:25:02 -0500] sgtpepper: gyre007, wait... got it... I think I was screwing a variable name
[2013-11-24 16:25:08 -0500] sgtpepper: yup
[2013-11-24 16:25:11 -0500] sgtpepper: it worked now
[2013-11-24 16:25:15 -0500] gyre007: cool :)
[2013-11-24 16:25:18 -0500] gyre007: good stuff
[2013-11-24 16:26:43 -0500] sgtpepper: yup.. silly me
[2013-11-24 16:27:06 -0500] sgtpepper: ok... first recipe, not bad :D
[2013-11-24 17:03:42 -0500] rhys: Does anyone know how i can access attributes for a non local node? An example, a backup server needs to lookup every node that has the 'backupclient' cookbook applied so it can automatically create sandboxes for them.
[2013-11-24 17:11:53 -0500] gyre007: rhys: chef server has REST API....you can run search against it
[2013-11-24 17:12:09 -0500] gyre007: there is a ridley client library afaik which can help you out...
[2013-11-24 17:12:28 -0500] rhys: Can i do that within a cookbook?
[2013-11-24 17:13:22 -0500] gyre007: rhys: you can run search in any recipe
[2013-11-24 17:13:31 -0500] gyre007: thats core chef functionality
[2013-11-24 17:14:25 -0500] rhys: So this is an accepted pattern, of have cookbooks run based on knowledge the chef server has on other parts of years your infrastructure?
[2013-11-24 17:16:29 -0500] rhys: Ridley looks useful to do these things externally. Cool.
[2013-11-24 17:21:43 -0500] rhys: This is odd to me, as in puppet one node accessing another nodes data is very complicated to do
[2013-11-24 18:15:33 -0500] gyre007: any Cheffers could explain to me why can't I do this ? https://gist.github.com/milosgajdos83/7630339
[2013-11-24 18:22:51 -0500] gyre007: looks like not_if Chef::Config is totally ignored...
[2013-11-24 18:27:08 -0500] rana_: Hi guys how to fix this error:  knife cookbook create working_with_git ERROR: TypeError: can't convert nil into String.??
[2013-11-24 18:34:17 -0500] cwj: gyre007: try not_if { Chef::Config[:solo] }
[2013-11-24 18:35:35 -0500] cwj: rana_: can you please pastebin/gist the full stack trace
[2013-11-24 18:36:34 -0500] gyre007: cwj:  that's what im doing ?
[2013-11-24 18:36:40 -0500] gyre007: ah
[2013-11-24 18:36:44 -0500] cwj: gyre007: no its not :)
[2013-11-24 18:36:47 -0500] gyre007: https://gist.github.com/milosgajdos83/7630339
[2013-11-24 18:36:53 -0500] gyre007: sent this earlier,...
[2013-11-24 18:37:00 -0500] cwj: gyre007: note the { }
[2013-11-24 18:37:06 -0500] gyre007: yeah I tried that
[2013-11-24 18:37:09 -0500] gyre007: also I tried do end
[2013-11-24 18:37:17 -0500] gyre007: and I also tried ::Chef::Config
[2013-11-24 18:37:19 -0500] gyre007: all fail
[2013-11-24 18:37:45 -0500] gregkare: gyre007: https://gist.github.com/milosgajdos83/7630339#comment-957151
[2013-11-24 18:38:08 -0500] gregkare: You can also use "if !Chef::Config[:solo]
[2013-11-24 18:38:10 -0500] gyre007: gregkare: yeah I ended up doing the same thing
[2013-11-24 18:38:18 -0500] gyre007: totally the same
[2013-11-24 18:38:20 -0500] gregkare: if you're confused by "unless" :)
[2013-11-24 18:38:33 -0500] gyre007: but you should be able to control this from within the resources via guards
[2013-11-24 18:39:23 -0500] gregkare: Guards are meant to be executed on the node
[2013-11-24 18:39:34 -0500] cwj: while you may have tried it already, putting code in a block (e.g. curly braces) is important when you want chef to interpret ruby in a guard http://docs.opscode.com/resource_common.html#not-if-examples
[2013-11-24 18:40:26 -0500] gyre007: cwj: like I said I tried {} and end do
[2013-11-24 18:40:37 -0500] gregkare: In your case you just want to exclude this resource when you're running Chef solo, you shouldn't use a guard
[2013-11-24 18:41:15 -0500] gyre007: yeah I was thinking the same...and it kind of makes sense...though I still believe this is probably a bug ?
[2013-11-24 18:42:58 -0500] cwj: gyre007: yep, i read what you said. im just trying to point out that if Chef::Config[:solo] were available to use inside a guard, i believe you would need it to be in the block
[2013-11-24 18:43:27 -0500] gyre007: yup...agreed
[2013-11-24 22:24:37 -0500] vito1988: In the solo.rb it allows you to specify list of cookbook dirs, if you have conflicting version of a recipe in these dirs what happens?
