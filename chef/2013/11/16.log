[2013-11-16 00:12:15 -0500] coderanger: timsmith1: I don't see why you couldn't, all it depends on is dynamic linking to libc
[2013-11-16 00:13:03 -0500] timsmith1: I image systems in a chroot environment from a livecd via PXE and then I reboot and bootstrap via SSH.  It would be really great to kill the bootstrap step
[2013-11-16 00:13:10 -0500] timsmith1: I guess I'll just have to give it a try
[2013-11-16 00:30:26 -0500] stormerider: what's the best way to generate a key/value hash in ruby that i can iterate on? ive got a bunch of gems that i'm installing a specific version of, and i want to define gemname/version in the hash so i can just loop over it instead of doing 52 different gem_package calls
[2013-11-16 00:30:49 -0500] dgarstang3: only took... 3 hours... http://pastebin.com/4AtacEuN :)
[2013-11-16 00:31:51 -0500] nathenharvey: dgarstang3: freaking awesome!  and I'll bet you learned a lot in the process
[2013-11-16 00:32:19 -0500] nathenharvey: would love to see a blog post or pr for the docs.  even some suggestions to docs@opscode.com would be appreciated
[2013-11-16 00:32:29 -0500] dgarstang3: nathenharvey: Yes. more questions still remain though... like that whole string literal thing magically producing output
[2013-11-16 00:32:32 -0500] nathenharvey: dgarstang3: way to go!
[2013-11-16 00:34:01 -0500] nathenharvey: dgarstang3: I'm sure I don't know what you mean there
[2013-11-16 00:34:16 -0500] dgarstang3: nathenharvey: line 11.
[2013-11-16 00:35:04 -0500] nathenharvey: dgarstang3: right.  you say your plugin 'provides "pvdisks"' on line 2
[2013-11-16 00:35:34 -0500] dgarstang3: nathenharvey: that's the magic fu?
[2013-11-16 00:35:35 -0500] nathenharvey: so it's looking for pvdisks as the key and the value to return (disks) in your case.
[2013-11-16 00:35:59 -0500] dgarstang3: nathenharvey: would that work in native ruby?
[2013-11-16 00:36:00 -0500] nathenharvey: change "pvdisks" to "foo" on 11 and I'll bet it'll break
[2013-11-16 00:39:50 -0500] nathenharvey: you're writing ruby in the context of ohai or an ohai plugin so there's definitely some extra magic going on.
[2013-11-16 00:39:57 -0500] nathenharvey: like the "provides" line
[2013-11-16 00:40:04 -0500] nathenharvey: and line 11
[2013-11-16 00:40:08 -0500] dgarstang3: nathenharvey: Tht's sort what I thought.
[2013-11-16 00:40:31 -0500] dgarstang3: nathenharvey: so, the docs are wrong. it's not ruby.
[2013-11-16 00:40:46 -0500] nathenharvey: dgarstang3: it's ruby alright
[2013-11-16 00:41:46 -0500] nathenharvey: dgarstang3: with some implementation details / syntactic sugar that's not directly exposed to you as you're writing the ohai plugin.  just like recipes are just ruby
[2013-11-16 00:42:03 -0500] nathenharvey: there's a nice DSL (domain specific language) provided
[2013-11-16 00:42:47 -0500] dgarstang3: time for new issues. :)
[2013-11-16 00:42:49 -0500] nathenharvey: dgarstang3: I'll watch for your pull request on docs
[2013-11-16 00:43:46 -0500] dgarstang3: I'm in the bc-lvm cookbook and a "remote_directory "/etc/chef/ohai_plugins" do' is trying to pull from the ohai cookbook
[2013-11-16 00:45:51 -0500] dgarstang3: makes no sense... http://pastebin.com/0C1uK0KJ
[2013-11-16 00:46:23 -0500] dgarstang3: 'cookbook ohai' ... I'm not in the ohai cookbook.
[2013-11-16 00:48:02 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: at a guess, you've got recipe[ohai] on your run list - it also declares remote_directory['/etc/chef/ohai_plugins'], so you can end up with weird stuff happening
[2013-11-16 00:48:37 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: that being the case, if you seet the attributes in bc-lvm like so, the ohai::default recipe will take care of copying it for you (and loading it for the run) - https://github.com/zts/cookbook-ohai-aws/blob/master/attributes/default.rb
[2013-11-16 00:48:41 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: Oh. Ok then. I guess I'll have to put the plugin there with a file instead
[2013-11-16 00:49:13 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: in that attributes file I've linked, you'd need to change "ohai-aws" on line 3 to "bc-lvm"
[2013-11-16 00:49:56 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: oh, sorry.  That also assumes that your plugin file is in "files/ohai_plugins/<something>"
[2013-11-16 00:49:58 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: bit lost...
[2013-11-16 00:50:49 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: okay, that's fair - let me step through it.  If you're using the ohai cookbook, it looks for an attribute called node["ohai"]["plugins"]
[2013-11-16 00:51:03 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: yep, I see that.
[2013-11-16 00:51:13 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: that attribute is a hash, and each key is the name of a cookbook
[2013-11-16 00:51:14 -0500] dgarstang3: 'defaults to the files/default/plugins' ... where?
[2013-11-16 00:51:42 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: the value is the name of a files directory in the cookbook, that contains ohai plugins
[2013-11-16 00:51:59 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: in the bc-lvm cookbook?
[2013-11-16 00:52:29 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: yup.  So referring to the default.rb I've posted, it mentions "ohai_plugins", which is this directory here: https://github.com/zts/cookbook-ohai-aws/tree/master/files/default/ohai_plugins
[2013-11-16 00:52:54 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: does it matter than ohai comes first in the run list?
[2013-11-16 00:53:53 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: if you're setting the attribute in your cookbook attributes file, it won't matter - that's because all the attributes files will be loaded before the first recipe is loaded
[2013-11-16 00:54:05 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: kk. processing...
[2013-11-16 00:55:45 -0500] dgarstang3: oh dear
[2013-11-16 00:56:04 -0500] zts: no joy?
[2013-11-16 00:56:11 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: http://pastebin.com/Hdg0uTuS
[2013-11-16 00:56:39 -0500] dgarstang3: popped default['ohai']['plugins'] = 'files/default//etc/chef/ohai_plugins' in bc-lvm's attributes. Override?
[2013-11-16 00:57:11 -0500] dgarstang3: nope, that didn't help
[2013-11-16 00:57:22 -0500] zts: ah, not quite right - change that to:  default['ohai']['plugins']['bc-lvm'] = "etc/chef/ohai_plugins"
[2013-11-16 00:58:37 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: hang on, you said that node['ohai']['plugins'] is a hash, but the docs says it's a string
[2013-11-16 01:00:00 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: hm, which docs?  node['ohai']['plugin_path'] is a string, but ['plugins'] is definitely a hash
[2013-11-16 01:00:25 -0500] dgarstang3: here? https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/ohai
[2013-11-16 01:01:19 -0500] dgarstang3: this so confusing. should this be an attribute in each cookbook or set globally in a role?
[2013-11-16 01:01:38 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: I reckon I'd agree that could be more clear - the important sentence is this one: "You can add additional cookbooks by adding the name of the cookbook as a key and the path of the files directory as the value."
[2013-11-16 01:02:02 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: compare it to line 29 here: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/ohai/blob/master/attributes/default.rb
[2013-11-16 01:02:14 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: well, then, override['ohai']['plugins'] = 'files/default/etc/chef/ohai_plugins' should work...
[2013-11-16 01:03:09 -0500] dgarstang3: well, i changed to override['ohai']['plugins']['bc-lvm'] = 'files/default/etc/chef/ohai_plugins' and got a different each, but at least it looks like it's trying harder...
[2013-11-16 01:04:33 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: how about http://pastebin.com/kFhLK6vs ? Line #50. Yes It does...
[2013-11-16 01:05:53 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: getting closer.  Think back to the remote_directory you tried first - what did you put as the "source"?
[2013-11-16 01:05:56 -0500] dgarstang3: so, progress, sort of...
[2013-11-16 01:06:14 -0500] dgarstang3: if I remove the leading / ... ie override['ohai']['plugins']['bc-lvm'] = 'etc/chef/ohai_plugins'
[2013-11-16 01:06:24 -0500] dgarstang3: == 'could not find recipe plugins for cookbook bc-lvm'
[2013-11-16 01:06:33 -0500] dgarstang3: oops that's my error. :)
[2013-11-16 01:07:04 -0500] dgarstang3: ok, ran without errors
[2013-11-16 01:07:18 -0500] zts: cool!  But did it deposit your file in the right place? :)
[2013-11-16 01:07:23 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: so, if we look at the doc page, and what I have, they aren't the same...
[2013-11-16 01:08:18 -0500] dgarstang3: yep, it's there
[2013-11-16 01:08:43 -0500] dgarstang3: This is where so much frustration comes from. to get from what the docs say, to what actuall works requires help from someone else.
[2013-11-16 01:09:12 -0500] dgarstang3: The docs don't say that ohai_plugins MUST be a hash to work
[2013-11-16 01:09:27 -0500] zts: I think I'd probably argue that the description of node['ohai']['plugins'] is correct, but also unhelpful - I'm just trying to think of how I'd rewrite it to be clearer
[2013-11-16 01:09:46 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: how about it MUST be a hash, where the key is the name of the cookbook?
[2013-11-16 01:10:38 -0500] zts: Yup, I think it would benefit from a description that spells out that it's a hash - and then perhaps literally includes what's in the ohai cookbook's attributes/default.rb and explains what it means
[2013-11-16 01:10:49 -0500] dgarstang3: totally.
[2013-11-16 01:11:12 -0500] dgarstang3: thanks for your help though. Never would have gotten it to work otherwise.
[2013-11-16 01:12:33 -0500] zts: No problem, it'd be great if you could open a ticket on that cookbook with your thoughts about improving the docs - I can have a go, but if you can explain what would've made sense to you (now that you've just got to that point), that usually makes the best docs
[2013-11-16 01:13:12 -0500] zts: also, I can point out another tip which is in that doc, but I didn't really pay attention to when I first used it
[2013-11-16 01:13:30 -0500] dgarstang3: oh?
[2013-11-16 01:14:08 -0500] zts: Note the bit about the plugin being loaded twice, and "Ohai::Config[:plugin_path]" being set
[2013-11-16 01:14:40 -0500] dgarstang3: wow, and the ohai plugin data was there on the first run too
[2013-11-16 01:15:10 -0500] zts: By default, that Ohai::Config thing wasn't in my /etc/chef/solo.rb (not sure if client.rb is different).  That means that your custom ohai plugin isn't loaded the first time that Chef runs ohai
[2013-11-16 01:15:24 -0500] dgarstang3: oh, it just was...
[2013-11-16 01:15:51 -0500] zts: what I found was that why-run mode doesn't load the custom ohai plugins
[2013-11-16 01:16:11 -0500] dgarstang3: lost again. :)
[2013-11-16 01:16:14 -0500] zts: so if I tried to use "chef-solo -W", it would blow up when a recipe needed attributes that my custom plugin provided
[2013-11-16 01:16:34 -0500] zts: if you never use why-run mode, you have nothing to worry about :)
[2013-11-16 01:16:40 -0500] dgarstang3: some dude got me to put ohai = Ohai::System.new ohai.all_plugins followed by an ohai reload  in there...
[2013-11-16 01:17:56 -0500] zts: in your recipe?  You may not need that (the ohai::default recipe should do something similar)
[2013-11-16 01:18:11 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: it's all a blur. I did at some point.
[2013-11-16 01:18:26 -0500] dgarstang3: i've had issues with ohai and gce too
[2013-11-16 01:18:41 -0500] zts: I know the feeling - shouldn't hurt, beyond maybe taking some extra time to re-run ohai
[2013-11-16 01:25:58 -0500] dgarstang3: what about... accessing ohai data from within an ohai plugin...? :)
[2013-11-16 01:27:38 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: here's an example of doing just that - https://github.com/zts/cookbook-ohai-aws/blob/master/files/default/ohai_plugins/aws.rb#L6-L7
[2013-11-16 01:28:09 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: you rock!
[2013-11-16 01:31:35 -0500] dgarstang3: oh noes. no gce.... but....
[2013-11-16 01:37:42 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: how about checking keys at the root?
[2013-11-16 01:39:01 -0500] zts: dgarstang3: hm, what's an example?
[2013-11-16 01:39:13 -0500] dgarstang3: virtualisation...
[2013-11-16 01:39:34 -0500] dgarstang3: it's under the top level... i can check ec2 and gce keys with ec2['foo'] but when there's no root var...
[2013-11-16 01:40:04 -0500] dgarstang3: stdout?
[2013-11-16 01:40:59 -0500] dgarstang3: nope
[2013-11-16 01:41:28 -0500] zts: Well, in the case of ec2, inside my recipe the attribute I needed was node['ec2'][':placement_availability_zone']
[2013-11-16 01:41:35 -0500] zts: typo
[2013-11-16 01:41:42 -0500] dgarstang3: hm. I was able to use ec2['foo']
[2013-11-16 01:41:48 -0500] dgarstang3: but this is in the plugin...
[2013-11-16 01:42:17 -0500] zts: Well, in the case of ec2, inside my recipe the attribute I needed was node['ec2']['placement_availability_zone'] - I guessed that in my ohai pluginI would need to require_plugin 'ec2', and then I would call the attribute ec2['placement_availability_zone']
[2013-11-16 01:42:43 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: right, but if you run ohai, there's quite a few keys that are at a level above ec2.
[2013-11-16 01:42:45 -0500] zts: note that require_plugin 'foo' gives you an object called foo, which maps to node['foo'] inside chef
[2013-11-16 01:42:46 -0500] dgarstang3: I need to inspect those
[2013-11-16 01:43:01 -0500] zts: above, or alongside?
[2013-11-16 01:43:11 -0500] dgarstang3: along side i guess
[2013-11-16 01:43:12 -0500] zts: above node['ec2'] is just node, isn't it?
[2013-11-16 01:43:17 -0500] dgarstang3: in a plugin?
[2013-11-16 01:44:03 -0500] zts: let's map my example to your one - I was looking for an attribute in chef called node['ec2']['placement_availability_zone'], what's one specific attribute you need from 'virtualisation' ?
[2013-11-16 01:44:39 -0500] dgarstang3: i'm trying to put this mess into a plugin... http://pastebin.com/K0as7EzS
[2013-11-16 01:44:59 -0500] dgarstang3: ie a plugin that returns the instance type across ec2, gce and vagrant.
[2013-11-16 01:45:57 -0500] dgarstang3: virtualization is a top level key in ohai
[2013-11-16 01:46:13 -0500] dgarstang3: dontknowwhattoput.exists?('virtualization')
[2013-11-16 01:47:06 -0500] zts: just making sure I understand - that pastebin, is that currently in a recipe?  What is the data variable set to?  (looks like it might be the same as node?)
[2013-11-16 01:47:19 -0500] dgarstang3: Yep, in a recipe currently.
[2013-11-16 01:47:35 -0500] dgarstang3: data ... loaded one line prior... data = ohai.data
[2013-11-16 01:48:53 -0500] dgarstang3: pretty amazing that logic was required to get it to work, but anwho
[2013-11-16 01:49:26 -0500] zts: okay, looking at that I'd imagine you could replace "data" with "node" on lines 1, 3, 4, and 6.  Does it work if you do?
[2013-11-16 01:50:01 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: but... I'm trying to get rid of this... and put the entire thing into a plugin that returns the instance type
[2013-11-16 01:51:18 -0500] dgarstang3: hm here https://github.com/albertsj1/ohai-plugins/blob/master/vserver.rb he doesn't even check if the virtualization key exists first. Sloppy
[2013-11-16 01:51:23 -0500] zts: yup, understood - I just want to make sure that we're on the same page.  Maybe things in your example don't work the way I'd expect, in which case I could end up giving you bad advice
[2013-11-16 01:51:24 -0500] dgarstang3: maybe I should just do the same
[2013-11-16 01:55:50 -0500] dgarstang3: how would you check a value at the top of the tree in ohai in a plugin? :)
[2013-11-16 01:55:55 -0500] zts: yeah, your code doesn't need to be quite as defensive as you're being in your pastebin at the moment.  Personally, I check just enough to make sure my code does the right thing - of course, it doesn't hurt if you check more
[2013-11-16 01:57:47 -0500] zts: Well, I see on line 6 of your pastebin you're looking at an 'ec2' attribute.  Fortunately, the example from my code also was looking at an 'ec2' attribute.  What do you think you'll need to add to your ohai plugin to make ec2['instance_type'] work?
[2013-11-16 01:58:48 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: sure, for ec2, but not for gce.
[2013-11-16 02:00:27 -0500] zts: okay, so what's an example of a gce attribute you're using in your recipe?  (I'm not seeing it in your pastebin?)
[2013-11-16 02:01:27 -0500] dgarstang3: zts: first pass... http://pastebin.com/WaLj6piJ
[2013-11-16 02:03:16 -0500] zts: looking good!
[2013-11-16 02:03:37 -0500] zts: although typo on line 1
[2013-11-16 02:03:46 -0500] dgarstang3: oh yah, thanks
[2013-11-16 03:53:21 -0500] dgarstang3: I've got a variable, pvdisks, which is outputting ["/dev/sdb", "/dev/sdc"] with debug. However, I think it's being treated as a string later... possible?

[2013-11-16 06:39:22 -0500] thun_: http://pastebin.com/FSQQLALe
[2013-11-16 06:40:11 -0500] thun_: from attributes/default.rb (inside of my cookbook not percona's)
[2013-11-16 06:40:13 -0500] thun_: http://pastebin.com/t7p8fkb7
[2013-11-16 06:40:21 -0500] thun_: Was trying different methods
[2013-11-16 06:40:36 -0500] adnichols: makes sense
[2013-11-16 06:41:18 -0500] adnichols: all their attributes are namespaced under node["percona"] so you need to be changing values there
[2013-11-16 06:42:20 -0500] adnichols: so in your recipe, for example - it should be node.override["percona"]["server"]["server_id"] = 10
[2013-11-16 06:43:00 -0500] adnichols: similarly in your default.rb you should s/percona-install/percona/
[2013-11-16 06:44:07 -0500] thun_: In default I did have it as perona
[2013-11-16 06:44:11 -0500] thun_: was trying percona install
[2013-11-16 06:44:23 -0500] adnichols: ok, well percona is correct
[2013-11-16 06:44:28 -0500] thun_: in default.rb I list as node[percona][blah][blah]
[2013-11-16 06:44:37 -0500] thun_: or default[percona][blah][balh]
[2013-11-16 06:45:36 -0500] adnichols: right - so the problem w/ specifying defaults in your wrapper cookbook is that they have basically the same precidence as the percona cookbook and so when they merge I suspect there are cases where your values may not get used
[2013-11-16 06:45:54 -0500] adnichols: I generally go w/ overrides for that reason so I'm sure my values will be used
[2013-11-16 06:46:56 -0500] thun_: Ok also another weird thing is the server was installed with almost no defaults
[2013-11-16 06:47:03 -0500] thun_: not even the percona ones
[2013-11-16 06:47:16 -0500] thun_: says bin-lon is on by default and slow query log
[2013-11-16 06:47:21 -0500] thun_: both are off on default install
[2013-11-16 06:47:50 -0500] adnichols: hmm.. you have the percona cookbook listed as a depend in your metadata.rb for your wrapper cookbook?
[2013-11-16 06:48:16 -0500] thun_: Yep
[2013-11-16 06:49:06 -0500] adnichols: not sure why the normal defaults wouldn't apply w/out looking at the cookbook more - I don't use the percona cookbook myself
[2013-11-16 06:52:46 -0500] thun_: I feel like just dropping a cookbook file with my.cnf and reload percona
[2013-11-16 06:53:20 -0500] adnichols: :) and I wouldn't blame you
[2013-11-16 09:48:41 -0500] slicknick: got my ingredients all prepped- php via apache serving ecomm & cms gets pulled from git as ordered by jenkins. right now slaves bash the bin: softlinks, re-confs, dbinserts, tar, push to web servers .. seeking some suggestions/comments/tangents for leveraging chef not to continually whip this up, but as demanded and called to order
[2013-11-16 09:54:19 -0500] jameson__:  use cookbook to deploy all the things?
[2013-11-16 09:56:52 -0500] slicknick: unfortunately i have to go this (git > jenkins > chef) route for the time being
[2013-11-16 10:00:37 -0500] spheromak: slicknick: that is the route i use
[2013-11-16 10:00:43 -0500] spheromak: there is no silver bullet.
[2013-11-16 10:01:27 -0500] spheromak: single cook per node if you want to deploy across infras with sanity. (by solving deps and pushing a cook+deps through a pipeline)
[2013-11-16 10:01:44 -0500] spheromak: berks 3.0 is supposed to help a bit with the api server that they are introducing
[2013-11-16 10:01:48 -0500] slicknick: more pointed -- whats best for smashin bash  after jenkins/slaves dirty hands get in there
[2013-11-16 10:02:03 -0500] slicknick: mmk k
[2013-11-16 10:02:55 -0500] spheromak: my setup is  git->jenk (PR) quick tests -> Merge Master -> Full tests (kichen/vagabond) -> Version(edit metadata and tags) -> push tags/version back onto master -> deploy cook + deps to "cookbook" server
[2013-11-16 10:03:30 -0500] spheromak: have sepparate job for "prototing" a cook into other envs/servers
[2013-11-16 10:03:46 -0500] spheromak: *promoting
[2013-11-16 10:04:24 -0500] spheromak: slicknick: not sure what yer askin
[2013-11-16 10:05:47 -0500] slicknick: right right, definitely understand theres no one way. our own tools aprons are diverse and the kitchens unique; digressed
[2013-11-16 10:05:59 -0500] spheromak: no worries
[2013-11-16 10:06:04 -0500] slicknick: i see a discussion
[2013-11-16 10:06:08 -0500] slicknick: exactly this
[2013-11-16 10:06:16 -0500] spheromak: theres just no "cook plugin"  ;P
[2013-11-16 10:06:19 -0500] slicknick: thanks for the responses
[2013-11-16 10:06:20 -0500] spheromak: ive thought about it
[2013-11-16 10:06:35 -0500] spheromak: I don't have much of my workflow up on github (yet)
[2013-11-16 10:06:51 -0500] slicknick: havin my first go at all this, i feel the need to disclose
[2013-11-16 10:06:53 -0500] spheromak: @  the summit this week there were only a few of us with a working workflow at all
[2013-11-16 10:06:58 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-11-16 10:07:05 -0500] spheromak: it took me a bit to work things out
[2013-11-16 10:11:26 -0500] slicknick: im good with git and jenkins ..  for me its el jefe ive yet to feel confident with
[2013-11-16 10:13:50 -0500] spheromak: ah
[2013-11-16 10:15:32 -0500] slicknick: the branch is chillin, marinating .. time for the souschef to in there and stir things up
[2013-11-16 10:18:37 -0500] slicknick: sure, jenkins can do most of that through the scripts & post run options .. so i suppose, stock the repo and make one smooth cut
[2013-11-16 10:19:31 -0500] slicknick: from each node serving up
[2013-11-16 10:58:27 -0500] slicknick: no mas eh?
[2013-11-16 11:22:21 -0500] sneak: i had a recipe at version 0.0.1 that was called "database_master.rb" in cookbook "token". i renamed it to default.rb and changed all references to recipe[token::database_master] to recipe[token]
[2013-11-16 11:22:39 -0500] sneak: database_master no longer appears anywhere yet i am getting recipe compile errors
[2013-11-16 11:24:18 -0500] sneak: things can't find token::database_master
[2013-11-16 11:24:20 -0500] sneak: please advise
[2013-11-16 13:01:26 -0500] yaitskov: hi, why do remote_file copy file to var first?
[2013-11-16 13:03:07 -0500] yaitskov: because of this i cannot work with big files
[2013-11-16 13:56:09 -0500] fly-away: hi
[2013-11-16 13:56:42 -0500] fly-away: guys, what did you use to graph server metrics like io, cpu, mem and so on
[2013-11-16 13:59:11 -0500] laurent\: i'm using collectd to fetch metrics and using graphite to store&process&graph them
[2013-11-16 14:00:20 -0500] micgo: I've used munin in the past to collect basic server metrics
[2013-11-16 14:01:12 -0500] laurent\: (also been using munin in the past)
[2013-11-16 17:20:27 -0500] geewiz: Hi! Even after years using Chef, I seem not to grasp attribute precedence fully. :-/
[2013-11-16 17:20:55 -0500] geewiz: How are default attributes depending on the run list order?
[2013-11-16 17:21:14 -0500] geewiz: For example: Two roles, both define the same default attribute. Which one will win?
[2013-11-16 17:22:08 -0500] adnichols: geewiz: I'm similarly unsure of that - I just try to avoid that situation
[2013-11-16 17:23:09 -0500] geewiz: adnichols: I find that hard to avoid in a more complex environment...
[2013-11-16 17:23:42 -0500] adnichols: geewiz: yeah, I'm sure it is, and I'm sure there's an explanation for how it works. My understanding just isn't nuanced enough for me to be comfortable that it's correct
[2013-11-16 18:26:39 -0500] cheeseplus: geewiz: in chef 11 attributes are evaluated in the order of the run_list and dependencies
[2013-11-16 18:26:56 -0500] cheeseplus: so it should be last write wins
[2013-11-16 19:29:24 -0500] geewiz: cheeseplus: That makes a lot of sense. Time to upgrade, then! Thanks!
[2013-11-16 19:29:49 -0500] cheeseplus: yea, chef 10 was kinda random and the deep merge behavior has changed a bit
[2013-11-16 19:33:42 -0500] dev1x: anyone here with AWS? are you guys also having problems with R53 updates?
[2013-11-16 19:34:50 -0500] atomi: hmm there is no chef recipe for Resin
[2013-11-16 19:39:54 -0500] thun_: How do I get the ip address of the current node in a recipe?
[2013-11-16 19:40:02 -0500] thun_: node[ip_address] ?
[2013-11-16 19:45:16 -0500] coderanger: thun_: node['ipaddress']
[2013-11-16 19:45:21 -0500] thun_: Ty
[2013-11-16 19:45:31 -0500] coderanger: That will be the ip of the default gateway interface
[2013-11-16 19:46:21 -0500] thun_: Yes strange on AWS ifconfig does return external ip
[2013-11-16 19:46:23 -0500] thun_: is that normal
[2013-11-16 19:50:19 -0500] coderanger: Yes, if you want to be more specific on EC2 use node['cloud']['public_ipv4'] and 'local_ipv4'
[2013-11-16 19:52:11 -0500] thun_: Ty perfect
[2013-11-16 20:10:46 -0500] strictlyb: anyone using aws cookbook for ebs raid?
[2013-11-16 20:12:07 -0500] strictlyb: i dont see a aws_ebs_raid providor
[2013-11-16 20:12:19 -0500] strictlyb: but its saying to use this which makes no sense

[2013-11-16 22:51:20 -0500] someara: Is there a way to specify possible values for a String in the LWRP resource DSL?
[2013-11-16 23:00:48 -0500] alfieBinLi: i have an attribute question
[2013-11-16 23:00:48 -0500] alfieBinLi: i have a cookbook x with an attribute file called a.rb (different from default.rb), which defined as node[a][b][c]=opqr
[2013-11-16 23:00:50 -0500] alfieBinLi: i then have a role y, which want to override such variable

[2013-11-16 23:01:07 -0500] alfieBinLi: however, when i run chef-client -o role[y], the override did not happen for the recipe i wrote, could anyone tells me if i am doing wrong here, as how i am organising attribute here?   many thx..
[2013-11-16 23:03:53 -0500] coderanger: alfieBinLi: Drop the x
[2013-11-16 23:08:03 -0500] alfieBinLi: oh    silly me, thx  it drives me crazy
[2013-11-16 23:10:51 -0500] alfieBinLi: how can i check defined attributes in the chef node,  say cookbook x is running on a box,   how can i print off the attribute i defined:  node["a"]["b"]["c"]="poqr"
[2013-11-16 23:33:59 -0500] alfieBinLi: hello, could anyone tells me how can i check defined attributes, say node["a"]["b"]="cd" is defined in attribute, after the chef-client finish running with this cookbook, how can i print out (debug) node["a"]["b"] in that box?  many thx
[2013-11-16 23:56:49 -0500] coderanger: alfieBinLi: Use the log resource
