[2013-11-25 02:09:06 -0500] holms_: how to unprovision a recipe?
[2013-11-25 02:38:00 -0500] flaccid: holms: you can't, but you could design the recipe to do the opposite of create another recipe to do that
[2013-11-25 02:40:19 -0500] holms: hell...
[2013-11-25 02:42:49 -0500] flaccid: holms: why
[2013-11-25 02:43:39 -0500] holms: installed a role accedently which supposed to be on another node
[2013-11-25 02:43:47 -0500] holms: so now i need to remove everything manually
[2013-11-25 02:43:56 -0500] holms: not so hard but just annoying
[2013-11-25 02:51:50 -0500] flaccid: holms: replace with a new correct node
[2013-11-25 02:54:52 -0500] holms: flaccid: well, it's too much of stuff configured in there
[2013-11-25 02:54:56 -0500] holms: so i'd better clean this up
[2013-11-25 02:54:56 -0500] holms: :)
[2013-11-25 02:55:16 -0500] flaccid: but if chef done correctly it would be the same state heh

[2013-11-25 12:58:02 -0500] polysics: I have this recipe that uses deploy_key
[2013-11-25 12:58:12 -0500] polysics: do I need to give it the private or the public key?
[2013-11-25 13:30:08 -0500] adamjk-dev: we would have to see the recipe
[2013-11-25 13:30:12 -0500] adamjk-dev: or know what it is talking to
[2013-11-25 13:30:42 -0500] adamjk-dev: are you sure its public/private key and not a shared key?
[2013-11-25 13:30:47 -0500] adamjk-dev: i dont know what the deploy key is for
[2013-11-25 13:30:49 -0500] polysics: it is a private recipe, but I am trying to deploy from Github
[2013-11-25 13:31:10 -0500] polysics: and the admin is out of office, so I can't get myself a deploy key :)
[2013-11-25 13:31:29 -0500] polysics: but I *think* it's fixed, I needed the private key
[2013-11-25 13:31:36 -0500] polysics: still, thanks for helping!
[2013-11-25 13:31:52 -0500] polysics: this is a monstrous full-stack application recipe that takes about 40 minutes to run on a VM
[2013-11-25 13:32:01 -0500] polysics: so getting results is SLOW. :)
[2013-11-25 13:33:30 -0500] bryanl: I'm finding that wrapping user/group in a conditional based on whether or not i'm running on vagrant is the best way to get around nfs perm issues. is that how others are doing it?
[2013-11-25 13:33:58 -0500] polysics: we had to move a lot of FS-based stuff into conditionals too
[2013-11-25 13:35:36 -0500] workmad3: bryanl: you could use 'ignore_failure node[:vagrant]' and set that 'vagrant' attribute to 'true' in your VagrantFile
[2013-11-25 13:35:54 -0500] bryanl: workmad3: that's an even better solution. thanks
[2013-11-25 13:36:51 -0500] workmad3: bryanl: is this that issue I vaguely remember from a week or so back, where when you mount an nfs partition your subsequent directory resources to manage the mount point fail with permission errors?
[2013-11-25 13:37:42 -0500] bryanl: workmad3: yes, this is the issue
[2013-11-25 13:44:11 -0500] adamjk-dev: polysics: sure, didn't do much lol
[2013-11-25 13:49:34 -0500] polysics: sometimes describing an issue fixes it :)
[2013-11-25 13:49:39 -0500] polysics: although I have a new one now
[2013-11-25 13:49:58 -0500] polysics: Chef fails because of the "Permanently added the RSA host key" message

[2013-11-25 13:55:40 -0500] broconne: anyway to get more debugging info around specific blocks from chef?
[2013-11-25 14:01:35 -0500] polysics: oh heck, it looks like Github is actually timing out here
[2013-11-25 14:09:18 -0500] broconne: Hmm.. guessing it has to do w/ the order of when resources in a provider are run vs. the ruby code...
[2013-11-25 14:10:57 -0500] broconne: but not sure why that matters inside of a provider, vs. a recipe..

[2013-11-25 17:24:27 -0500] jetole: actually I was wondering if anyone knew of a vagrant github or similar vagrant experience for learning chef. trying to google it I'm getting a lot of hits on deploying vagrant boxes using chef as the provisioner
[2013-11-25 17:24:50 -0500] jetole: but I actually want to find a set of vagrant boxes for learning chef
[2013-11-25 17:25:42 -0500] c_t: mmmmm, bacon
[2013-11-25 17:25:48 -0500] jetole: lol
[2013-11-25 17:26:03 -0500] c_t: which reminds me in a roundabout way, I should try making biltong again sometime
[2013-11-25 17:26:11 -0500] jetole: oooh
[2013-11-25 17:26:16 -0500] c_t: I've tried a few times, but I'm never sure if I got it right
[2013-11-25 17:26:24 -0500] jetole: haven't had that in about 5 years since I had a south african room mate
[2013-11-25 17:26:52 -0500] jetole: but it was gooooood
[2013-11-25 17:27:05 -0500] dissolve: gah, this is driving me nuts
[2013-11-25 17:27:10 -0500] c_t: mine was OK, but not as good as my homemade beef jerky
[2013-11-25 17:27:29 -0500] c_t: so I'm not sure I did it right
[2013-11-25 17:27:44 -0500] jetole: I've done jerky once. Never tried making biltong but it was actually our neighbor who was also SA who made the biltong
[2013-11-25 17:27:49 -0500] jetole: and it was gooood
[2013-11-25 17:28:31 -0500] jetole: so is there a vagrant box set out there for learning chef? Does anyone know?
[2013-11-25 17:28:47 -0500] jetole: I have ones for saltstack and puppet, etc but it's a tricky thing to google
[2013-11-25 17:28:52 -0500] c_t: specifically for learning chef?
[2013-11-25 17:28:53 -0500] c_t: hmm
[2013-11-25 17:29:06 -0500] jetole: yeah. c_t something like http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/projects/index.html but for chef
[2013-11-25 17:29:45 -0500] c_t: you know, I'm not sure
[2013-11-25 17:29:52 -0500] dissolve: anyone having my same issue with 11.8 attempting to recreate an existing group
[2013-11-25 17:29:53 -0500] jetole: c_t: or like http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/deploy/demo.html
[2013-11-25 17:30:15 -0500] c_t: oh, I understand, I'm just not sure
[2013-11-25 17:30:20 -0500] jetole: ok
[2013-11-25 17:30:38 -0500] c_t: chef stuff is, sadly, pretty hard to google
[2013-11-25 17:30:42 -0500] jetole: if there isn't, there should be.
[2013-11-25 17:30:48 -0500] jetole: great way to get new users interested
[2013-11-25 17:32:13 -0500] jetole: c_t: may have found one. Changed my google and one of the first hits was https://github.com/spheromak/chef-sandbox
[2013-11-25 17:32:23 -0500] c_t: did you see this too?
[2013-11-25 17:32:24 -0500] c_t: https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/converge/
[2013-11-25 17:32:50 -0500] c_t: chef-sandbox might fit your needs too
[2013-11-25 17:33:34 -0500] jetole: c_t: looks like it
[2013-11-25 17:34:17 -0500] jetole: I can edit the vagrant confs to get more then one demo node (since only one seems pretty limited for learning infrastructure orchestration) but it seems right up what I asked for
[2013-11-25 17:34:20 -0500] jetole: so...
[2013-11-25 17:34:26 -0500] jetole: how about them bacon wrapped medalions?
[2013-11-25 17:36:00 -0500] geewiz: Hi! I've got a cookbook for a whole server infrastructure (web, memcache etc. in separate recipes) that's continuously growing. Would you recommend splitting its recipes up into separate cookbooks for maintainability?
[2013-11-25 17:36:14 -0500] c_t: I would
[2013-11-25 17:37:38 -0500] geewiz: The cookbook also has a library with common helper functions. I could keep using that by having the cookbook as a dependency in the split-up cookbooks, right?
[2013-11-25 17:38:26 -0500] c_t: I believe so
[2013-11-25 17:38:48 -0500] jetole: so I read a comparison the other day of puppet(know it) vs. chef(don't know it) vs. salt(know it) vs. ansible(don't know it) and it mentioned chef and puppet are more geared towards devs where salt and ansible are more geared towards ops. I kind of agree re: puppet and salt. Does that seem accurate about chef?

[2013-11-25 17:46:55 -0500] workmad3: jetole: well, chef is definitely focussed on the 'infrastructure as code' idea
[2013-11-25 17:47:11 -0500] adamjk-dev: jetole: before I started working with Chef... I was told.... Puppet => for dev ops people or ops people, Chef => more geared towards software people
[2013-11-25 17:47:17 -0500] workmad3: jetole: as all your chef cookbooks are ruby code etc :)
[2013-11-25 17:47:38 -0500] adamjk-dev: jetole: and I am strictly a software engineer in this new land working with Chef
[2013-11-25 17:49:33 -0500] jetole: I'm ops for devops and can code in... "enough" languages but ruby isn't one of them. I do like saltstack which I migrated to after puppet but now I'm at a point where I need to familiarize myself with chef regardless of my preferences and experience
[2013-11-25 17:49:40 -0500] jetole: so yay
[2013-11-25 17:50:49 -0500] adamjk-dev: you don't need to know a lot of ruby for chef
[2013-11-25 17:50:56 -0500] adamjk-dev: it has its DSL, so you mostly use that
[2013-11-25 17:51:05 -0500] adamjk-dev: (but you can write as much Ruby as you would like as well)
[2013-11-25 17:51:16 -0500] adamjk-dev: but the resources available cover most of your cases I am betting
[2013-11-25 17:51:27 -0500] jetole: k
[2013-11-25 17:51:32 -0500] jetole: well thanks for the input
[2013-11-25 17:51:36 -0500] adamjk-dev: of course
[2013-11-25 17:51:38 -0500] adamjk-dev: just ask questions
[2013-11-25 17:51:45 -0500] adamjk-dev: but I would suggest looking at a few examples
[2013-11-25 17:51:48 -0500] adamjk-dev: to see what is going on
[2013-11-25 17:52:26 -0500] adamjk-dev: jetole: there are also fundamentals videos to learn chef
[2013-11-25 17:52:44 -0500] adamjk-dev: jetole: I am using a lot of those slides to do a conference presentation on Chef myself
[2013-11-25 17:53:47 -0500] adamjk-dev: jetole: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh9osPQA_-k
[2013-11-25 17:54:34 -0500] yfeldblu_: you're going to have to write software to run your infrastructure
[2013-11-25 17:55:06 -0500] yfeldblu_: chef & some others make the software part of that a first-class citizen

[2013-11-25 18:53:48 -0500] fveillette: start_time and start_day are attribute of the provider

[2013-11-25 18:54:45 -0500] juliancdunn: yeah, me neither... I just looked at the code
[2013-11-25 18:59:19 -0500] juliancdunn: we suspect a naming conflict, since Chef's resource class uses start_time internally

[2013-11-25 19:21:41 -0500] juliancdunn: supercom32: no, but you specify the entire path to the source
[2013-11-25 19:21:51 -0500] juliancdunn: most (well-behaved) packages don't care where you run them *from*
[2013-11-25 19:35:04 -0500] broconne: Ok.. this has me confused...
[2013-11-25 19:35:15 -0500] broconne: from inside a provider
[2013-11-25 19:35:23 -0500] broconne:   Chef::Log.debug("Remote Path is #{@new_resource.remote_path}");

[2013-11-25 19:35:32 -0500] broconne: it logs the path.
[2013-11-25 19:35:44 -0500] broconne: then says that remote_path is nil

[2013-11-25 19:38:26 -0500] fveillette: you found something julian?
[2013-11-25 19:54:51 -0500] sdicu: hi - what is the refference cookbook for mysql-percona distribution ?
[2013-11-25 19:55:31 -0500] sdicu: the mysql cookbook from github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql doesn't seem to support percona distro
[2013-11-25 19:55:44 -0500] sdicu: found https://github.com/phlipper/chef-percona but it has some bugs from what i see
[2013-11-25 19:57:35 -0500] juliancdunn: fveillette: no, but that's still my suspicion
[2013-11-25 19:57:49 -0500] juliancdunn: you can try to confirm it by changing all references of start_time to something else, see if that fixes it
[2013-11-25 19:57:58 -0500] juliancdunn: if it does, then it's totally a conflict with Chef::Resource base class

[2013-11-25 20:04:34 -0500] jblancett: ianco: it should be an instance of the Chef::DataBagItem class
[2013-11-25 20:06:13 -0500] ianco: jblancett: oh? i guess i should read the source

[2013-11-25 20:31:28 -0500] shyam: we use knife ec2 command with --user-data for winrm configuration, EC2 instance is creating but bootstrapping is not happening. Using the knife ec2 server create, ec2 windows instances are creating and it is showing an error "waiting for winrm". We verified from the ec2 windows node the winrm configurations but bootstrapping is not happening.

[2013-11-25 20:39:27 -0500] juliancdunn: shyam: your EC2 security group allows WinRM 5985-5986 inbound?
[2013-11-25 20:41:33 -0500] shyam: juliancdunn: yes, i had opened the ports for winrm, once the windows ec2 instance came up , i verified the winrm settings and user details specified in the .ps1 file

[2013-11-25 21:47:11 -0500] Otterley: I think so

[2013-11-25 21:49:49 -0500] DandyPandy: How do most go about upgrading chef? I'm currently on 11.4.4 and figure that I should upgrade to keep from falling behind too far. I know I can run the the omnibus installer for the newer version, which will work fine on the server. What would be the best way to do it on the nodes?
[2013-11-25 21:51:32 -0500] DandyPandy: Also, would I be able to upgrade the server and leave older clients in place? I made the naive decision when I was starting out to setup one server for my dev, staging, and production environments. I would like to test in dev without having to push the changes to staging/production immediately.
[2013-11-25 21:51:58 -0500] webframp: DandyPandy we most often use https://github.com/hw-cookbooks/omnibus_updater
[2013-11-25 21:52:31 -0500] webframp: especially given that I'm with HW ;)
[2013-11-25 21:53:09 -0500] gregkare: Using a wrapper cookbook that's version locked in all the environment and the heavy water omnibus_updater is a good way to update
[2013-11-25 21:53:42 -0500] gregkare: You can also set the version as an attribute in your environments
[2013-11-25 21:54:31 -0500] DandyPandy: do server/client version mismatches cause issues, assuming they're in the same major release?
[2013-11-25 21:54:55 -0500] DandyPandy: More specifically newer server, older clients.
[2013-11-25 21:58:20 -0500] paulczar: anyone able to help me with a chefspec question?     if I try and notify a resource from another recipe/cookbook the chef spec run fails with 'resource firewall_rule[ssh port 22] is configured to notify resource firewall[ufw] with action enable, but firewall[ufw] cannot be found in the resource collection. firewall_rule[ssh port 22]'

[2013-11-25 23:06:07 -0500] theskyisdrunk: ruby 1.9.3p448 (2013-06-27 revision 41675) [x86_64-linux]

[2013-11-25 23:07:00 -0500] theskyisdrunk: 11.8.0
[2013-11-25 23:07:22 -0500] rbwsam: have you set your cookbook path in knife.rb?
[2013-11-25 23:07:29 -0500] theskyisdrunk: checking...
[2013-11-25 23:08:46 -0500] theskyisdrunk: Doesn't look like it. I set up a chef workstation and it has the default knife.rb from knife configure --initial
[2013-11-25 23:08:56 -0500] theskyisdrunk: adding the cookbook path now via the information from the docs
[2013-11-25 23:10:31 -0500] theskyisdrunk: that fixed it. Thanks rbwsam!
[2013-11-25 23:13:40 -0500] rbwsam: theskyisdrunk:  yay! you're welcome
[2013-11-25 23:32:10 -0500] Majost: Why did the python cookbook get punted to a community cookbook?
[2013-11-25 23:37:08 -0500] juliancdunn: Majost: Opscode is divesting itself of many cookbooks, particularly for technologies we no longer use
[2013-11-25 23:39:33 -0500] Majost: juliancdunn: As a community, how do we ensure the quality of a cookbook given the large number of forks out there; what defines a standard cookbook from the community if not opscode as the source?
[2013-11-25 23:39:41 -0500] chip-: Also because: When a cookbook becomes part of opscode-cookbooks git org, then for better or worse it's treated as "authoritative," and people cease sharing work on alternative solutions to the same problem.
[2013-11-25 23:40:01 -0500] webframp: DandyPandy haven't had an issue there, we use the cookbook to upgrade chef on nodes that are using 'enterprise hosted chef'
[2013-11-25 23:40:11 -0500] juliancdunn: Majost: I'm hoping such things will be solved when we have the community site rebuilt
[2013-11-25 23:40:29 -0500] juliancdunn: there will likely be some kind of rating system, both automatic and manual, that will mark cookbooks as being high-quality
[2013-11-25 23:40:43 -0500] juliancdunn: automatic could be "passes rubocop", "passes foodcritic", "has unit tests", etc. etc.
[2013-11-25 23:41:17 -0500] Majost: What is the projected go-live date for the new site?
[2013-11-25 23:42:54 -0500] juliancdunn: we're just getting started with the process
[2013-11-25 23:43:04 -0500] juliancdunn: we hope to have something usable by ChefConf 2014
[2013-11-25 23:43:04 -0500] Majost: I hope I am not being too noisy -- but this change raises some questions and concerns which I may have to answer within my own org.
[2013-11-25 23:43:38 -0500] juliancdunn: Opscode continues to be co-maintainer on cookbooks that we've divested
[2013-11-25 23:43:53 -0500] juliancdunn: hit me up by email if you want to discuss further and if I can address any of those concerns. jdunn@opscode.com
[2013-11-25 23:44:10 -0500] Majost: okay, thanks. =)
