[2013-11-03 00:50:51 -0400] Geoffc__: can anyone help me with nagios data bags?
[2013-11-03 04:20:06 -0500] fak3r: trying to upload a recipe to server: Ridley::Errors::HTTPUnauthorized: {"error":["Invalid signature for user or client 'user"]}
[2013-11-03 04:20:37 -0500] fak3r: I've ssh-d to the chef-server, and done knife user reregister user to get a new key, but that new key still doesn't work. what could I be missing?
[2013-11-03 08:00:03 -0500] JeanMertz: Is there a (documented) way to monkeypatch classes throughout the entire Chef run (both on precompile and during the run)? f.e. I'd like a "strip_heredoc" method on the String class to exist at all time.
[2013-11-03 08:10:57 -0500] slicknick: no idea what that even means
[2013-11-03 10:55:01 -0500] davsharyan33: heeeey people. having a problem with node.default which I try to set an attribute from recipe. The problem is that it works on my local lab and it's not working where it should ( on other servers ). When I print from recipe it to console it returns correct values. But it's not setting in attributes.  Any idea where to have a look ? thnx Chef 11.4.0 http://paste2.org/CI6M1NyP
[2013-11-03 14:35:46 -0500] glen: any ideas is there plan to make depends optional or platform specific in metadata.rb? i mean i have only linux os'es and some cookbooks depend on stuff like dmg
[2013-11-03 14:42:42 -0500] holms: now this is what I call a chef tutorial
[2013-11-03 14:42:43 -0500] holms: http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/event/60/Infrastructure%20Automation%20with%20Opscode%20Chef%20Presentation.pdf
[2013-11-03 15:03:23 -0500] glen: indeed, never heard of shef for example
[2013-11-03 15:03:47 -0500] glen: ah, it's old name for chef-shell, but haven't used chef-shell anyway
[2013-11-03 15:14:33 -0500] _dumfries: It's a great little tool when you need to do some troubleshooting.
[2013-11-03 15:54:54 -0500] holms: we need "chef for dummies"
[2013-11-03 15:55:04 -0500] holms: can somebody explain me difference between roles and nodes folders?
[2013-11-03 15:55:36 -0500] holms: it does completely the same, unless you want 10 nodes of one role or smtng
[2013-11-03 17:12:12 -0500] thedeeno: I'd like to override a method of a built in chef class. Where would you put this meta programming code so that it gets loaded at the start of a chef-run?
[2013-11-03 17:13:32 -0500] thedeeno: It needs to load early as early as possible in the run, not sure where to inject this. Maybe it's not even possible. If I put in a recipe it will be too late, the code will be effecting recipe loading.
[2013-11-03 17:13:45 -0500] thedeeno: it in a recipe*
[2013-11-03 17:46:16 -0500] chip-: thedeeno: What do you need to override?
[2013-11-03 17:47:23 -0500] thedeeno: chip-: I'd like to override cookbook caching. I'm using chef-zero and the cookbook caching is slowing the runs down considerably, and it's not needed. I want to test a possible patch which allows users to toggle it.
[2013-11-03 17:48:02 -0500] thedeeno: pretty much I want to enable chef-solo style filesystem loading in the context of chef-zero
[2013-11-03 17:48:04 -0500] thedeeno: or try to anyways
[2013-11-03 17:48:32 -0500] jkeiser: thedeeno: you can't do it by putting it in a cookbook, that's for sure
[2013-11-03 17:48:59 -0500] thedeeno: indeed, that's why i'm a little stuck
[2013-11-03 17:49:19 -0500] chip-: Well when it comes to chef-zero, here's the man himself. :)
[2013-11-03 17:49:42 -0500] jkeiser: thedeeno: can you just pull the chef source code, modify it and "rake install"?
[2013-11-03 17:49:48 -0500] jkeiser: That's what I would do
[2013-11-03 17:50:58 -0500] thedeeno: facepalm. Yeah, I could do that. I love monkey patching too much! :)
[2013-11-03 18:10:08 -0500] holms: ha! nice one! http://learnchef.getharvest.com
[2013-11-03 21:23:07 -0500] blaind: Hello. What's the best way to use chef to install utility packages by apt-get? Such as strace, screen, binutils, telnet, etc
[2013-11-03 21:23:24 -0500] blaind: Should I create a cookbook for that?
[2013-11-03 21:27:48 -0500] coderanger: blaind: A lot of people just have a <companyname>-misc cookbook
[2013-11-03 21:28:14 -0500] coderanger: with some recipe code like %w{strace screen ...}.each do |p| package p end
[2013-11-03 21:36:02 -0500] blaind: coderanger: seems to work. Thanks a lot!
[2013-11-03 21:36:13 -0500] blaind: very new to chef, but really impressed so far. Good work! :)
