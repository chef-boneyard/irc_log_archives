[2013-11-28 00:20:20 -0500] Lolindir__: Anyone encountered an issue where Chef::Log.info no longer displays during a run in Windows?
[2013-11-28 01:11:36 -0500] jmickle: happy thanksgiving chefs!
[2013-11-28 01:17:15 -0500] Lolindir__: To you as well!
[2013-11-28 01:38:24 -0500] jmickle: is it possible to use a node attribute in role?
[2013-11-28 01:49:57 -0500] spheromak: jmickle: you mean have an attribute evaluated in the role ? no. you can do this in a wrapper cookbook tho.
[2013-11-28 01:52:09 -0500] jmickle: yeah i was trying to avoid that
[2013-11-28 01:52:21 -0500] jmickle: i have a haproxy load balancer that uses the json entries to do haproxy_lb's
[2013-11-28 01:52:32 -0500] jmickle: and wanted to bind to eth0:1
[2013-11-28 01:52:40 -0500] jmickle: on some specific blocks
[2013-11-28 02:12:32 -0500] coderanger: btm: You around?
[2013-11-28 02:12:52 -0500] coderanger: btm: unping, I'll email y'all
[2013-11-28 02:21:35 -0500] halorgium: what is the way to make the node in the cookbooks require certain keys?
[2013-11-28 02:21:58 -0500] halorgium: i'm getting a lot of cases where a value is missing but it is silently letting it pass
[2013-11-28 02:24:03 -0500] coderanger: halorgium: Just raise an exception from your recipe if it isn't set
[2013-11-28 02:24:17 -0500] halorgium: coderanger: yer, i figured it would be like that
[2013-11-28 02:24:32 -0500] halorgium: i'd prefer to have it in the attributes, where i could set it as a precondition check
[2013-11-28 02:24:55 -0500] halorgium: or even default to "raise" :)
[2013-11-28 02:25:11 -0500] halorgium: using a value and getting null is less likely than not IME
[2013-11-28 02:25:44 -0500] coderanger: Not sure what you mean
[2013-11-28 02:26:02 -0500] coderanger: At the point that the attributes file is run, you don't know if it will be set or not
[2013-11-28 02:26:07 -0500] coderanger: since a later cookbook could set it
[2013-11-28 02:26:34 -0500] coderanger: Raising an error during recipe compile phase is your best bet by far
[2013-11-28 02:27:30 -0500] halorgium: coderanger: yer, i have isolated the cookbooks from each other so i can more easily understand the dependencies
[2013-11-28 02:27:43 -0500] halorgium: so i don't set attributes across cookbooks or really inside recipes either
[2013-11-28 02:29:34 -0500] coderanger: That means you forgo most established wrapper and library cookbook patterns
[2013-11-28 02:30:02 -0500] halorgium: is there a best practices wiki page?
[2013-11-28 02:30:18 -0500] coderanger: Not really, it moves too quickly for a wiki to help much :)
[2013-11-28 02:31:03 -0500] halorgium: yer, i felt too much pain when dealing with oooold chef and quickly decided to keep inter-dependencies to a minimum
[2013-11-28 06:08:13 -0500] jmickle: anyone around decent with ohai?
[2013-11-28 08:01:07 -0500] enbergj: one of my nodes running on a dedicated server thinks it's EC2 and chef-client constantly freezes for 2min until some stupid ec2 test completes, says "Loading plugin ec2", "looks_like_ec? == true", then freezes until a connection timeout .. how can I tell it that it's being retarded and it's not running on an EC2 instance?
[2013-11-28 09:21:01 -0500] robwatkin: Can anyone help me work out how to use ssh-keys cookbook?
[2013-11-28 09:21:15 -0500] ocholetras: is that a community cookbook?
[2013-11-28 09:21:33 -0500] robwatkin: Yes
[2013-11-28 09:23:04 -0500] ocholetras: https://github.com/nickola/chef-ssh-keys
[2013-11-28 09:23:10 -0500] ocholetras: there is a readme
[2013-11-28 09:23:18 -0500] ocholetras: that gives you an example
[2013-11-28 09:23:26 -0500] ocholetras: seems pretty good explained
[2013-11-28 09:23:56 -0500] robwatkin: It's probably obvious but I cant figure out where to put ...
[2013-11-28 09:24:03 -0500] robwatkin: {
[2013-11-28 09:24:04 -0500] robwatkin:   "ssh_keys": { ...
[2013-11-28 09:25:49 -0500] robwatkin: I'm trying to set the node[:ssh_keys] attribute in my 'base_server' cookbook
[2013-11-28 09:27:05 -0500] robwatkin: which then does   include_recipe "ssh-keys"
[2013-11-28 09:27:17 -0500] Cope: robwatkin: so it seems that the design is that the attribute points to a databag item
[2013-11-28 09:28:24 -0500] Cope: seems slightly indirect
[2013-11-28 09:28:40 -0500] Cope: but basically you create a databag item for each user, and put their authorized keys in it
[2013-11-28 09:28:58 -0500] Cope: then you set the attribute to say which users have which users keys
[2013-11-28 09:29:28 -0500] Cope: the node config example in the readme is if you use chef solo
[2013-11-28 09:30:47 -0500] robwatkin: I get the data bag stuff. I am trying to set the attribute so that every node will populate authorized_keys looking at the code ...
[2013-11-28 09:30:55 -0500] robwatkin: if node[:ssh_keys]
[2013-11-28 09:30:55 -0500] robwatkin:   node[:ssh_keys].each do |node_user, bag_users| ...
[2013-11-28 09:32:22 -0500] robwatkin: I need to set :ssh_keys but I'm trying to do that from base_server/attributes/default.rb. Perhaps I have the wrong idea on this?
[2013-11-28 09:32:24 -0500] Cope: right, so you need to decide where you're going to set that attrbute
[2013-11-28 09:33:06 -0500] Cope: you can set attributes in a whole bunch of places in chef, and depending on where you set them and at what level, chef ultimately decides what takes precedence
[2013-11-28 09:33:44 -0500] Cope: attributes/default.rb is for setting a sane default
[2013-11-28 09:33:53 -0500] Cope: which you might choose to override elsewhere
[2013-11-28 09:35:18 -0500] robwatkin: Ah, so in this case I could set them directly in the recipe
[2013-11-28 09:35:49 -0500] Cope: well you could - or in this case you might feel it makes sense to set up default users and keys in your base cookbook
[2013-11-28 09:36:12 -0500] Cope: chef is all about making a model - you decide what models the way you want reality to be
[2013-11-28 09:36:44 -0500] Cope: so if you think it makes sense to have a set of default users and keys in the base cookbook, by all means stick it in attributes/default.rb in the base cookbook
[2013-11-28 09:37:07 -0500] Cope: if you then include ssh_keys, the attribute will be set, and the ssh_keys recipe will function as you want
[2013-11-28 09:38:42 -0500] robwatkin: Thanks, I'm starting to get it now :-) So something like default["ssh-keys"]["ssh_keys"] = { etc?
[2013-11-28 09:39:17 -0500] robwatkin: The matter of where is a different question.
[2013-11-28 09:40:09 -0500] Cope: i think just default['ssh-keys'] = { ... }
[2013-11-28 09:40:51 -0500] Cope: ssh_keys
[2013-11-28 09:40:53 -0500] Cope: _ not -
[2013-11-28 09:40:59 -0500] robwatkin: Yep :-)
[2013-11-28 09:41:38 -0500] Cope: afk #breakfast
[2013-11-28 09:42:01 -0500] robwatkin: Thanks, you've helped a lot!
[2013-11-28 10:21:56 -0500] robwatkin: Got a lot further now but getting error Chef::Exceptions::InvalidDataBagPath: Data bag path '/var/chef/data_bags' is invalid ...
[2013-11-28 10:22:23 -0500] robwatkin: I suspect that vagrant is not finding the data bag
[2013-11-28 10:22:40 -0500] Cope: right - you need to set a databag path in your vagrantfile
[2013-11-28 10:22:53 -0500] robwatkin: Thanks :-)
[2013-11-28 10:37:35 -0500] robwatkin: Cope: well all the chef and vagrant stuff seems to have work but ssh root@localhost -p 2222 is challenging for password. I've checked everything inside the VM and all looks ok, is there anything else I should be doing in vagrant?
[2013-11-28 10:37:57 -0500] Cope: don't use root
[2013-11-28 10:38:00 -0500] Cope: vagrant ssh
[2013-11-28 10:38:21 -0500] Cope: or use the vagrant-created insecure private key
[2013-11-28 10:38:58 -0500] robwatkin: vagrant ssh works, but I' just trying to check that my ssh-keys cookbook works before uploading it
[2013-11-28 10:39:13 -0500] Cope: oh sorry - being dense
[2013-11-28 10:39:24 -0500] robwatkin: ok :-)
[2013-11-28 10:39:43 -0500] Cope: so you're expecting the key to have been dropped off
[2013-11-28 10:39:55 -0500] Cope: and you're trying to test it
[2013-11-28 10:40:08 -0500] robwatkin: Yes, it's in .ssh/authorized_keys
[2013-11-28 10:40:25 -0500] Cope: assuming you've either cached the key or are using id_[rd]sa
[2013-11-28 10:40:25 -0500] robwatkin: Yes, it's in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
[2013-11-28 10:40:51 -0500] Cope: ie the defult that ssh will use... that should work; unless your vagrant box is configured not to allow root logins
[2013-11-28 10:41:00 -0500] Cope: ubuntu, for example, is thusly configured
[2013-11-28 10:41:06 -0500] robwatkin: Yes I use the key all the time
[2013-11-28 10:41:50 -0500] robwatkin: It' the CentOS image from Berkshelf
[2013-11-28 10:42:25 -0500] Cope: ok that should work
[2013-11-28 10:43:28 -0500] robwatkin: I'll try another key, maybe this ones broken
[2013-11-28 10:49:21 -0500] robwatkin: Cope: I've found the problem. The ssh-keys cookbook has placed the key in /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys which is not what I want at all. I must have done something wrong.
[2013-11-28 10:50:01 -0500] Cope: alas
[2013-11-28 10:59:08 -0500] holms: help :( ERROR: Berkshelf::BerksfileReadError: Berkshelf::BerksfileReadError
[2013-11-28 10:59:14 -0500] holms: never had this issue.. what's happened?
[2013-11-28 10:59:49 -0500] Cope: I suspect berkshelf can't read your Berksfile
[2013-11-28 11:01:25 -0500] holms: you don't say :D
[2013-11-28 11:01:46 -0500] holms: chef-solo been updated
[2013-11-28 11:01:53 -0500] holms: and there's no update to berksfile
[2013-11-28 11:01:57 -0500] robwatkin: Just for the record 'vagrant reload' didn't do it. 'vagrant destroy / vagrant up' now all /root/.ssh/authorized_keys is in place
[2013-11-28 11:01:58 -0500] holms: and now it doesn't work =(
[2013-11-28 11:02:42 -0500] robwatkin: Cope: Thanks again for your help.
[2013-11-28 11:03:30 -0500] Cope: holms: the stack trace would be useful... see where the error happens; look at the code... see what it's trying to do
[2013-11-28 11:06:32 -0500] holms: ok one min
[2013-11-28 11:10:28 -0500] Cope: robwatkin: glad it's working for you1
[2013-11-28 11:14:12 -0500] mattsmith: can I use the following to search?
[2013-11-28 11:14:30 -0500] mattsmith: search(:node, "tag:blah")?
[2013-11-28 11:15:27 -0500] Cope: mattsmith: you can always test your searches with chef-shell to find out... :)

[2013-11-28 11:19:32 -0500] mattsmith: Cope, Thanks. Now to test that i'm setting tags correctly
[2013-11-28 11:24:08 -0500] Cope: right, so PathLocation.new(name, version_constraint, options)
[2013-11-28 11:24:14 -0500] Cope: looks like it's failing
[2013-11-28 11:24:47 -0500] Cope: because if it didn't you'd just get a array from that method
[2013-11-28 11:24:53 -0500] Cope: but instead you get an exception
[2013-11-28 11:27:56 -0500] Cope: what does your berksfile say
[2013-11-28 11:29:41 -0500] Garo__: Anybody know any cookbooks which can create, snapshot and restore lvm volumes which are based on multiple ebs volumes?
[2013-11-28 11:31:19 -0500] Cope: Garo__: have you looked for cookbooks on the community site? eg aws? ebs?
[2013-11-28 11:36:02 -0500] Garo__: Cope: the "ebs" cookbook can create lvm based on ebs volumes, but there's no word about backups and snapshots
[2013-11-28 11:49:59 -0500] chef-beginner: good day
[2013-11-28 11:53:55 -0500] Garo__: hello chrisstreeter
[2013-11-28 11:54:10 -0500] Garo__: typo
[2013-11-28 11:56:40 -0500] mattsmith: ohai_time shows the last time that ohai was run, is there any object to show last check-in and successful chef-client run?
[2013-11-28 12:11:29 -0500] laurent\: mattsmith: just curious, what are you trying to do ? :)
[2013-11-28 12:44:15 -0500] robwatkin: Having updated my cookbook I ran 'berks upload' which reported 'Uploading base_server (0.1.0) to:...' but when I check the cookbook on the OPSCODE manage it's the old version. Do I need to bump the version number?
[2013-11-28 12:52:49 -0500] Cope: robwatkin: yes
[2013-11-28 12:59:15 -0500] mattsmith: laurent\, trying to build a list of seeds for a config file :-)
[2013-11-28 13:00:26 -0500] mattsmith: but I need to know that the host has checked in within the last hour wit a successful chef-client run
[2013-11-28 13:03:31 -0500] laurent\: mattsmith: in that case you can use ohai_time
[2013-11-28 13:05:19 -0500] laurent\: mattsmith: there's an excerpt of one of my one-liners: knife search node "ohai_time:[$(date +%s -d "40 minutes ago") TO NOW]" -i
[2013-11-28 13:05:52 -0500] laurent\: ohai_time will only be updated if the run is successful
[2013-11-28 13:06:02 -0500] mattsmith: laurent\ perfect thanks
[2013-11-28 13:30:52 -0500] ___stefan: Hi everyone, is there a way to lock down an environment so that a new cookbook can not be installed if there is no version specific setting specified in the env.? I would like to use ohai and the chef api to map out my production nodes but I don't want any cookbooks to be added by 'accident' to their run list.
[2013-11-28 13:31:35 -0500] ___stefan: Right now if there is no version constraint in an environment it will just run the latest version. I want it to not run if there is no version info in the env.
[2013-11-28 13:44:33 -0500] cassianoleal: __stefan: why would a newly updated cookbook be added to the run_list of a node without you explicit specifying so?

[2013-11-28 13:46:33 -0500] ___stefan: cassianoleal: it wouldn't but there is nothing to prevent someone from just 'accidentally' doing so especially if the nodes have similar names.
[2013-11-28 13:46:52 -0500] glen: how do specify order how ohai plugins are loaded?

[2013-11-28 14:14:53 -0500] _dumfrie-: glen: Looks like a issue with the hostaddr plugin you're using.
[2013-11-28 14:16:05 -0500] glen: _dumfrie-: no it works in chef, the other ones fail too which work in chef
[2013-11-28 14:16:30 -0500] _dumfrie-: Take a look at like 41 in the file.
[2013-11-28 14:16:57 -0500] williamherry: I defined with `default[:munin][:packages] = 'xxx'`, and use it with `node[:munin][:packages]`, any thing wrong?
[2013-11-28 14:17:08 -0500] williamherry: or need extra step to make this work?
[2013-11-28 14:17:26 -0500] glen: dumfries_: that line 41 seems stasndard ruby: "rescue => e"
[2013-11-28 14:18:21 -0500] glen: ah. i corrupted the file while trying to add debug. the original problem still there
[2013-11-28 14:24:21 -0500] glen: damn, the ohai plugins run correctly in one node, and incorrectly (wrong order) on the other
[2013-11-28 14:27:07 -0500] glen: so i did sometthing stupid, renamed hostaddr.rb to vhostaddr.rb to get better order!
[2013-11-28 14:27:56 -0500] glen: it also helped if i move hostaddr.rb out of plugins dir, and back, then it gets "last" order in filesystem i use:
[2013-11-28 14:28:01 -0500] glen: 16:27:28 root[load: 0.09]@mamma ~/ohai_plugins# ls -f
[2013-11-28 14:28:01 -0500] glen: ./  ../  README  wikidata.rb  ipmi.rb  rpm.rb  vserver.rb  .hostaddr.rb.swp  .wikidata.rb.swp  .hostaddr.rb.swo  hostaddr.rb
[2013-11-28 14:28:52 -0500] glen: so question remains why these two ohai plugins dependency does not work hostaddr.rb: http://sprunge.us/TBSQ vserver.rb: http://sprunge.us/hQDd
[2013-11-28 14:39:43 -0500] bubu\a_: ey guys, how can I access a recipe from a 'shef -z' session? include_recipe isn't working.
[2013-11-28 14:40:25 -0500] Cope: bubu\a_: recipe_mode ?
[2013-11-28 14:41:00 -0500] bubu\a_: chef > recipe_mode
[2013-11-28 14:41:00 -0500] bubu\a_: NameError: undefined local variable or method `recipe_mode' for main:Object
[2013-11-28 14:41:16 -0500] bubu\a_: yeah that doesn't work. recipe looks to get me into recipe_mode
[2013-11-28 14:43:02 -0500] bubu\a_: chef:recipe > include_recipe "partial_search"
[2013-11-28 14:43:04 -0500] bubu\a_: Chef::Exceptions::CookbookNotFound: Cookbook partial_search not found. If you're loading partial_search from another cookbook, make sure you configure the dependency in your metadata
[2013-11-28 14:43:22 -0500] bubu\a_: how can I do that in a shef session?
[2013-11-28 14:43:34 -0500] Cope: um
[2013-11-28 14:44:34 -0500] bubu\a_: and don't say 'depends'
[2013-11-28 14:44:35 -0500] bubu\a_: :P
[2013-11-28 15:02:49 -0500] ptrf: is it possible to synthesize a temporary data bag?
[2013-11-28 15:03:14 -0500] ptrf: so I'm using elasticsearch, and there's a data bag that contains passwords and keys
[2013-11-28 15:04:08 -0500] ptrf: can I have an encrypted data bag, and decrypt it in my wrapper cookbook, and pass a reference to that data bag, rather than an actual data bag?
[2013-11-28 15:04:19 -0500] ptrf: or am I completely misunderstanding omething here?
[2013-11-28 15:04:49 -0500] BryanWB: every time i try to run my test-kitchen tests w/ '-p' i get a nasty "Trace/BPT trap: 5" crash. This is on mac os x
[2013-11-28 15:04:53 -0500] BryanWB: anyone else seen that?
[2013-11-28 15:05:39 -0500] slicknick: ptrf: for me will you please break down and describe "synthesize a temporary data bag"
[2013-11-28 15:05:56 -0500] slicknick: BryanWB: nay. search the webs ?
[2013-11-28 15:06:05 -0500] BryanWB: slicknick: i did, w/out success
[2013-11-28 15:07:00 -0500] slicknick: BryanWB: maybe not the entire output, but specific terms trace bpt trap ?
[2013-11-28 15:07:03 -0500] slicknick: start there
[2013-11-28 15:07:25 -0500] BryanWB: i tried that as well, tks for ur suggestions tho
[2013-11-28 15:07:47 -0500] slicknick: id wager its not only chef that would suffer from this but i knot not for sure
[2013-11-28 15:07:52 -0500] BryanWB: i upgraded to latest ruby 2.* to no avail
[2013-11-28 15:08:28 -0500] slicknick: maybe b0rked something during?
[2013-11-28 15:08:55 -0500] ichilton: Hi BryanWB
[2013-11-28 15:09:03 -0500] BryanWB: hi ichilton!
[2013-11-28 15:09:06 -0500] slicknick: nvm .. you did that as remediation attempt
[2013-11-28 15:09:08 -0500] ichilton: BryanWB: how's things?
[2013-11-28 15:09:08 -0500] slicknick: my apologies
[2013-11-28 15:09:50 -0500] BryanWB: ichilton: super bz, u?
[2013-11-28 15:10:08 -0500] ichilton: BryanWB: cool - yeah, good thanks - busy too!
[2013-11-28 15:10:10 -0500] slicknick: id check some logs ... chef's, messages, dmesg? when waas last boot

[2013-11-28 15:14:15 -0500] Cope: BryanWB: at what point/
[2013-11-28 15:14:37 -0500] nacer: BryanWB: hi dude ! :)
[2013-11-28 15:14:52 -0500] nacer: BryanWB: can ark keep the file in cache ?
[2013-11-28 15:15:20 -0500] BryanWB: slicknick: tks, that's probably the cause for me too, as the crash always happens right berkshelf starts uploading cookbooks
[2013-11-28 15:15:25 -0500] BryanWB: Cope: ^^
[2013-11-28 15:15:26 -0500] daxroc: Evening all
[2013-11-28 15:15:46 -0500] nacer: BryanWB: because my ark download, always download
[2013-11-28 15:15:59 -0500] daxroc: Is it possible to set the Company info for new cookbooks created through knife ?
[2013-11-28 15:15:59 -0500] BryanWB: nacer, add the checksum
[2013-11-28 15:16:34 -0500] nacer: BryanWB: ok
[2013-11-28 15:16:51 -0500] Cope: daxroc: yes, set it in your knife.rb
[2013-11-28 15:20:04 -0500] ptrf: slicknick: yeah, so instead of having an actual data ba
[2013-11-28 15:20:11 -0500] ptrf: arhg
[2013-11-28 15:21:54 -0500] ptrf: slicknick: yeah, so instead of having an actual data bag, you have an encrypted which you decrypt in your recipe, and then when the wrapped cookbook tries to fetch data from a data bag, it will use the transient data bag
[2013-11-28 15:22:08 -0500] ptrf: it sounds complicated though, so complicated that I dont think it's a viable solution
[2013-11-28 15:32:37 -0500] cmecca_: hey guys --- quick (opscode, really) hosted chef question; can you delete an organization?

[2013-11-28 16:47:59 -0500] luisico: any idea?
[2013-11-28 18:11:17 -0500] glen: any ideas why hostaddr is loaded before hostaddr even if deps say otherwise: 15:59:17  glen> hostaddr.rb: http://sprunge.us/TBSQ vserver.rb: http://sprunge.us/hQDd

[2013-11-28 23:41:21 -0500] johncolombia: for instance, if hosts file exists then append it to the /etc/hosts in the provisioned machine
