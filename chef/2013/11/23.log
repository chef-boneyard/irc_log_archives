[2013-11-23 00:51:54 -0500] timsmith1: anyone know what the syntax on knife search run_list is
[2013-11-23 01:02:00 -0500] scalp42: if someone is requiring the hipchat gem in their client.rb for the report handler, using the chef-client cookbook and didnt lock the version, it's currently broken. I added a comment on how to fix it: https://github.com/hipchat/hipchat-rb/pull/51#issuecomment-29121421
[2013-11-23 03:17:52 -0500] clakeb: I've read over the "File Specificity" section of the cookbook_file resource. Can I structure files in arbitrarily name directories just for my sanity? Only deploying to one node with this cookbook. What I want: COOKBOOK-NAME/files/dotfiles/
[2013-11-23 03:18:37 -0500] clakeb: how would I specify the source attribute in that situation? source "/dotfiles/somefile
[2013-11-23 03:19:06 -0500] adnichols: clakeb: "dotfiles/somefile" - but yes
[2013-11-23 03:19:31 -0500] clakeb: adnichols: thank you
[2013-11-23 03:19:34 -0500] adnichols: but I think dotfiles would be under "default"
[2013-11-23 03:19:50 -0500] adnichols: the whole specificity logic still applies
[2013-11-23 03:20:33 -0500] clakeb: so no arbitrary dir names under cookbook-name/files/?
[2013-11-23 03:21:01 -0500] adnichols: you would put it under cookbook-name/files/default
[2013-11-23 03:21:39 -0500] clakeb: Thank you for your help
[2013-11-23 03:21:48 -0500] adnichols: np
[2013-11-23 03:43:58 -0500] jmickle: Just got home to find a super cool card in the mail from @opscode ;-) You guys are awesome
[2013-11-23 04:06:54 -0500] joelteon: so can you not use a branch called "deploy" with the git provider?
[2013-11-23 04:08:53 -0500] adnichols: joelteon: I'd expect revision "deploy" to work - it doesn't?
[2013-11-23 04:09:26 -0500] joelteon: reference is an alias for that?
[2013-11-23 04:09:41 -0500] adnichols: looks like it
[2013-11-23 04:11:16 -0500] joelteon: hang on a sec let me run it again
[2013-11-23 04:45:54 -0500] joelteon: yeah
[2013-11-23 04:45:56 -0500] joelteon: "git checkout: branch deploy already exists"
[2013-11-23 04:46:00 -0500] joelteon: not sure why
[2013-11-23 05:03:03 -0500] joelteon: ok, but it doesn't happen the second time
[2013-11-23 05:03:05 -0500] joelteon: great
[2013-11-23 05:03:07 -0500] joelteon: that's what i love about chef
[2013-11-23 06:07:50 -0500] ohadlevy: Zauberfisch23: did you see http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Chef-deployment
[2013-11-23 06:17:01 -0500] Zauberfisch23: ohadlevy: yes, someone in #theforeman posted that to me
[2013-11-23 06:17:02 -0500] Zauberfisch23: thanks
[2013-11-23 06:17:18 -0500] ohadlevy: Zauberfisch23: great, did it work out?
[2013-11-23 06:17:49 -0500] Zauberfisch23: haven't done it yet
[2013-11-23 06:17:57 -0500] Zauberfisch23: failing to install foreman at the moment
[2013-11-23 06:18:09 -0500] ohadlevy: on which platform?
[2013-11-23 06:18:16 -0500] Zauberfisch23: ubuntu 13.10
[2013-11-23 06:18:27 -0500] ohadlevy: using packages?
[2013-11-23 06:18:35 -0500] Zauberfisch23: yes
[2013-11-23 06:18:49 -0500] ohadlevy: any specific error? :)
[2013-11-23 06:19:01 -0500] Zauberfisch23:  Something went wrong! :P
[2013-11-23 06:19:03 -0500] Zauberfisch23: no, hold on
[2013-11-23 06:19:29 -0500] Zauberfisch23: http://paste2.org/nW9eFPZF
[2013-11-23 06:19:35 -0500] Zauberfisch23: just got that one
[2013-11-23 06:19:48 -0500] Zauberfisch23: just 30sec ago or so
[2013-11-23 06:20:37 -0500] Zauberfisch23: my first guess is that this installer is designed for redhat based systems and was not perfectly ported to debian
[2013-11-23 06:21:31 -0500] Zauberfisch23: while configurating the installer I saw a reference to "httpd" and replaced it with "apache2"
[2013-11-23 06:22:01 -0500] ohadlevy: Zauberfisch23: it should work, as it work cross platform, i assume its something else, whats in the install log?
[2013-11-23 06:23:27 -0500] Zauberfisch23: ohadlevy: same thing
[2013-11-23 06:23:36 -0500] Zauberfisch23: [ INFO 2013-11-23 06:16:49 main] E: Unable to locate package postgresql-client-unknown
[2013-11-23 06:24:47 -0500] Zauberfisch23: my guess is that "unknown" is suppose to be the version number, but puppet failed to find the required version number
[2013-11-23 06:24:50 -0500] ohadlevy: Zauberfisch23: ok, i guess better ask gwmngilfen at #theforeman, afaik, it should work... gotta go sadly
[2013-11-23 06:24:57 -0500] ohadlevy: thats harmless i guess
[2013-11-23 06:25:23 -0500] Zauberfisch23: ohadlevy: thanks, fair day to you
[2013-11-23 10:03:31 -0500] polysics: how do you people (if you do) speed up provisioning on Debian/Ubuntu?
[2013-11-23 10:03:48 -0500] polysics: is there a somewhat easy or recommended way to do something like cache apt packages?
[2013-11-23 10:05:34 -0500] slicknick: provisioning can mean many things ..
[2013-11-23 10:06:06 -0500] slicknick: many variables and things to consider
[2013-11-23 10:08:04 -0500] slicknick: physical or virtual? slap down base image template style and ship it? how far do you want to take it? post OS provisions?
[2013-11-23 10:08:08 -0500] slicknick: what it d00
[2013-11-23 10:11:20 -0500] polysics: I am mostly testing recipes on Kitchen
[2013-11-23 10:11:23 -0500] polysics: so Vagrant
[2013-11-23 10:11:53 -0500] polysics: I think I should possibly move all package resources in one spt, build a VM, and use that as a base box
[2013-11-23 10:25:13 -0500] slicknick: most likely. unclear and vague you are still while my disregarded & unacknowledged questions remain valid
[2013-11-23 10:26:13 -0500] slicknick: provisioning to you means what
[2013-11-23 14:47:03 -0500] efeldhusen: How do I upload an edited older version of an existing cookbook on the Chef that's in an alternate directory on my chef workstation?
[2013-11-23 14:48:29 -0500] slicknick: great questoin
[2013-11-23 14:49:05 -0500] slicknick: maybe you can specify the location via knife command options ?
[2013-11-23 14:54:52 -0500] efeldhusen: I think so, but I'm not completely sure and I don't want to mess up my Chef server
[2013-11-23 14:55:02 -0500] efeldhusen: I need a testing chef server I think ;-)
[2013-11-23 20:23:11 -0500] rcovarru: Hi everyone... My name is Renato, I'm from Chile... And y have a question for all... :)
[2013-11-23 20:23:41 -0500] rcovarru: I hope someone can give me a hand with this...
[2013-11-23 20:24:04 -0500] rcovarru: I have in default attributes in recipe1 some like default['recipe1']['ready'] = false  ... You can modify this attribute permanently in a handler (running at the end of chef-client) to another node then, to search for that attribute to true, find it?
[2013-11-23 20:32:44 -0500] rcovarru: any idea?
[2013-11-23 20:32:52 -0500] rcovarru: it's possible? :S
[2013-11-23 20:39:35 -0500] zeroXten: rcovarru: hmm, my understanding is that you're setting an attribute in one node then searching for it from another. in which case yes, that is possible
[2013-11-23 20:51:40 -0500] rcovarru: The default value is defined in recipe1 ... But I need to change the value of that attribute from a handler running to finish running chef-client. (change the attribute value only if the execution terminates successfully)
[2013-11-23 20:52:31 -0500] rcovarru: Thus ... another node, using another recipe, can find all nodes that have ended well.
[2013-11-23 20:52:50 -0500] adnichols: rcovarru: attributes are probably not well suited for this IMO
[2013-11-23 20:53:48 -0500] adnichols: rcovarru: you can probably find a way to make it work w/ the correct order of writing the attribute but it seems brittle - data bags seem like a better place to write info like this
[2013-11-23 20:53:59 -0500] rcovarru: But so far, all my tests ... have allowed me to change the value of the attribute in the chef-client execution, but does not appear modified for the other node.
[2013-11-23 20:54:39 -0500] adnichols: rcovarru: right, I'm not sure at what point the state of the attributes are saved on the chef server but it's probably not at the end of the run
[2013-11-23 20:54:51 -0500] adnichols: rcovarru: I'd guess it's after they've been merged
[2013-11-23 20:54:55 -0500] rcovarru: OMG!! You have right!!! databags are the right place to do this!! :)
[2013-11-23 20:56:14 -0500] rcovarru: I'll try that right now! :D
[2013-11-23 20:56:21 -0500] rcovarru: Thanks a lot adnichols!! :D
[2013-11-23 20:56:24 -0500] adnichols: ok, good luck
[2013-11-23 20:59:14 -0500] sascha_: Hi
