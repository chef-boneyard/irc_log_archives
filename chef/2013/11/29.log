[2013-11-29 03:05:51 -0500] sentience: Anyone here familiar with using Berkshelf to manage the cookbooks in a chef-repo?
[2013-11-29 05:34:17 -0500] TehRandom: evening gents
[2013-11-29 05:34:36 -0500] TehRandom: when i have a cookbook asking for "the php cookbook" as a pre-req is there one that's standard?
[2013-11-29 05:35:49 -0500] TehRandom: perhaps i should back up and ask... is anyone here awake and not turkey coma'd out? :)
[2013-11-29 05:42:11 -0500] Cope: A reasonable first approach is to search the community site
[2013-11-29 05:42:39 -0500] Cope: knife cookbook site search php
[2013-11-29 05:43:35 -0500] Cope: shows a large number of related cookbooks, and knife cookbook site show php
[2013-11-29 05:44:05 -0500] Cope: shows info about it, eg when last released, url, maintainer etc
[2013-11-29 05:44:52 -0500] TehRandom: i found many php cookbooks
[2013-11-29 05:45:12 -0500] Cope: the query will return all php-related cookbooks
[2013-11-29 05:45:32 -0500] TehRandom: the reason i ask is https://github.com/escapestudios/chef-newrelic
[2013-11-29 05:45:55 -0500] TehRandom: references : Installing the PHP agent? You'll need the php cookbook to be available.
[2013-11-29 05:46:08 -0500] TehRandom: but it's not linked to "the php cookbook" in question
[2013-11-29 05:46:17 -0500] TehRandom: i assume it means : https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/php
[2013-11-29 05:46:25 -0500] TehRandom: but i have no idea, and no one in #newrelic is awake
[2013-11-29 05:47:28 -0500] Cope:  I've not used that cookbook, but I think it's reasonable to assume in the absence of further clarification that it means 'the cookbook on the community website with the name `php`'
[2013-11-29 05:48:53 -0500] Cope: TBH I would expect it to be explicit if it *didn't* mean that
[2013-11-29 05:49:31 -0500] TehRandom: forgive my ignorance, but i'm very new to git and chef both
[2013-11-29 05:50:47 -0500] Cope: Chef is broadly built around the idea of cookbooks as shareable artefacts; the community site is the first place to start looking - cookbooks.opscode.com
[2013-11-29 05:51:18 -0500] Cope: there isn't a namespacing capability though, so whoever gets the name first gets the name
[2013-11-29 05:51:41 -0500] Cope: so someone random might have released a php cookbook 3 yrs ago and never maintained it
[2013-11-29 05:52:08 -0500] Cope: in that case the community would cluster around a cookbook with a differet name, eg php5
[2013-11-29 05:52:20 -0500] Cope: but you can usually tell by looking at the metadata
[2013-11-29 05:52:30 -0500] Cope: ie how many downloads, how many releases, cookbook rating etc
[2013-11-29 05:52:45 -0500] Cope: in this case 'php' is the maintained, common cookbook
[2013-11-29 05:53:26 -0500] Cope: and any cookbook depending on a PHP cookbook would almost certainly be meaning that one; if it didn't want you to use that one, it would explicitly say so.
[2013-11-29 05:54:33 -0500] TehRandom: so the opscode one that i linked is almost assuredly the one i want?
[2013-11-29 06:00:24 -0500] Cope: yes
[2013-11-29 06:01:48 -0500] TehRandom: koo, i will try to incooperate that to my repository and see if that makes the agent hapyp
[2013-11-29 06:01:52 -0500] TehRandom: happy even... thanks guys
[2013-11-29 06:06:11 -0500] Cope: TehRandom: welcome; one thing, If I may... I'm sure you did it without meaning, but when you language like 'gents' and (to a lesser extent) 'guys', I feel uncomfortable because I need to feel like Chef is an inclusive community. I'd prefer it if you used less gender-specific terms. Would you mind using something more obviously neutral in future?
[2013-11-29 06:06:31 -0500] TehRandom: sure
[2013-11-29 06:07:12 -0500] Cope: TehRandom: I'll be around for the rest of the day (morning in the UK), so sing out if you need any more help.
