[2013-05-11 07:04:37 -0400] Guest48902: Theres a lot of names with y in them
[2013-05-11 07:30:26 -0400] dsdeiz: hey all, is application_nginx entirely different with the nginx cookbook?
[2013-05-11 07:30:38 -0400] dsdeiz: im a little confused as to what they mean by 'reverse proxy'
[2013-05-11 07:30:56 -0400] dsdeiz: not sure if i need application_nginx if i just wanted to use nginx as a simple web server
[2013-05-11 08:21:44 -0400] dsdeiz: do i need application_nginx to have nginx act as a simple web server?
[2013-05-11 09:27:50 -0400] dsdeiz: hey all, how do i override a cookbook's attribute from a custom cookbook?
[2013-05-11 12:54:59 -0400] _aeris_: Hello everybody !
[2013-05-11 12:55:20 -0400] _aeris_: i have some trouble with chef, all what i upload fail with a SignatureDoesNotMatch
[2013-05-11 12:55:36 -0400] _aeris_: Chef: 11.4.4
[2013-05-11 12:55:48 -0400] _aeris_: chef-server 11.0.8-1.ubuntu.11.04
[2013-05-11 13:07:53 -0400] flipture_: _aeris_: What command are you using to upload?
[2013-05-11 13:08:16 -0400] _aeris_: knife cookbook upload
[2013-05-11 13:10:13 -0400] flipture: _aeris_: with cookbook name afterwards? and are you using berkshelf?
[2013-05-11 13:10:51 -0400] _aeris_: yep, with name after, and i don't know for bookshelf
[2013-05-11 13:11:01 -0400] _aeris_: just install chef-server from scratch
[2013-05-11 13:11:03 -0400] flipture: _aeris_: reason i ask is i see something  similar here: https://github.com/RiotGames/berkshelf/issues/409
[2013-05-11 13:11:30 -0400] flipture: they are using berkshelf however and say that ridley was the cause. so not sure if its related to what you're seeing
[2013-05-11 13:12:01 -0400] _aeris_: not using berkshelf
[2013-05-11 13:13:54 -0400] mmack: hey guys, i have a problem with a deploy resource... in a before_restart block i do a rvm_shell bundle install.... it runs without an error but if i start my app a little bit later i get an error that not all of my gems are checked out...
[2013-05-11 13:14:24 -0400] mmack: (especially a private github resource...)
[2013-05-11 13:14:47 -0400] mmack: but if i do a bundle install on the box myself it works like expected...
[2013-05-11 13:14:53 -0400] flipture: _aeris_: can you try running the command with -VV option? i.e. knife cookbook -VV upload..... to get some more info?
[2013-05-11 13:15:01 -0400] _aeris_: yep !
[2013-05-11 13:17:56 -0400] _aeris_: http://pastebin.com/EK72rTdM
[2013-05-11 13:17:59 -0400] _aeris_: here we go !
[2013-05-11 13:23:47 -0400] flipture: _aeris_: well its pretty clear that your signature keys arent matching whats being generated but i'm not quite sure how to troubleshoot that. I'm poking around a bit on google so see if i can find anything similar...
[2013-05-11 13:24:11 -0400] _aeris_: even if i create a cookbook from scratch, unable to upload it
[2013-05-11 13:26:00 -0400] flipture: _aeris_: maybe client key is bad? Take a look here: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Common+Errors
[2013-05-11 13:26:25 -0400] _aeris_: i already regenerate all private key :(
[2013-05-11 13:26:36 -0400] flipture: this page describes problems with 401's  and you're seeing 403's so not sure..
[2013-05-11 13:26:36 -0400] flipture: ah ok
[2013-05-11 13:26:51 -0400] flipture: you sure its using the correct public key that matches?
[2013-05-11 13:27:43 -0400] mmack: is there a example for a chef deploy and bundle install? Can't get this damn thing to work....
[2013-05-11 13:28:26 -0400] flipture: mmack: i'm a little lost on that one. i might poke around in a few and see if i find sonething...
[2013-05-11 13:30:22 -0400] flipture: _aeris_: did you see the section specific to 403's? http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Common+Errors#CommonErrors-403Forbidden
[2013-05-11 13:33:28 -0400] flipture: mmack: take a look here... http://baldowl.github.io/2010/11/08/using-chef-and-bundler-together.html
[2013-05-11 13:33:38 -0400] mmack: thx, i do...
[2013-05-11 13:40:31 -0400] _aeris_: flipture > strange, node, databag or role upload without problem ><
[2013-05-11 13:40:41 -0400] _aeris_: just cookbook fail
[2013-05-11 13:43:31 -0400] flipture: _aeris_: odd, so whats the difference between auth for role upload and cookbook upload... we should compare your output to a successful knife cookbook upload output with verbose on.
[2013-05-11 13:45:53 -0400] flipture: _aeris_: can you run a knife role upload with verbose and compare? See if its using the same auth method. Its using AWSAccessKeyId, is that hitting amazon?
[2013-05-11 13:46:11 -0400] _aeris_: no, i don't use amazon
[2013-05-11 13:46:21 -0400] _aeris_: seems internal way to process for chef
[2013-05-11 13:46:41 -0400] flipture: _aeris_: gotcha.
[2013-05-11 13:47:34 -0400] _aeris_: http://pastebin.com/BuR874eK
[2013-05-11 13:47:39 -0400] _aeris_: not very usefull :D
[2013-05-11 13:48:33 -0400] flipture: _aeris_: have you tried deleting the cookbook from your server then reuploading? maybe the auth code is different for some reason?
[2013-05-11 13:48:43 -0400] flipture: _aeris_: and yeah, output was a bit short :)
[2013-05-11 13:49:02 -0400] _aeris_: i have no cookbook on the server
[2013-05-11 13:49:04 -0400] _aeris_: fresh install
[2013-05-11 13:49:08 -0400] flipture: ah
[2013-05-11 13:49:34 -0400] flipture: let me see if i can run a cookbook upload on mine and get the verbose output...
[2013-05-11 13:49:48 -0400] flipture: i have a fresh install on a box here at home...
[2013-05-11 13:50:10 -0400] flipture: i'm currently fighting with using the same rabbitmq server for openstack and chef tho so not sure of the state of my server :)
[2013-05-11 13:50:50 -0400] _aeris_: :D
[2013-05-11 13:51:02 -0400] _aeris_: same step for me after that :D
[2013-05-11 13:51:13 -0400] _aeris_: for rmq, postgres and nginx->apache
[2013-05-11 13:51:20 -0400] flipture: nice :)
[2013-05-11 13:52:01 -0400] flipture: time for breakfast... brb
[2013-05-11 13:52:14 -0400] flipture: tried and my server is down, need to fix rabbit :)
[2013-05-11 15:07:45 -0400] flipture: _aeris_: you ever get anywhere with your issue?
[2013-05-11 15:08:10 -0400] forkit: hi, anyone have any insight to this.. Ok i'm playing with aws's opsworks stacks. I have an HAproxy layer, and then a layer with 3 node.js servers.... Each node.js server is in a different availability zone, with load balanced auto scaling set up... I'm under the impression that I can 'boot the instances' and then have this setup 'stop' instances if the load is below my thresholds.. or start up the other preconfigured instances once we surpass 
[2013-05-11 15:15:58 -0400] cjerdonek: is there an "empty" resource that can be used for doing nothing?
[2013-05-11 16:42:39 -0400] jdguzman: hello all.
[2013-05-11 16:43:31 -0400] jdguzman: wondering if I could get some help with an issue I'm having.  I am trying to deploy a new vps on rackspace and using knife it keeps failing on the bootstrapping part.
[2013-05-11 16:43:42 -0400] jdguzman: Bootstrapping Chef on 50.57.186.72
[2013-05-11 16:44:00 -0400] jdguzman: I see that but then I just get the prompt back and if I ssh into the box chef is not on it.
[2013-05-11 17:24:42 -0400] _aeris_: flipture > this is the first time i see this kind of error
[2013-05-11 17:24:55 -0400] _aeris_: but before that, i used chef 10
[2013-05-11 17:25:08 -0400] _aeris_: first time on chef 11, and totally unusable ><

[2013-05-11 17:43:22 -0400] MartinCleaver: Noone seems to be awake in #vagrant, so I'll try my luck here: In Vagrant, should sharing a unix domain socket from guest to host work?
[2013-05-11 17:44:02 -0400] zts1: MartinCleaver: I wouldn't think so
[2013-05-11 17:45:00 -0400] MartinCleaver: thanks zts
[2013-05-11 17:45:09 -0400] MartinCleaver: I did find http://www.bringhurst.org/2013/04/01/serial-console-access-to-a-vagrant-virtualbox-vm.html which implied that workarounds were necessary.
[2013-05-11 17:52:48 -0400] MartinCleaver: In Vagrant, if I port-forward from my host mac to a guest, would postgres see this as accesses from 127.0.0.1 ?
