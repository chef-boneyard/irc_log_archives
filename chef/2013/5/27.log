[2013-05-27 01:06:43 -0400] kenke: Hi all, I met got the following error : address family not supported by protocol - socket(2). I did not do any change. just executed chef-client twice on a node, the previous one worked but all the subsequent tries failed, can someone tell me the root cause for this error?
[2013-05-27 01:08:37 -0400] ssd7: kenke: We'll probably need a bit more information.  Can you post the full error message to something like gist or pastebin
[2013-05-27 01:13:07 -0400] kenke: Hi ssd7 please have a look at https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5654664
[2013-05-27 01:16:35 -0400] rafaelmagu: Does anyone here store number of servers in a Graphite counter?
[2013-05-27 01:16:58 -0400] rafaelmagu: I want to track how many app servers I have at any given time
[2013-05-27 01:41:02 -0400] zackf: ohai
[2013-05-27 02:01:11 -0400] ssd7: kenke: Apologies, my connection dropped.  I would check for problems in your client.rb configuration file
[2013-05-27 02:01:16 -0400] ssd7: specifically chef_server_url
[2013-05-27 02:50:38 -0400] jeremyolliver: Hey, can anyone sanity check this for me? I've got a helper function that returns nodes via a search, but when I store that in a local variable in a ruby_block somehow it's empty
[2013-05-27 02:50:48 -0400] jeremyolliver: Cookbook looks like this: https://gist.github.com/jeremyolliver/5654957
[2013-05-27 02:51:05 -0400] jeremyolliver: The log from within the helper function returns 2 nodes
[2013-05-27 02:51:26 -0400] jeremyolliver: the log in the ruby_block which is an instance variable of the same return value, is empty
[2013-05-27 08:05:29 -0400] oles_: Is there any way to check if a spesific package is installed on a system using Chef, if there isn't a recipe defined for that particular package ?
[2013-05-27 08:14:34 -0400] isbaran: oles_: package resource does the installation, you can check how it finds out if a package is installed
[2013-05-27 08:30:24 -0400] Alsmack: Anyone have familiarity with the knife-ec2 plugin, bootstrapping and encrypted data bags?
[2013-05-27 08:30:45 -0400] isbaran: Alsmack: using for a while
[2013-05-27 08:30:48 -0400] Alsmack: I can't seem to prepopulate my encrypted_data_bag_secret file when using the knife-ec2 plugin
[2013-05-27 08:31:00 -0400] Alsmack: I'm just totally lost on how to get this done properly
[2013-05-27 08:31:46 -0400] Alsmack: isbaran: How do you go about populating the secret file on the fresh server?
[2013-05-27 08:32:39 -0400] Alsmack: I feel like I'm completely missing something in the docs~
[2013-05-27 08:36:15 -0400] Alsmack: I tried passing it in as a json option, and it shows up in the first-boot.json but doesn't get used.
[2013-05-27 08:39:10 -0400] isbaran: Alsmack: i'm using plain data bag, just had a quick look at documentation, and i think i would put the secret file somewhere on s3 and load it in recipe as in the example
[2013-05-27 08:40:44 -0400] Alsmack: Yeah; so I'm getting it through to the server in the first-boot json data, so I can do it that way too I guess.  My recipe just isn't cooperating as it wants to use the file.  Going to see if I can work around that.
[2013-05-27 08:40:48 -0400] isbaran: This is the way i get validation.pem on fresh instances
[2013-05-27 08:49:43 -0400] isbaran: i'm new to ruby and i wonder why symbols aren't heavily used in recipes ? i was just checking apache cookbook and all definitions are like default['apache'] etc.
[2013-05-27 09:13:36 -0400] gigo1980: hi all, i am new to chef ( i have server , nodes, workstation) running. now i have to kinds of postfix server (some are satelites and some are smarthosts) how can i configure this. should i have to write to cookbooks that add the dependancy to postfix ?
[2013-05-27 09:15:28 -0400] isbaran: gigo1980: knife cookbook site install postix, and check if it suits you, if not, create your own cookbook (ex. mypostfix) to extend it
[2013-05-27 09:25:38 -0400] dyu: is there an option for knife that behaves like chef-client's -j?
[2013-05-27 09:26:16 -0400] isbaran: dyu: ec2 plugin has one
[2013-05-27 09:33:13 -0400] dyu: hmm
[2013-05-27 09:33:24 -0400] Alsmack: isbaran:  I figured out a way to do it purely through knife.  It doesn't seem to be documented other than in a comment in this source file: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/bootstrap.rb  You can specify an option and it will take care of putting the file where it needs to be before bootstrapping.
[2013-05-27 09:33:32 -0400] dyu: i specifically just need it for bootstrappng
[2013-05-27 09:33:50 -0400] isbaran: dyu: knife ec2 server create -j file passes file to chef-client on execution
[2013-05-27 09:33:52 -0400] Alsmack: dyu: yes
[2013-05-27 09:34:10 -0400] Alsmack: Isbaran beat me to it =)
[2013-05-27 09:34:19 -0400] dyu: does it work if we're not using ec2?
[2013-05-27 09:34:49 -0400] isbaran: you should check your clouds plugin i guess
[2013-05-27 09:35:08 -0400] dyu: we're deploying to actual physical machines
[2013-05-27 09:35:18 -0400] Alsmack: knife bootstrap -j does the same thing
[2013-05-27 09:35:34 -0400] dyu: can you give an example of knife bootstrap -?
[2013-05-27 09:35:43 -0400] dyu: i keep on trying but it doesn't seem to work for me
[2013-05-27 09:36:08 -0400] Alsmack: I don't use bootstrap directly since I deploy only to ec2 machines, thus I use ec2 plugin that bundles in the bootstrapping
[2013-05-27 09:36:14 -0400] Alsmack: but I know the option is there
[2013-05-27 09:36:23 -0400] Alsmack: What do you mean it "doesn't seem to work" - where is it failing?
[2013-05-27 09:37:03 -0400] dyu: one moment. i'll reproduce the problem
[2013-05-27 09:38:17 -0400] isbaran: Alsmack: are you gonna use knife[:secret_file] ?
[2013-05-27 09:40:09 -0400] Alsmack: isbaran: yes, it's working great for me.
[2013-05-27 09:41:39 -0400] dyu: Alsmack: .rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p362/gems/json-1.7.6/lib/json/common.rb:155:in `parse': 757: unexpected token at './user.json' (JSON::ParserError)
[2013-05-27 09:41:42 -0400] gigo1980: on an cookbook i have multiple receipts. is it posible to run on one server this receipts and on an other this receipts ? and where should i place the configfiles for a downloaded cookbook ?
[2013-05-27 09:42:55 -0400] Alsmack: dyu: What command are you running to produce that; that's just a simple issue in whatever json it's trying to read
[2013-05-27 09:43:17 -0400] dyu: knife bootstrap
[2013-05-27 09:43:29 -0400] Alsmack: is the json what you added with the -j option?
[2013-05-27 09:43:41 -0400] dyu: it's a json file
[2013-05-27 09:43:45 -0400] Alsmack: you have to be careful about bash quoting messing up what the files are actually using
[2013-05-27 09:43:59 -0400] Alsmack: -j expects a string of json
[2013-05-27 09:44:04 -0400] dyu: ohh
[2013-05-27 09:44:07 -0400] Alsmack: not a file
[2013-05-27 09:44:08 -0400] dyu: i'll try again
[2013-05-27 09:44:17 -0400] Alsmack: protip: use single quotes surrounding your json
[2013-05-27 09:44:39 -0400] Alsmack: so, knife bootstrap ... -j '{"somekey": "somevalue"}'
[2013-05-27 09:44:45 -0400] Alsmack: to avoid bash messing up your json string
[2013-05-27 09:45:06 -0400] Alsmack: i just fought that a bit earlier because i totally forgot about {} spawning a shell in bash
[2013-05-27 09:45:35 -0400] dyu: i still get an unexpected token error
[2013-05-27 09:45:50 -0400] Alsmack: trying it with really dumb values like i did, just to see
[2013-05-27 09:45:59 -0400] Alsmack: before trying to parse your file or what not
[2013-05-27 09:47:15 -0400] dyu: it works now
[2013-05-27 09:48:48 -0400] dyu: Alsmack: thanks!
[2013-05-27 09:49:02 -0400] dyu: had to try out different quoting and escaping combinations
[2013-05-27 09:49:18 -0400] Alsmack: yep, gotta watch it bash will bite you if you don't think it through =)
[2013-05-27 09:51:07 -0400] isbaran: gigo1980: checkout roles, also you don't edit config files in cookbooks, but use attributes to provide values
[2013-05-27 10:00:18 -0400] Alsmack: isbaran: one thing to note about using knife[:secret_file] - it apparantly can modify your file.  my original secret file has new lines in it and is 11 bytes larger than the one knife delivered to the server
[2013-05-27 10:01:02 -0400] Alsmack: the text is the same, but i guess it loads it and does some chomps or something.
[2013-05-27 10:17:16 -0400] gigo1980: @isbaran where does i set this attributes ? in which file ? or in which part of the frontend of the server
[2013-05-27 10:22:32 -0400] jacobat: Anyone got Chef running with Ruby 2.0?
[2013-05-27 10:28:01 -0400] dyu: where are knife plugins stored?
[2013-05-27 10:28:09 -0400] dyu: and where's the configuration file that points to that location?
[2013-05-27 10:31:13 -0400] gigo1980: http://www.dafont.com/
[2013-05-27 10:31:19 -0400] gigo1980: das ist vertrauenswrdig
[2013-05-27 10:31:32 -0400] gigo1980: sorry wrong window
[2013-05-27 10:47:02 -0400] dyu: i'm looking at this page
[2013-05-27 10:47:03 -0400] dyu: http://docs.opscode.com/plugin_knife_custom.html
[2013-05-27 10:47:10 -0400] dyu: specifically the bottom part
[2013-05-27 10:47:42 -0400] dyu: i copied my simple plugin(just prints out "hello world") to the two directories specified, but nothing happens
[2013-05-27 10:47:47 -0400] dyu: any hints?
[2013-05-27 10:47:56 -0400] dyu: also, would it still work if it was just a symlink?
[2013-05-27 10:54:32 -0400] dyu: nevermind
[2013-05-27 10:54:46 -0400] dyu: it turns out that i have to follow the naming convention so knife can find them
[2013-05-27 10:57:48 -0400] dyu: symlinking also works
[2013-05-27 11:28:26 -0400] mikeywaites1: hey guys im having a ton of trouble trying to install nginx from source using the nginx recipe from opscode, wondering if any can help?
[2013-05-27 11:29:27 -0400] aruntomar: mikeywaites1: i wanted to try the same. let me try it. i'll update you in sometime.
[2013-05-27 11:30:00 -0400] mikeywaites1: aruntomar:  awesome
[2013-05-27 11:30:17 -0400] mikeywaites1: im running ubuntu 12.04 via vagrant atm
[2013-05-27 11:30:27 -0400] mikeywaites1: specifically im after the spdy module
[2013-05-27 11:30:42 -0400] mikeywaites1: ill paste up my nginx recipe attrs im using
[2013-05-27 11:31:03 -0400] aruntomar: mikeywaites1: so are you able to install nginx?
[2013-05-27 11:31:28 -0400] aruntomar: for source i mean, or you are stuck at the installation part itself
[2013-05-27 11:31:52 -0400] mikeywaites1: aruntomar:  its seems to be changing whats its breaking on as i try differnt settings
[2013-05-27 11:31:55 -0400] mikeywaites1: currently
[2013-05-27 11:32:05 -0400] mikeywaites1: STDERR: tar: This does not look like a tar archive
[2013-05-27 11:32:05 -0400] mikeywaites1: tar: Skipping to next header
[2013-05-27 11:32:05 -0400] mikeywaites1: tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors

[2013-05-27 11:32:06 -0400] mikeywaites1: Ran "bash"  "/tmp/chef-script20130527-6653-ao11f9-0" returned 2
[2013-05-27 11:32:21 -0400] mikeywaites1: aruntomar:  i just need to change networks BRB
[2013-05-27 11:42:15 -0400] mikeywaites: aruntomar:  sorry about that had to get off the train :)
[2013-05-27 11:43:02 -0400] mikeywaites: so its worth mentioning i had nginx installed before which i  have purged and removed.  now whenever i try to install from source its freaks out with that error i pasted above
[2013-05-27 11:44:02 -0400] mikeywaites: aruntomar:  http://dpaste.com/1201069/ these are the arguments im passing to the nginx recipe
[2013-05-27 11:44:17 -0400] mikeywaites: and im just including the nginx::source in my run list
[2013-05-27 11:49:41 -0400] aruntomar: mikeywaites: k, i was able to install nginx from source finally
[2013-05-27 11:49:53 -0400] aruntomar: but i had done it without all the attributes that you passed
[2013-05-27 11:52:48 -0400] mikeywaites: hmmmm yeh wonder whats making it freak?  it thinks the downloaded tar is not a valid tar file
[2013-05-27 11:53:55 -0400] aruntomar: currently it's install 1.2.6
[2013-05-27 11:54:01 -0400] aruntomar: let me try with your parameters also
[2013-05-27 11:54:10 -0400] mikeywaites: yeh i need 1.4.1 for spdy support
[2013-05-27 11:55:23 -0400] aruntomar: mikeywaites: spdy?
[2013-05-27 11:57:18 -0400] aruntomar: mikeywaites: k, found it, spdy protocol
[2013-05-27 11:57:42 -0400] aruntomar: mikeywaites: anyways, i want to install from source, so that i can use it with google pagespeed
[2013-05-27 12:01:08 -0400] mikeywaites: aruntomar:  ah cool
[2013-05-27 12:01:30 -0400] mikeywaites: yeh 1.4.1 is the min version for spdy support + support for reverse web sockets
[2013-05-27 12:14:56 -0400] aruntomar: mikeywaites: k, so installation is complete, but it tries to start the service it fails
[2013-05-27 12:15:18 -0400] aruntomar: mikeywaites: b'cas it can't find the directories /var/lib/nginx/body and so on
[2013-05-27 12:17:18 -0400] mikeywaites: yeh i think i have it working now
[2013-05-27 12:17:28 -0400] mikeywaites: just having issues with the flags not being picked up
[2013-05-27 12:17:45 -0400] gigo1980: does anyone configure postfix as satelite (postfix-client) and smarthost (postfix-server) ?
[2013-05-27 12:19:31 -0400] aruntomar: gigo1980: yes
[2013-05-27 12:20:08 -0400] gigo1980: ok at my system it does alway overrite the relayhost with []
[2013-05-27 12:20:32 -0400] gigo1980: so i create a role relayhost ( where add the receipt postfix-server)
[2013-05-27 12:20:52 -0400] gigo1980: and on one of the clients i add postfix-client
[2013-05-27 12:21:43 -0400] gigo1980: but if i rune chef-client on the "postfix-client" i always get relayhost = []
[2013-05-27 12:24:51 -0400] gigo1980: ok now i have in my config relayhost = [127.0.0.2]
[2013-05-27 12:25:18 -0400] gigo1980: but it should be something like relayhost = [172.16.21.11]
[2013-05-27 12:25:47 -0400] aruntomar: gigo1980: override the attribs node['postfix']['relayhost'] with the ip you want
[2013-05-27 12:27:22 -0400] gigo1980: on the "client-node" ?
[2013-05-27 12:27:41 -0400] gigo1980: that does not work, i do this in the webpannel from chef server
[2013-05-27 12:28:10 -0400] gigo1980: after i run chef-client on the server it reset the value in the chef server
[2013-05-27 12:30:18 -0400] aruntomar: gigo1980: http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_attributes.html
[2013-05-27 12:31:38 -0400] gigo1980: how do you setup this on your system ?
[2013-05-27 12:46:48 -0400] gigo1980: where do you setup your attributes, also in the chef server webpannel ?
[2013-05-27 12:48:41 -0400] aruntomar: gigo1980: the simplest solution would be to create a role, and override the attributes there.
[2013-05-27 12:50:52 -0400] gigo1980: so i have problem with overwriting the attributes.. so i create a postfix object and in side thie an relayhost object right ?

[2013-05-27 13:10:05 -0400] aruntomar: shutchie: you need to first create the directory in which you want to clone the app.
[2013-05-27 13:10:49 -0400] shutchie: aruntomar: ah ok. can i do that in that same gist?
[2013-05-27 13:11:09 -0400] aruntomar: shutchie: also, in the repository resource "give the proper path to your git repo"
[2013-05-27 13:11:40 -0400] aruntomar: shutchie: yes, you can use the same gist, or you can add comments also
[2013-05-27 13:14:17 -0400] shutchie: aruntomar: thanks. if i want to clone branch "development". is it reference "development" or revision "development"
[2013-05-27 13:14:23 -0400] shutchie: or remote "development"
[2013-05-27 13:15:47 -0400] aruntomar: shutchie: reference The alias for revision. This action only works with the git provider.

[2013-05-27 13:34:36 -0400] shutchie: aruntomar: just using chef solo with vagrant?
[2013-05-27 13:35:14 -0400] aruntomar: shutchie: chef-solo, chef-client etc... are all part of the chef gem
[2013-05-27 13:35:40 -0400] gigo1980: where do you place your configfiles (attributes) for chef. it works but is it also posible to have this in the filestructure ?
[2013-05-27 13:37:20 -0400] shutchie: aruntomar: i just used the latest installer on the opscode website
[2013-05-27 13:39:21 -0400] aruntomar: gigo1980: https://github.com/opscode/chef-repo
[2013-05-27 13:40:09 -0400] shutchie: aruntomar: ok the sync is working, now to setup ssh git keys in a databag!
[2013-05-27 13:40:42 -0400] aruntomar: shutchie: which OS?
[2013-05-27 13:40:55 -0400] shutchie: aruntomar: this machine is win8
[2013-05-27 13:41:39 -0400] aruntomar: shutchie: https://opscode-omnibus-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/windows/2008r2/x86_64/chef-client-11.4.4-2.windows.msi
[2013-05-27 13:41:52 -0400] gigo1980: @aruntomar i have the chef-repo. but in which folder should i store the files ?
[2013-05-27 13:42:27 -0400] gigo1980: and is it posible to extract the confi settings from the chef server to my repository ?
[2013-05-27 13:43:15 -0400] aruntomar: gigo1980: inside cookbooks folder create cookbooks "knife cookbook create <cookbook name>"
[2013-05-27 13:43:29 -0400] aruntomar: gigo1980: that creates a directory structure for you
[2013-05-27 13:44:03 -0400] gigo1980: and in that i also can set the config params for existing cookbooks ?
[2013-05-27 14:35:28 -0400] shutchie: aruntomar: thats the one i used :/
[2013-05-27 15:18:17 -0400] nd__: Can someone guide me a bit about enabling, starting and reloading services in the best possible way? I often have the problem that I try to action [:enable, :start] which sometimes fails Is there a best (idempotent) way?
[2013-05-27 15:58:49 -0400] isbaran: nd__: what do you mean fails ?
[2013-05-27 16:15:33 -0400] alex88: hi guys, how could I use a gem (e.g. mysql) inside a chef recipe?
[2013-05-27 16:15:51 -0400] isbaran: alex88: use with chef_gem resource
[2013-05-27 16:16:02 -0400] alex88: isbaran: oh awesome :) thanks!
[2013-05-27 16:16:14 -0400] isbaran: gem_package installs globally
[2013-05-27 16:17:03 -0400] nd__: isbaran: Well, I just had it with one cookbook but haven't logged the output. I define a service with action :nothing and :enable, :start the cookbook somewhere in the middle, then :reload after writing configuration. Is that the correct approach?
[2013-05-27 16:17:13 -0400] alex88: isbaran: great also that, thanks a lot!
[2013-05-27 16:17:53 -0400] isbaran: nd__: is this a custom service you wrote ?
[2013-05-27 16:18:40 -0400] isbaran: if you included recipes in order, it should work, be aware of the resource collection of chef
[2013-05-27 16:18:46 -0400] nd__: I guess so. I wrote a recipe for OpenSMTPD which has it's init file in upstart. I use a service for that to trigger :reload etc.
[2013-05-27 16:18:52 -0400] alex88: isbaran: but, if I install it via apt-get install ruby-mysql?
[2013-05-27 16:19:36 -0400] alex88: just to don't care about deps etc?
[2013-05-27 16:20:48 -0400] alex88: seems that installing via apt-get gives "no such file to load -- mysql" but works fine on terminal
[2013-05-27 16:21:16 -0400] stonevil: why chef official documentation so outdated? and not consistent?
[2013-05-27 16:22:23 -0400] isbaran: alex88: of course you can use package resource, it'll install deps. too
[2013-05-27 16:22:50 -0400] alex88: isbaran: yeah my idea was to use that since it's easier on opsworks and I don't have to install also compiler and so on..
[2013-05-27 16:23:17 -0400] isbaran: but if you'll use a gem in chef recipes, you should use chef_gem, chef has its own ruby environment
[2013-05-27 16:23:29 -0400] isbaran: global installations wont work in that cas
[2013-05-27 16:23:31 -0400] isbaran: vase*
[2013-05-27 16:23:34 -0400] isbaran: ah case* :D
[2013-05-27 16:23:44 -0400] alex88: isbaran: so still have to install gem that way?
[2013-05-27 16:24:02 -0400] isbaran: alex88: yes, if you want to use ruby code in recipe
[2013-05-27 16:24:15 -0400] isbaran: like "require" the library
[2013-05-27 16:24:50 -0400] isbaran: if you need it from outside of chef, for ex. your own script, you can use whatever you like
[2013-05-27 16:25:09 -0400] alex88: isbaran: yeah but it will compile the gem, not use the system defined... ok, I'll install then also other things
[2013-05-27 16:25:17 -0400] alex88: like build-essentials and so on
[2013-05-27 16:26:09 -0400] isbaran: yes i put all of them in AMI so nothing much is needed
[2013-05-27 16:26:27 -0400] alex88: isbaran: well I'm going to use amazon opsworks so no custom AMIs
[2013-05-27 16:27:53 -0400] alex88: isbaran: last problem, on amazon I'm using their way to install packages, so locally I created a vagrant recipe to install deps...now I want to run it before the compile (and so the chef_gem) of the mysql gem
[2013-05-27 16:28:00 -0400] alex88: else I don't have the required packages
[2013-05-27 16:28:22 -0400] alex88: to build it
[2013-05-27 16:28:30 -0400] isbaran: alex88: i guess you can include it in vagrant file ?
[2013-05-27 16:29:18 -0400] alex88: isbaran: I did, but the vagrant recipe isn't executed before the one I'm developing gets compiled. so it tries to compile, install mysql gem before the vagrant recipe is executed
[2013-05-27 16:29:51 -0400] alex88: and so, before the dependencies are installed via apt-get
[2013-05-27 16:29:53 -0400] isbaran: sorry i'd give it a try but gotto switch networks
[2013-05-27 16:48:00 -0400] gyre007: guys, anyone familiar with this blog posts ? http://realityforge.org/code/2012/07/17/lwrp-notify-on-changed-resources.html
[2013-05-27 16:48:19 -0400] gyre007: I'm trying to find a way how to notify some resource when LWRP is updated by any of the subresources...
[2013-05-27 16:49:04 -0400] gyre007: I take it that if I use somethin like what is in that blog post all I need is to notify from the LWRP as oppose to from particular subresources...
[2013-05-27 17:17:50 -0400] patcon_: schisamo: hey dude, just wondering what the long-term plan is for vagrant-omnibus -- the way you namespaced it makes me think that maaaaaybe you're in talks with the puppet folks to use it for them as well
[2013-05-27 17:18:15 -0400] patcon_: And I caught this: https://github.com/andytinycat/puppet-omnibus
[2013-05-27 17:18:36 -0400] patcon_: sounds like it's doable and sensible with a few pull requests
[2013-05-27 17:19:14 -0400] patcon_: I'm just in the process of forking vagrant-omnibus and converting it to vagrant-puppet-install, but currently thinking puppetlabs' pkg repos are the best route
[2013-05-27 18:15:38 -0400] patcon_: schisamo: here's a super rough PoC: https://github.com/patcon/vagrant-puppet-install
[2013-05-27 18:16:19 -0400] patcon_: not sure if you want to concern yourself with how a general plugin could help install various other provisioners, but what the hey :)
[2013-05-27 19:24:50 -0400] gigo1980: hi i only need an receipt for setting some attributes for other coobooks / receipts
[2013-05-27 19:25:29 -0400] gigo1980: is it the right way to create an cookbook for doing that, without logic only set the attributes file ?
[2013-05-27 19:25:35 -0400] gigo1980: or how should i do that ?
[2013-05-27 20:17:21 -0400] ssd7: Ohai Chefs
[2013-05-27 20:19:50 -0400] coderanger: ssd7: Did you see someone on the ML was having the same issue as you were talking to sethvargo about yesterday?
[2013-05-27 20:21:24 -0400] ssd7: Ah, I did not.  I'll respond to that now.  We should maybe send a more general message out about that one....or just fix Chef server.
[2013-05-27 20:25:42 -0400] alex88: before chef_gem what should have I used to use a custom gem? e.g. mysql?
[2013-05-27 20:27:04 -0400] alex88: since opsworks uses chef 0.9 and chef_gem is not there
[2013-05-27 20:27:07 -0400] alex88: maybe gem_package?
[2013-05-27 20:27:08 -0400] ssd7: alex88: likely gem_package at compile time, Gem.clear_path, and then require 'mysql'.
[2013-05-27 20:27:53 -0400] alex88: ssd7: oh ok let me try that, execution time couldn't work? since I install build deps in another recipe :)
[2013-05-27 20:28:40 -0400] ssd7: alex88: The exact timing really just depends on when you need to require and use it
[2013-05-27 20:28:55 -0400] alex88: ssd7: well I need to use in execution time
[2013-05-27 20:28:56 -0400] alex88: not before
[2013-05-27 20:30:27 -0400] alex88: ok thanks ssd7, that works fine! now let me see if it works fine on opsworks too
[2013-05-27 20:33:51 -0400] ssd7: coderanger: Responded to that ML tread.
[2013-05-27 20:35:10 -0400] coderanger: ssd7: thanky :)
[2013-05-27 20:49:14 -0400] alex88: ssd7: on local vagrant machine it worked fine, on amazon opsworks gives exception http://pastie.org/7970732
[2013-05-27 20:50:02 -0400] alex88: that seems so strange
[2013-05-27 20:50:17 -0400] alex88: it says it's installed but fails on require
[2013-05-27 20:50:30 -0400] alex88: maybe because the clear path issued before it?
[2013-05-27 20:58:35 -0400] ssd7: alex88: I'm not yet that familiar with the opswork setup, but the first thing I would look for is whether the system ruby is different from the ruby that chef is running under
[2013-05-27 20:59:12 -0400] alex88: ssd7: actually, just ssh'ed into machine, apt-get install anythin doesn't work, seen that gem and ruby are in /usr/local/bin/
[2013-05-27 20:59:14 -0400] alex88: so something custom
[2013-05-27 20:59:29 -0400] alex88: did gem install mysql and worked fine, both require 'mysql' and chef run
[2013-05-27 20:59:51 -0400] gigo1980: i have a receipt that should create on an other physical server an mysql user
[2013-05-27 21:00:11 -0400] alex88: don't get why "Found installed gem mysql version 2.8.1 matching mysql (>= 0)" and still the exception
[2013-05-27 21:01:37 -0400] alex88: btw unfortunately opsworks is just old ruby with old chef :) but they're saying it will be updated soon
[2013-05-27 21:04:48 -0400] ssd7: hrm
[2013-05-27 21:07:12 -0400] ssd7: Looking at this I'm tempted to beleive there is still some bizarness with the ruby chef is running under: https://github.com/aws/opsworks-cookbooks/blob/master/gem_support/libraries/intern_gem.rb
[2013-05-27 21:10:52 -0400] alex88:  /usr/local/bin/gem query --local lists mysql (2.8.1), but /usr/local/bin/ruby "require 'mysql'" says no such file or directory
[2013-05-27 21:11:43 -0400] alex88: ssd7: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=118646 seems they say to use that to install gems
[2013-05-27 21:11:49 -0400] alex88: wth are they doing
[2013-05-27 21:13:04 -0400] alex88: I should check if OpsWorks::InternalGems exists and then call that?
[2013-05-27 21:14:50 -0400] ssd7: alex88: Yeah, looks like it.
[2013-05-27 21:15:12 -0400] alex88: ssd7: begin OpsWorks::InternalGems.internal_gem_package('mysql') rescue NameError #chef-way end should do the trick?
[2013-05-27 21:17:10 -0400] ssd7: alex88: That should work.
[2013-05-27 21:17:40 -0400] alex88: thanks a lot! trying that way
[2013-05-27 21:39:17 -0400] alex88: ssd7: oh god, now LoadError - no such file to load -- mysql/mysql_api during native extension building
[2013-05-27 21:48:17 -0400] ssd7: :(
[2013-05-27 22:03:08 -0400] coderanger: ssd7: You around?
[2013-05-27 22:12:03 -0400] ssd7: coderanger: what's up?
[2013-05-27 22:12:45 -0400] alex88: and again, using mysql2, LoadError - no such file to load -- mysql2/mysql2... awesome
[2013-05-27 22:16:56 -0400] coderanger: ssd7: How do I translate this: '11.0.8-rc.2+20130422002429.git.19.94749fb'
[2013-05-27 22:17:59 -0400] bluepojo: It's the second release candidate pulled from git at the hash 94749fb
[2013-05-27 22:18:16 -0400] bluepojo: of 11.0.8
[2013-05-27 22:18:19 -0400] coderanger: bluepojo: whats the 19 then :P
[2013-05-27 22:18:31 -0400] bluepojo: hmmmmmmm
[2013-05-27 22:18:52 -0400] bluepojo: good question
[2013-05-27 22:19:35 -0400] ssd7: coderanger: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-rc.INDEX+YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.git.COMMITS_SINCE.SHA1
[2013-05-27 22:19:43 -0400] bluepojo: maaaybe it's 19 commits since... yeah
[2013-05-27 22:20:12 -0400] coderanger: 19 commits since what?
[2013-05-27 22:20:15 -0400] bluepojo: since RC
[2013-05-27 22:20:16 -0400] bluepojo: probably
[2013-05-27 22:20:19 -0400] bluepojo: ?
[2013-05-27 22:20:25 -0400] coderanger: since the last build?
[2013-05-27 22:22:19 -0400] ssd7: I think it is part of git-describe.  Since the "parent" which I guess would be 11.0.8-rc.2?
[2013-05-27 22:24:47 -0400] coderanger: Oy
[2013-05-27 22:30:14 -0400] ssd7: Heh, I love that we put all this metadata in the version and I can't figure out how in the world I would actually check out the code related to that release
[2013-05-27 22:33:12 -0400] ssd7: then again, I'm assuming that is from omnibus-chef-server. Maybe it isn't which would explain why the hashes don't exist
[2013-05-27 22:58:26 -0400] jeremyolliver: Hey, can anybody offer any clues as to why a helper function is returning empty results? https://gist.github.com/jeremyolliver/5654957
[2013-05-27 22:59:05 -0400] jeremyolliver: Log within the helper function shows a search result, but try store the result, and somehow it's empty?
[2013-05-27 23:00:32 -0400] jeremyolliver: I've tried on multiple chef-client versions 10.24.4 and 11.4.4
[2013-05-27 23:13:34 -0400] spicy: with omnibus chef-server 11, what's the best way to specify a custom SSL cert for at least the web ui (not sure if it is shared with API as well)
[2013-05-27 23:25:17 -0400] jeremyolliver: spicy: I think it is shared. Check the nginx install it creates config files to see the file location specified for the ssl cert
[2013-05-27 23:25:32 -0400] jeremyolliver: spicy: You should just be able to put your custom ssl cert there and it'll work
[2013-05-27 23:28:34 -0400] spicy: jeremyolliver: there's no SSL config in /opt/chef-server/embedded/conf/nginx.conf - am i looking in the wrong place?
[2013-05-27 23:29:23 -0400] jeremyolliver: spicy: I haven't got an install to look at myself, but that seems about right. Is there a sites-enabled folder somewhere near there?
[2013-05-27 23:29:45 -0400] jeremyolliver: spicy: or does that conf file have a listen section that proxies off to the chef instance?
[2013-05-27 23:29:56 -0400] spicy: i think it is just proxying
[2013-05-27 23:32:59 -0400] jeremyolliver: as it should, but should ssl terminate first I assumed
[2013-05-27 23:33:12 -0400] spicy: jeremyolliver: it is only listening on port 80
[2013-05-27 23:40:33 -0400] jeremyolliver: spicy: There should be another config listening on 443 http://www.linuxguy.in/how-to-install-and-configure-open-source-chef-server-11/
[2013-05-27 23:44:21 -0400] spicy: jeremyolliver: oh cute, it is in json
