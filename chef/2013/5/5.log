[2013-05-05 03:06:14 -0400] hexfury: Hello, I'm having trouble with a recipe for zookeeper...  It has include_recipe "zookeeper::exhibitor" but keeps failing on that line... Any ideas how to resolve?
[2013-05-05 03:45:01 -0400] prana: hm. is there no omnibus installer for chef-server in the 10.x series?
[2013-05-05 05:13:26 -0400] coderanger: prana: No, nor is there much reason to use the 10x server at this point :)
[2013-05-05 05:22:59 -0400] prana: coderanger: i haven't yet bitten the bullet and upgraded to 11.x. The list of cookbook and run changes looks long and I haven't gone and figured out if things would break.
[2013-05-05 05:23:22 -0400] coderanger: prana: You can continue to use 10x clients with an 11x server
[2013-05-05 05:24:43 -0400] prana: coderanger: all the cookbook changes are client side only?
[2013-05-05 05:25:01 -0400] coderanger: Yes, the chef-server _never_ runs any code of any kind :)
[2013-05-05 05:25:15 -0400] coderanger: (which is kind of needed given that the 11x server is no longer written in Ruby :)
[2013-05-05 05:25:57 -0400] prana: oh i see there's a whats new in server section way down the page that I never got to before :-)
[2013-05-05 05:28:22 -0400] prana: hm. well. i managed to fix my problem (where I had installed an omnibus client on my server running old apt packages) by just moving everything to 10.18 on that server.
[2013-05-05 05:29:21 -0400] prana: i'll think about upgrading to 11 some other day. thanks for the info tho
[2013-05-05 07:49:27 -0400] drrk: :q
[2013-05-05 11:15:44 -0400] epta: watching http://youtu.be/3JTlcnEpWD4 is it a valid data bag in 11:32 ?
[2013-05-05 12:39:15 -0400] epta: What is the common approach to test search stuff?
[2013-05-05 13:39:12 -0400] huib: Hi guys
[2013-05-05 13:39:36 -0400] huib: Just starting out with Chef (solo) and so far I am really loving it.
[2013-05-05 13:40:10 -0400] huib: However, I am having the following problem: when I try to run the mysql cookbook (cloned straight from github) I am presented with this error: uninitialized constant Opscode::Mysql
[2013-05-05 13:41:20 -0400] huib: The full error can be seen here: http://pastebin.com/YZ7E5Y3u
[2013-05-05 13:43:04 -0400] huib: Oh, and I am on debian squeeze
[2013-05-05 13:49:55 -0400] huib: Hmm, I think I figured it out. I was trying to be clever by including the cookbook in a general "webstack" cookbook, and only running that from my node
[2013-05-05 13:50:09 -0400] huib: turns out that when I include mysql::server directly it just works
[2013-05-05 16:12:35 -0400] mib_chef: All, I am using chef server 10.24.0 with knife ec2 0.6.2 / 0.6.4 and suddenly am facing a issue during bootstrap using knife ec2 server create chef actually fails. If i then type the knife bootstrap command for the machine it passes.
[2013-05-05 16:13:03 -0400] mib_chef: After connecting to opscode.com and downloading a file it gives " Downloading Chef 0.28 for ubuntu..."
[2013-05-05 16:13:40 -0400] mib_chef: anyone there that has faced this issue? It is random.
[2013-05-05 16:16:44 -0400] mib_chef: The log is put up here: http://pastebin.com/GTBdiEd8 . I am using my own chef server.
[2013-05-05 16:31:21 -0400] ssd7: mib_chef: looking
[2013-05-05 16:32:07 -0400] ssd7: mib_chef: Did you pass bootstrap_version in your command line options or have it in your knife.rb anywhwere?
[2013-05-05 17:30:41 -0400] gabrtv: i'm having trouble with my first chef-client run against a new private chef server
[2013-05-05 17:30:50 -0400] gabrtv: error message says chef_server_url is incorrect, but it's not.. debug logs show:
[2013-05-05 17:30:57 -0400] gabrtv: DEBUG: Sending HTTP Request via POST to chef.example.com:443/clients --> results in 404
[2013-05-05 17:30:59 -0400] gabrtv: any ideas?
[2013-05-05 17:48:14 -0400] alexanderx: Hello, I signed up for Chef but i dont get it.
[2013-05-05 17:48:56 -0400] alexanderx: I have existing recipes, how do i enter them into the system?
[2013-05-05 17:49:42 -0400] ssd7: alexanderx: Hi, there is definitely a lot to get at first.  Have you tried starting with learnchef.com?
[2013-05-05 17:49:43 -0400] alexanderx: Foodforge and webrecipemanager.com is much simpler.
[2013-05-05 17:50:27 -0400] ssd7: alexanderx: Ah, are you looking for something to manage actual recipes for food?
[2013-05-05 17:50:33 -0400] alexanderx: yes
[2013-05-05 17:50:56 -0400] alexanderx: ok sorry, im just pulling your leg.
[2013-05-05 17:51:01 -0400] ssd7: hehe :)
[2013-05-05 17:51:13 -0400] ssd7: Wouldn't have been the first time it happened :)
[2013-05-05 18:30:19 -0400] mib_chef: @ssd7 , apologies was off for some time.  No I do not pass any chef version. The knife ec2 server create works sometimes and sometimes it does not. When it works, the chef version printed is 10.24.0 which is correct and it continues correctly. When it does not i get the given error. If I run knife bootstrap <ip_address> after the failure it bootstraps just fine.
[2013-05-05 18:31:31 -0400] ssd7: mib_chef: That is odd. What version of knife-ec2 do you have installed.  And what other plugins do you have installed?
[2013-05-05 18:35:03 -0400] ssd7: One possibility is whether you are picking up config from somewhere unexpected.  You might be able to see that if you use -VV when running the command.
[2013-05-05 18:35:09 -0400] mib_chef: @ssd7: Yes it is odd and that has gotten me confused. Haven't faced this and have been able to launch bring down around 300-400 m/cs succesfully in past couple of months.  Suddenly this showed up. Knife ec2 version is 0.6.4. I earlier had 0.6.2. Haven't used any other plugin of knife.  My gem list is here http://pastebin.com/eGhVgYgR for reference
[2013-05-05 18:36:49 -0400] mib_chef: @ssd7: Do you know if there anyway to enable a debug / trace mode of bootstrap process. That might help.
[2013-05-05 18:38:56 -0400] ssd7: Well, -VV will give you some extra output potentially.  I have a plugin that can dump the rendered bootstrap script that will get used, but it sounds like a bootstrap alone is working.
[2013-05-05 18:41:25 -0400] mib_chef: @ssd7 I will try the debug mode and check nonetheless to see if it gives any information for that region of boot.  It is indeed failing just before the rest of bootstrap  starts. Its almost like the contact to server could not tell it a correct version to download.
[2013-05-05 18:47:01 -0400] ssd7: mib_chef: I believe that the way the bootstrap works that 0.28 has to be coming from the knife side of things.
[2013-05-05 18:47:55 -0400] mib_chef: @ssd7, ok, I'll look over there too, thanks for the tip
[2013-05-05 19:28:29 -0400] bjensen: is there a way I can get the associated home path for a username e.g. /home/bob ?
[2013-05-05 19:38:41 -0400] mib_chef: @ssd7, for now I have gotten it towork by putting a variable knife[:bootstrap_version] = "10.24.0" in my knife.rb. So like you said some config from somewhere is interfering. Will look into that.
