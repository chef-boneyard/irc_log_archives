[2013-05-04 12:00:26 -0400] dorongutman: to define my virtual host, I created a site-cookbook, that defines the virtual host

[2013-05-04 12:01:18 -0400] dorongutman: so I figured out I need to copy the web_app.conf.erb file from the apache2 cookbook, into my site-cookbook
[2013-05-04 12:01:35 -0400] dorongutman: is there a way to "inherit" from the apache2 template, and not to copy paste it ?

[2013-05-04 12:40:50 -0400] gsreynolds: Any thoughts? The only change recently is running the 3.2.0-4 kernel on the Debian wheezy install that chef-server runs on. Strange that other clients can still connect fine though. Much appreciated.
[2013-05-04 12:42:19 -0400] gsreynolds: I should clarify - the change was a Debian squeeze to wheezy upgrade.
[2013-05-04 13:05:50 -0400] gsreynolds: RE my messages at 13:40 - upgraded the omnibus chef-server package to the ubuntu 11.04/11.10 version which is equivalent debian wheezy (at least in terms of glibc version). Everything working fine now. D'oh.

[2013-05-04 15:14:29 -0400] asdbla: Ohai, I have problem with chef-clients. Basically, when chef run is ongoing and somebody restarts chef during this time (after logrotate for example) then daemon dies. OS: debian, chef gem. 11.4.2, any ideas?
[2013-05-04 15:14:58 -0400] asdbla: and from log i see:  FATAL: Chef is already running pid  <pid id>
[2013-05-04 15:15:39 -0400] asdbla: i'm not using --fork. Just for your information.
[2013-05-04 15:17:04 -0400] ssd7: asdbla: Hrm. Are you using the chef-client cookbook to manage it?
[2013-05-04 15:17:35 -0400] asdbla: yes, not sure how up to date is it
[2013-05-04 15:18:32 -0400] ssd7: So, the pattern is that Chef is running, someone issues a 'restart' to the init script, and the daemon dies?
[2013-05-04 15:19:16 -0400] asdbla: yes, I'm suspecting that
[2013-05-04 15:19:39 -0400] ssd7: Do you know if you are using an init script or an upstart job?
[2013-05-04 15:19:56 -0400] asdbla: init script
[2013-05-04 15:21:50 -0400] asdbla: ssd7, http://pastebin.com/aZFe7Y0A
[2013-05-04 15:21:56 -0400] asdbla: init script which i'm using
[2013-05-04 15:23:31 -0400] asdbla: and I have daily logrotate for chef-client log, which  restarts chef-client as well
[2013-05-04 15:25:07 -0400] ssd7: asdbla: Hrmm.  I do see one recent update to the init script with respect to finding to pid of the running server correctly
[2013-05-04 15:25:22 -0400] ssd7: I'm unsure if it would cause the behavior you are seeing though
[2013-05-04 15:26:42 -0400] ssd7: Unfortunately I have to split.  But perhaps this:http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-2255

[2013-05-04 17:55:21 -0400] jblaine: afaundez: Find the matching provider(s) code
[2013-05-04 17:55:59 -0400] jblaine: afaundez: resource code + provider(s) code = implementation
[2013-05-04 17:56:24 -0400] jblaine: bjensen: See github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-client
[2013-05-04 17:56:51 -0400] afaundez: jblaine: thanks for your reply. I'm watching it, and its also different from what I expected (the actions declarations)
[2013-05-04 17:57:30 -0400] jblaine: bjensen: My bad, that won't help you. Instead, search for the cookbook from the Heavywater Ops guys

[2013-05-04 18:13:04 -0400] dorongutman: how can I have the data in the mongodb survive the "destroy" and "up" cycles of the virtual machine ?
[2013-05-04 18:17:54 -0400] afaundez: dorongutman: What I do for file persistence between VM is to have a shared folder with the host machine. But I do it almost exclusively for source code files.
[2013-05-04 18:18:45 -0400] dorongutman: cd /vagrant
[2013-05-04 18:18:51 -0400] dorongutman: oops, sorry
[2013-05-04 18:20:24 -0400] dorongutman: afaundez: I've tried putting the mongodb db files on the host machine, and share it as a shared folder to the guest, but when I try to write anything in the shared folder inside the guest - I get a "protocol error"
[2013-05-04 18:21:23 -0400] afaundez: (this is a vagrant question, we should continue in #vagrant)
[2013-05-04 18:59:14 -0400] jblaine: afaundez: Because the pip one is a LWRP inside a cookbook and the 'package' one is a Ruby implementation of the package resource in core Chef.
[2013-05-04 19:00:00 -0400] coderanger: Also because the pip resource was written by someone that didn't know much python
[2013-05-04 19:00:06 -0400] bjensen: jblaine: thanks im looking at https://github.com/hw-cookbooks/chef-client they havent added it to the READMe it seams..ill keep digging
