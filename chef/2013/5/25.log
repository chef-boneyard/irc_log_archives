[2013-05-25 00:49:32 -0400] reset: coderanger: it seems that for a client to have write permissions to a particular node object it, itself, must create it. Is there anyway to grant permissions to node objects via the REST Api?
[2013-05-25 00:50:30 -0400] coderanger: reset: Check out https://github.com/seth/knife-acl to see how to poke ACLs directly
[2013-05-25 00:50:39 -0400] reset: thanks
[2013-05-25 00:50:47 -0400] dpollen: Has anyone else had problems with the user resource setting passwords wrong?
[2013-05-25 00:50:54 -0400] reset: is this just for hosted/private Chef or is this also for OSS
[2013-05-25 00:51:17 -0400] coderanger: reset: OHC/OPC only
[2013-05-25 00:51:22 -0400] reset: ok thanks
[2013-05-25 00:51:42 -0400] coderanger: reset: Open source doesn't have ACLs, the access policy there is (admin || client.name == node.name)
[2013-05-25 00:51:56 -0400] reset: got ya
[2013-05-25 01:06:00 -0400] timsmith: is there a way to check the version of the chef client from within the cookbook other than digging into the ohai data.  A simple method perhaps
[2013-05-25 01:11:06 -0400] timsmith: do you know if these drives light up when they're working?
[2013-05-25 01:11:16 -0400] timsmith: whoops
[2013-05-25 02:06:39 -0400] rayrod2030: I imagine anyone using sudo in a recipe has had their vagrant user lose root?
[2013-05-25 02:06:44 -0400] rayrod2030: or sudo privileges
[2013-05-25 02:21:59 -0400] juliancdunn: rayrod2030: yeah, you need to make provisions for that :-)
[2013-05-25 02:22:36 -0400] rayrod2030: yeah I just added vagrant to the users array in my .kitchen.yml attributes for the sudo cookbook.
[2013-05-25 02:22:52 -0400] rayrod2030: looks good so far.
[2013-05-25 02:23:23 -0400] rayrod2030: btw I really enjoyed your antipatterns talk at chefconf.  My company is basically using that as a template to overhaul all of our chef workflow and practices.
[2013-05-25 02:38:16 -0400] juliancdunn: rayrod2030: oh cool! thanks. I have way more antipatterns where those came from but I only had time for ten :-)
[2013-05-25 13:37:01 -0400] giraffe: Hi I am trying to knife cookbook upload apache but I get: " Cannot sign the request without a client name, check that :node_name is assigned" I created /etc/chef/knife.rb and wrote knife[:node_name] = chef-master  but no upload joy?
[2013-05-25 13:47:39 -0400] binamov: giraffe what does knife client list say ?
[2013-05-25 14:11:56 -0400] giraffe: binamov: same thing
[2013-05-25 14:12:14 -0400] binamov: so your setup is all wrong then :)
[2013-05-25 14:12:39 -0400] binamov: giraffe how did you install chef?
[2013-05-25 14:14:08 -0400] giraffe: binamov: with the ubuntu dpkg and the reconfigure command
[2013-05-25 14:14:29 -0400] binamov: and workstation setup?
[2013-05-25 14:15:28 -0400] binamov: giraffe ^
[2013-05-25 15:25:44 -0400] Cope: ANyone seen this before?

[2013-05-25 15:25:53 -0400] Cope: on vagrant up
[2013-05-25 15:28:01 -0400] binamov: there's no one here :)
[2013-05-25 15:51:43 -0400] shutch: hi all. where does the json for mysql attributes go when provisioning a mysql server? https://github.com/shutchinson/ourplasma-chef
[2013-05-25 15:55:38 -0400] binamov: shutch a data bag?
[2013-05-25 15:56:22 -0400] shutch: binamov: new to chef, not sure the correct layout. for example, a lot of tutorial talking about a run_list but I just have the Vagrantfile which calls my cookbook which depends on others
[2013-05-25 15:57:53 -0400] binamov: shutch it's probably pulling this cookbook http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/mysql
[2013-05-25 15:58:31 -0400] shutch: binamov: yep, it is. but I'm getting an error on vagrant up saying that i ned to specify root passwords in a json attributes. just figuring trying to understand where that file should sit and what it should be named
[2013-05-25 15:58:39 -0400] binamov: shutch so you could pass them as vagrant attributes
[2013-05-25 16:01:17 -0400] binamov: shutch so like this https://gist.github.com/binamov/5649558
[2013-05-25 16:11:44 -0400] shutch: binamov: brilliant, worked, now to just get mod_php5 sorted !
[2013-05-25 16:12:08 -0400] binamov: good luck shutch
[2013-05-25 16:16:35 -0400] shutch: binamov: so is it better to set all the apache attributes through json in the vagrant file? or leave it as a cookbook like in my git repo?
[2013-05-25 16:17:16 -0400] binamov: it's really whatever makes most sense for you shutch...
[2013-05-25 16:17:24 -0400] binamov: i don't know your use case
[2013-05-25 20:36:17 -0400] jameson1: using community cookbooks is best done via berkshelf?
[2013-05-25 20:39:11 -0400] coderanger: jameson1: Yep, and your own too
[2013-05-25 21:13:28 -0400] jameson1: so -> get cookbooks in their own repo, make modifications/fixes, bump version, add into berkshelf, use berkshelf to deploy test into vagrant (for test kitchen), when ready update the remote repo from the cookbook's repo (and not from my chef repo)
[2013-05-25 21:13:39 -0400] jameson1: sounds about right?
[2013-05-25 21:13:44 -0400] jameson1: coderanger: ^
[2013-05-25 21:15:57 -0400] coderanger: yeah
[2013-05-25 21:37:12 -0400] giraffe: http://docs.opscode.com/install_workstation.html tells me I can download knife.rb from the organizations page but I do not have organizations link?
[2013-05-25 21:37:30 -0400] giraffe: oh nvm
[2013-05-25 21:37:34 -0400] giraffe: i have to configure it
[2013-05-25 21:37:40 -0400] giraffe: thanks u guys rock
[2013-05-25 23:59:36 -0400] mmccarthy: Can anyone provide a sample string for the Java "JDK" parameter to the Java cookbook? (https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/java)
