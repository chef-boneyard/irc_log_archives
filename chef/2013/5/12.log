[2013-05-12 00:04:58 -0400] rayrod2030: anybody get kitchen-lxc working on ubuntu 13.04?  I've got my container creating properly but it hangs right after chef/install.sh is downloaded and written out.
[2013-05-12 00:07:59 -0400] rayrod2030: maybe I'll give vagrant-lxc a shot instead.
[2013-05-12 01:06:21 -0400] oponder: Howdy. I have a little experience, we're running chef to manage a pretty humble amount of vps' . But that was a first set up.. so am now locally trying to set it up from scratch.
[2013-05-12 01:06:35 -0400] oponder: The docs.opscode.com is super nice btw
[2013-05-12 01:07:17 -0400] oponder: but anyways, I got through installing chef-server on a clean ubuntu 12.04. Went very smoothly. But am missing knife
[2013-05-12 01:07:25 -0400] oponder: is there a step I skipped somewhere?
[2013-05-12 01:14:41 -0400] petecheslock: oponder - knife doesn't come with chef-server - it comes with chef client
[2013-05-12 01:15:06 -0400] oponder: ah ok
[2013-05-12 01:15:25 -0400] oponder: just trying to wrap my head around the a proper 'first install'
[2013-05-12 01:15:40 -0400] oponder: should my chef-server also have chef-client on it? just for the purposes of getting knife on there?
[2013-05-12 01:16:12 -0400] oponder: or do I take the admin.pem that I just noticed and use that on my first workstation.
[2013-05-12 01:17:33 -0400] petecheslock: oponder - normally you'd make your desktop/workstation the client that uses knife to interact
[2013-05-12 01:17:53 -0400] petecheslock: great docs here if you haven't seen yet - https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/workstation-setup/
[2013-05-12 01:19:45 -0400] oponder: thanks! ive been looking at those indeed
[2013-05-12 01:20:00 -0400] oponder: but I think im just slightly off the normal path, since im not setting up hosted chef
[2013-05-12 01:21:37 -0400] petecheslock: pretty much the same as hosted chef after you get your chef server setup
[2013-05-12 01:23:34 -0400] oponder: hmm im just not grokking it fully yet I guess :) sorry
[2013-05-12 01:23:42 -0400] oponder: i'll keep messing around a bit
[2013-05-12 03:09:01 -0400] blaine2: hello
[2013-05-12 03:13:04 -0400] oponder: howdy
[2013-05-12 03:15:31 -0400] blaine2: good evening
[2013-05-12 03:15:37 -0400] blaine2: glad to see someone around
[2013-05-12 03:16:09 -0400] blaine2: I'm trying to learn chef, and install the chef-server first of all, and I'm having problems
[2013-05-12 03:16:35 -0400] oponder: im on the same boat.. a bit further than you though
[2013-05-12 03:16:50 -0400] oponder: I got chef-server installed... so might be able to be of some (though limited) assistance
[2013-05-12 03:16:52 -0400] blaine2: you wouldn't be using centos by chance?
[2013-05-12 03:17:01 -0400] oponder: nope.. ubuntu sorry
[2013-05-12 03:17:02 -0400] blaine2: it seems like most folks are using debian based systems
[2013-05-12 03:17:21 -0400] blaine2: yeah that seems to be the start of my problems.....
[2013-05-12 03:17:54 -0400] oponder: yeah I dont have much centos specific knowledge
[2013-05-12 03:18:29 -0400] blaine2: ok sure, well thanks anyways
[2013-05-12 03:18:58 -0400] blaine2: I think I might play with testing a chef-server build on ubuntu system then
[2013-05-12 03:19:29 -0400] oponder: might be the quickest way to get some learning going on...
[2013-05-12 03:19:39 -0400] oponder: start with the most common, and then start branching off from there
[2013-05-12 03:19:55 -0400] blaine2: yeah exactly, I'm more interested in learning to create the recipes and so forth, and it's frustrating I can not even get it "on"
[2013-05-12 03:20:22 -0400] flipture: Whats your current problem?
[2013-05-12 03:20:55 -0400] blaine2: hello
[2013-05-12 03:21:14 -0400] blaine2: I am trying to install chef-server, on a centos machine (Amazon AMI instance on EC2)
[2013-05-12 03:21:23 -0400] blaine2: and am running into some errors
[2013-05-12 03:21:54 -0400] blaine2: I was able to install the RPM
[2013-05-12 03:22:03 -0400] blaine2: but when I ran sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure it would error out
[2013-05-12 03:22:19 -0400] blaine2: after some digging, I found a bug report at the opscode site about it
[2013-05-12 03:22:38 -0400] blaine2: CHEF-3838 talking about having to change /opt/chef-server/embedded/cookbooks/runit/recipes/default.rb
[2013-05-12 03:23:29 -0400] blaine2: so I did that, and then was able to run sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure
[2013-05-12 03:23:53 -0400] blaine2: actually, now it seems to be something different, I just tried rerunning that
[2013-05-12 03:24:06 -0400] blaine2: and it is complaining about the FQDN, let me check that I probably didn't set it
[2013-05-12 03:24:18 -0400] justizin: anyone using knife-cfn on chef 11?
[2013-05-12 03:28:05 -0400] oponder: Can a User do everything a Client can? Like is a User just a Client with a password for accessing the web ui?
[2013-05-12 06:32:50 -0400] vitorbap1ista: Hey, I'm trying to create a user using the users cookbook and a data_bag with chef-solo. I've installed chef-solo-search and everything seems to be working, but my user isn't created at all, only the sysadmins group. Are there any common mistakes that I might be doing?
[2013-05-12 06:33:20 -0400] vitorbap1ista: I'm using the standard "knife solo init ." files...
[2013-05-12 06:39:41 -0400] vitorbap1ista: Got it: my stupid mistake was using group sysadminS, not sysadmin...
[2013-05-12 11:00:42 -0400] _aeris_: hello chef !
[2013-05-12 11:01:11 -0400] _aeris_: i reask for my tommorow problem given there is more people today :)
[2013-05-12 11:01:32 -0400] _aeris_: each time i try to upload a cookbook on my own chef-server

[2013-05-12 12:14:14 -0400] oponder: hey, anyone into pair programming ? Im learning chef, trying to set up a basic infrastructure for some abstract rails SaaS product.
[2013-05-12 12:14:28 -0400] oponder: along with a 'launch demo' button somewhere
[2013-05-12 16:06:45 -0400] breckognize: I'm running knife version 10.16.6 and I'm having trouble with knife bootstrap on windows. It doesn't seem to respect the --bootstrap-version command line option. Has anyone else experienced this?
[2013-05-12 17:27:09 -0400] kgraham: hello, i am experiencing this error http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3940
[2013-05-12 17:27:16 -0400] kgraham: with chef 10.26.0
[2013-05-12 17:27:21 -0400] kgraham: I cannot seem to get around it
[2013-05-12 17:27:26 -0400] kgraham: does anyone have any suggestions?
[2013-05-12 17:54:23 -0400] CaptainQuirk: Hi !
[2013-05-12 17:54:45 -0400] CaptainQuirk: I'm trying to use chef-solo to provide for my personal computer used for development
[2013-05-12 17:55:26 -0400] CaptainQuirk: I was wondering how I could handle configuration files in a way that I can version them with git
[2013-05-12 17:55:46 -0400] CaptainQuirk: for example, I have a git repository on github with my vim configuration
[2013-05-12 17:56:26 -0400] CaptainQuirk: What I would like to do is, on install, clone the repository, make a symbolic link etc
[2013-05-12 17:56:40 -0400] CaptainQuirk: and on update, pull the newest code
[2013-05-12 17:57:01 -0400] CaptainQuirk: obviously, this can be done with the templates inside my vim cookbook
[2013-05-12 17:57:03 -0400] CaptainQuirk: ?
[2013-05-12 17:57:35 -0400] CaptainQuirk: #ruby
[2013-05-12 18:29:19 -0400] chip-: CaptainQuirk: Deploy resource or git resource.
[2013-05-12 18:43:08 -0400] ssd7: Ohai Chefs
[2013-05-12 21:03:22 -0400] Kzim: hello ! any of you using Salt with Chef ?
[2013-05-12 21:18:19 -0400] anoopl: I have a variable in chef cookbook  template like this: variables(:ssl_cert_path => "/opt/ssl/test.crt" )
[2013-05-12 21:18:34 -0400] anoopl: how can I over ride this in a role
[2013-05-12 21:19:55 -0400] anoopl: I tried overide_attributes like this: apache2": {
[2013-05-12 21:19:56 -0400] anoopl:       "ssl_cert_path": ["/mnt/apache2/conf/ssl-certs/123.crt"]
[2013-05-12 21:19:56 -0400] anoopl:     }
[2013-05-12 21:20:01 -0400] anoopl: but it's not working
[2013-05-12 21:54:08 -0400] anoopl: is it possible to change template variable from roles?
[2013-05-12 22:06:27 -0400] zts: anoopl: no, you would need recipe code to re-open the template and change its variables.
[2013-05-12 22:06:45 -0400] zts: anoopl: for an example, the code here is shown in a definition, but you would do a similar thing in a recipe: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_definitions.html#many-recipes-one-definition
[2013-05-12 22:07:32 -0400] anoopl: zts: thanks, let me read on this
[2013-05-12 22:07:44 -0400] anoopl: zts: is this same as attributes?
[2013-05-12 22:08:49 -0400] zts: anoopl: no, template variables are completely separate to attributes.  To override with attributes, the template resource would have to pass in a node attribute as a variable
[2013-05-12 22:09:05 -0400] anoopl: ok
[2013-05-12 22:09:10 -0400] zts: anoopl: eg, variables(:ssl_cert_path => node['my']['ssl']['path'])
[2013-05-12 22:09:34 -0400] zts: anoopl: it would be reasonable to file a bug against the ticket, to say that you'd like to be able to override that variable
[2013-05-12 22:09:42 -0400] zts: anoopl: sorry, file a bug against the cookbook
[2013-05-12 22:09:49 -0400] anoopl: zts:which watt would be good?
[2013-05-12 22:10:08 -0400] anoopl: zts:I am creating my own cookbook
[2013-05-12 22:10:30 -0400] zts: anoopl: it's usually better to allow things like that to be changed using attributes
[2013-05-12 22:10:46 -0400] zts: anoopl: and if it's something you're writing, definitely recommended to do that
[2013-05-12 22:10:47 -0400] anoopl: zts: ok, let me try attributes
[2013-05-12 22:11:00 -0400] anoopl: zts:yes i ll do that
[2013-05-12 22:11:05 -0400] zts: cool
[2013-05-12 22:12:22 -0400] anoopl: :)
[2013-05-12 22:12:59 -0400] toady00: does anyone know where the public/private keys are for users in a chef-server 11.x install?
[2013-05-12 22:42:03 -0400] toady00: I'm trying to manually copy the admin keys from an existing chef server to a new chef server. Can anyone help?
[2013-05-12 22:43:54 -0400] toady00: I know the private key is /etc/chef/admin.pem but I don't know where the public key is
[2013-05-12 22:55:48 -0400] zts: toady00: somewhere in postgresql, I'd imagine - but you might want to look at "Step 4" of http://www.opscode.com/blog/2013/03/12/5106/ which talks about updating the admin user's public key
[2013-05-12 22:58:24 -0400] toady00: zts: thanks. I'll try that and see what happens
