[2013-05-26 00:29:15 -0400] coderanger: mmccarthy: Unless you are doing something special, thats not something you change
[2013-05-26 00:29:37 -0400] coderanger: mmccarthy: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/java/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L63-92
[2013-05-26 01:40:38 -0400] mmccarthy: coderanger: I am trying to load Oracle Java 6u33 rather than 6u45
[2013-05-26 01:41:15 -0400] coderanger: Ahh, well just change the URLs and figure out the checksum
[2013-05-26 01:42:13 -0400] mmccarthy: coderanger: The docs led me to believe that was only for loading from my own repo. In that case, what does the 'jdk' variable do?
[2013-05-26 01:43:42 -0400] cdapena: I am looking for a tool for config files transportation purposes between quality and production enviroment, can i do that with chef?
[2013-05-26 01:43:43 -0400] coderanger: mmccarthy: Read the link I posted
[2013-05-26 01:44:05 -0400] coderanger: mmccarthy: That attr just contains the download links
[2013-05-26 01:44:27 -0400] coderanger: cdapena: Thats rather vague, but sure
[2013-05-26 01:44:56 -0400] mmccarthy: coderanger: I did/am. Chef is my first exposure to Ruby and only worked with Chef this week.
[2013-05-26 01:45:25 -0400] coderanger: mmccarthy: In general automating Oracle java installs is unpleasant these days since they locked it all down
[2013-05-26 01:45:39 -0400] coderanger: mmccarthy: If you can run under openjdk or similar, highly recommended :)
[2013-05-26 01:45:40 -0400] mmccarthy: coderanger: Yeah, tell me abou tit.
[2013-05-26 01:45:54 -0400] coderanger: mmccarthy: Otherwise I would advise downloading and privately rehosting the install packages
[2013-05-26 01:46:13 -0400] coderanger: A private S3 bucket works well
[2013-05-26 01:46:21 -0400] mmccarthy: coderanger: And that would be accomplished by changing the url and checksum as well?
[2013-05-26 01:47:19 -0400] cdapena: coderanger: thanks you. why you saw that it is rather vage?
[2013-05-26 01:50:58 -0400] coderanger: mmccarthy: Depends on exactly what you are installing (jre vs jdk)
[2013-05-26 01:51:10 -0400] mmccarthy: coderanger: JDK.
[2013-05-26 01:51:32 -0400] coderanger: cdapena: Generally you don't transport files per se, Chef generally renders config files from erb templates
[2013-05-26 01:51:54 -0400] coderanger: cdapena: So you promote individual data bits from one env to another, not config files exactly
[2013-05-26 01:53:26 -0400] cdapena: coderanger: thank you,
[2013-05-26 01:54:12 -0400] cdapena: coderanger: do you know a especialized tool for that?
[2013-05-26 01:57:56 -0400] cdapena: coderanger: it means that i can make the config files changes using erb templates and then copy that templates to production to make changes?
[2013-05-26 01:58:45 -0400] coderanger: cdapena: Not really, pretty much all modern config management systems work similarly, you make changes to the config script, not to the raw config files
[2013-05-26 01:59:32 -0400] coderanger: Hand editing files is both error prone and makes it impossible to easily express differences between environments, like different hostnames for DB servers, different firewall rules, etc
[2013-05-26 02:01:03 -0400] cdapena: coderanger: yes, i am talking about that. I make the changes in some place (config script) and after probe that copy that scripts to production. It is a correct?
[2013-05-26 02:01:24 -0400] cdapena: coderanger: sorry for my english
[2013-05-26 02:01:44 -0400] coderanger: cdapena: Yes, the chef-client agent copies down the template and applies it to the system
[2013-05-26 02:02:19 -0400] cdapena: coderanger: Thanks lot!!!
[2013-05-26 02:05:04 -0400] cdapena: coderanger: one more question, is a config management systems the correct tool for that kind of work?
[2013-05-26 02:05:20 -0400] coderanger:  Yes
[2013-05-26 02:05:51 -0400] cdapena: thanks again sir!!!
[2013-05-26 02:29:55 -0400] mmccarthy: coderanger: Got it working. Thanks for the help!
[2013-05-26 03:58:15 -0400] stormerider: does berkshelf support comments in the Berksfile?
[2013-05-26 09:45:23 -0400] eugenmayer: guys how you handle monit during chef runs? it happens that monit starts/stops services during chef runs messing up start scripts / rais conditions so e.g. apache will get started a second time, failing
[2013-05-26 11:30:37 -0400] glen: hi, can i make "template" that "notifies" "package" to reinstall?
[2013-05-26 11:50:29 -0400] stormerider: why do it via a template instead of via a recipe?
[2013-05-26 11:55:21 -0400] glen: i'm new, so i'm not sure what you mean, can you link to some example?
[2013-05-26 11:55:41 -0400] glen: i already put the code into recipe/default.rb
[2013-05-26 11:57:58 -0400] glen: http://sprunge.us/LbEc this is in my recipes/default.rb... so what you mean do via recipe?
[2013-05-26 12:02:53 -0400] glen: so? can i make the "template" (defined in recipe as seen above) to notify some "package to be reinstalled" when the "template" changes
[2013-05-26 12:03:53 -0400] stormerider: ah, ok, i misunderstood the question. yes, that should be viable. let me see if i can find some info on that real quick.
[2013-05-26 12:06:55 -0400] stormerider: something along these lines: https://gist.github.com/stormerider/5652610
[2013-05-26 12:10:19 -0400] glen: oh. two more things: a) it doesn't *reinstall* the package if it's already present. b) i need the reinstall happen *after* template has been changed (not before)
[2013-05-26 12:11:53 -0400] stormerider: you'll have to adjust the :install to be whatever parameter the package provider you're using supports for reinstalling; i dont see reinstall as one of the base actions
[2013-05-26 12:12:19 -0400] stormerider: (and/or you'll need to extend it or replace it with an execute block instead)
[2013-05-26 12:12:23 -0400] glen: can i pass :options with the action?
[2013-05-26 12:12:40 -0400] glen: as package i use can take --reinstall argument
[2013-05-26 12:13:30 -0400] stormerider: i think you can define the options inside the package block that you're notifying
[2013-05-26 12:13:31 -0400] glen: something like :immediately, :options => "--reinstall" ?
[2013-05-26 12:13:41 -0400] stormerider: as for timing stuff, have at the docs: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_common_notifications.html
[2013-05-26 12:15:44 -0400] glen: seems chef own logic doesn't allow reinstalling, it sees package present, and doesn't care to call :install again
[2013-05-26 12:16:55 -0400] glen: so maybe i should instead make new resource of type "execute" and notify that? and in that block uninstall and install package?
[2013-05-26 12:17:43 -0400] stormerider: i guess, if that's what you need to get it working. i admit i dont see the point in cycling a package like that, but an execute block should achieve that result, yes.
[2013-05-26 12:18:32 -0400] glen: package :install wiht :options --force does not work otherwise
[2013-05-26 12:19:17 -0400] stormerider: well, apt-get install --force won't reinstall a package
[2013-05-26 12:19:23 -0400] glen: maybe i should just add :reconfigure action to my package manager that does --reinstall? (it has no native "configure" support, so perhaps okay to abuse it)?
[2013-05-26 12:21:43 -0400] glen: hmm, i can't invoke "package" inside "execute" block, says undefined method "package"
[2013-05-26 12:22:59 -0400] glen: http://sprunge.us/ibMM - tried this
[2013-05-26 12:25:59 -0400] glen: stormerider: btw, that url you gave, does not give solution to run action BEFORE template is written to disk
[2013-05-26 12:26:51 -0400] stormerider: if you want it to happen before, then switch who is notifying whom and the action :nothing
[2013-05-26 12:27:42 -0400] stormerider: and you can't use a resource inside execute. execute is its own resource to run raw commands.
[2013-05-26 12:28:23 -0400] stormerider: afk
[2013-05-26 12:29:09 -0400] glen: yeah, but not with the combination of run only if template changed
[2013-05-26 12:29:30 -0400] glen: if i switch sides, it means i must always execute the action
[2013-05-26 12:29:50 -0400] grant1: anyone know if it's possible to subscribe a resource to an included recipe?
[2013-05-26 12:30:45 -0400] glen: grant1: see the same page: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_common_notifications.html ?
[2013-05-26 12:31:08 -0400] grant1: yeah, so more specifically...
[2013-05-26 12:31:37 -0400] grant1: i'm doing an include_recipe "blah". Then in another resource, subscribes, resource("recipe[blah]"), which doesn't work
[2013-05-26 12:32:02 -0400] grant1: not such resource found. so i'm surely doing something wrong
[2013-05-26 12:32:33 -0400] glen: i'm not sure, does this from that url give what you want?
[2013-05-26 12:32:33 -0400] glen:   subscribes :run, resources(:template => "/etc/nagios3/configures-nagios.conf"), :immediately
[2013-05-26 12:32:45 -0400] grant1: the format isn't the issue
[2013-05-26 12:33:00 -0400] grant1: it's how to call a recipe that i'm including using include_recipe
[2013-05-26 12:33:38 -0400] glen: i shut up then. i don't know :)
[2013-05-26 12:56:25 -0400] glen: how do i set node['nagios']['server_role']?
[2013-05-26 13:23:33 -0400] gor: Hi guys. Does anyone know how to actually run one recipe before compiling the other? In my second recipe I need to run some programs which are installed by the first one in order to get some values needed for the second recipe...
[2013-05-26 13:44:00 -0400] glen: why does run_list recipename and include_recipe[recipename] behave differently? with include_recipe attributes for recipename are not initialized :(
[2013-05-26 13:44:32 -0400] glen: or how do i create super-recipe, contaning all cookibook recipes i wist to run?
[2013-05-26 13:47:31 -0400] stormerider: glen: that's what a role is for
[2013-05-26 13:49:44 -0400] glen: ah, perhaps i'm missing depends line in metadata.rb
[2013-05-26 13:51:48 -0400] glen: ah, yes!
[2013-05-26 13:56:41 -0400] glen: btw, is there short version (oneline) of 'package name do\n action "install"\ndone' ?
[2013-05-26 14:00:05 -0400] gor: glen: package "<package name>" without a block works just fine
[2013-05-26 14:00:37 -0400] gor: also, roles have one flaw: they have no versions
[2013-05-26 14:05:14 -0400] mvitale_tw: testmsg
[2013-05-26 14:07:11 -0400] glen: gor: and how you specify action (i.e install)
[2013-05-26 14:07:25 -0400] gor: glen: install is the default action
[2013-05-26 14:08:16 -0400] glen: trying: chef-apply -e 'package "patch"'
[2013-05-26 14:08:30 -0400] glen: indeed, seems to work
[2013-05-26 14:09:34 -0400] mvitale_tw: Can someone assist me in trying to fix "could not find recipe maven3 for cookbook maven" when trying to initialize my Vagrant box?
[2013-05-26 14:10:42 -0400] glen: you probably should show what you put into your provision block in Vagrantfile
[2013-05-26 14:10:57 -0400] glen: and info where your maven cookbook originates
[2013-05-26 14:12:02 -0400] mvitale_tw: Hmmm.  Relative newb at Chef, so I'll try to answer questions to the best of my ability.  Maven cookbook comes from opscode, downloaded last night.
[2013-05-26 14:13:16 -0400] mvitale_tw: The Vagrant/Chef setup was done last year, and it used to work.  I rolled off the project for a while and now I have to go back and fix a bug.  From what I can tell, it looks like Chef upgraded from 10 to 11, and the world broke.
[2013-05-26 14:13:29 -0400] mvitale_tw: Vagrantfile specifies:       chef.add_recipe("maven::maven3")
[2013-05-26 14:13:44 -0400] mvitale_tw: Vagrant host is Ubuntu 12.04
[2013-05-26 14:14:45 -0400] glen: i don't see meven3 in maven cookbook
[2013-05-26 14:14:48 -0400] glen: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/maven/tree/master/recipes
[2013-05-26 14:15:11 -0400] glen: [COOK-1874] - refactor default recipe w/ version attribs
[2013-05-26 14:15:29 -0400] glen: it was refactored month ago, so checkout older revision or catch up with the docs?
[2013-05-26 14:16:23 -0400] mvitale_tw: Does that mean I need to: chef.add_recipe("maven::maven::3") ?
[2013-05-26 14:16:40 -0400] glen: i have no idea from here
[2013-05-26 14:17:01 -0400] glen: read maven cookbook docs?
[2013-05-26 14:18:17 -0400] glen: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/maven
[2013-05-26 14:21:46 -0400] flaccid_: mvitale_tw: yes
[2013-05-26 14:21:53 -0400] flaccid_: make sure its in your cookbook path for vagrant too mvitale_tw
[2013-05-26 14:22:15 -0400] glen: flaccid_: imho no, if you read the docs. version is attribute now
[2013-05-26 14:22:31 -0400] flaccid_: glen:  huh
[2013-05-26 14:22:51 -0400] mvitale_tw: Well, I'm trying it.  vagrant destroy ; vagrant up -- easy enough to do.
[2013-05-26 14:22:55 -0400] flaccid_: chef.add_recipe("maven")
[2013-05-26 14:23:09 -0400] glen: mvitale_tw: you do not need  to destory it!!!!
[2013-05-26 14:23:12 -0400] flaccid_: mvitale_tw: vagrant reload
[2013-05-26 14:23:23 -0400] glen: flaccid_: you do not need to reload it !!!
[2013-05-26 14:23:25 -0400] flaccid_: mvitale_tw: there is also #vagrant chat channel
[2013-05-26 14:23:29 -0400] glen: vagrant provision
[2013-05-26 14:23:44 -0400] flaccid_: glen: dude i'm not doing anything
[2013-05-26 14:23:51 -0400] flaccid_: if its already run, reload it
[2013-05-26 14:24:09 -0400] glen: reload => vagrant halt + up
[2013-05-26 14:24:13 -0400] mvitale_tw: Thx
[2013-05-26 14:24:33 -0400] glen: you need only vagrant provision to rerun chef-solo, no need to destroy or reboot
[2013-05-26 14:24:44 -0400] flaccid_: glen: you don't need to halt and power it on again. reload!
[2013-05-26 14:24:54 -0400] flaccid_: vagrant reload
[2013-05-26 14:24:57 -0400] glen: reload does halt and up
[2013-05-26 14:25:18 -0400] flaccid_: so you hav a moot point glen
[2013-05-26 14:25:32 -0400] flaccid_: in fact no point at all
[2013-05-26 14:25:52 -0400] glen: wha?
[2013-05-26 14:25:57 -0400] flaccid_: wha
[2013-05-26 14:26:15 -0400] glen: i'm saing that you suggested him to "vagrant reload" i'm saying no, he should do "vagrant provision"
[2013-05-26 14:26:55 -0400] mvitale_tw: So maven::maven::3 didn't work.  Trying just add_recipe('maven') now
[2013-05-26 14:27:17 -0400] glen: mvitale_tw: did you read the docs? i even gave you link!
[2013-05-26 14:28:30 -0400] mvitale_tw: glen: I've been reading them since last night.  As I am so new to Chef, I'm not gonna say that it makes perfect sense right now.  Trying to figure it out, though.
[2013-05-26 14:28:49 -0400] glen: mvitale_tw: version is now attribute, not recipe or role
[2013-05-26 14:28:56 -0400] glen: recipe name is just maven
[2013-05-26 14:29:00 -0400] flaccid_: i'm confused as br0
[2013-05-26 14:29:21 -0400] flaccid_: and i been doin this shiz for a while
[2013-05-26 14:29:23 -0400] glen: mvitale_tw: afaik attributes are passed with the .json key
[2013-05-26 14:29:39 -0400] flaccid_: whats a json key?
[2013-05-26 14:29:53 -0400] glen: mvitale_tw: and when you done changes to Vagrantfile, run vagrant provision
[2013-05-26 14:30:00 -0400] glen: flaccid_: read Vagrantfile
[2013-05-26 14:30:25 -0400] flaccid_: glen: that can be anything you want. I use it every day. maybe you should ask the user for their Vagrantfile?
[2013-05-26 14:30:39 -0400] flaccid_: mvitale_tw: can you pastebin your Vagrantfile ?
[2013-05-26 14:31:12 -0400] glen: flaccid_: wtf? you can't put together maven docs and sample Vagrantfile?
[2013-05-26 14:31:33 -0400] flaccid_: glen: huh what crack are you on?
[2013-05-26 14:31:34 -0400] mvitale_tw: Let's see if this works first...
[2013-05-26 14:32:05 -0400] glen: flaccid_: ????
[2013-05-26 14:32:13 -0400] flaccid_: glen: ??????????????????????
[2013-05-26 14:32:15 -0400] glen: flaccid_: that chef.json is allso used in chef solo
[2013-05-26 14:32:35 -0400] flaccid_: glen: no .json is used in chef solo unless you specify it
[2013-05-26 14:32:50 -0400] glen: and cookbooks can read the json if it matches wanted cookbook name
[2013-05-26 14:33:02 -0400] glen: flaccid_: but the attributes are passed via json!
[2013-05-26 14:33:06 -0400] flaccid_: i'm not sure what your point is dude
[2013-05-26 14:33:15 -0400] glen: of how you pass attributes to cookbook from vagrant?
[2013-05-26 14:33:16 -0400] flaccid_: i run this everday
[2013-05-26 14:33:23 -0400] glen: flaccid_: meven cookbook?
[2013-05-26 14:33:36 -0400] flaccid_: wtf is meven cookbook
[2013-05-26 14:34:00 -0400] flaccid_: anyone wanna be specific about some problem here?
[2013-05-26 14:34:01 -0400] glen: ok. i'm stopping to pissing myself of with someone who can't distinguish even a typo
[2013-05-26 14:34:05 -0400] glen: afk
[2013-05-26 14:34:21 -0400] flaccid_: glen: dude go get a reality check
[2013-05-26 14:34:42 -0400] mvitale_tw: glen: Thanks for your help thus far.  No idea why my "vagrant up" is being as slow as it is right now.
[2013-05-26 14:34:57 -0400] flaccid_: ok so meven cookbook doesn't find in google
[2013-05-26 14:35:06 -0400] flaccid_: maven is found however http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/maven
[2013-05-26 14:35:10 -0400] flaccid_: is that the same thing?
[2013-05-26 14:35:11 -0400] mvitale_tw: flaccid_: He typoed "maven"
[2013-05-26 14:35:30 -0400] flaccid_: right
[2013-05-26 14:36:03 -0400] flaccid_: mvitale_tw: so are you using http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/maven ?
[2013-05-26 14:36:06 -0400] flaccid_: fill me in
[2013-05-26 14:36:09 -0400] mvitale_tw: yes
[2013-05-26 14:36:13 -0400] mvitale_tw: Downloaded last night
[2013-05-26 14:36:39 -0400] flaccid_: mvitale_tw: pastebin your errors

[2013-05-26 14:42:56 -0400] flaccid_: hows maven or mavan going mvitale_tw
[2013-05-26 14:43:19 -0400] mvitale_tw: Still on openjdk-6
[2013-05-26 14:43:23 -0400] mvitale_tw: *twiddle*
[2013-05-26 14:44:11 -0400] flaccid_: mvitale_tw: what you running it on?
[2013-05-26 14:44:40 -0400] mvitale_tw: mbp
[2013-05-26 14:45:23 -0400] mvitale_tw: whole bunch of stuff just scrolled by.  Let me find the error...
[2013-05-26 14:45:27 -0400] flaccid_: what is maven?
[2013-05-26 14:45:55 -0400] flaccid_: mvitale_tw: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/maven os x is not supported dude
[2013-05-26 14:46:36 -0400] flaccid_: i assume you are doing it in vagrant for an ubuntu guest then?
[2013-05-26 14:46:42 -0400] mvitale_tw: Host is 12.04
[2013-05-26 14:46:44 -0400] mvitale_tw: yes
[2013-05-26 14:46:54 -0400] flaccid_: kk
[2013-05-26 14:47:26 -0400] flaccid_: let me know the prob, i'm on a mac here atm with that env
[2013-05-26 14:49:05 -0400] glen: mvitale_tw: afaik you need chef.json ... {maven => version => 3} .. http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/chef_solo.html i don't know exact syntax
[2013-05-26 14:49:15 -0400] mvitale_tw: http://pastebin.com/dJCRaV9m
[2013-05-26 14:49:37 -0400] glen: mvitale_tw: and if your vm is already up, but only chef failed, then vagrant provision to re-run privisoning task
[2013-05-26 14:50:09 -0400] flaccid_: or understand the error first lol
[2013-05-26 14:51:15 -0400] mvitale_tw: flaccid_: What does that comment mean?  Or are you just going to laugh at me?
[2013-05-26 14:51:17 -0400] flaccid_: mvitale_tw: cookbook seems to be missing a template
[2013-05-26 14:51:32 -0400] flaccid_: mvitale_tw: look st the pastebin
[2013-05-26 14:52:01 -0400] glen: mvitale_tw: why not checkout older cookbook version, and be done with it?
[2013-05-26 14:53:37 -0400] flaccid_: or why not fix the problem for the world
[2013-05-26 14:54:24 -0400] glen: mvitale_tw: your ark cookbook up to date too? template is present in git version: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/ark/tree/master/templates/default
[2013-05-26 14:54:44 -0400] fkiss: hi, i'm really stuck on using Chef with EC2 (from https://learnchef.opscode.com/common-use-cases/multi-node-ec2/), only getting this error message: https://gist.github.com/felixkiss/5651155
[2013-05-26 14:54:47 -0400] fkiss: how can I know what exactly is so bad about my request?
[2013-05-26 14:55:44 -0400] mvitale_tw: glen: Downloaded ark last night too.  All my cookbooks were updated last night except passenger_nginx and phantomjs -- but only because I haven't gotten around to seeing errors from either of those yet.
[2013-05-26 14:56:37 -0400] flaccid_: glen: no, add_to_path.sh.erb is not there.
[2013-05-26 14:57:42 -0400] glen: flaccid_: it is there. and this is last sentence i exchange with you
[2013-05-26 14:58:06 -0400] flaccid_: glen: enjoy
[2013-05-26 14:58:45 -0400] flaccid_: mvitale_tw: the template it is looking for is not in the master of https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/maven
[2013-05-26 14:59:15 -0400] flaccid_: mvitale_tw: its also not referenced in https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/maven/blob/master/recipes/default.rb
[2013-05-26 14:59:24 -0400] flaccid_: it uses source "mavenrc.erb"
[2013-05-26 14:59:40 -0400] flaccid_: glen: hope this helps you too
[2013-05-26 14:59:51 -0400] mvitale_tw: So let me see if I understand what you're saying.
[2013-05-26 15:00:10 -0400] mvitale_tw: The "maven" cookbook provides templates/default/mavenrc.erb
[2013-05-26 15:00:59 -0400] mvitale_tw: The "ark" cookbook, inside providers/default.rb, is looking for maven/templates/default/add_to_path.sh.erb
[2013-05-26 15:01:09 -0400] mvitale_tw: And since maven doesn't provide that, it's failing
[2013-05-26 15:01:29 -0400] flaccid_: mvitale_tw: provide link to ark cookbook showing that
[2013-05-26 15:03:19 -0400] mvitale_tw: flaccid_: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/ark/blob/master/providers/default.rb -- line 79
[2013-05-26 15:03:42 -0400] mvitale_tw: Nah, that doesn't seem right
[2013-05-26 15:05:56 -0400] flaccid_: it might be coz of https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/maven/blob/master/metadata.rb#L10
[2013-05-26 15:07:10 -0400] flaccid_: you might need to add a template here
[2013-05-26 15:07:50 -0400] flaccid_: for /etc/profile.d/maven.sh
[2013-05-26 15:08:00 -0400] flaccid_: i have no idea why its not defaulted
[2013-05-26 15:08:10 -0400] flaccid_: never used this but yeah thats the prob
[2013-05-26 15:08:24 -0400] flaccid_: glen: +
[2013-05-26 15:09:07 -0400] flaccid_: i dont even know what maven is but thats the issue
[2013-05-26 15:09:44 -0400] mvitale_tw: I know what maven is, but I don't understand what you're suggesting the fix is.
[2013-05-26 15:09:52 -0400] mvitale_tw: (Maven is a Java-based build tool.)
[2013-05-26 15:14:02 -0400] flaccid_: provide the template that is missing
[2013-05-26 15:14:28 -0400] flaccid_: i'm off, goodnight
[2013-05-26 15:19:19 -0400] mvitale_tw: Whoah.  Successful "vagrant reload"
[2013-05-26 15:37:12 -0400] glen: mvitale_tw: what was the problem then?
[2013-05-26 15:43:33 -0400] mvitale_tw: glen: Inside maven/templates/default, I copied mavenrc.erb to add_to_path.sh.erb
[2013-05-26 15:43:54 -0400] mvitale_tw: Bah
[2013-05-26 15:44:16 -0400] mvitale_tw: Now doing a destroy/up to test that this whole thing is working, I get ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'chef' (>= 0) in any repository
[2013-05-26 16:15:01 -0400] gyre007: is it only me or anyone else finding knife-rackspace plugin a total mess ?
[2013-05-26 16:19:11 -0400] gyre007: actually it's the Fog what is mess...not the plugin...arrrgh
[2013-05-26 16:36:28 -0400] gyre007: actually its a combination of them both...
[2013-05-26 16:39:05 -0400] jmickle: hi anyone around?
[2013-05-26 16:42:53 -0400] gyre007: jmickle: sure
[2013-05-26 16:47:49 -0400] jmickle: hey, i am trying to migrate from hosted chef into open source chef
[2013-05-26 16:48:10 -0400] jmickle: how do i download all my client data from hosted?
[2013-05-26 16:48:21 -0400] gyre007: I never used hosted chef :(
[2013-05-26 16:48:23 -0400] jmickle: knife download / doesn't grab client list
[2013-05-26 16:48:30 -0400] jmickle: i mean imagine it as chef 10
[2013-05-26 16:48:49 -0400] gyre007: what data do you have in mind ?
[2013-05-26 16:49:43 -0400] gyre007: either way you might want to check this https://github.com/mdxp/knife-backup
[2013-05-26 16:51:08 -0400] jmickle: well what I'm most concerned about is restoring run lists
[2013-05-26 17:25:18 -0400] glen: does ruby have something like static variable? i'm writing package manager plugin, and i want to refresh packages' index only once per run, not via each "package" call
[2013-05-26 17:43:06 -0400] matti: glen: Static variable?
[2013-05-26 17:43:33 -0400] matti: glen: Use class variable. Or worse approach - a global.
[2013-05-26 17:43:35 -0400] glen: matti: yeah, that is something global regardless which instance of class is called it
[2013-05-26 17:44:06 -0400] glen: class variable is written with @varname ?
[2013-05-26 17:44:21 -0400] matti: No.
[2013-05-26 17:44:23 -0400] matti: @@
[2013-05-26 17:44:29 -0400] matti: @foo - instance.
[2013-05-26 17:44:42 -0400] matti: @@bar - class.
[2013-05-26 17:44:42 -0400] glen: thanks
[2013-05-26 17:44:56 -0400] matti: ;]
[2013-05-26 17:47:28 -0400] glen: is 'return' keyword optional in ruby? it's like in perl that last statement value will be used as method return value?
[2013-05-26 17:48:39 -0400] matti: Yes.
[2013-05-26 17:49:48 -0400] glen: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/resource.rb#L154 is that 'resource_classes' accessing the same class variable @@resource_classes?
[2013-05-26 17:54:24 -0400] matti: glen: Yes, the @@ is wrapped in a class method.
[2013-05-26 17:56:37 -0400] glen: not sure where do i set initial value for @@var?
[2013-05-26 17:57:06 -0400] glen: i get otherwise NameErrro
[2013-05-26 17:59:36 -0400] matti: glen: Show code. But, you can set it when you declar it.
[2013-05-26 17:59:47 -0400] matti: class Foo; @@variable = [] ; end
[2013-05-26 18:00:16 -0400] matti: Or, wrap like they did in handy class method / static method.
[2013-05-26 18:00:54 -0400] glen: i'm not sure i understand what is happening with the vars if once they have @@ in front and then again not
[2013-05-26 18:02:01 -0400] glen: http://sprunge.us/UKiE
[2013-05-26 18:02:01 -0400] matti: class Foo ; def self.start ; @@foo ||= [] ; end ; end
[2013-05-26 18:02:06 -0400] matti: Foo.start << 1 << 2 << 3
[2013-05-26 18:02:21 -0400] matti: Do you know Ruby at all?
[2013-05-26 18:02:43 -0400] glen: not really :)
[2013-05-26 18:03:21 -0400] matti: ;p
[2013-05-26 18:03:22 -0400] glen: that pastebin seems to work, such code is totalhack or almostok ?
[2013-05-26 18:03:26 -0400] matti: I'd do it differently anyway.
[2013-05-26 18:03:32 -0400] glen: like?
[2013-05-26 18:03:37 -0400] matti: As @@ is not persistent between Chef runs, is it?
[2013-05-26 18:03:52 -0400] glen: that is okay. i just want to update indexes once per chef run
[2013-05-26 18:04:16 -0400] glen: if i wanted it totally persistent, then the value should be rather timestamp and include information of active repos. that's a bit more complicated task :)
[2013-05-26 18:04:23 -0400] matti: There is still no guarantee that this will wook.
[2013-05-26 18:04:26 -0400] matti: s/wook/work/
[2013-05-26 18:04:44 -0400] glen: i had two package calls, and the update indexes ran update only once
[2013-05-26 18:04:54 -0400] glen: so, it seemed to work
[2013-05-26 18:05:02 -0400] matti: :)
[2013-05-26 18:05:14 -0400] matti: So, did you fix it?
[2013-05-26 18:05:17 -0400] glen: also, how would you do it, would like still to hear
[2013-05-26 18:05:38 -0400] glen: ee? fix? i mean this works: http://sprunge.us/UKiE
[2013-05-26 18:05:53 -0400] matti: Eh, I thought you've had NameError.
[2013-05-26 18:06:06 -0400] glen: ah, that was like minutes ago :)
[2013-05-26 18:06:08 -0400] matti: ;p
[2013-05-26 18:06:24 -0400] matti: I am impressed that people stil use PLD.
[2013-05-26 18:06:32 -0400] matti: still*
[2013-05-26 18:06:41 -0400] glen: ah, you are martti from pld?
[2013-05-26 18:06:59 -0400] glen: ah, probably not!
[2013-05-26 18:07:05 -0400] matti: No.
[2013-05-26 18:07:07 -0400] glen: anyway,how you know pld?
[2013-05-26 18:07:09 -0400] matti: But I used to use it long time ago.
[2013-05-26 18:07:17 -0400] matti: Because I worked on it when it was young.
[2013-05-26 18:07:40 -0400] glen: yeah, there are like 3 people who use it and are not from .pl :D
[2013-05-26 18:07:48 -0400] matti: YEah.
[2013-05-26 18:07:53 -0400] matti: I thought it is long dead.
[2013-05-26 18:08:29 -0400] matti: So, the pattern than people have is to drop a tag file and use its ctime/mtime to see if they need to run.
[2013-05-26 18:08:41 -0400] matti: This obviously has issue with immediate freshness.
[2013-05-26 18:08:52 -0400] matti: So your approch has advantage over it.
[2013-05-26 18:09:42 -0400] glen: ideally the checking should be done at package level, like yum does it itself
[2013-05-26 18:09:44 -0400] matti: Cool idea, actually.
[2013-05-26 18:10:15 -0400] matti: There is no golden bullet here.
[2013-05-26 18:10:19 -0400] glen: yum caches metadata for 6h by default afaik
[2013-05-26 18:10:33 -0400] matti: Puppet when you use package resource.
[2013-05-26 18:10:40 -0400] glen: but indeed, it has the stale possibiity if you update from repos that are updated more often
[2013-05-26 18:10:46 -0400] matti: Will automatically notice multiple calls to package manager to update.
[2013-05-26 18:10:53 -0400] matti: And aggregate, running only once.
[2013-05-26 18:10:59 -0400] matti: Chef has issue with this.
[2013-05-26 18:11:08 -0400] glen: poldek is fast luckily for this
[2013-05-26 18:11:13 -0400] matti: :)
[2013-05-26 18:11:30 -0400] glen: and poldek.rb does rpm -q before invoking poldek at all, so, the lag is only when something needs to be installed
[2013-05-26 18:11:41 -0400] matti: :)
[2013-05-26 18:12:19 -0400] glen: ok, but by language construct point of view, would you do the same logic anyhow differently?
[2013-05-26 18:12:32 -0400] matti: Depends.
[2013-05-26 18:12:42 -0400] matti: This simple solution solvs the problem.
[2013-05-26 18:12:52 -0400] matti: You cold use memoize pattern.
[2013-05-26 18:13:01 -0400] matti: Which would be an over kill.
[2013-05-26 18:13:09 -0400] matti: And you also don't really return anything.
[2013-05-26 18:13:12 -0400] glen: ok. i'll leave as this
[2013-05-26 18:13:16 -0400] matti: Yeah.
[2013-05-26 18:13:29 -0400] matti: +1
[2013-05-26 18:13:44 -0400] glen: i use "return" because it hate code that is indented too much
[2013-05-26 18:14:08 -0400] glen: i like to expand code vertically, not horizontally
[2013-05-26 18:15:12 -0400] matti: Haha
[2013-05-26 18:15:32 -0400] matti: Ruby developers tend to don't care about line lenght.
[2013-05-26 18:15:34 -0400] matti: Sadly.
[2013-05-26 18:15:41 -0400] matti: It drives me nuts sometimes.
[2013-05-26 18:16:00 -0400] glen: yeah, that same class has 5x"end" at the end of the .rb file
[2013-05-26 18:16:58 -0400] matti: Can imagine.
[2013-05-26 18:18:04 -0400] glen: btw, of all the package managers in chef, yum.rb is insane
[2013-05-26 18:18:15 -0400] glen: others just call foo install, foo uninstall
[2013-05-26 18:18:29 -0400] matti: Haha
[2013-05-26 18:18:38 -0400] glen: but yum one implements down to very core of everything yum/rpm could do
[2013-05-26 18:18:47 -0400] glen: including it's own version comparator, etc
[2013-05-26 18:19:14 -0400] glen: and more of that, it does it in two languages! ruby and python at the same time
[2013-05-26 18:20:03 -0400] glen: python one dumps all packages with the metadata to stdout, then ruby collecs and parses that and caches internally, and all the lookups go over that cached data. wtf was the programmer smoking!
[2013-05-26 18:20:52 -0400] matti: Haha
[2013-05-26 18:21:35 -0400] matti: These things sometimes tends to be hairy
[2013-05-26 19:16:05 -0400] mvitale_tw: Anyone able to answer questions about creating postgresql databases/users via chef scripts during my "vagrant up"?
[2013-05-26 19:46:08 -0400] yoshie902a: can anyone recommend some good chef tutorials and books?
[2013-05-26 19:54:27 -0400] yoshie902a: anyone here?
[2013-05-26 20:20:31 -0400] mmccarthy: Does anyone know if the Opscode tomcat recipe will work with Oracle JDK? Every time I use it I end up with Open JDK.
[2013-05-26 20:31:01 -0400] Cope: mmccarthy: check the attributes - iirc there's an option to choose oracle
[2013-05-26 20:31:20 -0400] Cope: yoshie902a: learnchef.com is a good place to start
[2013-05-26 20:31:31 -0400] Cope: yoshie902a: join #learnchef too :)
[2013-05-26 20:31:46 -0400] mmccarthy: Cope: That's for the Java cookbook though, not Tomcat, correct?
[2013-05-26 20:32:33 -0400] Cope: right - so IIRC the Tomcat cookbook requires the Java cookbook
[2013-05-26 20:33:02 -0400] Cope: so if you set the attribute correctly in the Java cookbook, you'll get the right Java.
[2013-05-26 20:33:40 -0400] yoshie902a: cope:thank you
[2013-05-26 20:34:28 -0400] yoshie902a: cope: can you recommend any good books?
[2013-05-26 20:34:49 -0400] yoshie902a: learnchef.com looks great btw
[2013-05-26 20:47:42 -0400] mmccarthy: Cope: Yep, thanks, got it working.
[2013-05-26 20:51:04 -0400] Cope: yoshie902a: mine, of course :)
[2013-05-26 20:51:20 -0400] yoshie902a: you have a book?
[2013-05-26 20:51:23 -0400] Cope: yoshie902a: 2nd edition out by Velocity :)
[2013-05-26 20:51:33 -0400] yoshie902a: what is the name?
[2013-05-26 20:51:44 -0400] Cope: Test-driven Infrastructure with Chef
[2013-05-26 20:52:06 -0400] Cope: I wouldn't bother buyng the 1st edition now though.
[2013-05-26 20:52:20 -0400] Cope: Wait a couple of weeks and get the 2nd
[2013-05-26 20:52:29 -0400] yoshie902a: ok, thanks
[2013-05-26 20:52:57 -0400] Cope: also... https://leanpub.com/chef-survival-guide
[2013-05-26 20:56:13 -0400] yoshie902a: thanks
[2013-05-26 20:56:20 -0400] mmccarthy: Is there any way to install a specific version of tomcat with the tomcat cookbook? i.e. 6.0.29 insted of 6.0.35
[2013-05-26 21:55:50 -0400] alisdair: if i want to include a recipe in another recipe but i want to override it's defaults, is there a pattern for that?
[2013-05-26 22:22:19 -0400] jvbe: jtimberman: you around?
[2013-05-26 22:23:57 -0400] jvbe: i've setup a new server, was able to import my clients and nodes from the old server , was able to upload my cookbooks again and perform chef runs
[2013-05-26 22:24:23 -0400] jvbe: now not even 24h later again the same problem as the previous server
[2013-05-26 22:24:46 -0400] jvbe: HTTP Request Returned 500 Internal Server Error: undefined method `payload' for nil:NilClass
[2013-05-26 22:25:23 -0400] jvbe: so it wasn't caused by running out of diskspace
[2013-05-26 22:36:06 -0400] jvbe: it was caused by RabbitMQ losing al chef default, user, vhost and permissiong
[2013-05-26 22:36:20 -0400] jvbe: somehow they get lost at reboot
[2013-05-26 22:42:13 -0400] Cope: alisdair: sure
[2013-05-26 22:42:21 -0400] Cope: alisdair: in my_recipe
[2013-05-26 22:42:33 -0400] Cope: include_recipe "something"
[2013-05-26 22:42:41 -0400] alisdair: i think i figured it out
[2013-05-26 22:42:54 -0400] Cope: and then in the attributes file or in the recipe, set the attributes at normal/set level
[2013-05-26 22:42:58 -0400] alisdair: i'm doing `node.override['foo']['bar]`
[2013-05-26 22:42:58 -0400] Cope: ok great
[2013-05-26 22:43:05 -0400] alisdair: before i include the recipe
[2013-05-26 22:43:06 -0400] Cope: override is the nuclear option
[2013-05-26 22:43:10 -0400] Cope: but ok :)
[2013-05-26 22:43:20 -0400] alisdair: node.set would work too?
[2013-05-26 22:43:59 -0400] Cope: yes
[2013-05-26 22:44:17 -0400] alisdair: sorry my wifi died
[2013-05-26 22:44:29 -0400] alisdair: should i be using node.set instead of node.override?
[2013-05-26 22:44:55 -0400] alisdair: also, is it better to override in attributes or in the recipe?
[2013-05-26 22:46:20 -0400] Cope: i would use normal, unless you actually need to override
[2013-05-26 22:46:28 -0400] Cope: hold back your heavy ammunition
[2013-05-26 22:46:35 -0400] alisdair: ok
[2013-05-26 22:47:21 -0400] Cope: rarely do you need to override; if you do, take account of attribute precedence hierarchy; but it's rarely needed
[2013-05-26 22:47:41 -0400] Cope: 80% + of the time you just need to set defaults in your cookbook attributes file
[2013-05-26 22:47:59 -0400] Cope: and then if you need to change the use normal either in a role or a wrapper cookbook
[2013-05-26 22:52:07 -0400] Cope: mccarthy: sure; again - look at the node attributes; iirc you can set the version there.
[2013-05-26 23:05:14 -0400] gor: Hi guys. Does anyone know whether there's a way to set node attributes inside a recipe in ruby_block?
[2013-05-26 23:05:32 -0400] gor: it just doesn't seem to work, though the block is executed
[2013-05-26 23:06:27 -0400] gor: Here's the ruby_block I'm struggling with
[2013-05-26 23:06:31 -0400] gor: ruby_block "passenger_data" do
[2013-05-26 23:06:32 -0400] gor:   action :nothing
[2013-05-26 23:06:33 -0400] gor:   block do
[2013-05-26 23:06:35 -0400] gor:     node.set[:slots][:passenger][:path] = `#{node[:ree][:path]}/bin/passenger-config --root`.chomp
[2013-05-26 23:06:36 -0400] gor:     node.set[:slots][:passenger][:snippet] = `#{node[:ree][:path]}/bin/passenger-install-apache2-module --snippet`
[2013-05-26 23:06:38 -0400] gor:   end
[2013-05-26 23:06:39 -0400] gor:   subscribes :run, "gem_package[passenger]"
[2013-05-26 23:06:41 -0400] gor:   notifies :run, "bash[install_passenger_module]"
[2013-05-26 23:06:42 -0400] gor:   notifies :create, "template[/etc/httpd/conf.d/app.conf]"
[2013-05-26 23:06:43 -0400] gor:   notifies :create, "template[/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf]"
[2013-05-26 23:06:44 -0400] gor: end
[2013-05-26 23:07:08 -0400] gor: templates have action :nothing inside them, so they aren't evaluated without notification from the ruby_block
[2013-05-26 23:07:31 -0400] gor: nevertheless, attributes seem to be empty :(
[2013-05-26 23:11:11 -0400] ssd7: gor: Are you passing the attribute values into the template via a variables hash?
[2013-05-26 23:11:20 -0400] gor: yes
[2013-05-26 23:11:34 -0400] ssd7: gor: You'll want to reference the attributes directly inside the template instead
[2013-05-26 23:11:59 -0400] ssd7: the variables hash gets whatever value the attribute had at compile time
[2013-05-26 23:12:08 -0400] ssd7: while your modifications are happening during convergence
[2013-05-26 23:13:03 -0400] gor: ssd7: sorry, I've mistaken. Actually I pass something like this:    variables(:passenger => node[:slots][:passenger])
[2013-05-26 23:13:31 -0400] ssd7: gor: Right.  For the above to work, you'll have to access node[:slots][:passenger] directly in the ERB template
[2013-05-26 23:13:37 -0400] ssd7: rather than via @passanger
[2013-05-26 23:15:21 -0400] gor: ssd7: thank you, I'll try. Though I wonder if there's a better way of doing such things. My recipe includes the other one, which installs REE
[2013-05-26 23:22:06 -0400] gor: btw, it just struck me that I could use a proc, like    variables(:passenger => proc { node[:slots][:passenger] }), and than call it inside a template
