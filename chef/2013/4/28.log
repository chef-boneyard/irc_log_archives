[2013-04-28 03:13:48 -0400] jasonr: I might be doing something wrong, but I can't pass a postgresql version to chef.  The default is the only one that works. I'm using berkshelf and vagrant.
[2013-04-28 03:18:52 -0400] coderanger: jasonr: How are you trying to pass it?
[2013-04-28 03:22:38 -0400] jasonr: coderanger: In Vagrantfile, chef.json{:postgresql => {:version => '8.4'}}
[2013-04-28 03:23:24 -0400] jasonr: ^ chef.json = {...}
[2013-04-28 03:23:50 -0400] coderanger: What OS is this with?
[2013-04-28 03:24:10 -0400] jasonr: Ubuntu percise32
[2013-04-28 03:25:06 -0400] coderanger: Looks like we only support manual version overrides for RedHat family OSes
[2013-04-28 03:25:27 -0400] coderanger: Otherwise you get whatever the OS package is
[2013-04-28 03:26:01 -0400] jasonr: Oh. Ok.
[2013-04-28 03:26:38 -0400] coderanger: the Postgres team does have an apt repo similar to the yum repo we are using
[2013-04-28 03:26:44 -0400] coderanger: so you could add support and submit a patch :)
[2013-04-28 03:27:07 -0400] jasonr: :) ok.  Thanks for your help.
[2013-04-28 05:41:50 -0400] countdigi: i was very intrigued by the stateless chef server idea at fb ... make setting up backup chef-servers a snap, but of course, u need a solid SOR in your environmnent - chef server does a pretty good job on the cheap :-) anyone else use stateless chef-server model? where nodes don't sent back anything substantial?
[2013-04-28 07:50:14 -0400] mlf4aiur: Hey
[2013-04-28 07:50:46 -0400] mlf4aiur: I want to know, how to use chef to search and get cookbook?
[2013-04-28 07:50:57 -0400] mlf4aiur: Just like puppet module command
[2013-04-28 07:52:14 -0400] null_route: Hey all - How do I get the HTTP response from an http_request resource?
[2013-04-28 07:52:44 -0400] null_route: I see that the rest class has a "body" variable which is set in the class - How can I use it in later resources?
[2013-04-28 10:23:48 -0400] bjensen: Im using Berkshelf. I added the redis cookbook and did berks install. It says using redis..but its not installed anywhere nor is it located in my Berksfile.lock
[2013-04-28 10:26:09 -0400] bjensen: nm
[2013-04-28 10:26:14 -0400] bjensen: figured it out
[2013-04-28 10:31:42 -0400] bjensen: well actually I didn't..the redis cookbook shows up in the Berksfile.lock but isn't downloaded from the opscode repo
[2013-04-28 13:26:53 -0400] mlen: what is the best way to store stuff like ca certificates in chef? I can use cookbook_file, but that means I have to keep it in that cookbook. Another option is to use data bags, but it isn't the best solution to store files. What do you think?

[2013-04-28 16:49:06 -0400] dcsobral: I have a newb question. Can someone help me with it?
[2013-04-28 16:51:12 -0400] dcsobral: I'm using the munin cookbook, and I want to use a nginx plugin with it. This plugin requires me to link the plugin to plugin_name_ip_address, for the ip address of each of my nginx servers.
[2013-04-28 16:51:31 -0400] dcsobral: the link is done on the munin server, though, not on the nagios servers.
[2013-04-28 16:52:21 -0400] dcsobral: so, how do I accomplish such a thing?
[2013-04-28 16:57:03 -0400] dcsobral: I mean, ngins servers.
[2013-04-28 17:12:19 -0400] dcsobral: also, is there something like gitignore for cookbooks?
[2013-04-28 17:13:17 -0400] mlen: dcsobral: there is something called chefignore http://www.opscode.com/blog/2011/04/29/chef-0-10-preview-chefignore/

[2013-04-28 21:26:20 -0400] gamafranco: does anyone know a good sshd recipe? I want to change the default port on a node and disable root login
[2013-04-28 22:17:30 -0400] ssd7: gamafranco_: The opscode openssh cookbook lets you set any config option via dynamically generated config.
[2013-04-28 22:17:49 -0400] gamafranco_: thanks
