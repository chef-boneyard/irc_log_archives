[2013-04-13 00:00:12 -0400] jtimberman: monokrome: 11.4.0 is.
[2013-04-13 00:00:15 -0400] thasmo: monokrome, new to this but I think 11.4 is the latest stable
[2013-04-13 00:00:18 -0400] thasmo: jtimberman :>
[2013-04-13 00:04:14 -0400] monokrome: jtimberman: Thanks! That was my issue!
[2013-04-13 00:04:55 -0400] holoway: log1kal: yes
[2013-04-13 00:05:14 -0400] holoway: if you put the depends in the metadata, its lwrps, attributes, libraries, et al are available
[2013-04-13 00:05:18 -0400] holoway: but no recipes executed
[2013-04-13 00:05:24 -0400] holoway: (but oyu could then include_recipe it)
[2013-04-13 00:07:00 -0400] log1kal: OK, that was my previous understanding, but ranjibd confused me
[2013-04-13 00:07:05 -0400] log1kal: Thanks for clarifying
[2013-04-13 00:54:02 -0400] thasmo: jtimberman, those warnings - "WARN: Cloning resource attributes for directory[/var/cache/local/preseeding] from prior resource" etc. - can they be avoided somehow?
[2013-04-13 01:24:54 -0400] thasmo: thx for the help to all who helped me :D
[2013-04-13 01:35:35 -0400] johnny_: I need help with the most basic of things - getting a Vagrant server provisioned
[2013-04-13 01:35:46 -0400] johnny_: I am not able to authenticate with Chef server
[2013-04-13 01:36:36 -0400] johnny_: Failed to authenticate as chef-validator. Ensure that your node_name and client key are correct.
[2013-04-13 01:39:11 -0400] johnny_: anyone want to join a shared dekstop and help debug a Vagrant provision with chef problem?
[2013-04-13 02:36:53 -0400] johnny_: ok I'm going to say it - Chef is just WAYYYY to complex to learn with all the fucked up blogs out there that don't work
[2013-04-13 02:37:21 -0400] johnny_: is there a single Chef expert on this chat that can help?
[2013-04-13 02:38:01 -0400] yfeldblum: johnny_, yes
[2013-04-13 02:43:51 -0400] yfeldblum: johnny_, was there something in particular you wanted to ask about?
[2013-04-13 02:49:52 -0400] holoway: johnny_: have you tried https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/workstation-setup/?

[2013-04-13 07:53:12 -0400] pantsd_: Are there any good example chef recipies which do master/slave configuration?
[2013-04-13 07:55:55 -0400] kisoku: master slave configuration of what ?
[2013-04-13 08:19:24 -0400] pantsd_: pantsd_: I'm trying to make a cookbook where one host would be a master and the rest are worker nodes.
[2013-04-13 08:19:28 -0400] pantsd_: err
[2013-04-13 08:19:30 -0400] pantsd_: kisoku: ^
[2013-04-13 08:19:33 -0400] pantsd_: long night :p

[2013-04-13 10:49:22 -0400] zrankfappa: a quick noob question
[2013-04-13 10:50:40 -0400] zrankfappa: if I have ohai cookbook in my chef server, what is the correct way to update it and push it out to my nodes from this updated tree ? https://github.com/mattray/ohai/tree/OHAI-381
[2013-04-13 11:00:56 -0400] ionthas: Hi! I'm new on chef and I'm really confused about bootstraping with custom .erb file. I'm looking some example files and I see <%= validation_key %> or <%= config_conent %>. I made my test and I get the same validation key I need for my clients but with client config I recive erroneous file. My question is: Anyone know where are the files from thes variables located? Thanks!
[2013-04-13 11:09:15 -0400] zrankfappa: sry, i'm new also and just using the defaults atm
[2013-04-13 11:30:52 -0400] chef237: any one have idea about create cook book  for nagios client side configuration..?
[2013-04-13 11:35:14 -0400] zrankfappa: dont you just need to install teh agent?
[2013-04-13 11:40:05 -0400] schuckles1: I hate to ask, but does anyone use chef-web in the new version in 11?
[2013-04-13 16:31:21 -0400] dpollen: Has anyone else encountered problems with the `ohai ipaddress` command on OpenVZ platforms?
[2013-04-13 16:44:51 -0400] dpollen: Is there any way to override values provided by Ohai?
[2013-04-13 17:01:07 -0400] PapaSier_: what is the significance of the node_name? i'm using chef solo to provision a server. in future, if i need another server provisioned would i change the node name for the second server?
[2013-04-13 17:50:43 -0400] tvon: I'm having a bit of trouble googling for this, but how would one handle loading up content (eg, a medium to large SQL file) while provisioning?  Should I just stash the sql on S3 and load it up via a cookbook, or is there a best practice for handling data that you normally wouldn't keep in VC?
[2013-04-13 18:05:48 -0400] techminer: Getting this error in a chef run.  "Cannot find a resource for platform_family on centos version 6.4".  The offending line is just the following....
[2013-04-13 18:05:53 -0400] techminer: case platform_family
[2013-04-13 18:05:59 -0400] techminer: when 'rhel'
[2013-04-13 18:07:11 -0400] techminer: If I run ohai on the node....platform_family is "rhel".
[2013-04-13 18:10:13 -0400] dpollen: Has anyone else encountered problems with the `ohai ipaddress` command on OpenVZ platforms?
[2013-04-13 18:10:58 -0400] dpollen: The venet0 interface is still having problems being picked up correctly by Ohai and it's crippling me atm.
[2013-04-13 18:37:51 -0400] boris317: Is there a way with "chef-client" to force a run_list to be run a node again
[2013-04-13 18:38:11 -0400] boris317: simply calling chef-client says the run list is empty
[2013-04-13 18:39:36 -0400] boris317: nvm I think I found my answer in "$ knife node run_list add [NODE] [ENTRY]"
[2013-04-13 19:02:47 -0400] boris317: hmm. Some of the cookbooks that were uploaded to my node are missing files
[2013-04-13 19:03:46 -0400] boris317: for instance the apache2 only contains one file, metadata.json
[2013-04-13 19:03:57 -0400] boris317: strange indeed
[2013-04-13 19:12:30 -0400] jtimberman: techminer1: you need to have Chef 0.10.10+ for the platform_family method to be available.
[2013-04-13 19:19:37 -0400] boris317: awesome, our chef server has broken versions of cookbooks!
[2013-04-13 19:26:02 -0400] mbaxa: anyone using the knife plugin in oh-my-zsh?
[2013-04-13 19:34:40 -0400] PapaSierra: i'm trying to run chef solo and straight up i get http://www.hastebin.com/raw/lunasoteju
[2013-04-13 19:35:01 -0400] PapaSierra: which i don't understand
[2013-04-13 19:51:36 -0400] CaptTofu: hi all!
[2013-04-13 19:52:09 -0400] CaptTofu: super simple question: latest chef 11 - what ports need to be open to use it? Obviously 443. Doesn't seem 4000 and 4040 are used with my stock setup though
[2013-04-13 20:17:48 -0400] PapaSierra: i'm trying to provision with chef-solo. i'm seeing Cannot find a resource for apt_repository on ubuntu version 12.04, but i have the apt cookbook. this is how i run it: chef-solo -c /root/chef/config/solo.rb
[2013-04-13 20:23:59 -0400] PapaSierra: jtimberman: is this a version imcompatibility thing or is something else wrong? i have apt 1.5.0 and chef 11.4
[2013-04-13 23:57:21 -0400] rbueno: Hi all
[2013-04-13 23:58:20 -0400] rbueno: I want to use the opscode server on web, but i have firewall and some security access in my internal machines, how can i do a nice security to use chef server to upgrate my machines in my private network ?
