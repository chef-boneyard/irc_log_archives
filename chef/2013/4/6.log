[2013-04-06 01:23:47 -0400] gmcinnes: how do I tell chef to use Upstart instead of SysV on Ubuntu?
[2013-04-06 01:26:59 -0400] jed2: the init_style attribute in the chef-client cookbook is what you twiddle there
[2013-04-06 01:27:57 -0400] jed2: set it to upstart, should be enough
[2013-04-06 01:28:43 -0400] gmcinnes: hmm. can I twiddle that with chef-solo ?
[2013-04-06 01:29:15 -0400] gmcinnes: just in the json I guess
[2013-04-06 01:29:23 -0400] jed2: probably, I haven't used solo
[2013-04-06 01:29:56 -0400] gmcinnes: is there any way to vary it per process tho?
[2013-04-06 01:30:40 -0400] gmcinnes: I'm not even sure if that's a question that makes sense.

[2013-04-06 12:55:52 -0400] RJ2: the defaults for "knife configure -i" with chef 11 installed on ubuntu 1204 as per the website are wrong
[2013-04-06 12:56:14 -0400] RJ2: url should be https on 443 not 4000, and the path is /etc/chef-server not /etc/chef
[2013-04-06 12:59:43 -0400] RJ2: caused me some temporary confusion until i poked around in the install and realised it was all behind nginx now (which is great, btw)
[2013-04-06 14:10:33 -0400] RJ2: how do i translate this to chef 11?  node['afw']['chains'][user]['rules'].push(iptables_rule)
[2013-04-06 14:10:52 -0400] RJ2: do i have to build the array separately then node.set['afw'][...] = tmpvar ?
[2013-04-06 14:38:02 -0400] yfeldblum: RJ2, you may only modify `node.default`, `node.normal`, or `node.override`; you can no longer modify `node` directly
[2013-04-06 14:38:43 -0400] yfeldblum: RJ2, node.default["afw"]["chains"][user]["rules"] << iptables_rule
[2013-04-06 14:38:49 -0400] RJ2: so node.default['afw'][...].push(iptables_rule) would have worked?
[2013-04-06 14:39:17 -0400] yfeldblum: RJ2, it should work
[2013-04-06 14:39:21 -0400] RJ2: thanks
[2013-04-06 14:39:38 -0400] RJ2: i made a copy and assigned directly, will change it back
[2013-04-06 14:39:56 -0400] yfeldblum: RJ2, when you *read* the values for use in, e.g., templates, that's when you read them from `node` directly because that presents a merged view of the data across all four precedence levels
[2013-04-06 14:40:36 -0400] yfeldblum: RJ2, make sure to `knife node edit` that node and remove the normal-level attributes you mistakenly assigned
[2013-04-06 14:46:53 -0400] RJ2: yfeldblum: yep that did the trick, thanks

[2013-04-06 16:22:02 -0400] ivey: yeah you can specify a version
[2013-04-06 16:22:44 -0400] ivey: change the command to curl . |bash -s VERSION
[2013-04-06 16:22:46 -0400] ivey: i think
[2013-04-06 16:23:09 -0400] rajasaur: ok.. ill try that. thanks
[2013-04-06 16:23:22 -0400] ivey: or do a manual install
[2013-04-06 16:23:35 -0400] ivey: http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/ and just change the version in the url to get the older rpm
[2013-04-06 16:23:56 -0400] ivey: although the JS on that page is acting very odd, maybe it's just me

[2013-04-06 19:19:52 -0400] ivey: zrankfappa: check out berkshelf or librarian
[2013-04-06 19:19:58 -0400] ivey: they can fetch deps

[2013-04-06 19:20:37 -0400] zrankfappa: are they pluggins or seperate programs?
[2013-04-06 19:20:53 -0400] ivey: berkshelf is a separate program
[2013-04-06 19:21:30 -0400] zrankfappa: oki thanks i'll take a look
[2013-04-06 19:29:58 -0400] KarlHungus: thoughts on distributing plugins with cookbok dependencies?
[2013-04-06 19:30:10 -0400] kesor: whats a "plugin" ?
[2013-04-06 19:30:16 -0400] KarlHungus: knife plugin, sorry
[2013-04-06 19:31:28 -0400] KarlHungus: i have a knife plugin and coresponding cookbook for tarsnap that does fully automated off-site backup and recovery
[2013-04-06 19:32:05 -0400] KarlHungus: i'm going to open source it, but handling the cookbook/knife-plugin requirement gracefully is quirky
[2013-04-06 19:32:32 -0400] kesor: can you explain why your knife plugin needs a cookbook as a dependency?
[2013-04-06 19:32:45 -0400] KarlHungus: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b04a9ca6faa24476ca92
[2013-04-06 19:33:24 -0400] ivey: i'd treat them as separate things, separate git repos, and just doc it
[2013-04-06 19:33:44 -0400] kesor: yep, put it in the readme  its human who are going to use this in the end after all.
[2013-04-06 19:33:49 -0400] KarlHungus: the cookbook handles setting up tarnsap on the node based on the contents of an encrypted data bag. a lwrp inthe cookbook allows other recipes to quickly define which dirs to offsite and their backup rotation
[2013-04-06 19:33:50 -0400] ivey: because the plugin goes client side and the cookbook needs to go in chef server infrastructure and they may be completely separate
[2013-04-06 19:34:14 -0400] ivey: you could have the plugin check the chef server for the cookbook and warn / bail if not there
[2013-04-06 19:34:26 -0400] KarlHungus: the knife plugin lets you manage tarsnap keys, list backups for a node, and pull files out of the backups and any point in time
[2013-04-06 19:35:10 -0400] KarlHungus: yeah, i guess i could doc it and have the plugin look for a required version of the cookbook on the infra
[2013-04-06 19:35:21 -0400] KarlHungus: that may be the only somewhat sane approach
[2013-04-06 19:35:40 -0400] zts: KarlHungus: a place I worked last year open sourced a cookbook to manage x509 certificates, which needs a client program to be useful
[2013-04-06 19:35:43 -0400] zts: KarlHungus: https://github.com/VendaTech/chef-cookbook-ssl
[2013-04-06 19:36:24 -0400] KarlHungus: zts: ahh, yes, similar
[2013-04-06 19:36:35 -0400] zts: KarlHungus: so the code's together, but we also push the gem to rubygems to make it easier to install
[2013-04-06 19:36:53 -0400] zts: possibly not the best way, but it seems to work alright
[2013-04-06 19:37:26 -0400] KarlHungus: yeah, thats perfect. now if knife only had the ability to load plugins out of the cookbooks dirs ;)
[2013-04-06 19:37:56 -0400] kesor: knife plugins are usually gems. its good that way.
[2013-04-06 19:38:19 -0400] KarlHungus: kesor: why?
[2013-04-06 19:38:35 -0400] kesor: why not? you can manage it with bundler. its perfect.
[2013-04-06 19:38:45 -0400] KarlHungus: hah, actually. you could add 'gem "knife-tarsnap", :path => "cookbooks/tarsnap" to the Gemfile ;)
[2013-04-06 19:38:57 -0400] kesor: yeah, you could. actually.
[2013-04-06 19:39:11 -0400] KarlHungus: thats quite clean
[2013-04-06 19:41:19 -0400] kesor: I need to come up with a story for my chef/opsworks presentation, anyone good with stories and can throw some ideas at me?  I was thinking of using the "rags to reaches" template, maybe with a developer trying to deploy his code doing stuff that ops people usually do  failing and having a help from some ops fairy or something.
[2013-04-06 19:41:42 -0400] kesor: if anyone has any crazy ideas  i'm all ears.
[2013-04-06 19:42:02 -0400] zts: KarlHungus: hm, I wonder if you could write a knife plugin that loaded knife plugins out of cookbook dirs :)
[2013-04-06 19:42:38 -0400] KarlHungus: zts, that may actually be cleaner, since adding the path to bundler creates a chicken/egg problem if the chef-repo uses berkshelf
[2013-04-06 19:43:17 -0400] kesor: zts: I think you most probably can. should be quite easy too, come up with some convention like cookbook/somename/plugins/knife/... which all get loaded with this plugin. also think that after this takes hold it will get merged into opscode knife.
[2013-04-06 19:44:00 -0400] KarlHungus: kesor: yeah. gems are fantastic, but embedding plugins in cookbooks has a lot of benefits
[2013-04-06 19:44:05 -0400] kesor: I think that puppet works that way, it has manifest/library/facter/... where manifest=cookbook and facter=ohai.
[2013-04-06 19:45:00 -0400] kesor: http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/plugins_in_modules.html
[2013-04-06 19:45:41 -0400] kesor: you sure that chef doesn't have this? ^^^
[2013-04-06 19:46:07 -0400] KarlHungus: out of the box, it doesnt have that
[2013-04-06 19:47:01 -0400] zts: well, you can manage ohai plugins, and you ship custom types as libraries and LWRPs
[2013-04-06 19:47:17 -0400] zts: I'm not sure what would be analagous to knife in the puppet ecosystem
[2013-04-06 19:47:32 -0400] kesor: the command "puppet".
[2013-04-06 19:47:58 -0400] zts: oh, I thought that was somewhat closer to chef-solo/chef-apply/something that is run on a node
[2013-04-06 19:48:12 -0400] kesor: thats "puppet agent".
[2013-04-06 19:48:25 -0400] kesor: chef-solo = "puppet apply". chef-client = "puppet agent", etc ...
[2013-04-06 19:48:41 -0400] kesor: knife cookbook create = "puppet module generate"
[2013-04-06 19:49:36 -0400] zts: gotcha, thanks

[2013-04-06 20:32:09 -0400] zrankfappa: hey guys, another quick quesiton
[2013-04-06 20:32:28 -0400] zrankfappa: anyone familiar with openstack pluggin for knife?
[2013-04-06 21:24:13 -0400] kesor: why is chef called chef? is it because of southpark?
[2013-04-06 21:41:55 -0400] Guest89331: Is called chef because some fat programmer guy was really really hungry
[2013-04-06 21:42:04 -0400] Guest89331: And wanted to automate good food.
[2013-04-06 21:42:14 -0400] siezer: yes.u
[2013-04-06 21:42:22 -0400] basic`: does anyone use the nagios cookbook with centos 6.x as server+client?
[2013-04-06 21:42:37 -0400] ivey: yeah most of the Opscode folks seem like fitness nuts so I doubt that was it
[2013-04-06 21:42:40 -0400] basic`: it doesnt seem to work building out as the server and I'm wondering if it's a client only thing
[2013-04-06 21:42:51 -0400] Guest89331: I use nagios but on ubutnut
[2013-04-06 21:44:28 -0400] Guest89331: Ivey I know what the heck is up with that
[2013-04-06 21:44:49 -0400] Guest89331: Im skinny as hell but deep inside im a fat programmer I truly am
[2013-04-06 21:44:56 -0400] zrankfappa: anyone here using opensource chef server?

[2013-04-06 21:45:28 -0400] basic`: are you  using the omnitruck rpm/deb?
[2013-04-06 21:45:33 -0400] zrankfappa: i am so close to setting it up with openstack it's untrue
[2013-04-06 21:45:41 -0400] zrankfappa: omni i think
[2013-04-06 21:45:49 -0400] zrankfappa: i just have one simple quesiton :)
[2013-04-06 21:46:09 -0400] zrankfappa: how do i recreate my validation.pem?
[2013-04-06 21:46:19 -0400] zrankfappa: i can fire up the openstack node and kick off the bootstrap
[2013-04-06 21:46:24 -0400] Guest89331: I hate omnibus I want to make my own chef solo cookbooks
[2013-04-06 21:46:37 -0400] zrankfappa: it gets right until the point of registering my node iwth the chef server and bombs out
[2013-04-06 21:46:43 -0400] basic`: hmm, i haven't tried to do that before
[2013-04-06 21:46:50 -0400] zrankfappa: do you have a validation.pem ?
[2013-04-06 21:46:52 -0400] basic`: did you delete your node and client?
[2013-04-06 21:46:57 -0400] basic`: knife node delete
[2013-04-06 21:46:59 -0400] basic`: knife client delete

[2013-04-06 22:25:30 -0400] faustroll: i'm attempting to use knife rackspace server create
[2013-04-06 22:26:05 -0400] faustroll: and I'm getting the dreaded Fog::Compute::Rackpace::NotFound
[2013-04-06 22:26:34 -0400] faustroll: newest Fog does not even have that namespace anymore
[2013-04-06 22:27:03 -0400] faustroll: Fog::Rackspace:Compute does exists
[2013-04-06 22:27:07 -0400] faustroll: exist
[2013-04-06 22:27:47 -0400] zrankfappa: guys, quick question if anyone is still alive
[2013-04-06 22:27:49 -0400] faustroll: I've tried a number of combinations of Chef, knife-rackspace and Fog
[2013-04-06 22:28:05 -0400] zrankfappa: i'm fresh to using chef/knife and openstack and decided to learn them all @ once
[2013-04-06 22:28:06 -0400] zrankfappa: :)
[2013-04-06 22:28:17 -0400] faustroll: zrankfappa: and
[2013-04-06 22:28:24 -0400] basic`: so looking more at the cookbook for nagios, it seems like redhat systems are only supported as clients
[2013-04-06 22:28:27 -0400] zrankfappa: is it simple to create a chef recipe that would modify my /etc/hosts file?
[2013-04-06 22:28:44 -0400] zrankfappa: i'm running internal nodes that resolve dns externally
[2013-04-06 22:29:05 -0400] zrankfappa: i've managed to get the node build but the final stage of register to chef server fails because it cannot resolve the server naem
[2013-04-06 22:29:06 -0400] zrankfappa: naem*
[2013-04-06 22:29:08 -0400] zrankfappa: name*
[2013-04-06 22:29:34 -0400] zrankfappa: so i'm thinking how about I pop a small recipe in the run list that adds teh name to /etc/hosts
[2013-04-06 22:29:47 -0400] zrankfappa: would this be a good way to resolve the problem or a bodge job?
[2013-04-06 22:30:33 -0400] faustroll: zrankfappa: u kind of implied the answer
[2013-04-06 22:30:46 -0400] zrankfappa: indeed
[2013-04-06 22:30:52 -0400] faustroll: lol
[2013-04-06 22:31:06 -0400] zrankfappa: i've been @ this for a week solid, my brain is fried
[2013-04-06 22:31:15 -0400] faustroll: take a break
[2013-04-06 22:31:19 -0400] zrankfappa: just wanted to bounce the idea of you guys to see if i'm diong it correctly
[2013-04-06 22:31:33 -0400] zrankfappa: aye, i should take a break and go fly my planes
[2013-04-06 22:31:39 -0400] faustroll: yes!
[2013-04-06 22:31:52 -0400] zrankfappa: ;)
[2013-04-06 22:35:29 -0400] faustroll: zrankfappa: are u using knife-rackspace gem at all?
[2013-04-06 22:40:39 -0400] faustroll: arg!
[2013-04-06 22:40:59 -0400] faustroll: Fog::Compute::Rackspace does not exist
[2013-04-06 22:43:03 -0400] faustroll: of course it cannot be found if it does not exists
[2013-04-06 22:43:17 -0400] faustroll: exist
[2013-04-06 22:45:45 -0400] gansbrest: hello. I'm using encrypted data bags and wondering where should I keep encrypted key ( using chef-solo at the moment )
[2013-04-06 22:51:12 -0400] siezer: gansbrest encrypted databags are useful for the case where you don't trust your chef-server admin. you need to put a secret on the box out-of-band of chef (usually with a custom knife bootstrap script that also drops the key off, along with the normal bootstrap functions)
[2013-04-06 22:51:53 -0400] siezer: don't fear the server. solo ends up being a lot more work
[2013-04-06 23:07:44 -0400] gansbrest: the other use case would be avoiding storing sensitive data in git?
[2013-04-06 23:11:39 -0400] yfeldblum: gansbrest, if it's data, then why's it in git?
[2013-04-06 23:12:17 -0400] gansbrest: mysql password for example
[2013-04-06 23:12:23 -0400] gansbrest: where would you keep it
[2013-04-06 23:13:16 -0400] yfeldblum: gansbrest, you can keep it in a data-bag item; but there's nothing that says your data-bag items have to be in git
[2013-04-06 23:13:38 -0400] gansbrest: hm, where would you keep those?
[2013-04-06 23:15:15 -0400] yfeldblum: gansbrest, if you're using chef-solo, then why not put it in the node.json?
[2013-04-06 23:15:59 -0400] gansbrest: to be honest I was thinking to commit whole chef-solo dir to the repo
[2013-04-06 23:16:22 -0400] gansbrest: maybe it's not a good idea after all
[2013-04-06 23:32:19 -0400] faustroll: gansbrest: I'm using an encrypted data bag for a password as well, and yes i'm letting it get into git.
[2013-04-06 23:32:50 -0400] gansbrest: <faustroll> Are u using chef-solo?
[2013-04-06 23:33:05 -0400] gansbrest: I'm having strange problem now - Data Bag Items must contain a Hash or Mash!
[2013-04-06 23:33:05 -0400] faustroll: hosted chef
[2013-04-06 23:33:09 -0400] gansbrest: getting this error
[2013-04-06 23:33:32 -0400] faustroll: and I also have the issue of the key
[2013-04-06 23:33:41 -0400] faustroll: which I keep elsewehere
[2013-04-06 23:34:22 -0400] faustroll: gansbrest: r u using knife?
[2013-04-06 23:34:45 -0400] gansbrest: no, I'm using a script to generate encrypted key
[2013-04-06 23:34:54 -0400] gansbrest: encrypted data bag item I mean
[2013-04-06 23:37:20 -0400] faustroll: gansbrest: show me the output of your data bag script
[2013-04-06 23:38:20 -0400] gansbrest: http://pastebin.com/jsyiNh53
[2013-04-06 23:39:04 -0400] gansbrest: and then I'm trying to use it in attributes file like this
[2013-04-06 23:39:05 -0400] gansbrest: mysql_creds = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("pass", "mysql")
[2013-04-06 23:43:48 -0400] faustroll: gansbrest: .load_secret first
[2013-04-06 23:44:20 -0400] faustroll: path_to_secret
[2013-04-06 23:44:47 -0400] gansbrest: can you paste sample of how u use encrypted data please?
[2013-04-06 23:45:15 -0400] faustroll: BLAH.load_secret("path_to_secret") first
[2013-04-06 23:45:51 -0400] faustroll: gansbrest: u have it right. only u need the path to secret loaded through load_secret
[2013-04-06 23:46:25 -0400] gansbrest: and then pass secret to EncryptedDataBagItem.load ?
[2013-04-06 23:46:41 -0400] faustroll: yes!
[2013-04-06 23:47:02 -0400] faustroll: should be in the docs
[2013-04-06 23:47:12 -0400] gansbrest: it seems like it third attribute of this function is optional, i.e. it should try to load secret if you don't specify it
[2013-04-06 23:47:16 -0400] gansbrest: but I will try it out
[2013-04-06 23:56:29 -0400] gansbrest: <faustroll> ha, you know what it was?! I made a mistake and created data_bags folder instead of existing one called data-bags.. And it couldn't locate my encrypted item..
