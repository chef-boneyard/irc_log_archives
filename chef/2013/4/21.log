[2013-04-21 01:11:55 -0400] ssd7: awsuser: zts There was just some windows bootstrap stuff merged to master
[2013-04-21 01:12:43 -0400] ssd7: Should be in the next release, you can build from master now if you want to test it out and report any problems you ran into
[2013-04-21 01:13:12 -0400] ssd7: And the new code even knows how to do the "Grab the admin password using your keypair" dance
[2013-04-21 05:10:53 -0400] alisdair: is there a way to execute a resource as a specific user?
[2013-04-21 05:30:30 -0400] ssd7: alisdair: Depends on the resource.  The execute and script resource have 'user' parameters that allow you to set the user.
[2013-04-21 05:30:50 -0400] alisdair: ok so the resource has to support it?
[2013-04-21 05:31:01 -0400] alisdair: there's no universal way to do it
[2013-04-21 05:31:02 -0400] alisdair: ?

[2013-04-21 09:11:05 -0400] koodough: when I run knife solo cook root@13.0.0.1 I recieve an error that Cannot find a resource for logrotate_app on debian version 7.0. But I don't have logrotate in the run list. Why would this be so?
[2013-04-21 11:01:28 -0400] zts: ssd7: awesome!  I keep meaning to play with Chef on Windows, so that's now on my list
[2013-04-21 11:27:18 -0400] bjensen: when I do solo cook with chef solo I keep getting asked about the password, even though its correct. Ideas please? http://pastie.org/7680640
[2013-04-21 11:33:59 -0400] bjensen: it turns out that it needs the pw for every rsync of the cookbooks
[2013-04-21 11:44:31 -0400] JeanMertz: Is there any way to install Chef-client on ubuntu 13.04 (raring)? I noticed the apt repository isn't being updated anymore and the Omnibus installer seems the way to go, but it doesn't support 13.04 yet.
[2013-04-21 13:51:00 -0400] gyre008: anyone here using https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nginx
[2013-04-21 13:51:09 -0400] gyre008: ohai reload takes bloody ages
[2013-04-21 13:51:12 -0400] gyre008: mental
[2013-04-21 14:00:17 -0400] cwj: that cookbook is a hot mess
[2013-04-21 14:02:49 -0400] jtimberman: JeanMertz: Use the full stack installer: http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/
[2013-04-21 14:03:44 -0400] jtimberman: koodough: sounds like you have a recipe that uses the logrotate_app definition. that cookbook needs to declare a dependency on logortate in its metadata.
[2013-04-21 14:08:26 -0400] cwj: jtimberman: any idea if cookbook code review will happen this week, what with chefconf coming up?
[2013-04-21 14:09:15 -0400] jtimberman: cwj: I think we're still having it on Monday
[2013-04-21 14:09:41 -0400] jtimberman: I'm going to be assisting in one of the cookbook authoring workshops.
[2013-04-21 14:11:15 -0400] cwj: ok, i need to get http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-2611 merged so i can properly commit a fix for http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-2747
[2013-04-21 14:27:19 -0400] bjensen: how do you guys get your public key on vagrant so you don't have to use passwords..
[2013-04-21 14:35:24 -0400] JeanMertz: jtimberman: I still don't see how to install the latest Chef on ubuntu 13.04. The page you gave doesn't let me select 13.04 and instead tells me to run installer.sh, which doesn't work. I only need chef-solo, and the Chef Server tab only lets me pick Chef upto 11.0.6
[2013-04-21 14:40:04 -0400] cwj: JeanMertz: you've tried something like  'curl -L http://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh | sudo bash' and it didn't work?
[2013-04-21 14:40:22 -0400] JeanMertz: cwj: Correct, because it doesn't have a package for ubuntu 13.04
[2013-04-21 15:02:28 -0400] hamzakc: Hi
[2013-04-21 15:02:42 -0400] hamzakc: I am having a problem with a bash block
[2013-04-21 15:02:48 -0400] hamzakc: I am using sed -i
[2013-04-21 15:03:45 -0400] hamzakc: from what i can tell it is removing the escape characters I have in the sed script
[2013-04-21 15:03:57 -0400] hamzakc: do i need to do anything special to tell it not to do that?
[2013-04-21 15:04:36 -0400] hamzakc: i read somewhere that you need to escape new line chars
[2013-04-21 15:05:02 -0400] hamzakc: i have done that, i have even removed the new line charm but i still get the same error
[2013-04-21 15:06:35 -0400] hamzakc: any help wuld be much appreciated
[2013-04-21 15:07:10 -0400] hamzakc: here is the sed script
[2013-04-21 15:07:56 -0400] hamzakc: sed -i 's/endscript/\/usr\/bin\/checksum_log.sh  $1 endscript/' /path/to/file
[2013-04-21 17:43:06 -0400] jtimberman: JeanMertz: use the package for 12.10
[2013-04-21 18:04:49 -0400] julienphalip: Hello there, is anyone interested in reviewing this pull request for the Gunicorn recipe? Thanks in advance! https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/gunicorn/pull/7
[2013-04-21 18:18:13 -0400] Buns: Hey all. Trying to provision a vagrant box with Chef server. Installed ruby 2.0 and bundler. When I try to run "bundle install" from one of my recipes, I get "bundle: command not found". I suspect chef-client on the vagrant box is running under a different ruby. Any ideas on how to get 'bundle install' to run?
[2013-04-21 18:24:11 -0400] smith3v: Hi, Buns. It seems you need to install bundler using chef_gem resource - http://docs.opscode.com/resource_chef_gem.html
[2013-04-21 18:27:31 -0400] Buns: smith3v, thanks, I'll give it a try. Worth noting, bundler is present when ssh'ing into the vagrant box.
[2013-04-21 18:28:50 -0400] smith3v: Yep, but if chef-client is set as Omnibus, then it uses it's own Ruby and separate gems bundled within it
[2013-04-21 18:29:22 -0400] smith3v: It doesn't use the system wide gems
[2013-04-21 18:30:58 -0400] smith3v: you can check it easily. Just check if you have chef in /opt/
[2013-04-21 18:31:54 -0400] Buns: yep /opt/chef is present
[2013-04-21 18:32:18 -0400] smith3v: so you chef_gems will help you
[2013-04-21 18:32:43 -0400] ssd7: Hrmm.  So, if it is available when you ssh into the box, then it is installed to the system ruby.  In most cases, you'll want your applications using the system ruby and not omnibus ruby
[2013-04-21 18:32:43 -0400] Buns: cool. I have a feeling I'm going to run into ruby version issues once the bundle mystery is solved
[2013-04-21 18:33:37 -0400] ssd7: My hunch is your path/enviornment is being altered in your login scripts that aren't run when you are running chef-client over ssh or the like.  I'd try to fix that rather than using omnibus's ruby isntallation
[2013-04-21 18:33:48 -0400] Buns: using RVM, confirmed that after the provision runs, ruby 2.0 is available on vagrant and root users
[2013-04-21 18:34:12 -0400] Buns: available and default that is
[2013-04-21 18:35:11 -0400] ssd7: Buns: In the typical RVM setup, it works by altering your environment via .bash_profile or other startup scripts which aren't going to get run in a non-login shell
[2013-04-21 18:36:37 -0400] Buns: ssd7: that makes sense, and I suspect that's exactly what's happening
[2013-04-21 18:39:31 -0400] Buns: is there a way to pass in some config to chef when running a non-login shell?
[2013-04-21 18:40:05 -0400] smith3v: Buns: should be more narrow way
[2013-04-21 18:42:35 -0400] Buns: ssd7, smith3v gotta run, but thanks for the info. I'll let you guys know how it goes
[2013-04-21 18:42:39 -0400] Buns: later!
[2013-04-21 22:48:01 -0400] flaccid: hmm anyone have any issues running latest chef-shell on ruby 2 ?
[2013-04-21 22:48:12 -0400] flaccid: i seem to get require': cannot load such file -- rubygems/format (LoadError)
[2013-04-21 22:48:16 -0400] flaccid: going to try updating gems
[2013-04-21 22:58:41 -0400] flaccid: hmm maybe chef doesn't support ruby 2 yet?
