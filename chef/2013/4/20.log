[2013-04-20 01:23:54 -0400] wassy121: Hi there chefs.  Is there a way to have a recipe run last, no matter what role it's in?
[2013-04-20 01:24:40 -0400] wassy121: I have a base role, and a bunch of braches/leaves that inherit up a chain (database-server -> database-master), etc.  And I need a recipe to run last as it checks the compiled_resources list.
[2013-04-20 01:25:47 -0400] wassy121: The recipe I'm trying to run is for managed_directory, and if it is run at the end of the base role, and database-server inherits base, then defines something in that same directory, it gets deleted and recreated every run
[2013-04-20 07:45:03 -0400] pnorman: I'm experimenting with Chef on a VM and I'm wondering if to upgrade packages I should do the normal apt-get commands, or if I should do something via knife?
[2013-04-20 08:11:46 -0400] pnorman: I guess nowisn't the best time to ask - off to bed, i'll check any mentions of my name in themorning.
[2013-04-20 10:58:10 -0400] thasmo: Hey there! Is there a date for when the omnibus installer gets support for Ubuntu 13.04?
[2013-04-20 15:33:42 -0400] gyre007: I just dont understand why is https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/postgresql/blob/master/templates/default/pg_hba.conf.erb#L19 set for ALL users and not just for postgres...
[2013-04-20 15:35:09 -0400] gyre007: if create a user using https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/database I'm never going to be able to log on the DB unless I change postgres listen attribute to NOT listen on localhost interface...
[2013-04-20 18:56:41 -0400] dillyjay: having some strange behavior with chef-solo as a vagrant provisioner. "php::source" recipe from the community cookbook failed this morning after working fine yesterday. after five tries of 'vagrant provision' it suddenly worked. and the failure points were inconsistent each of the first four. a couple times i got an 'tar: Unexpected EOF in archive' early in the process. a couple times there were drivers missing. what would cause
[2013-04-20 18:56:42 -0400] dillyjay: inconsistent behavior?
[2013-04-20 21:49:14 -0400] juliancdunn: dillyjay: sounds like a bad Internet connection
[2013-04-20 21:50:18 -0400] dillyjay: juliancdunn: thank you, been doing some research and thought that might be it. gotta love verizon broadband.
[2013-04-20 22:17:12 -0400] fasta: Using Chef can I express that I want the latest version of libbotan available? In this case libbotan-1.10-dev ?
[2013-04-20 23:11:52 -0400] awsuser: was trying to run: knife ec2 server create -I ami-46bf2xxx -bootstrap-protocol winrm -i /home/ubuntu/.chef/xx-keypair-01 -r "role[supern]" --region us-west-1 -f t1.micro --subnet subnet-43xxxxb --security-group-ids sg-9xxxxx6
[2013-04-20 23:12:08 -0400] awsuser: and i keep getting ERROR: You did not provide a valid 'AWS SSH Key Id' value.
[2013-04-20 23:12:16 -0400] awsuser: can someone help?
[2013-04-20 23:18:16 -0400] awsuser: anyone know knife ec2 commands?
[2013-04-20 23:24:57 -0400] zts: awsuser: you need to use the --ssh-key option to say which AWS keypair the instance should use
[2013-04-20 23:26:09 -0400] zts: awsuser: or you can edit your knife.rb to set knife[:aws_ssh_key_id] - that way you won't need to set it on the commandline
[2013-04-20 23:30:24 -0400] awsuser: does it matter if im launching windows hosts?
[2013-04-20 23:30:41 -0400] awsuser: thanks btw
[2013-04-20 23:32:29 -0400] awsuser: it says it doesnt exit but i see it there and i have given it full permissions
[2013-04-20 23:33:28 -0400] zts: awsuser: doesn't matter if it's windows - it's an AWS thing rather than a Chef thing
[2013-04-20 23:36:41 -0400] zts: awsuser: that option should be set to the "Key Pair Name" you find in the AWS web console, under EC2 -> Network & Security -> Key Pairs
[2013-04-20 23:37:01 -0400] neur0fx: Hey everyone, whenever I do a chef run on a AWS 12.04 TLS instance (completlely fresh bootup) with the nginx OR mysql::server recipes they fail. For some reason a weird version gets appended to the apt-get command preventing the package from getting properly downloaded.
[2013-04-20 23:37:25 -0400] neur0fx: this is the error: [2013-04-20T23:32:15+00:00] FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::Exec: package[nginx] (nginx::default line 35) had an error: Chef::Exceptions::Exec: apt-get -q -y install nginx=1.1.19-1ubuntu0.1 returned 100, expected 0
[2013-04-20 23:37:32 -0400] zts: awsuser: another thing to check is that the keypair is set up in the region you're using (they are per-region not per-account), I think that's tricked me before
[2013-04-20 23:38:01 -0400] neur0fx: any ideas? I'm pretty stumped. Same thing happens when trying to install mysqld with mysql::server
[2013-04-20 23:38:33 -0400] zts: neur0fx: if you try to run that apt-get command by hand, you'll get more information about what's going wrong - but it's probably that "apt-get update" needs to run
[2013-04-20 23:39:02 -0400] neur0fx: i did run it manually, it 404s, can't find package with that version
[2013-04-20 23:39:06 -0400] zts: neur0fx: if you put the default recipe in the apt cookbook first on your run_list, that will take care of it for you
[2013-04-20 23:39:57 -0400] neur0fx: so run the default apt recipe first THEN run the nginx default recipe?
[2013-04-20 23:39:58 -0400] awsuser: so should i copy the pem key local to my server and point to the file like so in knife.rb ...... knife[:aws_ssh_key_id]  = "/home/ubuntu/keypair.pem"
[2013-04-20 23:40:38 -0400] zts: neur0fx: yeah, you'll want it on your run_list before the other recipes so that 'apt-get update' runs before the later recipes try to install packages
[2013-04-20 23:41:01 -0400] neur0fx: cool, thanks, going to try that right away
[2013-04-20 23:41:41 -0400] zts: awsuser: no, knife[:aws_ssh_key_id] should be "your key name", where "your key name" is what you see in the AWS web console
[2013-04-20 23:42:16 -0400] zts: awsuser: ...oh hangon, sorry, I could be entirely wrong about it being the same with Windows
[2013-04-20 23:42:27 -0400] zts: let me check something
[2013-04-20 23:43:05 -0400] neur0fx: zts: thank you so much, it worked
[2013-04-20 23:44:58 -0400] zts: neur0fx: you're welcome, glad to hear it :)
[2013-04-20 23:48:13 -0400] zts: awsuser: how does winrm bootstrap work normally?  ie, what username and password would you use to bootstrap a windows server
[2013-04-20 23:49:12 -0400] zts: awsuser: I'm reading that on AWS, you actually use the keypair to call an API which tells you the Administrator password for the instance - 'knife ec2' definitely doesn't know how to do that
[2013-04-20 23:49:28 -0400] zts: do you know if that would be required?
[2013-04-20 23:52:02 -0400] awsuser: zts, yes that is right you would use the keypair to get your adminsitrator password
[2013-04-20 23:54:16 -0400] zts: awsuser: okay, that definitely won't work at the moment I'm afraid
[2013-04-20 23:54:53 -0400] zts: awsuser: if you have the time, I'd suggest going to tickets.opscode.com and reporting that you wanted to use 'knife ec2 server create' with a Windows instance, but it didn't work
[2013-04-20 23:55:20 -0400] awsuser: ok thanks
[2013-04-20 23:56:05 -0400] zts: awsuser: looks like there's already a ticket - http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KNIFE-161
[2013-04-20 23:59:39 -0400] awsuser: looks unresolved
