[2013-04-07 00:15:48 -0400] faustroll: gansbrest: kewl
[2013-04-07 00:16:29 -0400] gansbrest: now another strange thing ) Have you ever used chef-rewind
[2013-04-07 00:17:32 -0400] gansbrest: It seems like both original provider ( template ) and the one I rewrote gets executed, causing my mysql server to restart twice
[2013-04-07 00:35:40 -0400] flaccid: dang chef-shell seems heaps different to shef. time to read doc
[2013-04-07 01:20:13 -0400] flaccid: hmm i'm not sure if i am blind in docs, but how do i clear everything i have inputed into chef-shell/shef?
[2013-04-07 01:20:24 -0400] flaccid: so when i run_chef it doesn't get the old stuff
[2013-04-07 01:24:56 -0400] juliancdunn: flaccid: reset?
[2013-04-07 01:27:07 -0400] flaccid: ooo lemme try
[2013-04-07 01:31:48 -0400] flaccid: juliancdunn: thanks; that takes a while but if only option, sweet as; cheers!
[2013-04-07 01:36:53 -0400] basic`: how does one upgrade nagios from source using the nagios cookbook? I just realized half my problems were because I was using an outdated cookbook, and the new one also has a newer version of the nagios server that I would like to install
[2013-04-07 01:37:36 -0400] basic`: it looks like it already downloaded the new version, but   * bash[compile-nagios] action run didn't seem to do anything
[2013-04-07 01:39:20 -0400] flaccid: basic`: url to the source of the coookbook please
[2013-04-07 01:39:28 -0400] basic`: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nagios
[2013-04-07 01:39:36 -0400] basic`: thanks flaccid
[2013-04-07 01:39:41 -0400] flaccid: basic`:  you are using master?
[2013-04-07 01:39:47 -0400] basic`: i am now, yes
[2013-04-07 01:40:06 -0400] basic`: whatever knife cookbook site install gave me didn't support the packages from epel for centos properly
[2013-04-07 01:40:15 -0400] flaccid: oh, centos hmm
[2013-04-07 01:40:27 -0400] basic`: but now my server is running 3.4.3 from source and the new cookbook uses 3.4.4
[2013-04-07 01:40:28 -0400] flaccid: which recipe you running
[2013-04-07 01:40:49 -0400] basic`: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nagios/blob/master/recipes/server_source.rb
[2013-04-07 01:41:53 -0400] flaccid: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nagios/blob/master/recipes/server_source.rb#L65 does what it says
[2013-04-07 01:42:01 -0400] flaccid: pastebin whole output of run?
[2013-04-07 01:42:46 -0400] basic`: http://pastebin.osuosl.org/1621/
[2013-04-07 01:43:26 -0400] basic`: it runs the bash[compile-nagios], but nothing seemed to happen
[2013-04-07 01:43:32 -0400] basic`: line 219
[2013-04-07 01:44:24 -0400] flaccid: basic`: maybe because of  creates "/usr/sbin/nagios"
[2013-04-07 01:44:30 -0400] flaccid: like /usr/sbin/nagios probably exists?
[2013-04-07 01:44:44 -0400] basic`: ya it does.. is there a way to force that or should i just remove that file
[2013-04-07 01:45:43 -0400] flaccid: remove the file, however you might be able to make uninstall to do it cleaner from Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]
[2013-04-07 01:47:08 -0400] basic`: hmm no uninstall command
[2013-04-07 01:47:48 -0400] basic`: though at least with the old cookbook that was a world of pain with paths not lining up properly and having to override half of the attributes
[2013-04-07 01:49:39 -0400] flaccid: i've never used the nagios cookbook
[2013-04-07 01:50:08 -0400] flaccid: i assume the server recipe does from package not source.
[2013-04-07 01:50:10 -0400] basic`: flaccid: thanks for your help, i just rm'd the /usr/sbin/nagios and it updated itself
[2013-04-07 01:50:16 -0400] flaccid: or server_package rather
[2013-04-07 01:50:25 -0400] basic`: flaccid: it doesnt unfortunately, on rhel it defaults to source install
[2013-04-07 01:50:35 -0400] basic`: i may submit a pull request to fix that
[2013-04-07 01:50:39 -0400] basic`: but it works for now
[2013-04-07 01:51:01 -0400] flaccid: thats probably because its not in rhel
[2013-04-07 01:51:06 -0400] basic`: it's part of epel
[2013-04-07 01:51:16 -0400] flaccid: epel != rhel exactly
[2013-04-07 01:51:44 -0400] basic`: i know, but the client packages work if you set it to use packages, but the server packages dont because the paths aren't correct and the packages names are wrong
[2013-04-07 01:52:01 -0400] basic`: it automatically enables epel, which is why it defaults to source
[2013-04-07 01:52:12 -0400] flaccid: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nagios/blob/master/recipes/server_package.rb does only support debian at this time. you are welcome to contrib
[2013-04-07 01:52:39 -0400] flaccid: or just use a real server OS like debian :p
[2013-04-07 01:53:11 -0400] basic`: well, rhel is our default for political reasons :)
[2013-04-07 01:53:48 -0400] flaccid: thats too bad. you'll find that many cookbooks do not support it
[2013-04-07 01:54:01 -0400] flaccid: so you will need to contrib a lot if you want it supported better
[2013-04-07 01:54:19 -0400] basic`: i dont mind a little work here and there
[2013-04-07 01:54:40 -0400] basic`: we'll see how long that lasts ;)
[2013-04-07 01:55:02 -0400] flaccid: knowing redcrap people, not long at all :)
[2013-04-07 01:55:54 -0400] basic`: oof

[2013-04-07 13:11:18 -0400] yruss972: Hi, I'm having a very strange problem, data_bag is returning nil. I can't seem to find any reason why
[2013-04-07 13:13:01 -0400] yruss972: I"m using chef-solo v 10.18.2 btw
[2013-04-07 13:13:10 -0400] yruss972: Any ideas?
[2013-04-07 13:23:12 -0400] yruss972: In data_bag.rb, if I change line 164 bag[item['id']] = item to bag[item['raw_data']['id']] = item['raw_data'] it works :?
[2013-04-07 13:23:20 -0400] yruss972: did the data bag format change?
[2013-04-07 14:58:43 -0400] kesor: how can I use node[:something][:version] in a node[:something][:url] in attributes/default.rb file (if at all) so that I could override it in another cookbook attributes file after an include_attribute "something" line?
[2013-04-07 15:01:35 -0400] kesor: the best I could come up with, is have node[:something][:url] = "http://....something-{version}.tar.gz" and then replacing it in the recipe with .gsub("{version}", node[:something][:version])  any idea if thats a good idea?
[2013-04-07 17:43:37 -0400] indy_1984: hey has anyone here dealt with environments where ssh port is inconsistent? I'm trying to get knife ssh to use a different port for different hosts based on config (doing knife ssh with wildcard)
[2013-04-07 17:44:32 -0400] indy_1984: from what I can tell, this isn't possible unless i override the ssh argument in knife to use a node attribute other than fqdn?
[2013-04-07 18:11:37 -0400] chef_: Hello
[2013-04-07 18:11:59 -0400] chef_: Hey Can I use chef to automate Instance creation on AWS and Eucalyptus
[2013-04-07 18:15:23 -0400] knuckolls: chef_: yes. I did this at my previous job. take a look at knife-ec2 and knife-eucalyptus
[2013-04-07 18:15:38 -0400] knuckolls: chef_: it'll provision instances and then log in and bootstrap them with chef recipes
[2013-04-07 18:16:00 -0400] chef_: I will have a try.. Thank you..
[2013-04-07 18:16:21 -0400] chef_: any blog link for better explanation ..
[2013-04-07 18:16:40 -0400] knuckolls: chef_: are you familiar with knife?
[2013-04-07 18:16:57 -0400] chef_: No.. I am a beginner
[2013-04-07 18:17:06 -0400] chef_: experimenting on chef..
[2013-04-07 18:17:45 -0400] knuckolls: i'll take you through my previous workflow
[2013-04-07 18:17:52 -0400] knuckolls: and hopefully that'll give you enough context for the links i'll hand you
[2013-04-07 18:18:17 -0400] knuckolls: we'd write recipes, test them locally in vagrant with the vagrant chef-solo provider
[2013-04-07 18:18:32 -0400] knuckolls: chef-solo does nothing except grab the cookbooks you hand it, and run them
[2013-04-07 18:18:43 -0400] knuckolls: so once we had something working, we'd tag it with a version and upload it to the chef server
[2013-04-07 18:19:16 -0400] knuckolls: so the chef server holds cookbooks, versioned, and they contain recipes. the recipes will have different behavior based on the attributes applied and there are usually many default attributes specified in a cookbook
[2013-04-07 18:19:35 -0400] knuckolls: knife is the tool that you use to work with everything on the chef server
[2013-04-07 18:19:44 -0400] knuckolls: to upload cookbooks, environments, roles, etc
[2013-04-07 18:19:51 -0400] knuckolls: so there's a knife bootstrap command
[2013-04-07 18:20:20 -0400] knuckolls: which is pretty cool. you provide it with the login information of the node, tell it what chef cookbooks / recipes you want run on that node with what overridden attributes
[2013-04-07 18:20:46 -0400] knuckolls: and it'll log in, register itself with the chef server, download the cookbooks it needs, and set the machine up as specified in the run list
[2013-04-07 18:21:05 -0400] knuckolls: that you specified in your `knife bootstrap ` command
[2013-04-07 18:21:13 -0400] chef_: can I write my own recipe for knife
[2013-04-07 18:21:16 -0400] knuckolls: so the knife-ec2 and knife-eucalyptus projects take it a step further
[2013-04-07 18:21:27 -0400] knuckolls: knife is extendable
[2013-04-07 18:21:31 -0400] knuckolls: via plugins
[2013-04-07 18:21:51 -0400] knuckolls: so both of those projects take your aws / eucalyptus access credentials from the knife.rb config file
[2013-04-07 18:22:01 -0400] knuckolls: and fire up a new node
[2013-04-07 18:22:07 -0400] knuckolls: wait for it to come up
[2013-04-07 18:22:14 -0400] knuckolls: then bootstrap it immediately.
[2013-04-07 18:22:31 -0400] knuckolls: my gut feeling is that whatever you're wanting to do, there's already a knife plugin for it
[2013-04-07 18:22:37 -0400] knuckolls: or an existing community cookbook
[2013-04-07 18:22:43 -0400] knuckolls: github.com/opscode-cookbooks/
[2013-04-07 18:22:48 -0400] chef_: ok.
[2013-04-07 18:22:48 -0400] knuckolls: github.com/opscode/knife-ec2
[2013-04-07 18:22:57 -0400] knuckolls: github.com/opscode/knife-eucalyptus
[2013-04-07 18:23:03 -0400] knuckolls: hope that's helpful :)
[2013-04-07 18:23:12 -0400] chef_: Thanz a million
[2013-04-07 18:23:19 -0400] knuckolls: at the end of the day, everything in chef is just ruby
[2013-04-07 18:23:28 -0400] chef_: it was much helpful
[2013-04-07 18:23:43 -0400] knuckolls: glad to help, best of luck :)
[2013-04-07 18:24:05 -0400] chef_: Hey, Can you provide me few links which shows how to install the req stuff and use it for my purpose
[2013-04-07 18:25:54 -0400] knuckolls: maybe. the learning curve is still a bit steep. can i suggest starting with vagrant and chef-solo on your workstation before you move into working with chef-server, knife, ec2, euca, etc?
[2013-04-07 18:26:02 -0400] knuckolls: it'll give you a more solid foundation
[2013-04-07 18:26:23 -0400] knuckolls: chef_: http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/27487546/highlight/309841
[2013-04-07 18:26:45 -0400] knuckolls: berkshelf is a modern tool for developing cookbooks, i consider it chef development "easy-mode"
[2013-04-07 18:27:04 -0400] knuckolls: so it'll generate a cookbook for you, with a vagrant file
[2013-04-07 18:27:37 -0400] knuckolls: so you can test provisioning a server by just typing vagrant up
[2013-04-07 18:27:47 -0400] knuckolls: and berkshelf will handle getting the cookbooks and dependencies on the vagrant box for you
[2013-04-07 18:28:06 -0400] knuckolls: that'll let you drop right in to developing a cookbook, seeing how it runs
[2013-04-07 18:28:08 -0400] knuckolls: http://berkshelf.com/
[2013-04-07 18:28:25 -0400] knuckolls: so once you run vagrant up and run your cookbook on the vm initially
[2013-04-07 18:28:35 -0400] knuckolls: you can then make a change, and run `vagrant provision`
[2013-04-07 18:28:39 -0400] knuckolls: and it'll re-run your recipes
[2013-04-07 18:51:46 -0400] nebrera_: hi
[2013-04-07 18:52:03 -0400] nebrera_: at the new version of chef you use postgresql
[2013-04-07 18:52:05 -0400] nebrera_: isn't ?
[2013-04-07 18:57:47 -0400] nebrera_: how do you solve the high availability ?
[2013-04-07 18:59:09 -0400] knuckolls: nebrera_: i decided to just pay for hosted chef. the finances of trying to solve the HA myself didn't make sense versus opscode's pricing
[2013-04-07 18:59:13 -0400] knuckolls: just my two cents
[2013-04-07 18:59:25 -0400] knuckolls: they also have private chef, which goes inside your firewall. if that's your thing.
[2013-04-07 19:00:11 -0400] nebrera_: thats true

[2013-04-07 19:36:32 -0400] KarlHungus: i expect it needs a few attributes to support centos, etc. i only have ubuntu and freebsd handy
[2013-04-07 19:37:49 -0400] KarlHungus: i should whip up a short screencast. it makes cloud backups trivial
