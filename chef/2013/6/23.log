[2013-06-23 00:33:42 -0400] martinisoft: Has anyone in here worked with test-kitchen 1.0.x. and encrypted data bags?
[2013-06-23 01:27:49 -0400] dpt89: Good evening everyone
[2013-06-23 01:28:40 -0400] dpt89: I would like to know if there's a way to use `include_recipe` to import recipes from the same cookbook where this method is called
[2013-06-23 01:29:09 -0400] dpt89: I have a default.rb and don't know if its appropriate to reference the current cookbook when importing a recipe
[2013-06-23 01:29:19 -0400] dpt89: I'm just trying to learn how to do it better
[2013-06-23 01:32:00 -0400] gregf: dpt89: pretty common to do that, the opscode nginx cookbook does that for example. For example https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nginx/blob/master/recipes/default.rb
[2013-06-23 01:33:06 -0400] dpt89: I see
[2013-06-23 01:33:21 -0400] dpt89: gregg thanks for pointing a clear example out.
[2013-06-23 01:33:42 -0400] dpt89: I'm worried about creating terrible spaghetti, so I'm trying to pay attention to this things.
[2013-06-23 01:33:43 -0400] dpt89: thanks!
[2013-06-23 01:34:35 -0400] gregf: dpt89: no problem, so sounds like your on the right track
[2013-06-23 01:34:58 -0400] gregf: you're*
[2013-06-23 01:35:07 -0400] dpt89: I am. It was quite confusing on the beginning, but I'm starting to role and it feels good.
[2013-06-23 01:52:30 -0400] dpt89: gregf
[2013-06-23 01:52:55 -0400] gregf: dpt89: ?
[2013-06-23 01:53:05 -0400] dpt89: do you know how I can write interactively in chef-shell
[2013-06-23 01:53:08 -0400] dpt89: to test recipe code
[2013-06-23 01:53:20 -0400] dpt89: chef-shell gives me the prompt
[2013-06-23 01:53:39 -0400] dpt89: but when I try to do something like `bash "install something" do ()` the command doesn't work
[2013-06-23 01:54:59 -0400] dpt89: I just found it. I had been googling and reading without luck.
[2013-06-23 01:55:15 -0400] dpt89: I have to go into chef-shell and then run `recipe_mode`
[2013-06-23 01:56:08 -0400] gregf: yep, check out this too http://docs.opscode.com/chef_shell.html
[2013-06-23 01:57:39 -0400] dpt89: great. Thanks
[2013-06-23 02:52:51 -0400] dpt89: Hello
[2013-06-23 02:53:10 -0400] dpt89: what would be a good way to pass information from a ruby_block to another resource later on?
[2013-06-23 02:53:51 -0400] flaccid: dpt89: there probably isn't; i don't think thats a good practice
[2013-06-23 02:53:54 -0400] dpt89: for example, if I do some logic to determine some target folder to link to destination using `link`. How would I pass such information? Apparently a regular ruby closure won't work
[2013-06-23 02:54:00 -0400] dpt89: I thought so
[2013-06-23 02:54:12 -0400] dpt89: but I don't know how to write a recipe like this:
[2013-06-23 02:54:26 -0400] dpt89: I have an attribute for the node, an array of usernames.
[2013-06-23 02:54:51 -0400] dpt89: I need to check which of those usernames exists in the system
[2013-06-23 02:55:09 -0400] dpt89: if it exists I obtain it's home and then link a folder in that home to another folder
[2013-06-23 02:55:28 -0400] dpt89: the logical part of 'checking if User exist' and then 'finding its home'
[2013-06-23 02:55:48 -0400] dpt89: this are arrays of users and results, etc. I don't know how to handle all this
[2013-06-23 02:56:17 -0400] dpt89: writing the regular ruby code outside the ruby_block?
[2013-06-23 03:00:17 -0400] flaccid: if it can be done at compile time, do it in your attributes file as an attribute
[2013-06-23 03:03:39 -0400] dpt89: so
[2013-06-23 03:03:45 -0400] dpt89: I run logic in the attributes file
[2013-06-23 03:03:54 -0400] dpt89: and create the value for the attribute there?
[2013-06-23 03:04:09 -0400] dpt89: will this be interpreted every on ever single chef-client on the node?
[2013-06-23 03:06:40 -0400] flaccid: cookbooks are run per client yes
[2013-06-23 03:07:45 -0400] dpt89: ok, that sound good
[2013-06-23 03:07:49 -0400] dpt89: I was trying to do that but in the recipe
[2013-06-23 03:07:57 -0400] dpt89: and chef would complain because attributes are read only
[2013-06-23 03:08:13 -0400] dpt89: but your pointed the solution: do it in the attribute definition.
[2013-06-23 03:08:41 -0400] dpt89: I'm now having trouble with templates
[2013-06-23 03:09:18 -0400] dpt89: it says -Chef::Exceptions::FileNotFound-
[2013-06-23 03:09:59 -0400] dpt89: when I try to use one of the template from the cookbook
[2013-06-23 03:10:22 -0400] dpt89: however, the error asserts that I have the template source:
[2013-06-23 03:10:23 -0400] dpt89: This cookbook _does_ contain: ['zshrc.erb']
[2013-06-23 03:12:34 -0400] dpt89: I just found the error: the subfolder on templates was not given to the source options of the template resource.
[2013-06-23 03:22:37 -0400] dpt89: Now I'm almost finished with the cookbook
[2013-06-23 03:22:46 -0400] dpt89: I've set a role in the run list for a node
[2013-06-23 03:23:05 -0400] dpt89: but apparently any changes in the role will not result in updated in the node.
[2013-06-23 03:23:17 -0400] dpt89: how do I make a node pick up the last version of a role?
[2013-06-23 03:23:29 -0400] dpt89: I tried adding the role[name] again to the run list but it's not working
[2013-06-23 03:26:11 -0400] dpt89: any ideas?
[2013-06-23 03:32:43 -0400] gregf: dpt89: sure you uploaded? If you are trying to list the role twice I don't think it will get run both times either
[2013-06-23 03:33:07 -0400] dpt89: gregg I upload the file again using knife.
[2013-06-23 03:33:31 -0400] dpt89: but when I run chef-client there's no mention to the role. Like it already knows what the run list is and won't' check again with the role.
[2013-06-23 03:33:51 -0400] gregf: did you edit the run list to add the role?
[2013-06-23 03:34:41 -0400] dpt89: I did something like `knife node run_list add role[demo]'
[2013-06-23 03:34:56 -0400] dpt89:  `knife node run_list add node_name role[demo]'
[2013-06-23 03:35:33 -0400] gregf: if you run knife node show node_name is it in there?
[2013-06-23 03:36:08 -0400] dpt89: it's there in the run list, but not in the role
[2013-06-23 03:36:15 -0400] dpt89: Run List:    role[demo]
[2013-06-23 03:36:15 -0400] dpt89: Roles:
[2013-06-23 03:37:09 -0400] dpt89: after the first chef-client run is complete
[2013-06-23 03:37:12 -0400] dpt89: then the role appears
[2013-06-23 03:37:17 -0400] dpt89: in node show
[2013-06-23 03:37:54 -0400] dpt89: however, it seems that maybe what I'm interpreting as not updating the role might be an attribute override not working
[2013-06-23 03:38:11 -0400] dpt89: if I have an attribute in the cookbook, I can override the value from the role, right?
[2013-06-23 03:40:24 -0400] gregf: http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_attributes.html look at attribute types
[2013-06-23 03:40:33 -0400] gregf: depending on what you are doing you might have it wrong
[2013-06-23 03:41:56 -0400] dpt89: I had a wrong assumption
[2013-06-23 03:42:27 -0400] dpt89: I assumes the attributes to override used the key of the cookbook they belonged to
[2013-06-23 03:42:41 -0400] dpt89: so i was overriding something like :apache2 => :attribute_overwritten....
[2013-06-23 03:43:14 -0400] dpt89: I just had to use the exact same key as in the attributes files without mentioning the cookbook/recipe defining those values
[2013-06-23 03:43:27 -0400] gregf: k
[2013-06-23 03:44:39 -0400] gregf: so you figure it out? late here i'm tired and slow at this point
[2013-06-23 07:00:28 -0400] koaps: heya, any one know why disabling embedded rabbitmq in chef 11 would cause embedded postgres to fail on running createdb?
[2013-06-23 07:00:41 -0400] koaps: trying to use a different rabbitmq server
[2013-06-23 07:03:33 -0400] koaps: nevermind, thought reconfigure started the chef 11 services after it ran, guess it doesnt
[2013-06-23 19:55:07 -0400] kh019267: I'm trying to test a cookbook with chef-solo.  All attributes that my cookbook needs are defined as default attributes in the cookbook attributes default file.
[2013-06-23 19:55:52 -0400] kh019267: However, when running the cookbook, is get undefined method [] error when it comes across the first attribute referenced in a template
[2013-06-23 19:56:16 -0400] kh019267: Is this because my templates uses a node attribute and this doesn't work with chef-solo?
[2013-06-23 20:06:18 -0400] rayrod2030: what's the test-kitchen kitchen file yaml syntax for forwarding ports in vagrant?
[2013-06-23 20:50:40 -0400] koaps: hey guys, i'm having some issues getting chef-server 11 to use a different rabbitmq server, does any one know where erchef or other parts get the user/pass to connect to rabbit? I setup chef/chefrocks in my rabbitmq and I tested it can login to /chef but chef-server seems to still fail to connect with the wrong credentials
[2013-06-23 21:28:46 -0400] koaps: ah I see the issue
[2013-06-23 21:28:56 -0400] koaps: chef-server 11 is using old bunny
[2013-06-23 21:44:58 -0400] koaps: nice got around it
[2013-06-23 21:45:33 -0400] koaps: anyone know where cryted string erchef uses for rabbit comes from? seems to be the issue
[2013-06-23 23:39:44 -0400] cpick: I've been using node[:etc][:passwd][user_name][:dir] to fetch a user's home directory so that I can create files within it.
[2013-06-23 23:40:05 -0400] cpick: I'd now like to craete the user, but that means ohai doesn't have it's homedir at cookbook compilation time
[2013-06-23 23:40:20 -0400] cpick: Is there a standard way to work around this?
[2013-06-23 23:40:42 -0400] cpick: (If possible, I'd like to continue to let the OS choose the user's homedir, but that's not strictly necessary.)
[2013-06-23 23:43:37 -0400] cpick: Should I ask this kind of question in #learnchef?
