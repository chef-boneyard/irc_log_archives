[2013-06-02 02:51:08 -0400] restart: i have a s3_file resource, and in the service resource i declare  > subscribes :restart, resources("s3_file[/opt/server.jar]")
[2013-06-02 02:51:28 -0400] restart: but it doens't restart. i tested again a template file and that works, when its modified
[2013-06-02 02:56:16 -0400] restart: anybody there
[2013-06-02 02:56:47 -0400] flaccid: maybe not, its the weekend
[2013-06-02 03:00:14 -0400] restart: :/
[2013-06-02 03:00:38 -0400] restart: there is something faulty with services subscribes
[2013-06-02 03:01:11 -0400] restart: it works fine with chef resources

[2013-06-02 04:57:44 -0400] schuckles1: hi, hate to ask
[2013-06-02 04:58:00 -0400] schuckles1: but does anyone have any experience with the riverbed stingray cookbook?
[2013-06-02 05:41:22 -0400] theCzar: Alright, how do I install a package on smartos with chef?  Is there something I need to do to get it to work with pkgin?
[2013-06-02 05:42:35 -0400] flaccid: theCzar: i'm not sure if chef supports smartos
[2013-06-02 05:42:48 -0400] flaccid: theCzar: ohai platform
[2013-06-02 05:44:42 -0400] theCzar: "smartos"
[2013-06-02 05:45:05 -0400] flaccid: theCzar: what happens when using the package resource?
[2013-06-02 05:46:14 -0400] theCzar: It just tells me there's no candidate version available, but if I try and run pkgin manually on the VM it does find the package.
[2013-06-02 05:47:08 -0400] flaccid: not sure sorry
[2013-06-02 05:49:20 -0400] theCzar: flaccid: no worries
[2013-06-02 08:06:26 -0400] Cope: theCzar: I think smartos will use ips by default
[2013-06-02 08:06:32 -0400] Cope: no sorry - that's wrong
[2013-06-02 08:06:34 -0400] Cope: ignore me
[2013-06-02 08:06:40 -0400] Cope: that's omnios
[2013-06-02 08:07:51 -0400] Cope: thehar: I'll be in the office in a while, and can have a look; don't have access to boxen right now.
[2013-06-02 08:08:12 -0400] Cope: theCzar: you... bah; n e e d c o f f e e
[2013-06-02 08:08:36 -0400] theCzar: Cope: haha
[2013-06-02 08:10:47 -0400] Cope: theCzar: so yeah, it should totally use pkgin : https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/provider/package/smartos.rb
[2013-06-02 08:10:58 -0400] theCzar: So yeah, essentially what I'm trying right now is to use the package resource.  I'm not sure if that can/should work, I've seen mention of a smartos_pkgin resource that people get from other cookbooks, but I've also seen people say that chef can work with smartos natively
[2013-06-02 08:11:15 -0400] theCzar: hmm, yah OK
[2013-06-02 08:11:23 -0400] Cope: and it gets your candidate version with /opt/local/bin/pkgin se
[2013-06-02 08:12:04 -0400] theCzar: Cope: weird, why does it work from the command line but not through chef...
[2013-06-02 08:12:24 -0400] theCzar: maybe I need to specify the entire package name (version and all)
[2013-06-02 08:13:15 -0400] Cope: brb - need to wash, dress, travel etc
[2013-06-02 08:19:16 -0400] theCzar: Cope: alright
[2013-06-02 08:19:37 -0400] theCzar: I tried it with the full package name, still no luck
[2013-06-02 08:19:50 -0400] theCzar: Here's a gist of the output I'm getting from chef and pkgin
[2013-06-02 08:19:52 -0400] theCzar: https://gist.github.com/0x783czar/5692998
[2013-06-02 08:32:30 -0400] theCzar: Cope: it's 2:30AM here, and I have to get up in the morning.  So I'm gonna jump off.  If you can think of anything feel free to leave a comment on that gist.  Either way, I appreciate your help.
[2013-06-02 08:56:53 -0400] Cope: theCzar: righto
[2013-06-02 08:57:41 -0400] Cope: will take a look during the day and comment if I have any ideas; will see if I can reproduce too.
[2013-06-02 10:01:00 -0400] GreatSUN: hi all
[2013-06-02 10:01:51 -0400] GreatSUN: is there some possibility to set an node attribute persistant from inside a cookbook?
[2013-06-02 11:16:45 -0400] nd__: Is github flavored markdown supported for the README.md (for the community page)? That would make writing tables way easier
[2013-06-02 14:56:27 -0400] jtimberman: nd__: it is not, no.
[2013-06-02 14:56:54 -0400] jtimberman: nd__: the markdown rendering on the community site was written, iirc, before "GitHub Flavored Markdown" was a thing. :)
[2013-06-02 15:05:04 -0400] axyelp1: is there any way i can change log level for a particular recipe only. i want to do this to view the STDOUT for bash command.
[2013-06-02 15:10:12 -0400] eponymi: jtimberman: i'm working through my testing models, looking at your "Anatomy of a Test Kitchen" and some other resources. can you help me with why i'd want to set an attribute in .kitchen.yml instead of my regular attribute files?
[2013-06-02 15:25:01 -0400] eponymi: oh well
[2013-06-02 16:00:22 -0400] eponymi: using hosted chef; i want to add an 'applications' directory to my chef-repo on my workstation. do i need to do anything other than adding `applications/*` to my chefignore?
[2013-06-02 16:12:12 -0400] eponymi: can include_recipe be dynamic based on a node attribute? e.g. `include_recipe node["mycookbook"]["webserver"]["service"]`
[2013-06-02 16:40:01 -0400] novatech1: I'm seeing a rather puzzling thing; In a cookbook, I have a default attribute set to an array containing a single value.  I am then overriding that default attribute at 'default' level, in a role.  From the docs, this has precendence.
[2013-06-02 16:40:14 -0400] novatech1: However, on my node, I see an array with two values
[2013-06-02 16:40:37 -0400] novatech1: it's almost as if setting the attribute at default level in the role appended to the array, rather than replaced it.
[2013-06-02 16:41:25 -0400] novatech1: Is this expected behaviour? I understand I can set a more powerful attribute in the role, but is that actually necessary?
[2013-06-02 16:41:34 -0400] novatech1: I am not convinced that I would expect this to happen.
[2013-06-02 16:41:36 -0400] novatech1: Any ideas?
[2013-06-02 16:42:04 -0400] GreatSUN: novatech1: please paste some code
[2013-06-02 16:42:19 -0400] GreatSUN: (nopaste)
[2013-06-02 16:43:04 -0400] GreatSUN: jtimberman: you still around?
[2013-06-02 16:44:44 -0400] novatech1: GreatSUN: ok... well, I am using the chruby cookbook.  There's a default ruby in the cookbook attribute file.
[2013-06-02 16:45:30 -0400] novatech1: https://github.com/Atalanta/chef-chruby/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L6
[2013-06-02 16:45:50 -0400] novatech1: And I have a role which sets attributes like this:
[2013-06-02 16:47:22 -0400] novatech1: http://pastebin.com/RQNVLUZr
[2013-06-02 16:47:56 -0400] novatech1: when I run chef, the system installs 2 rubies
[2013-06-02 16:48:08 -0400] novatech1: and when I inspect the node attributes with knife
[2013-06-02 16:48:15 -0400] novatech1: rubies has two elements
[2013-06-02 16:49:31 -0400] GreatSUN: I bet it is, cause you are setting chruby to a hash within your profiles
[2013-06-02 16:49:42 -0400] GreatSUN: and the recipy addresses array
[2013-06-02 16:50:09 -0400] novatech1: when i set it to override, it only has one entry
[2013-06-02 16:50:12 -0400] novatech1: which is what i expect
[2013-06-02 16:51:00 -0400] novatech1: GreatSUN: not sure i follow what you mean about hash/array
[2013-06-02 16:51:18 -0400] novatech1: the chruby namespace on the attribite is a hash (well a mash)
[2013-06-02 16:51:28 -0400] novatech1: it has keys and values
[2013-06-02 16:51:40 -0400] novatech1: chruby['rubies'] - sure that's an array
[2013-06-02 16:51:54 -0400] novatech1: but chruby - at that level it's hash-like
[2013-06-02 16:53:10 -0400] GreatSUN: novatech1: node is a mash, everything beyond might be an array, hash or mash
[2013-06-02 16:53:28 -0400] GreatSUN: recipe is addressing value as an array value
[2013-06-02 16:53:38 -0400] GreatSUN: you are setting value as a hash value
[2013-06-02 16:55:13 -0400] GreatSUN: in my opinion it is just a problem of interpreting the values
[2013-06-02 16:55:22 -0400] GreatSUN: not really something you did wrong
[2013-06-02 16:55:30 -0400] novatech1: I'm sorry - I don't understand.  Look at the attributes file. For each chruby attribute we have a key
[2013-06-02 16:55:37 -0400] novatech1: therefire it's hash-like
[2013-06-02 16:56:10 -0400] novatech1: GreatSUN: and if what you say is correct, why would setting the attr at override level result in an array with 1 elemnt?
[2013-06-02 16:56:16 -0400] novatech1: (which it does)
[2013-06-02 16:56:44 -0400] GreatSUN: novatech1: cause override level sets everything
[2013-06-02 16:56:48 -0400] novatech1: not being a dick - or trolling - I just don't understand how a) what you say can be correct or b) how it explains what i see
[2013-06-02 16:56:50 -0400] GreatSUN: would be same as normal
[2013-06-02 16:57:46 -0400] GreatSUN: novatech1: it's mainly about default definition of variable type
[2013-06-02 16:58:05 -0400] GreatSUN: not something you can address directly
[2013-06-02 16:58:24 -0400] GreatSUN: if you want it to be overridden, you have to use a higher level
[2013-06-02 16:58:50 -0400] novatech1: ok i see that... but what makes you think it's an array?
[2013-06-02 16:59:01 -0400] GreatSUN: anyways I don't know what you want to achieve
[2013-06-02 16:59:30 -0400] novatech1: I want to set the value of node['chruby']['runies']
[2013-06-02 16:59:32 -0400] GreatSUN: normally if you define it like node['key']['key2'] = ['value']
[2013-06-02 16:59:40 -0400] GreatSUN: key2 type is an array
[2013-06-02 16:59:51 -0400] novatech1: it's defaulting to ['1.9.3-p392']
[2013-06-02 17:00:06 -0400] GreatSUN: if you define it like node['key'] = { 'key2' => [...] }
[2013-06-02 17:00:12 -0400] GreatSUN: it is defined as hash
[2013-06-02 17:00:14 -0400] novatech1: I set it to ['1.9.3-p432']
[2013-06-02 17:00:27 -0400] GreatSUN: or mash
[2013-06-02 17:00:30 -0400] novatech1: ok ..
[2013-06-02 17:00:56 -0400] GreatSUN: as I said, this is not something you are doing wrong
[2013-06-02 17:01:05 -0400] GreatSUN: it is just what ruby does
[2013-06-02 17:01:30 -0400] novatech1: ok - so the answer is use override?
[2013-06-02 17:01:37 -0400] novatech1: or is my role just wong?
[2013-06-02 17:01:41 -0400] GreatSUN: novatech1: if roles where able to take ruby definitions, you could create a ruby Array.new definition to get aroung that
[2013-06-02 17:02:03 -0400] GreatSUN: novatech1: use normal, like that you can still override from outside
[2013-06-02 17:02:12 -0400] GreatSUN: I don't think your role is wrong
[2013-06-02 17:02:14 -0400] novatech1: normal doesn't exist in role
[2013-06-02 17:02:17 -0400] novatech1: accoring to the docs
[2013-06-02 17:02:59 -0400] GreatSUN: oh well, didn't think about that
[2013-06-02 17:03:07 -0400] GreatSUN: sorry
[2013-06-02 17:03:17 -0400] GreatSUN: back to the main question
[2013-06-02 17:03:25 -0400] GreatSUN: what do you want to have as result
[2013-06-02 17:03:40 -0400] GreatSUN: why are you defining these values as default?
[2013-06-02 17:04:12 -0400] novatech1: the result i want is for chef to install 1.9.3-p432
[2013-06-02 17:04:17 -0400] novatech1: only that ruby
[2013-06-02 17:04:29 -0400] novatech1: the default in the cookbook is the earlier patch version
[2013-06-02 17:04:35 -0400] novatech1: if I don't set the attr, i get that
[2013-06-02 17:04:45 -0400] GreatSUN: so then nothing is against override
[2013-06-02 17:04:53 -0400] novatech1: so I set the attr in the role
[2013-06-02 17:05:14 -0400] novatech1: and the docs say that default in a role has precedence over default in a cookbook attr file
[2013-06-02 17:05:28 -0400] novatech1: but what it actually did was append to the array
[2013-06-02 17:10:34 -0400] Cope: OK - trying to understand novatech1
[2013-06-02 17:10:43 -0400] Cope: I've created a cookbook called attr-test
[2013-06-02 17:10:58 -0400] Cope: It has just a default attributes file in the cookbook
[2013-06-02 17:11:27 -0400] GreatSUN: Cope: to be able to get the same result you have to set value within a mash/hash definition
[2013-06-02 17:11:29 -0400] Cope: default['attr-test']['array'] = [1]
[2013-06-02 17:11:40 -0400] GreatSUN: cause ruby takes base type as default
[2013-06-02 17:11:55 -0400] Cope: So I apply that recipe, and look:
[2013-06-02 17:12:08 -0400] GreatSUN: therfore the value even though defined in [] gets a { 0 => value }
[2013-06-02 17:12:46 -0400] Cope: http://dpaste.com/1208638/
[2013-06-02 17:13:20 -0400] Cope: novatech1: this is what the chruby cookbook does too - just sets attrs like that in default attr file in the cookbook
[2013-06-02 17:13:26 -0400] Cope: Now, I'll create a role
[2013-06-02 17:14:00 -0400] Cope: http://dpaste.com/1208650/
[2013-06-02 17:14:08 -0400] Cope: That looks like what you did - right?
[2013-06-02 17:14:35 -0400] GreatSUN: Cope: nearly
[2013-06-02 17:14:43 -0400] GreatSUN: and it's not me ;-)
[2013-06-02 17:14:56 -0400] GreatSUN: I just had that problem with types in ruby already ;-)
[2013-06-02 17:15:28 -0400] Cope: ok - applying that role
[2013-06-02 17:17:26 -0400] Cope: http://dpaste.com/1208653/
[2013-06-02 17:17:35 -0400] Cope: that seems to do what I expect, novatech1
[2013-06-02 17:18:33 -0400] GreatSUN: Cope: maybe you should have some other attribute to your array attribute
[2013-06-02 17:18:34 -0400] GreatSUN: ;-)
[2013-06-02 17:20:01 -0400] Cope: ok
[2013-06-02 17:20:02 -0400] Cope: http://dpaste.com/1208655/
[2013-06-02 17:20:28 -0400] GreatSUN: right
[2013-06-02 17:21:03 -0400] GreatSUN: might also be it just appears with string values (I haven't analyzed that far)
[2013-06-02 17:21:13 -0400] Cope: just resetting by running just the recipe
[2013-06-02 17:21:21 -0400] GreatSUN: sure
[2013-06-02 17:21:26 -0400] Cope: ok so array is 1
[2013-06-02 17:21:34 -0400] Cope: applying role
[2013-06-02 17:21:35 -0400] GreatSUN: it might also be connected to some ruby version
[2013-06-02 17:21:58 -0400] GreatSUN: just to remind that there are other factors to have a look at ;-)
[2013-06-02 17:22:27 -0400] Cope: ok - same thing; 1 was replaced with 2
[2013-06-02 17:23:02 -0400] GreatSUN: Cope: I dunno why it works for you and not for him... just guessed that the problem resides in the variable types
[2013-06-02 17:23:12 -0400] GreatSUN: cause I had kinda this already once
[2013-06-02 17:23:36 -0400] GreatSUN: not connected with attributes not overwriting values
[2013-06-02 17:24:05 -0400] GreatSUN: but with .each stuff not working out cause the type was the wrong
[2013-06-02 17:24:58 -0400] Cope: http://dpaste.com/1208662/
[2013-06-02 17:30:59 -0400] GreatSUN: Cope: does not matter I think
[2013-06-02 17:31:08 -0400] Cope: GreatSUN: it matters to novatech1 :)
[2013-06-02 17:31:14 -0400] GreatSUN: he has a solution
[2013-06-02 17:31:16 -0400] GreatSUN: override
[2013-06-02 17:31:28 -0400] GreatSUN: which is in my opinion anyways the better solution
[2013-06-02 17:31:31 -0400] Cope: that shouldn't be necessary
[2013-06-02 17:31:44 -0400] Cope: that's the nuclear option
[2013-06-02 17:31:52 -0400] Cope: attribute precendence should just work
[2013-06-02 17:32:11 -0400] GreatSUN: Cope: I know. It might also be connected to some specific chef/ohai version with a specific ruby version
[2013-06-02 17:32:20 -0400] GreatSUN: don't invest too much time in it now
[2013-06-02 17:32:54 -0400] GreatSUN: he should tell us what versions he is using, so that we might be able to reproduce the error without try and fail
[2013-06-02 17:33:56 -0400] GreatSUN: Cope: always experiencing the same stuff... one version works without something disgusting and the other doesnt
[2013-06-02 17:34:20 -0400] GreatSUN: sometimes also in special version combinations something messes up
[2013-06-02 17:41:52 -0400] novatech1: sorry - latest chef from omnibus
[2013-06-02 17:41:55 -0400] novatech1: on latest ubuntu
[2013-06-02 17:44:25 -0400] GreatSUN: I am out, no ubuntu in my house
[2013-06-02 17:44:48 -0400] GreatSUN: <--- slackware and rhel/sles
[2013-06-02 17:46:38 -0400] Cope: what package provider do you use for slackware, GreatSUN ?
[2013-06-02 17:47:25 -0400] GreatSUN: mostly none ;-)
[2013-06-02 17:47:38 -0400] GreatSUN: <-- downloads sources and compiles
[2013-06-02 17:48:48 -0400] Cope: old skool
[2013-06-02 17:48:52 -0400] GreatSUN: yeah
[2013-06-02 17:49:00 -0400] GreatSUN: but always worked out best for me
[2013-06-02 17:49:08 -0400] Cope: novatech1: this is odd enough to merit an issue against chruby cookbook at least
[2013-06-02 17:49:19 -0400] Cope: i don't understand what is happening
[2013-06-02 17:49:29 -0400] Cope: at the same precendence order, chef will merge hashes
[2013-06-02 17:49:47 -0400] Cope: i would expect at the same precedence level, chef will overwrite arrays
[2013-06-02 17:49:51 -0400] Cope: and that's what my test does
[2013-06-02 17:50:02 -0400] Cope: but in your case, it seems to merge arrays too
[2013-06-02 17:50:15 -0400] Cope: GreatSUN is right - override will do the trick for you
[2013-06-02 17:50:20 -0400] Cope: it's a blunt instrument
[2013-06-02 17:50:29 -0400] Cope: but it's what you'd need to use for a hash
[2013-06-02 17:50:53 -0400] GreatSUN: Cope: since I had/have to work with old chef ( < 11) I have another instrument
[2013-06-02 17:51:07 -0400] GreatSUN: I created some library for attribute late binding
[2013-06-02 17:51:34 -0400] GreatSUN: there is always one option someone is able to use: overwrite
[2013-06-02 17:52:05 -0400] GreatSUN: also I have the possibility to have differen attributes (configurations) for different versions of a software
[2013-06-02 17:52:44 -0400] Cope: novatech1: just been chatting offline with someara - he's puzzled too; will see if anyone else has an idea
[2013-06-02 19:28:17 -0400] Cope: novatech1: still looking into this for you - it's super confusing
[2013-06-02 19:30:09 -0400] eponymi: that's dedication
[2013-06-02 19:31:46 -0400] Cope: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/mixin/deep_merge.rb#L100
[2013-06-02 19:32:17 -0400] Cope: novatech1: so seems arrays will merge
[2013-06-02 19:33:20 -0400] eponymi: Cope, i have a question that's mostly semantical and will probably do nothing more than peeve you: shouldn't these examples (https://github.com/zpatten/cc-chef-repo/tree/master/features) include a lot less "code"?
[2013-06-02 19:33:47 -0400] eponymi: to adhere to the principals of BDD where you write as little technical language or code as possible?
[2013-06-02 19:34:21 -0400] eponymi: or is the understanding that a stakeholder in a cucumber-chef will have adequate technical proficiency to change the rules a little bit?
[2013-06-02 19:34:34 -0400] eponymi: so three questions...
[2013-06-02 19:34:36 -0400] Cope: eponymi: it depends who the stakehoder is
[2013-06-02 19:34:46 -0400] Cope: generally I don't like zahary's cukes
[2013-06-02 19:35:02 -0400] Cope: I think he lets too much implementation bleed
[2013-06-02 19:35:37 -0400] eponymi: are there any better examples of cucumber-chef you could share?
[2013-06-02 19:35:38 -0400] Cope: generally you want your cukes to be as implementation agnostic as possible
[2013-06-02 19:36:26 -0400] eponymi: my experience with gherkin is entirely in the world of development, but everything that i've heard/read indicates that plain language is mandatory
[2013-06-02 19:36:32 -0400] Cope: I agree
[2013-06-02 19:36:45 -0400] Cope: Now, in some cases, your stakeholder is technical
[2013-06-02 19:37:01 -0400] Cope: in which case the domain language can be technical
[2013-06-02 19:37:12 -0400] Cope: but you still want to shield the implementation detail
[2013-06-02 19:38:26 -0400] eponymi: i also think i remember something in the cuke4ninjas book that specifically mentioned not using adverbs like "properly" or "correctly" in your feature descriptions. there is also an instance of that in the cc example.
[2013-06-02 19:38:41 -0400] Cope: eponymi: frankly, I think cucumber-chef has gone in a direction I don't like
[2013-06-02 19:38:53 -0400] Cope: eponymi: I do things differently now
[2013-06-02 19:39:02 -0400] eponymi: wait, you're the guy from the testing foodfight that created cucumber chef, correct?
[2013-06-02 19:39:05 -0400] Cope: and as of 4.0 zachary has his own project - test lab
[2013-06-02 19:39:10 -0400] Cope: right - I wrote cucumber-chef
[2013-06-02 19:39:21 -0400] Cope: but zpatten is now the main dev
[2013-06-02 19:39:45 -0400] eponymi: ah. so without taking too much of your time, could you maybe link me to some reading material about how you're doing things now?
[2013-06-02 19:40:17 -0400] Cope: eponymi: so I have 6 days and counting to finish the update of my book; in w hich there will be exactly that stuff
[2013-06-02 19:40:28 -0400] Cope: so you can see it there :)
[2013-06-02 19:40:37 -0400] eponymi: anything to hold me over in the meantime? i will buy your book :)
[2013-06-02 19:40:53 -0400] eponymi: even just a list of the tools in your testing process?
[2013-06-02 19:42:07 -0400] Cope: tools: foodcritic, knife cookbook test, tailor, cain -> chefspec -> kitchen + serverspec -> cucumber + rspec expectations
[2013-06-02 19:42:37 -0400] Cope: also minitest-handler has value
[2013-06-02 19:42:52 -0400] Cope: and bats, for quick post-converge tests
[2013-06-02 19:43:54 -0400] eponymi: ok, so in taxonomical parlance, that would be, in order: syntax and code quality -> unit testing -> integration/system testing -> acceptance testing?
[2013-06-02 19:44:19 -0400] Cope: yes
[2013-06-02 19:44:23 -0400] Cope: but in reverse
[2013-06-02 19:44:31 -0400] Cope: I always go outside in
[2013-06-02 19:44:32 -0400] kart: hey all. i have a situation - i'm using s3_file, and notifies :restart isn't working, seems to just get ignored
[2013-06-02 19:44:50 -0400] eponymi: ah. that might just make my brain explode.
[2013-06-02 19:44:58 -0400] Cope: why?
[2013-06-02 19:45:07 -0400] Cope: just start with the acceptance  criteria
[2013-06-02 19:45:13 -0400] Cope: the cukes fail
[2013-06-02 19:45:18 -0400] Cope: now write the post converge tests
[2013-06-02 19:45:22 -0400] Cope: they will fail
[2013-06-02 19:45:27 -0400] Cope: now write the specs
[2013-06-02 19:45:29 -0400] Cope: chefpsec
[2013-06-02 19:45:32 -0400] Cope: they will fail
[2013-06-02 19:45:36 -0400] Cope: now write the resources
[2013-06-02 19:45:40 -0400] Cope: now the specs pass
[2013-06-02 19:45:48 -0400] Cope: now the post converge tests pass
[2013-06-02 19:45:56 -0400] Cope: now some/all of your acceptance criteria are met
[2013-06-02 19:46:00 -0400] Cope: iterate
[2013-06-02 19:46:01 -0400] Cope: win
[2013-06-02 19:46:06 -0400] eponymi: theoretically, it makes all the sense in the world. it is just quite different from my process in the past. frankly i've only recently started testing in any form
[2013-06-02 19:46:16 -0400] eponymi: old habits, and all
[2013-06-02 19:46:36 -0400] Cope: so i don't do this all the time, by any stretch; i should.. and when I do it makes a big difference
[2013-06-02 19:46:48 -0400] Cope: but the temptation to open up an editor and hack is so so great
[2013-06-02 19:47:09 -0400] eponymi: you know, why not? as it's the weekend, i'll go ahead and try a little application cookbook like this.
[2013-06-02 19:48:13 -0400] Cope: novatech1: so - after working it through with someara and coderanger -- what you saw is expected behavior.  If you want to over-write your array and not merge, you need to use override
[2013-06-02 19:48:16 -0400] eponymi: at any rate (without sounding cheesy, hopefully), you had the three comments which made the most sense to me in the food fight discussion. so kudos and thanks for the answers.
[2013-06-02 19:48:41 -0400] coderanger: Well, you need them at different levels
[2013-06-02 19:48:48 -0400] coderanger: could be default vs normal or whatever
[2013-06-02 19:48:54 -0400] Cope: right
[2013-06-02 19:49:03 -0400] Cope: although iirc there is no normal in roles
[2013-06-02 19:52:51 -0400] kart: figured it out use_inline_resources
[2013-06-02 20:08:27 -0400] novatech1: Cope: wow thanks for all that effort
[2013-06-02 20:09:09 -0400] GreatSUN: does someone of you guys know if/how it is possible to set persistant node attributes from within a recipe
[2013-06-02 20:09:09 -0400] Cope: novatech1: I'm going to change the way teh rubies attribute works in the chruby cookbook
[2013-06-02 20:09:12 -0400] GreatSUN: ?
[2013-06-02 20:09:15 -0400] coderanger: Cope: https://github.com/coderanger/coderanger.github.com/blob/master/_posts/2013-06-02-arrays-and-chef.markdown
[2013-06-02 20:09:20 -0400] coderanger: Cope: Hows that sound?
[2013-06-02 20:10:52 -0400] Cope: coderanger: that's really awesome
[2013-06-02 20:11:46 -0400] Cope: novatech1: so yeah - read what coderanger just wrote; I'm going to change the chruby cookbook to use that pattern.
[2013-06-02 20:15:51 -0400] coderanger: Okay, hitting the publish button then
[2013-06-02 20:17:37 -0400] coderanger: Oh lovely, apparently my version of jekyll doesn't process fenced blocks
[2013-06-02 20:17:56 -0400] GreatSUN: hehe
[2013-06-02 20:18:02 -0400] GreatSUN: as I said before
[2013-06-02 20:18:24 -0400] GreatSUN: hash/mash build in ruby merges with array values
[2013-06-02 20:19:53 -0400] coderanger: https://coderanger.net/2013/06/arrays-and-chef/
[2013-06-02 20:20:40 -0400] GreatSUN: btw
[2013-06-02 20:20:51 -0400] novatech1: coderanger: so would your pattern work wirh default_attributes in a role? I'd set the ruby to false if i didn't want it?
[2013-06-02 20:20:55 -0400] novatech1: would that stick?
[2013-06-02 20:21:00 -0400] coderanger: novatech1: yep
[2013-06-02 20:21:02 -0400] novatech1: or would I still need to use override?
[2013-06-02 20:21:05 -0400] GreatSUN: does someone know if I can access chef cache-dir via a node-attribute?
[2013-06-02 20:21:05 -0400] novatech1: ah ok great
[2013-06-02 20:24:17 -0400] sascha_d: @GreatSUN Chef::Config['file_cache_path']
[2013-06-02 20:25:04 -0400] GreatSUN: sascha_d: is that though the directory where cookbooks/cookbookname/... resides?
[2013-06-02 20:25:19 -0400] sascha_d: that's the parent dir
[2013-06-02 20:25:34 -0400] sascha_d: aka /var/chef/cache
[2013-06-02 20:25:43 -0400] GreatSUN: thats what I ment
[2013-06-02 20:25:50 -0400] GreatSUN: and searched for
[2013-06-02 20:25:51 -0400] GreatSUN: thanks
[2013-06-02 20:26:06 -0400] sascha_d: So yeah, it's a known thing to chef, not a node attribute
[2013-06-02 20:26:36 -0400] sascha_d: for example  remote_file "#{Chef::Config['file_cache_path']}/somefile.txt" do
[2013-06-02 20:30:02 -0400] GreatSUN: sascha_d: thanks, I needed exactly this
[2013-06-02 20:30:14 -0400] sascha_d: super
[2013-06-02 20:48:00 -0400] Cope: coderanger: new version of chruby cookbook released, using that pattern :)
[2013-06-02 21:07:06 -0400] GreatSUN: hey all
[2013-06-02 21:08:02 -0400] GreatSUN: if I have a library method thats called normally and need to call two other methods within the library which are calling lwrp's
[2013-06-02 21:08:21 -0400] GreatSUN: is there a possibility to have them forced into a specific order?
[2013-06-02 21:08:30 -0400] GreatSUN: (one is dependant on the other)
[2013-06-02 21:12:39 -0400] ermajn_: hello, what is common usage of parameters for chef recipes. For example I want o use same recipe but with different parameters for different node...
[2013-06-02 21:42:25 -0400] ermajn_: is it practice to use data bag
[2013-06-02 21:42:28 -0400] ermajn_: or something else?
[2013-06-02 21:46:26 -0400] matti: ermajn_: You mean attributes?
[2013-06-02 21:47:23 -0400] ermajn_: matti, I want to use same recipe for different nodes, and to give different parameter to each node
[2013-06-02 21:47:44 -0400] matti: ermajn_: You can override on the node level.
[2013-06-02 21:47:52 -0400] matti: ermajn_: Read on attributes in Chef :)
[2013-06-02 21:50:29 -0400] ermajn_: i'm reading and there is nothing for me...
[2013-06-02 21:50:59 -0400] ermajn_: where to override in a recipe file? then when I add a new node, I should make changes to recipe file ?
[2013-06-02 21:51:04 -0400] ermajn_: I do not want to do that.
[2013-06-02 21:52:25 -0400] matti: Nothing for you?
[2013-06-02 21:53:21 -0400] ermajn_: nop
[2013-06-02 21:53:39 -0400] matti: ermajn_: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_attribute_files.html
[2013-06-02 21:56:05 -0400] ermajn_: ok, thanks
[2013-06-02 22:38:01 -0400] ermajn_: why my chef-shell won't load cookbooks.. I have specified config file.. the same as for chef-solo, for chef-solo it works normally, but for chef-shell: chef > node['recipes']
[2013-06-02 22:38:02 -0400] ermajn_:  => []
[2013-06-02 23:26:37 -0400] spulec: Anyone with some public cookbooks interested in giving some feedback on a hosted testing solution?
