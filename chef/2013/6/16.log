[2013-06-16 02:05:05 -0400] schuckles: Hi, I'm having trouble with this
[2013-06-16 02:05:07 -0400] schuckles: https://gist.github.com/schuckles/5790457
[2013-06-16 02:05:24 -0400] schuckles: it the node name seems to be picking up the node name of the local system that's running the cookbook
[2013-06-16 02:05:32 -0400] schuckles: I'm wondering what I'm doing wrong?
[2013-06-16 02:06:17 -0400] schuckles: if anyone can help, I'll buy them BBQ (if you're in the bay area) :-)
[2013-06-16 02:06:55 -0400] schuckles: yummy BBQ, c'mon :-) !!!! nom nom nom
[2013-06-16 02:13:48 -0400] pcn:  node_name = host[node.name]
[2013-06-16 02:14:26 -0400] pcn: How is that supposed to work exactly?
[2013-06-16 02:17:00 -0400] schuckles: i also tried node_name = host['node.name']
[2013-06-16 02:18:09 -0400] schuckles: this is based off of the https://github.com/automatedlabs/shared-cookbooks/tree/netkernel-upstart cookbook
[2013-06-16 02:18:55 -0400] schuckles: I was attempting to modify the alias to reflect the node name
[2013-06-16 02:42:23 -0400] petecheslock: what about node_name = host['name']
[2013-06-16 02:42:42 -0400] schuckles: lemme try
[2013-06-16 02:45:59 -0400] petecheslock: hmm - this is odd https://gist.github.com/petecheslock/b8a457853ce5d5eddea2 - if the above doesn't work then just node_name = host.name may do it.
[2013-06-16 02:50:19 -0400] schuckles: petecheslock: ZOMG
[2013-06-16 02:50:21 -0400] schuckles: that worked
[2013-06-16 02:50:26 -0400] schuckles: you're awesome!!!!!
[2013-06-16 02:50:43 -0400] petecheslock: sawweet need to get me some bbq now
[2013-06-16 02:51:04 -0400] schuckles: if you're in the bay area, BBQ is on me!!!!!

[2013-06-16 02:58:57 -0400] petecheslock: schuckles -cool man - i'll let you know. i do like a good bbq
[2013-06-16 03:25:40 -0400] pcn: Well, I
[2013-06-16 03:25:57 -0400] pcn: I'm on the east coast and a vegetarian, so I won't lay any claim to that bbq for my little contribution
[2013-06-16 03:26:17 -0400] schuckles: this place has great veggie BBQ
[2013-06-16 03:27:49 -0400] pcn: That is worth knowing all by itself
[2013-06-16 03:41:34 -0400] tester: hello
[2013-06-16 03:42:49 -0400] tester: has any one used chef to automate rpm deployment

[2013-06-16 20:36:13 -0400] awgross: anyone around with experience developing Vagrant plugins, #vagrant is very silent
[2013-06-16 20:47:28 -0400] schuckles: i do not, but... i'll hear you out, may have some ideas

[2013-06-16 20:49:04 -0400] awgross: when i do `vagrant plugin install vagrant-chef-zero` it seems to install the i18n plugin and then prunes the gems for my plugin. https://gist.github.com/andrewgross/5793322
[2013-06-16 20:49:04 -0400] schuckles: error?
