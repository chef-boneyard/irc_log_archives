[2013-06-09 01:06:57 -0400] stoked: any suggestions for dealing with clients with the same name like vagrant vm's?
[2013-06-09 01:07:16 -0400] stoked: if all my devs have the same vm's with the same name, they will get 401 errors
[2013-06-09 01:38:08 -0400] sascha_d: @stoked the vagrantfile is jsut ruby
[2013-06-09 01:39:36 -0400] sascha_d: I've tacked on ENV['USER'] or something similar
[2013-06-09 01:41:16 -0400] sascha_d: [4] pry(main)> ENV['USER'].inspect  / => "\"saschabX\""
[2013-06-09 01:42:15 -0400] sascha_d: so config.vm.hostname = "somename-#{ENV['USER']}"
[2013-06-09 01:45:31 -0400] stoked: ah
[2013-06-09 01:45:41 -0400] stoked: was thinking that but working with windows guests
[2013-06-09 01:46:22 -0400] stoked: renaming the guest requires a reboot
[2013-06-09 01:46:35 -0400] stoked: anyhow, thanks
[2013-06-09 02:08:20 -0400] axsuul: Can I make chef server reflect changes ASAp through the API rather than a minute later?

[2013-06-09 05:49:12 -0400] runfromnowhere: Not sure if anyone's up at this hour but been going through the "Ifconfig" provider and was wondering if there was a particular reason that the interface IP is used as the "name" of the resource as opposed to the device name?

[2013-06-09 09:55:54 -0400] a_a_g: i tried installing nokogiri manually. thats also not working so its definitely a nokogiri problem. can i lock down the gem version that the omnibus installer installs?
[2013-06-09 09:56:53 -0400] gianarb: syntax error thanks!
[2013-06-09 10:52:30 -0400] gkarekinian: gianarb: The answer is in the question, you have a typo in add_recipe: add_repice

[2013-06-09 11:00:52 -0400] SteveMac: wondering if anyone has a cookbook that installs mod_jk for apache?
[2013-06-09 12:41:35 -0400] Z: Did the structure of run_context.cookbook_collection[cookbook_name].metadata change between Chef 10 and Chef 11 by any chance?
[2013-06-09 12:42:07 -0400] Z: I used to be able to do something like `sp = run_context.cookbook_collection[cookbook_name].metadata["platforms"]` followed by a simple `case sp`
[2013-06-09 12:42:29 -0400] Z: and that now barfs.

[2013-06-09 15:34:28 -0400] drogoh: is it possible to manage users without explicitly specifying uid or gid using one of the community cookbooks?
[2013-06-09 16:14:40 -0400] pcn: OK, modified the gem for now
[2013-06-09 17:15:13 -0400] coderanger: drogoh: Yes, just leave that field empty or don't give it at all
[2013-06-09 17:37:19 -0400] drogoh: thought so, must be some other reason the recipe isn't working

[2013-06-09 18:04:47 -0400] massey_: the node is reported in the knife node list, however if I issue ssh it tells me FATAL: No nodes returned from search!
[2013-06-09 18:05:17 -0400] massey_: sure it the fqdn missing.. so
[2013-06-09 18:05:58 -0400] massey_: knife ssh -a x.x.x.x "name:server"  " ps"
[2013-06-09 18:06:08 -0400] massey_: gives me:
[2013-06-09 18:06:21 -0400] massey_: FATAL: 1 node found, but does not have the required attribute to establish the connection. Try setting another attribute to open the connection using --attribute.

[2013-06-09 20:49:38 -0400] sfd: "knife client list" gives same error

[2013-06-09 20:49:57 -0400] sfd: and i'm using chef solo to provision ubuntu server
[2013-06-09 20:50:10 -0400] coderanger: Ahh, solo
[2013-06-09 20:50:18 -0400] coderanger: knife data bag create is a chef-server API command :)
[2013-06-09 20:50:29 -0400] sfd: ahhh
[2013-06-09 20:50:48 -0400] sfd: so i need a command to create encrypted databag for chef solo?
[2013-06-09 20:50:50 -0400] coderanger: Encrypted bags don't usually give you much in chef-solo, probably not what you want to use
[2013-06-09 20:52:36 -0400] sfd: is there an other option to make config files, that do not need to be transfered to the server in plain text?
[2013-06-09 20:52:56 -0400] sfd: i want to use it for setting up mysql server, en don't store plain text root password
[2013-06-09 20:53:14 -0400] coderanger: Usually chef-solo configs are transferred either via git or rsync, both can run over SSH
[2013-06-09 20:53:40 -0400] coderanger: or HTTPS in the case of git
[2013-06-09 20:54:13 -0400] sfd: yes i understand
[2013-06-09 20:54:30 -0400] coderanger: If you mean you don't want to store them in plaintext on the target server, just make it root:root:600, if you assume a local priv exploit, they can just as easily reset the DB password manually :)
[2013-06-09 20:54:32 -0400] sfd: but the config file will be stored in the server in plain text
[2013-06-09 20:55:01 -0400] sfd: ok
[2013-06-09 20:55:01 -0400] sfd:  mm
[2013-06-09 20:55:08 -0400] coderanger: Basically if you don't want to trust Linux's file-level protections, you've already lost the security game so hard that crypto won't help
[2013-06-09 20:55:25 -0400] coderanger: Not saying that a healthy paranoia isn't good, but its more of a weakest-link situation :)
[2013-06-09 20:56:14 -0400] coderanger: There is some possible use case for encrypting bags before storing in SCM if you either don't trust other people with SCM access, or if you don't trust the SCM server
[2013-06-09 20:56:58 -0400] coderanger: But since you would then have to handle distributing the decrytion key outside of Chef, with solo it is usually just as easy to distribute the relevant data manually
[2013-06-09 21:50:52 -0400] bobbyz: Does anyone know of any hosted CI services that are chef friendly?  As far as I can tell, it looks like Travis and Circle are pre-loaded with a ton of software and services that could conflict organization cookbooks.  Ideally it would be nice to use a service that lets you test a bare ubuntu image.
[2013-06-09 21:51:16 -0400] bobbyz: Or are most people doing chef CI work in-house on Jenkins?
[2013-06-09 21:53:52 -0400] coderanger: bobbyz: You mean you want to test on build-slaves you provision yourself?
[2013-06-09 21:56:34 -0400] bobbyz: coderanger: My goal is continuous integration and deployment of both chef-managed infrastructure as well as application code.  So I see part of that as spinning up a bare VM image and running chef provisioning on top.  I'm not sure a cold provision would be necessary every time, but that's the idea yes
[2013-06-09 21:56:59 -0400] coderanger: I know of no hosted system even remotely like that :)
[2013-06-09 21:58:55 -0400] bobbyz: The two popular hosted CI services I know of are TravisCI and CircleCI.  Both of them appear to spin up VMs on demand to run the testing, and in fact TravisCI says they use Chef to do that VM provision on their end.  They share their cookbooks on Github.  But it doesn't look like either of these services let you plug in your own provisioning
[2013-06-09 22:03:58 -0400] coderanger: No, they want a single stable environment.
[2013-06-09 22:10:34 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: You around?
[2013-06-09 22:26:36 -0400] skrb: I am new to chef. Question: what is the best way of modifying default-ssl (apache2)? I need to change   "AllowOverride None to"  "AllowOverride All" for /var/www.
[2013-06-09 22:26:45 -0400] jtimberman: coderanger: happen to be at the moment
[2013-06-09 22:26:59 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application_python/pull/30
[2013-06-09 22:27:06 -0400] coderanger: jtimberman: Care if I push buttan?
[2013-06-09 22:27:29 -0400] jtimberman: coderanger: is there a ticket? :)
[2013-06-09 22:27:34 -0400] coderanger: Nope!
[2013-06-09 22:27:39 -0400] jtimberman: please make one
[2013-06-09 22:27:41 -0400] coderanger: :P
[2013-06-09 22:27:43 -0400] coderanger: Fiiiiine
[2013-06-09 22:27:55 -0400] jtimberman: that's the kind of thing that's good to get in the changelog.md :)
[2013-06-09 22:29:00 -0400] jtimberman: which is now mainly generated from querying jira
[2013-06-09 22:29:25 -0400] jtimberman: also, tests + test kitchen support would be fantastic :)
[2013-06-09 22:29:43 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, no chance of that happening ;-)
[2013-06-09 22:30:05 -0400] coderanger: Also we should figure out a process where the overhead is <100x the time it took to make the patch :P
[2013-06-09 22:30:40 -0400] jtimberman: heh
[2013-06-09 22:30:55 -0400] jtimberman: main reason for the overhead is jira
[2013-06-09 22:31:19 -0400] jtimberman: and jira is there instead of github issues because a) github issues weren't a thing when we started and b) it gives us a way to track CLA holders pretty easily.
[2013-06-09 22:31:23 -0400] jtimberman: it could be improved for sure
[2013-06-09 22:32:24 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, and it makes sense for "external contributors", we should just figure out how to deal with handing out the commit bit like a more normal project
[2013-06-09 22:39:52 -0400] juliancdunn: how is CLAHub doing these days?
[2013-06-09 22:40:24 -0400] coderanger: Not a thing
[2013-06-09 22:41:13 -0400] coderanger: It really never was a thing, one of those "good idea projects" that never got past the first week of work
[2013-06-09 22:42:06 -0400] juliancdunn: damn, that sucks
[2013-06-09 22:44:02 -0400] coderanger: On my perma-backburner is trying to rig up something similar using the echosign API
[2013-06-09 22:44:23 -0400] killfill: hi all

[2013-06-09 22:45:04 -0400] killfill: its very little but important for smartos users.. :P
[2013-06-09 22:46:06 -0400] coderanger: killfill: channeling jtimberman, please open a Jira ticket too
[2013-06-09 22:46:26 -0400] killfill: Jira ticket?

[2013-06-09 23:21:50 -0400] axsuul: Anyone know how I can upload site cookbooks with knife?
[2013-06-09 23:31:12 -0400] coderanger: axsuul: "site-cookbooks" aren't a thing
[2013-06-09 23:31:15 -0400] coderanger: only "cookbooks"
[2013-06-09 23:32:44 -0400] jtimberman: coderanger: they're a thing as long as cookbook_path is an array :)
[2013-06-09 23:34:32 -0400] jtimberman: also, still in the default Chef::Config: cookbook_path [ platform_specific_path("/var/chef/cookbooks"), platform_specific_path("/var/chef/site-cookbooks") ]
[2013-06-09 23:34:36 -0400] jtimberman: :)
[2013-06-09 23:34:58 -0400] coderanger: No, there is no knife site-cookbook anything
[2013-06-09 23:35:06 -0400] coderanger: they are cookbooks in a different folder
[2013-06-09 23:38:58 -0400] killfill: hi jtimberman you think https://github.com/opscode/ohai/pull/145 looks good?
[2013-06-09 23:40:13 -0400] axsuul: jtimberman: coderanger: I specified cookbook_path as an array ["cookbooks/", "site-cookbooks/"] but now when I do knife upload roles/ or knife upload cookbooks/ nothing is outputted to screen. However, If i just leave it as ["cookbooks/"] it works, any suggestions?
[2013-06-09 23:40:52 -0400] coderanger: killfill: It will get reviewed during the normal code review cycle
[2013-06-09 23:41:03 -0400] axsuul: I think it might be messing with the paths or working directory that knife thinks its in?
[2013-06-09 23:41:12 -0400] coderanger: axsuul: You can't use a secondary folder with knife upload like that
[2013-06-09 23:41:15 -0400] killfill: greate :)
[2013-06-09 23:41:18 -0400] coderanger: It implies folder structure
[2013-06-09 23:41:28 -0400] coderanger: axsuul: You can use knife cookbook upload whatever though
[2013-06-09 23:42:37 -0400] axsuul: coderanger: I tried doing knife upload site-cookbooks/ but nothing happens, and site-cookbooks is in the same directory I'm running the command in
[2013-06-09 23:42:49 -0400] coderanger: Indeed
[2013-06-09 23:42:57 -0400] coderanger: Like I said, knife upload will not work
[2013-06-09 23:43:03 -0400] coderanger: You need to use knife cookbook upload
[2013-06-09 23:43:14 -0400] axsuul: oh sorry
[2013-06-09 23:44:32 -0400] coderanger: knife upload assumes that are using the "standard" folder layout
[2013-06-09 23:47:49 -0400] axsuul: coderanger: Thanks, so how about roles and environments?
[2013-06-09 23:48:14 -0400] coderanger: What about them?
[2013-06-09 23:48:39 -0400] axsuul: Now "knife upload roles/" doesn't work since my cookbook_path in knife.rb is an array
[2013-06-09 23:48:55 -0400] axsuul: and it doesn't look like there is a knife role upload command
[2013-06-09 23:50:05 -0400] coderanger: cookbooks have nothing to do with roles
[2013-06-09 23:50:27 -0400] coderanger: knife upload should be able to handle roles as long as you aren't using the Ruby DSL because it can't translate yet
[2013-06-09 23:50:38 -0400] coderanger: If you are using the Ruby DSL, you need to use knife role from file
[2013-06-09 23:51:10 -0400] axsuul: coderanger: Hmm wonder if its a bug, cause with cookbook_path ['cookbooks/'], knife upload roles works, but with cookbook_path ['cookbooks/', 'site-cookbooks/'], knife upload roles doesn't work
[2013-06-09 23:52:02 -0400] axsuul: Also, all my roles are json
[2013-06-09 23:53:46 -0400] coderanger: axsuul: That sounds like something is going wrong :)
[2013-06-09 23:55:01 -0400] axsuul: TIME TO SUBMIT A TICKET, thanks
[2013-06-09 23:55:12 -0400] axsuul: whoops
[2013-06-09 23:56:57 -0400] coderanger: axsuul: Ack, I see the issue
[2013-06-09 23:57:04 -0400] coderanger: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/chef_fs/knife.rb#L46-L48
[2013-06-09 23:57:16 -0400] coderanger: That is wrong in the case of more than one cookbook path
[2013-06-09 23:57:36 -0400] coderanger: It is computing the base path as 'cookbooks/site-cookbooks/..'
[2013-06-09 23:58:12 -0400] axsuul: Ah yea, cause its an array
[2013-06-09 23:59:14 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, looks like this is fixed in more recent knife-essentials
[2013-06-09 23:59:29 -0400] coderanger: and I know john is working on upgrading the bundled copy
