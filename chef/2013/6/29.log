[2013-06-29 06:09:01 -0400] axyelp: why do 'node.roles' doesn't return anything when i call it in a different recipe or even in chef-shell? i mean, how do i get the roles of the node?
[2013-06-29 06:22:10 -0400] stormerider: iirc you have to look at the run_list
[2013-06-29 06:47:20 -0400] erthad: hiall
[2013-06-29 06:47:39 -0400] erthad: does omnibus-packaged chef-client miss the initscript?
[2013-06-29 06:55:18 -0400] axyelp: stormerider:  couldn't find it - even node.run_list returns null
[2013-06-29 06:57:10 -0400] countdigi: erthad: i don't remember it installing one, just ran rpm -q --scripts chef and i don't see any post-install logic that installs one (chef 11.4.4)
[2013-06-29 06:59:39 -0400] erthad: coderanger: you've mentioned recently that installation Chef via apt repo is deprecated and not recommended but this page shows it as a recommended one: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installing+Chef+Client+on+Ubuntu+or+Debian
[2013-06-29 07:00:03 -0400] stormerider: ah, yeah, i think that run_list can't be parsed from ohai data.
[2013-06-29 07:00:15 -0400] stormerider: erthad: the entire wiki is deprecated i believe
[2013-06-29 07:00:21 -0400] axyelp: stormerider: so,.. whattodo?
[2013-06-29 07:00:24 -0400] stormerider: erthad: check docs.opscode.com
[2013-06-29 07:00:55 -0400] stormerider: axyelp: istr it's been discussed on the mailing list a few times, check the archives?
[2013-06-29 07:00:56 -0400] axyelp: stormerider: i need to know the roles in a recipe[base::deploy] so i can run role specific recipes  on all servers
[2013-06-29 07:01:09 -0400] axyelp: stormerider: alright! np! thanks!
[2013-06-29 07:02:00 -0400] stormerider: erthad: i believe you want to use the chef-client::service recipe to manage that, its not installed by omnibes
[2013-06-29 07:02:04 -0400] stormerider: omnibus*
[2013-06-29 07:02:40 -0400] erthad: stormerider: I've seen some wikpages with the banner like that but it is easy to forget about that unless you was hit several times by outdated info from wiki
[2013-06-29 07:02:46 -0400] coderanger: erthad: wiki.opscode.com is itself entirely deprecated for docs
[2013-06-29 07:02:51 -0400] coderanger: erthad: Use docs.opscode.com
[2013-06-29 07:02:56 -0400] erthad: stormerider: thank you, I'll check that recipe
[2013-06-29 07:04:32 -0400] erthad: coderanger: could you please add a deprecation message to all wiki pages but not only to some few of them like now?
[2013-06-29 07:05:55 -0400] coderanger: That is not something we can easily do in Confluence or we would have already
[2013-06-29 07:06:14 -0400] coderanger: There is a reason we are migrating off it :)
[2013-06-29 07:07:42 -0400] erthad: in page template probably? with a <div> ;-)
[2013-06-29 07:08:23 -0400] coderanger: There is some weird issue with our templates because of our licensing of Confluence for FOSS
[2013-06-29 07:09:00 -0400] erthad: sorry to hear that then
[2013-06-29 07:15:54 -0400] flaccid__: anyone from opscode alive that could process https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application_ruby/pull/16 ?
[2013-06-29 07:17:20 -0400] flaccid__: i guess waiting for mod from http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-2079
[2013-06-29 07:18:02 -0400] coderanger: That seems like an awful solution
[2013-06-29 07:18:12 -0400] coderanger: very -1 on merge
[2013-06-29 07:18:23 -0400] flaccid__: i agree
[2013-06-29 07:18:38 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, btm has it right
[2013-06-29 07:19:40 -0400] flaccid__: i will see if i can work out from that what it should be
[2013-06-29 07:19:50 -0400] flaccid__: to do a pr
[2013-06-29 07:20:11 -0400] coderanger: Just need to add that dir resource to the before_compile hook
[2013-06-29 07:28:08 -0400] flaccid__: coderanger: just add it in on before new_resource.restart_command ?
[2013-06-29 07:28:37 -0400] flaccid__: directory "#{new_resource.application.path}/current/tmp"
[2013-06-29 07:30:11 -0400] flaccid__: ah need recursive though
[2013-06-29 07:30:46 -0400] coderanger: You don't, the current folder is made by the app resource
[2013-06-29 07:31:03 -0400] flaccid__: its coming back Chef::Exceptions::EnclosingDirectoryDoesNotExist
[2013-06-29 07:31:10 -0400] flaccid__: Parent directory /usr/local/rails_app/current does not exist, cannot create /usr/local/rails_app/current/tmp
[2013-06-29 07:31:56 -0400] coderanger: What point in the cycle are you creating it? check where the app provider does it folder creates
[2013-06-29 07:32:52 -0400] flaccid__: woops, i'll put it in the unless
[2013-06-29 07:34:19 -0400] flaccid__: i still get Chef::Exceptions::EnclosingDirectoryDoesNotExist . i'll gist what i have
[2013-06-29 07:35:42 -0400] flaccid__: coderanger: https://gist.github.com/flaccid/5890243#file-gistfile1-txt-L37
[2013-06-29 07:54:48 -0400] flaccid__: coderanger: nathen's commit works interestingly, so i am putting it in wrong place or something?
[2013-06-29 07:55:11 -0400] flaccid__: or maybe its coz of the compile, execution order hmm
[2013-06-29 09:35:26 -0400] flaccid__: coderanger: i think this is workable https://gist.github.com/flaccid/5890243#file-gistfile1-txt-L37
[2013-06-29 09:59:24 -0400] stormerider: sent in another pull request for the nagios cookbook :) http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-3262
[2013-06-29 10:05:50 -0400] stormerider: also asked for some thoughts on another ticket: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-3210
[2013-06-29 18:31:08 -0400] kav_: hi anyone pls help me, we need to have separate windows chef server to maintain Windows nodes??????
[2013-06-29 18:39:52 -0400] dpt89: Hi Everyone
[2013-06-29 18:40:18 -0400] dpt89: I've been trying to figure out how to use chef-apply with chef-server
[2013-06-29 18:40:21 -0400] dpt89: is it possible?
[2013-06-29 18:40:38 -0400] dpt89: I want to run a single recipe every minute to manage DNS
[2013-06-29 18:41:05 -0400] dpt89: I don't want the whole chef-client to run. But I can't manage to get chef-apply work when there are dependencies in the recipe
[2013-06-29 18:42:02 -0400] dpt89: any ideas on how to run a single recipe instead of the whole chef-run using cron?
[2013-06-29 18:46:17 -0400] Otterley: dpt89, see the '-o' option to chef-client
[2013-06-29 18:49:15 -0400] ehthayer: welp,  java cookbook on centos 5.9 w/ ruby aegis biffs with this http://pastebin.com/4Wzy8Fjn
[2013-06-29 18:51:45 -0400] ehthayer: looks like i'm not the only one http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2013-06/msg00265.html
[2013-06-29 18:53:11 -0400] Otterley: ehthayer, are you running the omnibus client?
[2013-06-29 18:55:14 -0400] ehthayer: @otterley followed these instructions http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installing+Chef+Client+on+CentOS
[2013-06-29 18:55:53 -0400] dpt89: Otterley checking it out
[2013-06-29 18:56:00 -0400] Otterley: ehthayer, I'm afraid that wiki is horribly out of date
[2013-06-29 18:56:18 -0400] Otterley: http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/
[2013-06-29 18:56:48 -0400] ehthayer: tnx.   i'll  check those out
[2013-06-29 18:57:26 -0400] dpt89: Otterley, that'll do exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
[2013-06-29 19:01:10 -0400] stormerider: what syslog servers do folks tend to use? looking to sent one up at home, not sure if i should go with syslog-ng or rsyslog or something else. do want support for SSL so i can have linodes reporting back to it as well.
[2013-06-29 19:02:27 -0400] Otterley: I'm using syslog-ng
[2013-06-29 19:05:44 -0400] ehthayer: utterly worked like a champ!
[2013-06-29 19:05:51 -0400] ehthayer: stupid autocorrect
[2013-06-29 20:08:24 -0400] CaptainQuirk: Hi there
[2013-06-29 20:08:41 -0400] CaptainQuirk: I'm having bit of an issue with a lwrp I'm writing now
[2013-06-29 20:08:51 -0400] Otterley: what's the issue
[2013-06-29 20:09:39 -0400] CaptainQuirk: One of my actions if failing due to an exception
[2013-06-29 20:09:55 -0400] CaptainQuirk: The action itself launches a command of an npm module
[2013-06-29 20:10:28 -0400] CaptainQuirk: it seems that the module tries to print out the action's progress on stdout
[2013-06-29 20:11:02 -0400] CaptainQuirk: should try the --quiet flag
[2013-06-29 20:11:04 -0400] CaptainQuirk: silly me
[2013-06-29 20:11:18 -0400] Otterley: I'm not sure why that would cause an exception though
[2013-06-29 20:11:40 -0400] Otterley: usually there are only problems if the execution returns nonzero
[2013-06-29 20:14:29 -0400] CaptainQuirk: well, the module itself is throwing an exception
[2013-06-29 20:14:54 -0400] Otterley: the npm module?
[2013-06-29 20:17:20 -0400] CaptainQuirk: yes
[2013-06-29 20:17:33 -0400] Otterley: ah, that's outside Chef's scope. ==
[2013-06-29 20:19:17 -0400] CaptainQuirk: yeah ...
[2013-06-29 20:19:38 -0400] CaptainQuirk: trying to silence the module, but it still displays a progress bar
[2013-06-29 20:19:58 -0400] Otterley: also outside Chef's scope. :)
[2013-06-29 20:20:20 -0400] CaptainQuirk: well, kind of I guess
[2013-06-29 20:20:39 -0400] Otterley: how might it not be?
[2013-06-29 20:21:16 -0400] CaptainQuirk: no, I agree with you
[2013-06-29 20:25:11 -0400] CaptainQuirk: But that's a shame
[2013-06-29 20:25:29 -0400] CaptainQuirk: how does chef deals with certain package managers that display a progress bar ?
[2013-06-29 20:25:41 -0400] Otterley: chef doesn't care what the output is.  it only cares about the exit status
[2013-06-29 20:50:23 -0400] visof: hello
[2013-06-29 20:51:13 -0400] visof: where should i learn to write cookbooks?
[2013-06-29 22:00:14 -0400] dahunter3: Quick question: I'm just getting started with chef and I have a split environment. One set of nodes will need the username prod to knife ssh into them and the other set is on EC2 and the other needs user ubuntu. Is there a place where I can specify this automatically so that I can just run knife ssh 'name:*' w and get results from all nodes?
[2013-06-29 22:11:37 -0400] stormerider: dahunter3: why not provision your own users with chef and use that to connect?
[2013-06-29 22:12:35 -0400] dahunter3: stormerider: Well, that would sort of work. But doesn't EC2 still require I pass in pem file details whereas non-ec2 servers don't require that?
[2013-06-29 22:13:09 -0400] stormerider: dahunter3: you shouldnt be using passwords in the first place IMO
[2013-06-29 22:13:22 -0400] dahunter3: stormerider: I'm not, they are all public keys
[2013-06-29 22:13:48 -0400] dahunter3: Well, asymmetrical encryption rather public/private
[2013-06-29 22:13:53 -0400] stormerider: that's all the EC2 is setting up by default, unless you're talking about actually bootstrapping the nodes?
[2013-06-29 22:14:11 -0400] stormerider: all that*
[2013-06-29 22:20:20 -0400] dahunter3: I guess I don't know I'm new to all of this.
[2013-06-29 22:21:18 -0400] dahunter3: I'm not talking about bootstrapping. I just want to be able to ssh to them all without having to specify stuff to knife
[2013-06-29 22:21:38 -0400] dahunter3: Does it use my local machine to do the sshing? If so, could I just edit ~/.ssh/config ?
[2013-06-29 22:28:39 -0400] stormerider: yes
[2013-06-29 22:28:55 -0400] stormerider: but really, you should disable the ubuntu user on EC2 and use your own.
[2013-06-29 22:38:59 -0400] dahunter3: stormerider: Gotcha. Very helpful, thanks!
[2013-06-29 22:46:30 -0400] stormerider: np
[2013-06-29 22:46:55 -0400] stormerider: huh. i did not realize that Linode was listed in Ohai as a cloud provider.
[2013-06-29 22:47:05 -0400] stormerider: however, it does not seem to play nicely.
[2013-06-29 22:47:12 -0400] stormerider: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-3263
[2013-06-29 22:52:44 -0400] stormerider: notably, it sets cloud.public_ips instead of cloud.public_ipv4
[2013-06-29 22:53:13 -0400] stormerider: im not sure if that's something that should be worked around in the nagios cookbook template, or fixed in ohai?
