[2013-06-30 00:05:12 -0400] joelteon: is it possible to skip the "make" step in :install_with_make in ark?
[2013-06-30 00:53:47 -0400] joelteon: ok nvm, not using ark
[2013-06-30 00:54:14 -0400] joelteon: i'm using chef-solo. does kitchen converge clear the :file_cache_path directory before it runs
[2013-06-30 00:54:22 -0400] joelteon: because a remote file is being downloaded although it shouldn't be
[2013-06-30 01:07:37 -0400] joelteon: should i not store it in /tmp, then?
[2013-06-30 01:09:36 -0400] joelteon: or should I not be converging?
[2013-06-30 02:17:53 -0400] joelteon: or should I just put a not_if in every resource of the recip
[2013-06-30 02:17:54 -0400] joelteon: e
[2013-06-30 02:17:58 -0400] joelteon: well, at least that works
[2013-06-30 02:19:51 -0400] joelteon: but i feel like maybe it's not the right thing to do
[2013-06-30 02:27:34 -0400] joelteon: ok, chef doesn't make sense
[2013-06-30 02:27:49 -0400] joelteon: you're only supposed to extract and configure if the cached files don't already exist
[2013-06-30 02:28:02 -0400] joelteon: if the install succeeds, wouldn't you want to remove that stuff since it's just wasting disk space?
[2013-06-30 02:28:14 -0400] joelteon: but if you remove them, it'll extract and install again
[2013-06-30 02:28:21 -0400] joelteon: iiiii am confused
[2013-06-30 02:31:05 -0400] coderanger: joelteon: You need to design your idempotent checks around that
[2013-06-30 02:31:37 -0400] coderanger: joelteon: For example, use the installed binary as an idempotent check for the whole install cycle
[2013-06-30 02:50:50 -0400] joelteon: coderanger: I'm guessing a not_if block in each component is not the Right Way to Do It though
[2013-06-30 02:51:01 -0400] coderanger: Not in this case probably
[2013-06-30 02:51:49 -0400] coderanger: If you want to have the intermediary stages to be non-idempotent you'll need more complex code
[2013-06-30 02:51:54 -0400] joelteon: ok
[2013-06-30 02:51:58 -0400] coderanger: Or just make each operation idempotent itself
[2013-06-30 02:52:06 -0400] joelteon: Right, maybe I'll install to /usr/ghc or something
[2013-06-30 02:55:32 -0400] joelteon: coderanger: thank you for responding btw
[2013-06-30 02:55:56 -0400] coderanger: No prob, can get a bit slow around here on weekends
[2013-06-30 03:07:13 -0400] flaccid: how do you support boolean in metadata if Option default must be a kind of [String, Array, Hash]! ?
[2013-06-30 03:09:09 -0400] flaccid: appears to be a limitation, http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4075
[2013-06-30 03:11:48 -0400] coderanger: flaccid: They aren't actually used for anything so lulz
[2013-06-30 03:12:12 -0400] flaccid: coderanger: i use rightscale so no lulz :)
[2013-06-30 03:12:21 -0400] flaccid: added a comment, http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4075?focusedCommentId=37242&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-37242
[2013-06-30 03:12:26 -0400] coderanger: Does rightscale use that data?
[2013-06-30 03:12:42 -0400] flaccid: yes
[2013-06-30 03:12:45 -0400] coderanger: Nifty
[2013-06-30 03:13:59 -0400] flaccid: interestingly this is probably the same case for opsworks as i notice https://github.com/scalarium/cookbooks/pull/15/files
[2013-06-30 03:14:26 -0400] flaccid: https://github.com/Dunedan/scalarium-cookbooks/commit/3ed1f37105d7b1a3350a0c28f4bd63b6d122a0f6
[2013-06-30 03:15:33 -0400] flaccid: coderanger: was my application_ruby pr ok if you had a looksy?
[2013-06-30 03:15:46 -0400] coderanger: flaccid: Haven't looked yet
[2013-06-30 03:15:52 -0400] coderanger: Doing my best to relax :)
[2013-06-30 03:17:21 -0400] flaccid: then what are you doing here :p
[2013-06-30 03:27:09 -0400] flaccid: coderanger: https://github.com/flaccid/cookbooks/blob/master/cookbooks/rails_app/recipes/application.rb https://github.com/flaccid/cookbooks/blob/master/cookbooks/rails_app/metadata.rb starting to be more substanial :)
[2013-06-30 03:42:59 -0400] BrianJ: So im working on a cookbook to setup tomcat on windows. I was able to extract it and everything to c:\tomcat . How would I setup the service to start running? the command that needs to be run: http://pastie.org/8095972
[2013-06-30 03:43:32 -0400] BrianJ: My question is really, is there a way I can use "service" or does this need to be a powershell command
[2013-06-30 04:21:51 -0400] joelteon: ok so it appears that chef-solo is ignoring my config.vm.synced_folders in my Vagrantfile
[2013-06-30 04:21:53 -0400] joelteon: why might that be
[2013-06-30 04:22:08 -0400] joelteon: the first argument I'm passing to it is a folder that definitely exists
[2013-06-30 04:22:17 -0400] coderanger: Not sure how that would be related to solo, thats s Vagrant feature
[2013-06-30 04:22:57 -0400] joelteon: ok
[2013-06-30 04:24:03 -0400] joelteon: okay...
[2013-06-30 04:39:42 -0400] flaccid: undefined method `after_fork' for Chef::Resource::ApplicationRubyUnicorn
[2013-06-30 04:39:50 -0400] flaccid: is it possible that my chef is too old?
[2013-06-30 04:40:40 -0400] flaccid: or maybe i should be rolling back the application cookbook versions to support 10.10
[2013-06-30 04:52:08 -0400] flaccid: hmm it doesn't seem to be that :(
[2013-06-30 04:53:04 -0400] flaccid: traces back to cookbooks/application/libraries/default.rb:72:in `method_missing'
[2013-06-30 04:54:27 -0400] flaccid: ah i see, it must not be option collected
[2013-06-30 04:54:46 -0400] flaccid: coderanger: i guess in unicorn sub-resource it doesn't collect all the options for use with unicorn cookbook
[2013-06-30 05:41:52 -0400] tabolario: Hey if anyone is around, just submitted my first pull request on an opscode cookbook! Just wondering if it's supposed to be to mark my issue as 'Fix Provided' (I don't seem to have the ability to do so)
[2013-06-30 05:45:23 -0400] coderanger: tabolario: Do you have a CLA on file?
[2013-06-30 05:45:57 -0400] tabolario: coderanger: Yep, I submitted it right before I made my ticket and pull request
[2013-06-30 05:46:03 -0400] stormerider: tabolario: in any case, kudos for kicking back to the community :)
[2013-06-30 05:46:08 -0400] coderanger: Ahh, will take until Monday still
[2013-06-30 05:46:18 -0400] tabolario: Ah ok :)
[2013-06-30 05:46:18 -0400] coderanger: CLA processing is old fashioned and manual
[2013-06-30 05:46:38 -0400] tabolario: Well it was nice to use echosign at least instead of print-sign-scan-email
[2013-06-30 05:46:39 -0400] coderanger: Lawyers still aren't up on the whole computer thing sometimes
[2013-06-30 05:46:52 -0400] stormerider: tabolario: i know, that was pretty awesome :)
[2013-06-30 05:47:16 -0400] tabolario: stormerider: Expect lots more from me now that I've broken the proverbial ice :)
[2013-06-30 05:48:16 -0400] stormerider: not to suggest im complaining (so not) but things will take a bit to get merged in. they do regular code reviews of pull requests (weekly? biweekly? not exactly sure) and it's mostly jtimberman doing the lioness' share of actually accepting them once they've passed CR.
[2013-06-30 05:48:23 -0400] tabolario: Also, if any of guys had looked at it/heard of it before, I'm going to be starting on the second edition of Deploying Rails from PragProg which is basically going to be a complete rewrite with Chef
[2013-06-30 05:48:44 -0400] tabolario: Ah yeah I watch those CR's live on youtube sometimes
[2013-06-30 05:48:59 -0400] stormerider: just to give you a heads up that things are a little on the slow side right now, jtimberman is one busy fella :)
[2013-06-30 05:49:19 -0400] tabolario: Seems like they usually go straight down the list so hopefully mine doesn't get buried off the newest page before the next one :)
[2013-06-30 05:50:13 -0400] stormerider: but yes, once you get the CLA approved, link the PR in the ticket and the ticket in the PR and mark it as fix provided (and assign it to yourself, i think? coderanger can you confirm that's what's supposed to be done?) and they'll get to it when they can
[2013-06-30 05:50:36 -0400] tabolario: I've actually done all of the above except mark it as Fix Provided
[2013-06-30 05:50:46 -0400] coderanger: Sounds about right
[2013-06-30 05:50:56 -0400] stormerider: (i always crosslink it in both places just to make sure it's easy on the mergers)
[2013-06-30 05:51:24 -0400] stormerider: nagios is currently my attack vector of choice :)
[2013-06-30 05:51:41 -0400] tabolario: Oh so I wanted to ask, I want to make another PR on the aws cookbook to allow an encrypted data bag to be used to get the AWS credentials; is there a standard way that's usually done in the opscode cookbooks?
[2013-06-30 05:51:43 -0400] stormerider: coderanger: are you busy, or can you weigh in on a ticket, btw?
[2013-06-30 05:52:15 -0400] coderanger: stormerider: I'm not generally involved in FOSS review
[2013-06-30 05:52:26 -0400] coderanger: except for a few python-related cookbooks
[2013-06-30 05:52:51 -0400] stormerider: this is more of a "im not sure what component needs to actually be fixed to address this symptom"
[2013-06-30 05:53:20 -0400] stormerider: im not sure if it's an ohai bug or a cookbook bug
[2013-06-30 06:05:38 -0400] joelteon: chef rocks
[2013-06-30 06:11:10 -0400] joelteon: so whenever I run any knife command, I get "uninitialized constant Chef::Provider::Package::Apt" and I have no idea why
[2013-06-30 06:11:23 -0400] joelteon: a google search for that string results in instances of other people asking why they get that error when they run knife
[2013-06-30 06:13:26 -0400] stormerider: time for me to crash, night all
[2013-06-30 06:15:21 -0400] coderanger: joelteon: stack trace
[2013-06-30 06:15:23 -0400] coderanger: ?
[2013-06-30 06:15:27 -0400] joelteon: one sec
[2013-06-30 06:16:38 -0400] joelteon: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/91e37c60c975f57a949c
[2013-06-30 06:18:02 -0400] coderanger: joelteon: chef-0.8.10
[2013-06-30 06:18:22 -0400] coderanger: That would break pretty much everything
[2013-06-30 06:18:35 -0400] joelteon: whoa
[2013-06-30 06:18:37 -0400] joelteon: why do I have that
[2013-06-30 06:18:38 -0400] coderanger: Also Chef in general is not compatible with Ruby 2.0
[2013-06-30 06:18:43 -0400] coderanger: 11.6 will be
[2013-06-30 06:18:43 -0400] joelteon: ok
[2013-06-30 06:18:50 -0400] coderanger: and you can test out the rc if you want :)
[2013-06-30 06:18:58 -0400] coderanger: But 11.4.4 is not
[2013-06-30 06:18:59 -0400] joelteon: no, but seriously, how did I get a chef that old
[2013-06-30 06:19:10 -0400] coderanger: Usually because bundler is awful
[2013-06-30 06:19:23 -0400] joelteon: haha
[2013-06-30 06:19:30 -0400] coderanger: You must have chef in a gemfile with something else that has restrictions, usually on the json gem
[2013-06-30 06:19:38 -0400] joelteon: or it might be work-related, we use a bunch of old shit in production and I only recently started using chef for personal projects
[2013-06-30 06:19:40 -0400] coderanger: Well, not must, but thats usually it
[2013-06-30 06:20:35 -0400] coderanger: I think it is time for dinner
[2013-06-30 06:20:42 -0400] coderanger: midnight curry is always the best curry
[2013-06-30 08:18:16 -0400] flaccid: how do i do http://community.opscode.com/questions/75 "Appending the necessary path to the PATH environment variable and passing this to the resource via the environment resource attributes" ?

[2013-06-30 09:45:00 -0400] xerxas: flaccid: is this what you wanted
[2013-06-30 11:19:47 -0400] epta: What will be the chef analog of `ln -sf /home/a/b/*.sh /home/bin/ ` ?
[2013-06-30 11:22:40 -0400] mlf4aiur: NameError
[2013-06-30 11:22:44 -0400] mlf4aiur: uninitialized constant Chef::Resource::UlimitDomain
[2013-06-30 11:22:49 -0400] mlf4aiur: How to fix this issue?
[2013-06-30 11:23:44 -0400] mlf4aiur: I'm using vagrant launch a precise64 instance
[2013-06-30 11:24:41 -0400] mlf4aiur:   7:  attribute :domain, :kind_of => [Chef::Resource::UlimitDomain, String], :required => true
[2013-06-30 11:31:17 -0400] flaccid: xerxas: yup thanks. doing it in compile phase is good idea too so i used an anti-pattern combined with similar technique from https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/client.rb
[2013-06-30 11:32:31 -0400] flaccid: epta: not sure if it can do force though, so if its not adequate use execute resource
[2013-06-30 11:33:47 -0400] epta: Well, it's not about force, it's about '*'
[2013-06-30 11:35:00 -0400] epta: Can I make many symlink via one `link` call?
[2013-06-30 13:37:07 -0400] countdig1: epta: although the ln command does take multiple targets, i think u are going to have to generate mutiple link resources in chef from reading the docs
[2013-06-30 13:39:28 -0400] countdig1: so something like ::Dir["/home/a/b/*.sh"].each do |f| link f do to "/home/bin/#{::File.basename(f)}"; end
[2013-06-30 13:39:43 -0400] countdig1: end

[2013-06-30 14:08:58 -0400] m00dy_: where is knife.rb file
[2013-06-30 14:09:07 -0400] m00dy_: i get my private key but knife.rb
[2013-06-30 14:10:01 -0400] solvip: have you run 'knife configure -i' ?
[2013-06-30 14:10:06 -0400] solvip: iirc it prompts you for a path
[2013-06-30 14:11:50 -0400] m00dy_: oh
[2013-06-30 14:11:57 -0400] m00dy_: ok i wil try now
[2013-06-30 14:13:34 -0400] m00dy_: dude i have problems on installing chef
[2013-06-30 14:13:51 -0400] m00dy_: curl -L https://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh |  bash
[2013-06-30 14:14:09 -0400] m00dy_: Please detail your operating system type, version and any other relevant details URL: https://www.opscode.com/chef/download?v=&prerelease=false&p=debian&pv=7.1&m=x86_64
[2013-06-30 14:14:13 -0400] m00dy_: but
[2013-06-30 14:14:15 -0400] m00dy_: url is empty
[2013-06-30 14:14:47 -0400] countdigi: m00dy_: u can just manually download the package @ http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/
[2013-06-30 14:15:32 -0400] m00dy_: yes
[2013-06-30 14:15:33 -0400] m00dy_: but
[2013-06-30 14:15:50 -0400] m00dy_: anyone knows debian wheezy 7.0 is supported ?
[2013-06-30 14:16:22 -0400] m00dy_: installer tab shows only version 6
[2013-06-30 14:17:45 -0400] countdigi: try installing it and see if ruby comes up w/: /opt/chef/embedded/ruby --version
[2013-06-30 14:17:54 -0400] countdigi: if ruby works, chances are u are good
[2013-06-30 14:18:18 -0400] countdigi: otherwise u will probably have to install it via gem (get 1.9.3 ruby on ur system and then gem install chef)
[2013-06-30 14:18:46 -0400] countdigi: /opt/chef/embedded/bin/ruby --version # ... that is
[2013-06-30 15:01:58 -0400] atrius: another day.. another way chef has, at least temporarily, complicated my life...
[2013-06-30 15:02:38 -0400] atrius: i'm trying to add HBA entries to postgres for the first time.. the docs insist that the attribute must be an array of hashes.. but i can't figure out how to get that to work in such a way that the json works
[2013-06-30 15:30:48 -0400] thrillERboy: Hi, I'm a n00b programmer, I have configured a few servers before manually, approximately how long would it may take for me to get the hang of chef.
[2013-06-30 15:31:02 -0400] thrillERboy: too vague I know :|
[2013-06-30 15:32:04 -0400] maruq: thrillERboy: it really depends on your definition of "the hang of chef".
[2013-06-30 15:32:40 -0400] thrillERboy: marug lets say, I want to bootstrap a single machine to run rails, is what I mean by that
[2013-06-30 15:32:43 -0400] maruq: it's probably not too hard to get your head around cookbooks and how you can add then to a run_list
[2013-06-30 15:32:51 -0400] maruq: either directly, or via a role
[2013-06-30 15:33:27 -0400] maruq: once you know that, then really it's just running that run list via chef-client or chef-solo
[2013-06-30 15:34:05 -0400] thrillERboy: maruq, thanks
[2013-06-30 15:34:25 -0400] thrillERboy: so role here is giving context to the machine, like webserver, db-server etc. right?
[2013-06-30 15:34:44 -0400] maruq: thrillERboy: yep, it's basically a way of grouping cookbooks
[2013-06-30 15:34:52 -0400] maruq: or rather recipes
[2013-06-30 15:34:54 -0400] thrillERboy: If I go for a single machine for the starters, I don't need any roles am I right?
[2013-06-30 15:35:28 -0400] maruq: eg. for role ruby-server, run recipes ruby, unicorn, nginx
[2013-06-30 15:36:04 -0400] maruq: thrillERboy: you don't *need* roles, it's more for organising
[2013-06-30 15:36:06 -0400] thrillERboy: maruq, so here ruby-server becomes a cookbook because it had three recipies?
[2013-06-30 15:36:47 -0400] maruq: thrillERboy: nope, in that example, ruby-server would have been the role, ruby, unicorn & nginx would each have been cookbooks
[2013-06-30 15:36:53 -0400] maruq: I'll grab some links.
[2013-06-30 15:37:03 -0400] atrius: sigh...
[2013-06-30 15:37:15 -0400] thrillERboy: maruq, Thanks a ton, thats a lot of useful info :)
[2013-06-30 15:37:19 -0400] atrius: attribute must be an array of hashes... but i can't get it to be an array of hashes :(
[2013-06-30 15:37:19 -0400] maruq: http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_cookbooks.html
[2013-06-30 15:37:34 -0400] maruq: http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_nodes.html
[2013-06-30 15:38:17 -0400] maruq: the first is the insides of a cookbook. the second describes how the node comes together
[2013-06-30 15:38:47 -0400] thrillERboy: maruq, thanks a ton :)
[2013-06-30 15:38:53 -0400] maruq: no worries
[2013-06-30 15:39:19 -0400] maruq: also, I would maybe start with something like vagrant, just to get the hang of things, rather than hose a production server ;)
[2013-06-30 15:39:42 -0400] maruq: well, ec2, anything really would work
[2013-06-30 15:39:57 -0400] maruq: just don't want you to play in production ;)
[2013-06-30 15:56:38 -0400] thrillERboy: sure thanks, start with vagrant then :)
[2013-06-30 15:57:05 -0400] thrillERboy: I'm not using ec2, i'm using digitalocean. They support chef too :)
[2013-06-30 16:06:54 -0400] maruq: thrillERboy: that's cool. it was more about not breaking your existing system ;)
[2013-06-30 16:07:31 -0400] thrillERboy: maruq, I don't have anything serious online yet :D not on VPS
[2013-06-30 16:09:30 -0400] maruq: thrillERboy: depending on what you're trying to do, there may be cookbooks already at community.opscode.com
[2013-06-30 16:10:35 -0400] thrillERboy: maruq, currently I want a simple setup for hosting rails apps thats all, with some loadbalancing, ability to add and remove app servers and web servers, and a solid way to manage db server
[2013-06-30 16:11:46 -0400] thrillERboy: Only if all these were automatic :$
[2013-06-30 16:13:01 -0400] maruq: thrillERboy: there will definitely be some cookbooks to handle those things. I guess most will be driven by attributes / searching for roles
[2013-06-30 16:14:12 -0400] thrillERboy: maruq, thanks, lemme just experiment stuff with vagrant and some cheap digital ocean nodes, before going for the kill
[2013-06-30 16:14:32 -0400] thrillERboy: maruq, Can't thank u enough :) Its been great great great help :)
[2013-06-30 16:15:13 -0400] maruq: thrillERboy: no worries.
[2013-06-30 16:15:51 -0400] maruq: I imagine everything you need should be there, just might take a little time to get your head around some things
[2013-06-30 16:16:29 -0400] maruq: but I usually find #chef is happy to help solve problems ;)
[2013-06-30 16:20:55 -0400] xerxas: Hi all, I want to write a resource/provider for the php fastcgi process manager (php fpm), the configuration file format is ini. I'm wondering if I should use the gem inifile and inject configuration from attributes rendering an inifile, rather that doing a template which will force me to set a plethora of attributes 
[2013-06-30 16:22:45 -0400] xerxas: is this a good idea ? in general, should I load a parseable fileformat, inject parameter from a attribute whose value is a single big hash with all the configuration and then dump this file ? (checking if the file is changed and setting or not updated_by_last_action , or notifying the concerned service)
[2013-06-30 16:23:32 -0400] xerxas: s/dump this file/dump this hash to a file/
[2013-06-30 16:24:14 -0400] xerxas: this techniques allow me to set everything in configuration files rather than only what's rendered configurable through the template
[2013-06-30 17:27:04 -0400] coderanger: xerxas: You can do that with a template too
[2013-06-30 17:27:38 -0400] coderanger: <% options.each do |key, value| %>\n<%= key %> = <%= value %>\n<% end %>
[2013-06-30 18:04:20 -0400] stormerider: im looking at monitoring a windows system via nagios... what do people use for that these days? nsclient++, nsca, etc?
[2013-06-30 18:04:55 -0400] xerxas: coderanger: ini has sections and directives goes in sections
[2013-06-30 18:05:09 -0400] coderanger: xerxas: Yes, that was just a basic example
[2013-06-30 18:05:25 -0400] coderanger: xerxas: Because ini has basically no escaping rules, its an easy format to generate :)
[2013-06-30 18:05:38 -0400] coderanger: xerxas: But you can also use a gem and a file resource (via its #content attribute)
[2013-06-30 18:05:53 -0400] coderanger: Just render the ini data to a string and give that as the file's content
[2013-06-30 18:06:02 -0400] coderanger: thats how I generally do json and yaml output
[2013-06-30 18:07:52 -0400] xerxas: coderanger: yes this is the approach I want to do because I find it more flexible
[2013-06-30 18:08:01 -0400] xerxas: is this a good idea ? any drawbacks ?
[2013-06-30 18:08:21 -0400] xerxas: I was also thinking about yaml and json besides ini 
[2013-06-30 18:08:45 -0400] xerxas: I see a lot of cookbooks with templates with either, not enough variables, or too much ;)
[2013-06-30 18:09:01 -0400] coderanger: Either way works
[2013-06-30 18:10:11 -0400] coderanger: chef_gem 'inifile'; require 'inifile'; file '/foo.ini' do content IniFile.new(node['something
[2013-06-30 18:10:21 -0400] coderanger: Ack, premature enter :)
[2013-06-30 18:10:25 -0400] coderanger: but you get the idea
[2013-06-30 18:10:34 -0400] gkarekinian: The riak cookbook uses a library to turn attributes into erlang: https://github.com/basho/riak-chef-cookbook
[2013-06-30 18:10:45 -0400] coderanger: #to_s on an inifile object should return the serialized file data
[2013-06-30 18:11:06 -0400] gkarekinian: I like it better than having to write erlang in templates by hand :)
[2013-06-30 18:11:14 -0400] xerxas: coderanger: yes this is a sth I already do
[2013-06-30 18:11:18 -0400] xerxas: hi gkarekinian
[2013-06-30 18:11:21 -0400] gkarekinian: Hey :)
[2013-06-30 18:11:58 -0400] xerxas: coderanger: so I'm not doing crazy things ;)
[2013-06-30 18:12:13 -0400] coderanger: Nope, I've just not had to touch something that used an ini file in a while
[2013-06-30 18:12:32 -0400] coderanger: JSON is one true config format
[2013-06-30 18:12:42 -0400] xerxas: I'm touching some php stuff which are plenty of ini file
[2013-06-30 18:12:43 -0400] xerxas: agreed
[2013-06-30 18:13:32 -0400] dpt89: hi
[2013-06-30 18:14:47 -0400] dpt89: any ideas about how to protect data bag json files before committing them to git? I haven't found how to make knife store the encrypted version in the jsons
[2013-06-30 18:17:33 -0400] gchristensen: dpt89: the encrypted data baghs are stored on the FS encrypted...
[2013-06-30 18:20:47 -0400] chip-: coderanger: Real config file formats take comments.
[2013-06-30 18:21:29 -0400] coderanger: chip-: Negatory, comments belong in your chef recipe
[2013-06-30 18:21:44 -0400] coderanger: Config files are just a cache between your CMDB and application :)
[2013-06-30 18:21:57 -0400] coderanger: Push the semantic data down the stack where it belongs
[2013-06-30 18:24:17 -0400] coderanger: dpt89: I don't think you mean to be using encrypted data bags
[2013-06-30 18:24:37 -0400] coderanger: dpt89: The purpose of bags is to avoid trusting the chef server, not to avoid trusting your VCS
[2013-06-30 20:36:29 -0400] kim__: hi, i'm setting a chef server, i installed it and everything works, then I changed some data in the /etc/chef-server/chef-server like the email and nginx ssl cert info, launched the chef's reconfigure, but the data aren't changed... do you know why? :\
[2013-06-30 21:54:22 -0400] joelteon: how would i specify a custom .rpm repo for yum
[2013-06-30 22:21:12 -0400] llakey: joelteon: maybe https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/yum
[2013-06-30 23:42:47 -0400] countdigi: kim: /etc/chef-server/chef-server or /etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb ?
