[2013-02-03 01:37:25 -0500] ssd7: Ohai Chefs
[2013-02-03 03:25:13 -0500] aslaen: hey everyone.. I'm new to Chef.. I've read through most of docs.opscode.com but I'm not sure the best way to check if a package exists? Is there somewhere that talks about this?
[2013-02-03 03:26:05 -0500] aslaen: for example, on a RHEL server I need to install mysql55-server, but if mysql-libs is installed it conflicts with mysql55-libs. How can I check if mysql-libs is installed ina recipe?
[2013-02-03 14:57:41 -0500] null_route: Hi Guys! Is jonlives around, or is anyone familiar with spork?
[2013-02-03 14:58:12 -0500] null_route: I've got it running, and I'm working on figuring out the proper workflow for my team
[2013-02-03 14:58:43 -0500] null_route: ...specifically on how GIT fits into the workflow
[2013-02-03 15:54:01 -0500] null_route: hey all! does anyone here use Spork?
[2013-02-03 15:54:13 -0500] null_route: what's the proper workflow for using it?
[2013-02-03 15:54:26 -0500] null_route: the documentation describes the functions, but not real-world use
[2013-02-03 16:30:58 -0500] zts: null_route: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSnJCJiZDDU <- that presentation talks about spork, and some of the other tools Etsy use in their Chef workflow
[2013-02-03 16:31:19 -0500] zts: null_route: it's not really a "Here's what you should do" kind of thing, but might give you some ideas
[2013-02-03 17:04:30 -0500] ttgb: Any pointers on how I can create an LWRP that just extends cookbook_file but sets the path to fixed attribute?
[2013-02-03 17:06:55 -0500] jberanek: ttgb: what do you mean by "sets the path to fixed attribut"?
[2013-02-03 17:10:08 -0500] ttgb: jberanek: As in, no matter what you specify as the name it uses node[:foo] as the path of the file
[2013-02-03 17:12:59 -0500] jberanek: It's not pretty, but you can redefine all of the properties of a cookbook_file as the resource, and then your lwrp provider can just fill in the appropriate values into a cookbook resource
[2013-02-03 17:13:31 -0500] zts: ttgb: you probably want to be looking at Definitions instead of LWRPs - http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_definitions.html
[2013-02-03 17:13:55 -0500] ttgb: jberanek: Yeah that's what I was thinking, but did seem a bit ugly
[2013-02-03 17:15:16 -0500] ttgb: zts: Excellent, that seems like the solution, thanks!
[2013-02-03 17:16:29 -0500] jberanek: zts beat me to it
[2013-02-03 17:17:33 -0500] zts: ttgb: one thing to be aware of is that 'definition' is kind of like a macro - at the end of the run, the node will report that it had a cookbook_file resource, not something with the name of your definition
[2013-02-03 17:18:12 -0500] zts: ttgb: that probably doesn't matter if you're only worried about setting some defaults though, but it's something to be aware of
[2013-02-03 17:18:47 -0500] ttgb: zts: I think that will be OK, te main reason I want it is for consistency
[2013-02-03 17:18:54 -0500] zts: cool
[2013-02-03 17:33:32 -0500] gmcinnes: hi chefs
[2013-02-03 17:41:15 -0500] gmcinnes: I need some help around usage patterns for environments.  I have a requirement where in production my db and app servers are on different nodes, and in qa, they are on one node. Currently I'm achieving this by having a different role for the dev node with the app & db recipies in there.
[2013-02-03 17:42:57 -0500] gmcinnes: But it seems cleaner to have what recipies are run varied by environment.  Not least because then I could use search() to fill in some details about the IP's of app servers that the db needs to know, instead of "hard coding" it in data bags.
[2013-02-03 17:50:20 -0500] gmcinnes: n/m. I am idiot. per environment run lists
[2013-02-03 17:59:26 -0500] zts: gmcinnes: I'd have a role for db server, a role for app server, and have both on the QA host's run list
[2013-02-03 18:04:52 -0500] zts: gmcinnes: also, note that you can also search for recipe's on a node's expanded run_list.  eg, knife search node "chef_environment:prod AND recipes:sensu\:\:client"
[2013-02-03 18:06:02 -0500] gmcinnes: zts: yes, that's exactly what I wanted, but was struggling how to do it :)
[2013-02-03 18:14:49 -0500] gmcinnes: ok, one more thing I'm having difficulty with. I set default master passwords for the db etc. in the qa environment.  In production I pull them from an encrypted data bag.  Is there any clean way to merge these things together so that I don't have to case around the chef.node_environment to decide where to pull it from in the recipe?
[2013-02-03 18:19:50 -0500] SirFunk: anyone use the rbenv recipe? It is giving an error about not being able to write to /opt/rbenv
[2013-02-03 18:56:29 -0500] zts: gmcinnes: I'd do something like that, but instead of casing around chef_environment, I'd try to load a data bag then fall back to attributes if it wasn't found
[2013-02-03 18:57:07 -0500] zts: gmcinnes: I vaguely recall seeing that someone had written a library (or something) to wrap that pattern, but I haven't used it
[2013-02-03 18:57:15 -0500] zts: nothing built-in to Chef though
[2013-02-03 18:57:24 -0500] gmcinnes: shame.
[2013-02-03 18:57:27 -0500] gmcinnes: very common pattern.
[2013-02-03 18:57:29 -0500] gmcinnes: I'd think.
[2013-02-03 18:58:26 -0500] zts: I haven't personally wanted for it, to be honest - in your example, I'd use an encrypted data bag for the QA environment too
[2013-02-03 18:59:33 -0500] gmcinnes: I suppose that could simplify it a bit. Complifies other things though :)
[2013-02-03 19:02:56 -0500] zts: yeah, it's a trade-off :)  My philosophy, particularly with things like credential management, is to keep things consistent through the pipeline from dev to production
[2013-02-03 19:03:25 -0500] zts: that can provide a gentle nudge to put work into making the process light-weight, and it helps people get comfortable with the process
[2013-02-03 19:03:45 -0500] zts: there's definitely a greater up-front cost, though
[2013-02-03 19:04:02 -0500] zts: afk for a bit, dinner
[2013-02-03 19:04:44 -0500] khimera: any help here? i am running a recipe that loops on an array that uses git resource. Is it possible to tell the resource to wait until checkout is complete?
[2013-02-03 19:05:42 -0500] khimera: some git repos depend on each other so i am getting an error that one of the directories does not exist so it exits out
[2013-02-03 19:36:14 -0500] SirFunk: I have a problem using the nginx recipe. It can't (find) install the correct version. This is because it doesn't run apt-get update first... should it do that on it's own?
[2013-02-03 19:36:59 -0500] zenloop: Hey question on handlers.  I am using the chef_handler cookbook.  The handler code is simply ruby code.  Correct?  I want to execute a shell script from the handler.  I can simply run backticks (like in a ruby script)??
[2013-02-03 19:38:16 -0500] khimera: SirFunk: you can run apt-get update. But that will probably not work, since your depending on the os package manager
[2013-02-03 19:40:04 -0500] khimera: SirFunk: You can probably use the install_method => "compile", version => "xxx"
[2013-02-03 19:40:32 -0500] khimera: if you want to use package installer you might want to tap into another repo
[2013-02-03 19:40:41 -0500] SirFunk: khimera: oh. I figured it out i just need to use the "apt" recipe ... I know i'll be deploying to ubuntu so i would rather use packages
[2013-02-03 19:41:12 -0500] khimera: SirFunk: Yes, but if the ubuntu version does not come with the version you want, it will not install it probably.
[2013-02-03 19:41:24 -0500] khimera: it will only install the version it knows.
[2013-02-03 19:41:54 -0500] SirFunk: yeah, I don't think i have any specific version that I care about. I'll take whetever the receipe gives my ubuntu version will be pretty stable i think
[2013-02-03 19:42:07 -0500] khimera: yea, cool.
[2013-02-03 19:42:31 -0500] SirFunk: now lets see if rbenv works
[2013-02-03 19:42:57 -0500] khimera: SirFunk: I normally have a base role setup that installs all the basics like apt.vim,ziplist goes on
[2013-02-03 19:43:49 -0500] SirFunk: using apt and not recipes? (I guess i don't necessarily need to use the recipes)
[2013-02-03 19:44:12 -0500] SirFunk: (I'm pretty new to chef so excuse my ignorance if i'm doing something wrong :p )
[2013-02-03 19:44:26 -0500] khimera: no no, using apt recipe.
[2013-02-03 19:44:52 -0500] SirFunk: khimera: yeah i suppose there is little reason to use the nginx recipe if i'm not installing from source, right?
[2013-02-03 19:45:07 -0500] khimera: I am just saying I use a role that I name "basics" which will installs the basic recipes like apt
[2013-02-03 19:45:46 -0500] khimera: you can use the nginx recipe to install from source also. just change install_method to compile. But that will be slower of course.
[2013-02-03 19:47:17 -0500] SirFunk: khimera: ahh, ok, i think i'm following you now
[2013-02-03 19:47:45 -0500] SirFunk: I'm not using any roles quiet yet. Figuring out how to get my app deployed to vagrant first
[2013-02-03 19:47:59 -0500] SirFunk: then i'll probably make a role for vagrant and a role for real servers
[2013-02-03 20:13:06 -0500] gfunky: If i'm just planning to use chef-solo to configure one multi-function server, where should I place all my customizations? Should i make a new cookbook that includes recipes? Is there a better, more chef-fu, way?
[2013-02-03 20:19:24 -0500] khimera: gfunky:  customizations related to recipe attributes?  Roles.
[2013-02-03 20:25:58 -0500] gfunky: khimera: Thanks. I'll look more into those. I was thinking roles were more related to groups of servers.
[2013-02-03 20:41:53 -0500] SirFunk: hmm. how to i add a user to multiple groups?
[2013-02-03 20:45:31 -0500] khimera: SirFunk: you can use the user reference
[2013-02-03 20:50:20 -0500] SirFunk: khimera: i don't see any way to add a user to other groups, just create the primary group
[2013-02-03 20:52:21 -0500] khimera: SirFunk: oh i see, you can use the bash resource instead and just type the command out
[2013-02-03 20:54:36 -0500] zts: SirFunk: you can use the group resource to add a user to other groups - http://docs.opscode.com/resource_group.html
[2013-02-03 21:34:50 -0500] dotslas: knife cookbook upload cron
[2013-02-03 21:35:12 -0500] dotslas: It is saying it can't connect to https://ip-10-190-103-17.ec2.internal. That isn't the server that is set in knife.rb.
[2013-02-03 21:47:04 -0500] spheromak: you have a .chef/knife.rb in you pwd
[2013-02-03 21:47:05 -0500] spheromak: ?
[2013-02-03 21:47:39 -0500] dotslas: Yes.
[2013-02-03 21:48:00 -0500] spheromak: and thats pointing to the right server url ?
[2013-02-03 21:48:10 -0500] dotslas: It looks like nginx on the chef server is redirecting them to that url.
[2013-02-03 21:48:20 -0500] spheromak: ah
[2013-02-03 21:48:34 -0500] dotslas: I'm trying to fix that now to see it it helps.
[2013-02-03 21:50:21 -0500] dotslas: That didn't seem to help. But somehow the chef server seems to be redirecting the client to a non-public ip address when I try to upload. knife client list, etc works fine.
[2013-02-03 21:50:30 -0500] dotslas: Any ideas where else that could be coming from?
[2013-02-03 21:55:25 -0500] spheromak: seems like the proxy would be a good guess.
[2013-02-03 21:56:34 -0500] dotslas: I'm not working through a proxy though. Or do you mean the nginx proxy that handles sending everything where it needs to go?
[2013-02-03 22:01:29 -0500] dotslas: Anyone have any idea why Chef Server 11 would be redirecting knife cookbook upload operations to an internal ip address?
[2013-02-03 22:01:46 -0500] mswart: sends nginx the orginal host information to chef? primary host-header? is https://ip-10-190-103-17.ec2.internal the name to what nginx sends the requests
[2013-02-03 22:02:47 -0500] dotslas: No. nginx is just using localhost behind the scenes.
[2013-02-03 22:03:14 -0500] dotslas: hm. What is this: ./var/opt/chef-server/erchef/etc/app.config:                  {s3_url, "https://ip-10-190-103-17.ec2.internal"}
[2013-02-03 22:04:24 -0500] dotslas: The url it is trying to send it to has a bunch of AWSAccessKey type stuff in it. It almost seems like it is trying to redirect things to an S3 bucket...which doesn't make any sense to me.
[2013-02-03 22:05:29 -0500] mswart: prints knife with debug (-VV) something usefull?
[2013-02-03 22:06:53 -0500] dotslas: Uploading /root/infrastructure/cookbooks/cron/resources/d.rb (checksum hex = e7bbd4e88475d5ff222efad6445a33c2) to https://ip-10-190-103-17.ec2.internal:443/bookshelf/organization-00000000000000000000000000000000/checksum-e7bbd4e88475d5ff222efad6445a33c2?AWSAccessKeyId=384793923948fb637b2764fd1bdba36aaf0000d5f56&Expires=1359929060&Signature=KDLfkdjfkdslssdkfjdh/oc%3D
[2013-02-03 22:07:20 -0500] mswart: did you have a ~/.chef/knife.rb?
[2013-02-03 22:08:31 -0500] dotslas: Yes. It points to the correct server name. And things like: knife client list, work fine
[2013-02-03 22:09:56 -0500] dotslas: I'm not clear why erchef would even have an S3 setting filled out.
[2013-02-03 22:11:17 -0500] mswart: mmh, sorry, no more idea, too.
[2013-02-03 22:11:46 -0500] dotslas: Ok. Thanks for your help.
[2013-02-03 22:13:58 -0500] zts: dotslas: given that it's new, beta software, I could imagine it's a bug - I'd suggest creating a ticket to report it
[2013-02-03 22:16:24 -0500] dotslas: Ok. You know I think I did this the other day and it worked ok. I'll have to do it again with the old version and see if it has the same problem.
[2013-02-03 22:17:01 -0500] dotslas: Although if it is a bug, it still seems like a configuration issue that I should be able to fix if I just knew where it was controlled from.
[2013-02-03 23:18:28 -0500] SirFunk: so i'm trying to learn chef and use it to deploy a Ruby app (to vagrant for now). I'm wondering if there is a clever way to handle build deps for ruby gems, I have some that depend on xml libs
