[2013-02-17 01:02:48 -0500] sascha_d: halp attributes
[2013-02-17 01:03:11 -0500] sascha_d: I've read the attributes blog post and I'm looking at modifying the dhcp cookbook so it works
[2013-02-17 01:03:53 -0500] sascha_d: if an attribute is already defined somewhere, say, in an attributes file, I shouldn't have to do the precedence dance, should I?
[2013-02-17 01:04:32 -0500] sascha_d: my issue is this line in the dhcp cookbook: allows = node['dhcp']['allows'] || []
[2013-02-17 01:27:28 -0500] sascha_d: if I set it to just allows = [], all is well; if someone can help me understand why chef hates this, I'll fix it right and submit a pull request instead of what I did (hacking it so worked on my testbed)
[2013-02-17 02:57:20 -0500] sebastian: Hi there
[2013-02-17 02:57:57 -0500] sebastian: knife is throwing SSL errors like: ERROR: OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv2/v3 read server hello A: sslv3 alert handshake failure
[2013-02-17 02:58:05 -0500] sebastian: i'd appreciate any suggestions
[2013-02-17 03:38:42 -0500] gondoi: sebastian: what plugin you using if any?
[2013-02-17 03:38:47 -0500] gondoi: sounds like an invalid cert
[2013-02-17 04:29:51 -0500] spencerowen: Hey All, Does anyone know where to get the Private user key in hosted chef? I don't have it and I don't know how to regenerate it.
[2013-02-17 04:31:22 -0500] spencerowen: You know what, never mind, I think I found a backup
[2013-02-17 05:35:49 -0500] rocket: q
[2013-02-17 05:36:56 -0500] yfeldblum: spencerowen, chef-server (or hosted-chef or private-chef) doesn't keep a copy of the private key; if you lose your current private key, you simply make a new one

[2013-02-17 09:20:03 -0500] aruntomar: Guest46133: hi
[2013-02-17 09:21:20 -0500] aruntomar: Guest46133: is ur workstation configured correctly?
[2013-02-17 09:25:38 -0500] coolj: Guest46133: ^ does knife user/client/node list work?
[2013-02-17 13:15:36 -0500] deed02392: Hi I'm writing a PHP config file template, when it comes to building an array from chef ruby attributes, what is recommended in terms of storing values requiring key/index in Ruby?
[2013-02-17 13:15:58 -0500] deed02392: for example I need a PHP array like: array('foo' => 'bar', 'baz' =>' boo');
[2013-02-17 13:16:11 -0500] deed02392: how should I store that in Ruby?
[2013-02-17 13:16:32 -0500] deed02392: (and output it in the template)
[2013-02-17 14:01:04 -0500] slam-: hey, all my chef-clients are version 10 (0.10.2 being the older), my server is 10.14.4, is there a preferred order to upgrade : clients first or server first ? (i don't want to go version 11 yet)
[2013-02-17 14:30:25 -0500] Guest46133: my workstation seems to be set up correctly because i was able to execute the knife commands like "knife client list" correctly
[2013-02-17 14:31:39 -0500] Glacee: What is the best way to change the path of data in chef server 11 centos?
[2013-02-17 14:41:20 -0500] gyre007: is there any way how I can delete organization in hosted Chef via WebUI management console ?
[2013-02-17 15:26:26 -0500] Guest46133: i updated the chef_server_url in knife.rb everywhere (in chef-server and chef-client) with https://fqdn-chef-server instead of http://fqdn-chef-server and it seems to solve the problem
[2013-02-17 15:54:25 -0500] yruss972: Hi- I'm having trouble overriding node attributes. When I try to change a specific subelement, I end up overwriting the whole structure (changing all the arrays to hashes)
[2013-02-17 15:54:39 -0500] yruss972: any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
[2013-02-17 17:15:35 -0500] blackice2999: hi @all - on first i am new in this channel if i violate any rules please talk it to me. My Problem. I want to try the chef-server and used the vagrant berkshelf variant  git://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-server.git - i can log into the webui all seems to be fine.. but if i try to setup an workstation with knife i run into the message: Connection refused 1/5...
[2013-02-17 17:15:41 -0500] blackice2999: is there something that i had overread ?
[2013-02-17 17:26:40 -0500] jmartin: blackice2999: perhaps a firewall issue? or maybe a misconfiguration, whats your knife.rb look like?
[2013-02-17 17:27:41 -0500] blackice2999: jmartin: on the same machine i can connect to the webui is there something that i need explicit enable on vagrant side ?
[2013-02-17 17:27:51 -0500] Glace: How do I change the data path for services like postgresql, rabbitmq on chef server 11 centos?
[2013-02-17 17:28:31 -0500] Glace: I cant find the configuration file beside /etc/chef-server/chef-serverrunning.json which seems to do nothing if I change the config there
[2013-02-17 17:29:46 -0500] blackice2999: jmartin: or is port 4000 on chef 11 outdated ?
[2013-02-17 17:32:37 -0500] jmartin: blackice2999: try removing port 4000, i think that will get you going
[2013-02-17 17:32:38 -0500] blackice2999: jmartin: this was the answer... :D - no port anymore needed
[2013-02-17 17:32:41 -0500] jmartin: right
[2013-02-17 17:33:22 -0500] blackice2999: jmartin: this should be documented. any way to contribute anything here ?
[2013-02-17 17:34:59 -0500] blackice2999: jmartin: thanks a lot for your help.
[2013-02-17 17:35:12 -0500] yfeldblum: Glace, you modify `/etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb` and then you run `chef-server-ctl reconfigure`
[2013-02-17 17:35:34 -0500] yfeldblum: Glace, if that file doesn't exist, you can create it
[2013-02-17 17:35:58 -0500] Glace: yes it does not exist, thanks
[2013-02-17 17:36:07 -0500] yfeldblum: Glace, you can find all the tunables here: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef/blob/master/files/chef-server-cookbooks/chef-server/attributes/default.rb
[2013-02-17 17:36:31 -0500] Glace: thank you.. was currently looking for it
[2013-02-17 17:36:43 -0500] yfeldblum: Glace, you use the normal Mixlib::Config configuration-file syntax, using this context: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef/blob/master/files/chef-server-cookbooks/chef-server/libraries/chef_server.rb
[2013-02-17 17:36:45 -0500] Glace: You made my day, thanks :0
[2013-02-17 17:36:56 -0500] jmartin: http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2013-02/msg00133.html <-- anyone know if this was corrected or if there is a ticket on it, or if perhaps there is a more complete workaround at this time?
[2013-02-17 17:37:28 -0500] yfeldblum: Glace, for example, if you wanted to change the bookshelf-vip to be the node's ipaddress, you'd write this line in /etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb: `bookshelf["vip"] = node["ipaddress"]`
[2013-02-17 17:37:44 -0500] jmartin: my searches for a ticket or further responses
[2013-02-17 17:37:47 -0500] jmartin: are failing it seems
[2013-02-17 17:38:29 -0500] yfeldblum: blackice2999, if you're using the omnibus-built package, everything listens on 443
[2013-02-17 17:38:47 -0500] yfeldblum: blackice2999, if you're using the omnibus-built package, chef-server-api and chef-server-webui both listen on 443 (other things listen on other ports)
[2013-02-17 17:39:04 -0500] Glace: perfect yfeldblum
[2013-02-17 17:39:05 -0500] Glace: amazon
[2013-02-17 17:39:08 -0500] Glace: amazing :0
[2013-02-17 17:39:18 -0500] yfeldblum: Glace, mhmm
[2013-02-17 17:39:30 -0500] yfeldblum: Glace, bug jtimberman to document it ...
[2013-02-17 17:39:39 -0500] Glace: I will try and let you know :)
[2013-02-17 17:39:45 -0500] blackice2999: yfeldblum: thanks. Is there anywere a documentation about this changes ? Or is there more that i need to know in difference to chef 10 ?
[2013-02-17 17:39:51 -0500] Glace: Hehe ok , I will.. yes I wasnt able to find any documenation :0
[2013-02-17 17:40:55 -0500] yfeldblum: blackice2999, this isn't quite documented as far as i'm aware; however, the omnibus-built chef-server package sets everything up for you in obviously a very complex (yet somewhat tunable) way and, very often, you'll have to read the source
[2013-02-17 17:41:47 -0500] blackice2999: yfeldblum: good to known. Thanks!
[2013-02-17 17:42:17 -0500] yfeldblum: blackice2999, the package sets up nginx IIRC with some rules to listen on 443 and forward some requests to the api (probably listening on a backend port) and some requests to the webui (probably listening on another backend port) but you don't need to open up the backend ports, just 443
[2013-02-17 17:46:42 -0500] blackice2999: yfeldblum: ah i see it in /var/opt/chef-server/nginx/etc/nginx.conf
[2013-02-17 17:47:57 -0500] jmartin: ah, found my failure
[2013-02-17 18:26:06 -0500] Guest46133: for chef 11, here's a couple of blogs which you can refer to - http://www.linuxguy.in/how-to-install-and-configure-open-source-chef-server-11/ and jtimberman's own blog http://jtimberman.housepub.org/
[2013-02-17 18:26:47 -0500] Guest46133: this has the mention about the port 4000 not being used from v11 any more
[2013-02-17 18:54:41 -0500] blackice2999: Guest46133: thanks i read the blog from jtimberman but overread the port ;)
[2013-02-17 18:55:57 -0500] blackice2999: Knows anyone a good blog entry about wrapper cookbooks ? and best practice method on thi s?
[2013-02-17 19:08:49 -0500] yfeldblum: is it the case that, if multiple actions are declared for a resource, then each of those actions will be done with a separate provider instance created just for running that one action?
[2013-02-17 19:18:34 -0500] josephholsten: what's the sane way to upload stable cookbooks to the community site? I hate this tarball-through-a-web-form thing.
[2013-02-17 19:22:54 -0500] josephholsten: i get the feeling that `knife cookbook site share` is supposed to be better than this web form, but it doesn't like me
[2013-02-17 19:23:39 -0500] josephholsten: does everyone just upload a tarball by hand?
[2013-02-17 19:39:34 -0500] jtimberman: josephholsten: i use knife cookbook site share.
[2013-02-17 19:39:55 -0500] jtimberman: via mike fiedler's knife-community release plugin that wraps it with some extra sauce.
[2013-02-17 19:40:30 -0500] josephholsten: am I missing a config file? it just keeps saying  Server response: {"error_code": "AUTHENTICATION_FAILED"}
[2013-02-17 19:40:52 -0500] josephholsten: I reset my private key, no dice
[2013-02-17 19:42:40 -0500] jtimberman: you're using your opscode account's username/key right? :)
[2013-02-17 19:45:42 -0500] jtimberman: gotta run
[2013-02-17 19:49:18 -0500] josephholsten: yep
[2013-02-17 19:49:39 -0500] josephholsten: oh well, I'll figure it out some other day
[2013-02-17 20:02:35 -0500] kavi_: can i get sample recipe to move a file from one plath to anothert
[2013-02-17 20:04:07 -0500] matti: plath?
[2013-02-17 20:05:37 -0500] matti: kavi_: You could use execute or Ruby block.
[2013-02-17 20:19:43 -0500] kavi_: Hi matti, is any other alternate is there??
[2013-02-17 20:21:59 -0500] yfeldblum: kavi_, why?
[2013-02-17 20:22:47 -0500] kavi_: to get a sample recipe for moving a file from one place to another
[2013-02-17 20:23:22 -0500] yfeldblum: kavi_, no, why do you want an alternative to "uxecute or Ruby block"?
[2013-02-17 20:24:05 -0500] kavi_: i'm sorry, i'm beginner of chef i wanna learn more can you please adivse
[2013-02-17 20:24:13 -0500] matti: kavi_: Sure.
[2013-02-17 20:24:25 -0500] matti: kavi_: Write a define called move_remote_file :)
[2013-02-17 20:24:34 -0500] matti: kavi_: And put ruby_block there ;p
[2013-02-17 20:24:56 -0500] kavi_: noted, thanks. leet me try.
[2013-02-17 20:24:59 -0500] matti: Hehe
[2013-02-17 20:25:06 -0500] matti: You don't have to.
[2013-02-17 20:25:12 -0500] matti: Unless you plan to re-use it.
[2013-02-17 20:25:17 -0500] matti: Often.
[2013-02-17 22:01:41 -0500] deed02392: any advice on how to go about deploying a PHP web app?
[2013-02-17 22:01:56 -0500] deed02392: basically just automating the pulling of code from git and running a template for a config.php file?
[2013-02-17 22:07:35 -0500] kaerast: deed02392, this was discussed on a recent Foodfight podcast episode
[2013-02-17 22:08:02 -0500] kaerast: one of the ideas I really liked was using the git provider to deploy and a local template for the config
[2013-02-17 22:08:48 -0500] kaerast: using the local attribute of the template provider and a template in the git repo is a really nice pattern here
[2013-02-17 22:09:38 -0500] kaerast: there's a whole bunch of tools designed for deploying code, but if all you want is the basics then start with the minimal viable setup and grow from there
[2013-02-17 22:10:16 -0500] kaerast: http://foodfightshow.org/2013/01/application-deployment.html was the specific podcast episode
[2013-02-17 22:11:07 -0500] deed02392: that's what I was thinking of doing kaerast
[2013-02-17 22:11:20 -0500] deed02392: a podcast?!
[2013-02-17 22:11:26 -0500] deed02392: how quaint
[2013-02-17 22:11:49 -0500] deed02392: so I might jsut steal the git provider from the deploy resource?
[2013-02-17 22:11:58 -0500] deed02392: and use a cookbook template
[2013-02-17 22:13:44 -0500] kaerast: if it's your application then there's an argument for keeping the actual template file in the application git repo so it can be modified by the developers if necessary. Depends on your use-case really
[2013-02-17 22:15:09 -0500] kaerast: in a previous job we'd deploy an example.config.php with all the correct values in and let the developers copy it and manage any modifications they wanted
[2013-02-17 22:15:40 -0500] kaerast: currently we have a config.php managed by chef which includes a file that developers can modify
[2013-02-17 22:16:00 -0500] seanbrant: Im trying to untar some files that are downloaded using remote_file and it does not seem to be working
[2013-02-17 22:16:04 -0500] seanbrant: here is my code https://gist.github.com/seanbrant/27e4d9fc037100a57faa
[2013-02-17 22:16:43 -0500] seanbrant: the logs say the execute was successful but when i ssh into the server the directory does not exist
[2013-02-17 22:23:33 -0500] kaerast: seanbrant, https://gist.github.com/kaerast/e75907a7f9a7a660c449
[2013-02-17 22:24:04 -0500] kaerast: the path is the name attribute so you can provide that in the remote_file definition
[2013-02-17 22:24:27 -0500] seanbrant: thanks!
[2013-02-17 22:24:38 -0500] kaerast: and you probably want to be setting where the file should be extracted to
[2013-02-17 22:24:52 -0500] kaerast: this is completely untested of course
[2013-02-17 22:25:07 -0500] kaerast: and assumes that local is a full path and not just a filename
[2013-02-17 22:25:25 -0500] seanbrant: works perfect thanks
[2013-02-17 22:54:09 -0500] Glace: yfeldblum: ping
[2013-02-17 22:54:45 -0500] yfeldblum: Glace, pong
[2013-02-17 22:55:22 -0500] Glace: Im glad you are still there.. the chef-server.rb file is working.. but it does not find the solr attributes
[2013-02-17 22:56:14 -0500] yfeldblum: Glace, not sure what you mean by that
[2013-02-17 22:56:16 -0500] Glace: I tried  chef-solr['dir']
[2013-02-17 22:56:30 -0500] Glace: I tried  solr['dir']
[2013-02-17 22:57:41 -0500] Glace: in the chef-server.rb file
[2013-02-17 22:57:47 -0500] yfeldblum: Glace, https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef/blob/master/files/chef-server-cookbooks/chef-server/libraries/chef_server.rb#L28
[2013-02-17 22:57:48 -0500] Glace: and I get FATAL: NoMethodError: undefined method `[]=' for nil:NilClass
[2013-02-17 22:57:57 -0500] yfeldblum: Glace, try `chef_solr["dir"] = ...`
[2013-02-17 22:58:09 -0500] Glace: oh :)
[2013-02-17 22:58:26 -0500] Glace: I was looking there: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef/blob/master/files/chef-server-cookbooks/chef-server/attributes/default.rb
[2013-02-17 22:59:14 -0500] Glace: boom it works with chef_solr thank you so much
[2013-02-17 22:59:26 -0500] yfeldblum: Glace, np
[2013-02-17 23:00:25 -0500] yfeldblum: Glace, as i said earlier, the one i linked is the context in which your chef-server.rb will be instance_eval'd; the one you linked is the list of tunables, but you can't use them exactly as given; you have to translate them to a way that will work with the context class first
[2013-02-17 23:01:05 -0500] Glace: Got it
