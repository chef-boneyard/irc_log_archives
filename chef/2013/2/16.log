[2013-02-16 00:32:27 -0500] bendrix: question, i am using a ruby block to set a variable but it seems to be set outside of the run? how can i return the variable to be used in a template?
[2013-02-16 00:34:09 -0500] miah: dont use ruby_block
[2013-02-16 00:34:15 -0500] miah: you can put ruby in your recipes.
[2013-02-16 00:37:49 -0500] bendrix: what else can i use?
[2013-02-16 00:40:05 -0500] panq: hey fellas. i installed chef-client in my mac with the .sh installer, and now vagrant is complaining that the chef gem could not be loaded. should i just install the chef gem?
[2013-02-16 00:42:01 -0500] bendrix: miah, how would you just put the ruby in the recipe just on the top?
[2013-02-16 00:42:12 -0500] miah: anywhere
[2013-02-16 00:42:23 -0500] miah: all chef recipes are ruby
[2013-02-16 00:43:34 -0500] bendrix: oh nice
[2013-02-16 00:43:37 -0500] bendrix: i just ran it and it worked
[2013-02-16 00:43:43 -0500] bendrix: thanks miah
[2013-02-16 00:49:30 -0500] sabooky: Quick q, how do you use a lwrp from another cookbook? Do you just use the depends metadata or do you have to do include_recipe? (I'm using chef-solo if it matters)
[2013-02-16 00:49:53 -0500] gchristensen: if you include the recipe, the recipe will get run. if you just depend on it, it'll just make the lwrps available.
[2013-02-16 02:07:41 -0500] someara: miah still there?
[2013-02-16 02:59:00 -0500] miah: sup

[2013-02-16 08:57:33 -0500] papertigers_lapt: Hey, has anyone seen similar behavior with chef-client?  It will continuously lstat the same paths over and over https://gist.github.com/papertigers/d86a83cb23ff39b16020
[2013-02-16 17:35:12 -0500] Guest24044: I am trying to use application cookbook to deploy an app. I would like to add an before_symlink action but I need the new release path. Can I get it somehow?
[2013-02-16 17:40:45 -0500] andreacampi: Guest24044 that should be possible, yes
[2013-02-16 17:41:39 -0500] andreacampi: https://gist.github.com/andreacampi/4967861
[2013-02-16 17:41:41 -0500] andreacampi: try this
[2013-02-16 17:43:39 -0500] Guest24044: andreacampi thank you
[2013-02-16 17:45:52 -0500] Guest24044:  andreacampi it works
[2013-02-16 17:49:35 -0500] Guest24044: I am experiencing a strange behaviour: I deploy the app, I delete the folder that contains shared, current, releasses folders and I redeploy. The unussual thing is that releasses folder is not recreated but symlink is created (and points to a deleted location). Is there any other place where de cookbooks keeps the state?
[2013-02-16 18:35:42 -0500] pehlert1: Hey guys, is a Chef 11.4 client compatible with a Chef 10 server?
[2013-02-16 18:36:37 -0500] gchristensen: gosh I hope so, its being installed via omnibus :P a lot of people would be surprised
[2013-02-16 18:36:48 -0500] gchristensen: (that said, I'm not 100% sure)
[2013-02-16 18:38:34 -0500] pehlert1: gchristensen: Yup, that's why I was surprised, but it seems to be ;-) My install had another issue
[2013-02-16 18:39:41 -0500] gondoi: pehlert1: for the most part it is compatible, but here are the breaking changes
[2013-02-16 18:39:41 -0500] gondoi: http://docs.opscode.com/breaking_changes_chef_11.html
[2013-02-16 18:40:17 -0500] pehlert1: gondoi: So the cookbooks need to compatible with Chef 11?
[2013-02-16 18:40:24 -0500] gondoi: yeah
[2013-02-16 18:40:28 -0500] pehlert1: Ah, I see. Thanks
[2013-02-16 18:40:42 -0500] gondoi: if you do some things with attributes that are not supported anymore they will error
[2013-02-16 18:41:31 -0500] gondoi: i've also seen some interesting things happen with included_recipes that seems to have changed, but I haven't tracked down the exact combo of run_list and include_recipe
[2013-02-16 19:30:27 -0500] kavi: while running ched-solo, below to compiled resources whta does checksum mean?
[2013-02-16 19:38:52 -0500] papertigers_lapt: Hey, has anyone seen similar behavior in chef-client?  It seems to do a whole mess of lstat's on the same dir's  https://gist.github.com/papertigers/d86a83cb23ff39b16020
[2013-02-16 19:52:48 -0500] epta: Where can I found sources of git cookbook mentioned here http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/git+resource+updates ?
[2013-02-16 19:53:08 -0500] Garo_: Hello. I'm fairly new to Chef and to Ruby as I'm building a simple Chef recipe which locks database, snapshots it and then unlocks the database. The script can be seen at https://gist.github.com/garo/7c64b5a433725182a0d4 - now the problem is that the block_device action seems to happen only after the unlockDatabase() call is done. Have I understood something wrong as things doesn't seem to happen sequentially?
[2013-02-16 20:58:51 -0500] pwf: if i add an & to the end of the command in an execute resource, will it continue on with the chef run
[2013-02-16 20:59:04 -0500] pwf: i don't care what the command returns really, it just takes for-fucking-ever to run
[2013-02-16 23:04:17 -0500] kpepple_: is chef 11.0.6 supported on Ubuntu 12.10 ? i'm running into persistent problems doing the reconfigure ...
