[2013-02-02 03:44:36 -0500] alunduil: Is knife the only tool available in chef to deploy code to a central repository?  Does it make sense to ask if git can be used in place of knife for this particular purpose?
[2013-02-02 03:48:49 -0500] whilp: alunduil: we have some automation that uploads cookbooks/data/roles to the chef server
[2013-02-02 03:49:18 -0500] alunduil: whilp, you have time to elaborate a bit on that?  I'm curious how chef cookbooks fit into version control.
[2013-02-02 03:49:37 -0500] whilp: we're working on opensourcing our bits (cc jakedavis)
[2013-02-02 03:50:23 -0500] alunduil: Ok, but is version control part of deployment or do you have to commit to a repository and then use knife (by hand or by hook)?
[2013-02-02 03:50:38 -0500] whilp: but github triggers jenkins builds that munge the cookbooks a bit, run tests, and push to the server
[2013-02-02 03:50:42 -0500] whilp: i haven't run knife in ages
[2013-02-02 03:51:00 -0500] alunduil: whilp, Ok, that's what I was thinking but was wondering if there was a simpler or more built-in method.
[2013-02-02 03:51:35 -0500] whilp: nope
[2013-02-02 03:51:45 -0500] alunduil: Ok, thanks whilp that helped clarify things.
[2013-02-02 09:42:27 -0500] halcyonCorsair: can anyone point me in the direction of how to add an (open source) chef server webui user via knife?
[2013-02-02 10:38:52 -0500] red5|jbarney: If I have two chef servers, one for development, one for production. Can I place an attribute on the chef server itself so the recipes could search 'production' or 'development'? I would like different ufw rules based on this, and we are trying to move away from roles to do this job.
[2013-02-02 13:10:51 -0500] ttgb: If I have a recipe that sets up an instance of my application on a server, how can I force that recipe to run twice with different attributes, so I could install multiple development copies of the app on the same server?
[2013-02-02 13:14:35 -0500] Afterglow: ttgb: you are probably doing it wrong if you need the recipe to run multiple times, it would be more sensible to have one run of the recipe handle everything required
[2013-02-02 13:17:30 -0500] ttgb: Afterglow: fair point - I guess I'm considering a cookbook to be be a more discrete encapsulation of my application rather than covering all potential scenarios of how it could be installed.
[2013-02-02 13:29:12 -0500] deed02392: where can I read about when I should be using default[] and node[] and role[] etc and where these are defined and why the name changes from default[] in a cookbook attributes file to node[] in the recipe itself?
[2013-02-02 14:28:23 -0500] deed02392: I've updated a community cookbook, where should I post my changes for review (it's my first change so someone should look at this frst). I'm an approved contributor
[2013-02-02 14:32:31 -0500] cwj: deed02392: if its an opscode cookbook you can submit a pull request and then open a ticket on tickets.opscode.com referencing that pull request
[2013-02-02 14:33:02 -0500] deed02392: how do I do that cwj ?
[2013-02-02 14:33:04 -0500] cwj: once the opscode ticket is marked as "fix provided" it should get reviewed
[2013-02-02 14:33:07 -0500] deed02392: I installed it like knife cookbook site install
[2013-02-02 14:33:13 -0500] deed02392: and then just made loads of changes
[2013-02-02 14:33:37 -0500] deed02392: what do I have to do in terms of git etc to create a pull req?
[2013-02-02 14:34:12 -0500] cwj: if you can find the origin git repository, you can clone it and put your changes in a branch
[2013-02-02 14:34:29 -0500] cwj: which cookbook are you working on?
[2013-02-02 14:34:50 -0500] deed02392: php-fpm
[2013-02-02 14:35:00 -0500] deed02392: I've modified it completely so you can configure ALL the config directives from attributes
[2013-02-02 14:35:36 -0500] cwj: ok so it appears that cookbook is not maintained by opscode
[2013-02-02 14:35:42 -0500] cwj: so you wouldn't open a ticket with them
[2013-02-02 14:35:57 -0500] deed02392: oh right
[2013-02-02 14:36:12 -0500] cwj: but it looks like the author has merged some pull requests on github in the past
[2013-02-02 14:36:28 -0500] cwj: so you could fork that repository, put your changes in a branch, then send a pull request
[2013-02-02 14:44:37 -0500] deed02392: nice, thanks cwj
[2013-02-02 14:44:49 -0500] cwj: np
[2013-02-02 14:45:07 -0500] deed02392: if you're not too busy do you think you could advise me quickly on a php web app deployment?
[2013-02-02 14:45:08 -0500] deed02392: I've read a lot of docs but the guidance on opscode is mostly about ruby on rails stuff
[2013-02-02 14:45:42 -0500] deed02392: I did loads of work making my nginx recipe do a lot of the setting up for my site but I see now I should have been putting that all in a deployment recipe instead
[2013-02-02 14:46:12 -0500] deed02392: so I've got application and application_php, do I need to make another cookbook just for my app and then 'depend' on those two? and specify the packages my app needs in the app cookbook?
[2013-02-02 14:46:21 -0500] deed02392: i'm just playing with chef and figuring otu the proper way to do things as i go
[2013-02-02 14:46:34 -0500] cwj: yeah you depend on 'application_php'
[2013-02-02 14:47:09 -0500] cwj: the 'application' resource even has a 'packages' attribute
[2013-02-02 14:47:24 -0500] cwj: which takes an array of package names to install prior to deploying your app
[2013-02-02 14:48:06 -0500] deed02392: ahh right
[2013-02-02 14:48:33 -0500] deed02392: and the other thing with packages that's got me is what about when I know I want to use a specific repos first to get those packages?
[2013-02-02 14:48:33 -0500] deed02392: where should I define which repos to switch to before installing those packages?
[2013-02-02 14:48:42 -0500] deed02392: i.e. I wanna deploy on debian servers and use the dotdeb repos
[2013-02-02 14:49:01 -0500] cwj: are you familiar with the apt_repository resource provided by the apt cookbook?
[2013-02-02 14:49:42 -0500] deed02392: ah nope
[2013-02-02 14:50:02 -0500] cwj: it makes it really simple to add apt repositories
[2013-02-02 14:50:20 -0500] cwj: so put those at the beginning of the recipe for deploying your application
[2013-02-02 14:51:05 -0500] deed02392: ooh gotcha
[2013-02-02 14:51:42 -0500] cwj: make sure to depend on 'apt' and include_recipe 'apt' so that you can access that apt_repository LWRP
[2013-02-02 14:51:57 -0500] deed02392: so configure the repos, then install php cli/cgi/fpm, then install extensions, then nginx, then deploy my app
[2013-02-02 14:52:10 -0500] deed02392: basically i've just been putting lots of cookbooks in my runit list so far
[2013-02-02 14:52:32 -0500] deed02392: I should really be making one cookbook for my web app and including the others in it then?
[2013-02-02 14:52:45 -0500] cwj: that would be my recommendation
[2013-02-02 14:53:32 -0500] cwj: it looks like application_php is primarily oriented toward deploying behind apache w/ mod_php
[2013-02-02 14:53:37 -0500] deed02392: because I'd thought the idea of a role is that it consists of all the cookbooks you'd want
[2013-02-02 14:53:42 -0500] deed02392: but instead I should have a cookbook which if necessaary consists of other cookbooks
[2013-02-02 14:53:52 -0500] deed02392: and a role might be db_admin + web application
[2013-02-02 14:54:13 -0500] deed02392: and web app contains all my php/nginx etc cookbooks?
[2013-02-02 14:54:13 -0500] deed02392: yeah it is cwj
[2013-02-02 14:54:18 -0500] deed02392: so I suppose I should be forking that and adding in deploying with nginx support or something?
[2013-02-02 14:55:32 -0500] cwj: deed02392: you can certainly have other cookbooks in the run list, but if you need x y and z to be set up before you can begin deploying your own application with your cookbook, your cookbook should specify the dependencies and order things appropriately so x, y and z are ensured to be available
[2013-02-02 14:55:53 -0500] cwj: if you have to go back and read your roles to figure out what the right order of dependencies is, that kinda sucks
[2013-02-02 14:56:31 -0500] cwj: if i were you i would start by writing a cookbook that deploys the application using a deploy_revision resource instead of trying to add nginx into application_php straight away
[2013-02-02 14:57:09 -0500] cwj: then when you have that working you can add nginx bits to application_php if it suits your purposes
[2013-02-02 14:57:22 -0500] deed02392: well i've got no time limit as this is just a hobby thing, so I want to do it all properly even if that means going back on everything i've done now
[2013-02-02 14:57:50 -0500] deed02392: what do you mean by adding nginx into application_php?
[2013-02-02 14:58:18 -0500] deed02392: oh you mean by making application_php able to deploy an app with nginx?
[2013-02-02 14:58:40 -0500] cwj: when you use application_php it is wrapping an instance of deploy_resource and handling some other things under the hood
[2013-02-02 14:58:58 -0500] deed02392: deploy_revision resource I thought was just meant to set up a database and the site source rather than any software dependencies?
[2013-02-02 14:59:31 -0500] cwj: right, it checks out a repo, sets up some symlinks and runs a few different callbacks
[2013-02-02 15:00:07 -0500] cwj: you asked if you should fork application_php and add support for nginx
[2013-02-02 15:00:14 -0500] cwj: you could certainly try doing that
[2013-02-02 15:01:00 -0500] cwj: but imo you would have a better understanding of how that application/application_php stack works if you wrote a recipe that directly used the primatives and patterns that the application cookbook stack wraps
[2013-02-02 15:01:47 -0500] deed02392: hmm okay
[2013-02-02 15:01:59 -0500] deed02392: so I should just create one cookbook for my web app now and include just the application cookbook in that
[2013-02-02 15:02:22 -0500] deed02392: basically writing a separate application_php for my web app?
[2013-02-02 15:02:26 -0500] cwj: you should create one cookbook for your web app and ignore application/application_php for now
[2013-02-02 15:02:32 -0500] cwj: application doesnt really do much on its own
[2013-02-02 15:02:44 -0500] cwj: you use it through application_php or python or rails
[2013-02-02 15:02:49 -0500] cwj: er ruby
[2013-02-02 15:05:04 -0500] cwj: but yeah in a way you'd be reproducing parts of what application_php offers, but more verbosely
[2013-02-02 15:06:18 -0500] deed02392: hmm right
[2013-02-02 15:06:23 -0500] deed02392: more verbosely?
[2013-02-02 15:08:14 -0500] cwj: using the builtin primatives instead of the LWRP provided by the application cookbook stack
[2013-02-02 15:09:13 -0500] deed02392: ah right okay
[2013-02-02 15:09:45 -0500] cwj: so you probably have to ensure that certain directories exist first, etc
[2013-02-02 15:09:48 -0500] deed02392: nice
[2013-02-02 15:09:54 -0500] cwj: where as the application lwrp might handle that for you
[2013-02-02 15:09:59 -0500] cwj: as an example
[2013-02-02 15:12:47 -0500] deed02392: using the directory resource?
[2013-02-02 15:12:53 -0500] cwj: right
[2013-02-02 15:13:12 -0500] deed02392: is that what you mean by primatives? the reosurces provided directly by the core of chef?
[2013-02-02 15:13:22 -0500] cwj: yes
[2013-02-02 15:13:53 -0500] cwj: of course this all assumes you'd rather learn a bit by bumping your head instead of switching to apache+mod_php
[2013-02-02 15:14:18 -0500] cwj: but even if you dont use application_php there are useful lwrps for installing php modules etc
[2013-02-02 15:15:46 -0500] deed02392: ah really, without the overhead of including the apache stuff?
[2013-02-02 15:16:34 -0500] cwj: yeah, heres an example
[2013-02-02 15:16:35 -0500] cwj: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application_php/blob/master/providers/php.rb
[2013-02-02 15:16:48 -0500] cwj: this is the provider for the application php subresource
[2013-02-02 15:16:58 -0500] cwj: see on line 24 it includes the 'php' recipe
[2013-02-02 15:17:23 -0500] cwj: php::default really
[2013-02-02 15:17:25 -0500] cwj: and on line 55 it uses the php_pear LWRP provided by the php cookbook
[2013-02-02 15:17:48 -0500] deed02392: ohh
[2013-02-02 15:17:48 -0500] deed02392: interesting!
[2013-02-02 15:17:54 -0500] cwj: so you can do the same thing in your cookbook to use php_pear for installing php modules
[2013-02-02 15:17:56 -0500] cwj: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/php/blob/master/providers/pear.rb
[2013-02-02 15:18:30 -0500] cwj: and thats the provider for php_pear
[2013-02-02 15:19:29 -0500] deed02392: which the provider for php depends on for installing pear packages of course
[2013-02-02 15:20:02 -0500] deed02392: how does 'php_pear' convert to chef knowing to use the pear provider?
[2013-02-02 15:20:15 -0500] cwj: its a namespacing convention
[2013-02-02 15:20:49 -0500] deed02392: so in the context/'namespace' of one provider
[2013-02-02 15:20:53 -0500] cwj: if i have a cookbook foo containing resource/bar.rb and provider/bar.rb, they become a LWRP called foo_bar
[2013-02-02 15:21:13 -0500] deed02392: doing something like 'php_pear' means look at the php cookbook for the pear provider?
[2013-02-02 15:21:40 -0500] cwj: well kind of, its more like chef generates the php_pear name when loading the cookbooks
[2013-02-02 15:21:47 -0500] deed02392: oh they're combined like that?
[2013-02-02 15:22:23 -0500] deed02392: ah ok
[2013-02-02 15:22:59 -0500] schisamo: back
[2013-02-02 15:23:11 -0500] schisamo: woops ...wrong window :)
[2013-02-02 15:24:51 -0500] cwj: :D
[2013-02-02 17:04:11 -0500] xxiao: does the recent ruby/RoR security concern affect chef in any way?
[2013-02-02 17:04:45 -0500] xxiao: the damage to ruby in general seems serious
[2013-02-02 17:15:30 -0500] directhex: can anyone think of a sane reason why network:interfaces would be empty for a node which just ran chef-client from cron, but properly populated when running chef-client interactively on the same node? is there something about how network is populated that would make it depend on something in the environment?
[2013-02-02 17:16:29 -0500] ssd7: xxiao: We made a blog announcement about the security vulnerabilty that affects CHef: http://www.opscode.com/blog/2013/01/11/chef-10-16-6-security-release/
[2013-02-02 17:17:48 -0500] ssd7: directhex: Only thing I can think of is if the tools it uses to collect information isn't in the path when run via cron
[2013-02-02 17:19:31 -0500] directhex: huh, it *could* be as simple as $PATH couldn't it...
[2013-02-02 17:21:43 -0500] ssd7: directhex: The plugin uses ip, ifconfig, and arp to collect the information it puts in those attributes.
[2013-02-02 17:22:21 -0500] xxiao: ssd7: thanks
[2013-02-02 17:23:27 -0500] directhex: hm, missing /sbin from path, perhaps
[2013-02-02 17:26:20 -0500] ssd7: directhex: That would be my guess. Esepcially if you are on say, centos
[2013-02-02 17:27:45 -0500] ssd7: ALthough..
[2013-02-02 17:27:54 -0500] ssd7: our path sanity stuff should take care of that.
[2013-02-02 17:28:32 -0500] ssd7: directhex: If you really want to dig into it: up your log level to debug and be sure to capture the logs somewhere
[2013-02-02 17:28:46 -0500] ssd7: directhex: It will have the output from the various plugins that might yield some insight.
[2013-02-02 17:43:12 -0500] directhex: ssd7, bingo, that was it. now to work out how to gracefully deploy a fix for that.
[2013-02-02 17:54:54 -0500] tolland: ohai
[2013-02-02 17:57:04 -0500] tolland: im doing some cookbooks for a customer - they would like to base off public cookbooks, and customize them
[2013-02-02 17:57:52 -0500] tolland: this is going to result in a some cookbook version 1.2.3, being customized, to say 1.2.4 and diverging from the public cookbook
[2013-02-02 17:58:04 -0500] chip-: tolland: Make wrapper cookbooks that include the public cookbooks at the appropriate point.
[2013-02-02 17:58:11 -0500] tolland: they can then fix the 1.2.4 to their ...
[2013-02-02 17:58:19 -0500] chip-: tolland: so customer-apache, depends apache, then include_recipe apache::default when needed
[2013-02-02 17:58:21 -0500] tolland: ah, yes, that was what I was going to ask
[2013-02-02 17:58:35 -0500] chip-: tolland: couple that with the chef-rewind plugin
[2013-02-02 17:58:48 -0500] chip-: if necessary
[2013-02-02 17:58:59 -0500] tolland: chip-: is there a work flow for that,
[2013-02-02 17:59:05 -0500] tolland: I mean,
[2013-02-02 17:59:26 -0500] tolland: I have to explain this to the customer, and they have read the basics, so have an idea in mind
[2013-02-02 18:00:02 -0500] tolland: has anyone blogged on this subject?
[2013-02-02 18:00:15 -0500] tolland: or made a doc that I can pass on ;-)
[2013-02-02 18:00:17 -0500] chip-: Yeah, there's been lots of discussion about it.
[2013-02-02 18:00:39 -0500] chip-: http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-write-reusable-chef-cookbooks.html has some stuff on it
[2013-02-02 18:01:26 -0500] tolland: chip-: ah, brilliant!
[2013-02-02 18:01:29 -0500] tolland: thats perfect
[2013-02-02 18:01:31 -0500] tolland: thanks!
[2013-02-02 18:08:50 -0500] chip-: Hope it helps!
[2013-02-02 18:14:37 -0500] jkyle: I can't figure out why my plugins aren't loading, I wrote a little test script straight from the wiki, but o.orly returns nil => https://gist.github.com/4698647
[2013-02-02 18:15:41 -0500] ttgb: Can I overwrite a template that an included recipe uses in another cookbook?
[2013-02-02 18:17:30 -0500] chip-: ttgb: Check out this chef-client plugin: https://github.com/bryanwb/chef-rewind
[2013-02-02 18:21:47 -0500] jkyle: hm, it's only when I put provides 'openstack' that it doesn't work
[2013-02-02 18:26:01 -0500] ttgb: chip-: thanks, looks useful, just thought that just writing an LWRP might be what I actually need though
[2013-02-02 18:35:09 -0500] mattt: jkyle: not sure about that, never used ohai programmatically
[2013-02-02 18:35:10 -0500] jkyle: ah, I see, there's an openstack ohai plguin in core but it's not working on my cloud. so the mash attribute is conflicting
[2013-02-02 18:41:43 -0500] mattt: jkyle: what do you do w/ ohai like that ?
[2013-02-02 18:50:39 -0500] jkyle: mattt: youc an write your own metadata collectors for arbitrary data
[2013-02-02 18:50:52 -0500] jkyle: mattt: and then they're available as node attributes
[2013-02-02 18:51:24 -0500] jkyle: I wrote an openstack plugin cause the default one wasn't properly detecting our cloud, for example
[2013-02-02 18:51:59 -0500] mattt: jkyle: ah nice
[2013-02-02 18:52:08 -0500] mattt: jkyle: so what does it report for openstack clouds ?
[2013-02-02 18:54:28 -0500] jkyle: it's not detecting my cloud
[2013-02-02 18:54:43 -0500] jkyle: at all, going through the ohai core plugin to see why
[2013-02-02 19:42:26 -0500] rlw: Hi, I'm looking for a symlink provider or a LWRP. Does one exist?
[2013-02-02 19:43:25 -0500] zts: rlw: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Link
[2013-02-02 19:44:00 -0500] rlw: Thanks!!! google search failed me.
[2013-02-02 19:44:08 -0500] zts: rlw: or the more modern version, http://docs.opscode.com/chef/resources.html#link
[2013-02-02 19:44:37 -0500] zts: (more modern version of the documentation - the code being referred to is the same in both cases)
[2013-02-02 19:45:14 -0500] zts: rlw: probably best to google (if you didn't) for "chef symlink resource" - while there's a provider involved somewhere, the resource is the thing that you care about, when modelling your system
[2013-02-02 19:45:48 -0500] rlw: @zts thanks - yeah I searched symlink provider
[2013-02-02 19:46:17 -0500] zts: no problem
[2013-02-02 19:48:10 -0500] rlw: also, I'm looking for a curl provider - I want to use remote_file, but I have to use curl and some of it's more obscure command line options.
[2013-02-02 19:48:43 -0500] rlw: lastly, is there a way to pass a password as a command line option in chef-solo to 'remote_file'?
[2013-02-02 19:49:40 -0500] zts: rlw: I'm not sure about a curl provider - at the functional level, what do you need to do that remote_file doesn't support?
[2013-02-02 19:50:17 -0500] rlw: don't laugh - use an ssl cert and ssl password to authenticate to an https site internal to my customer
[2013-02-02 19:50:20 -0500] zts: rlw: as for passing a password to remote_file, you could do so in your url - eg, http://username@password:www.example.com/path/to/file.zip
[2013-02-02 19:51:02 -0500] zts: rlw: gotcha.  That's an entirely reasonable requirement!  If remote_file doesn't support that, it'd be a reasonable thing ot request as a feature
[2013-02-02 19:51:36 -0500] rlw: I could do that. Plus putting a cert password in a text file won't fly with my customer
[2013-02-02 19:52:33 -0500] zts: you'd want to look at encrypted databags for saving the credentials, if you need to go down that road
[2013-02-02 19:53:39 -0500] rlw: I didn't think encrypted databags would fly with chef-solo
[2013-02-02 19:54:53 -0500] zts: ah, on that front, I don't know one way or the other.  They make less sense with chef-solo, since they're concerned with exposure of secrets to the chef-server administrator (in the first instance), and data-at-rest behind that
[2013-02-02 19:55:28 -0500] zts: if your use of chef-solo lets you keep your ciphertext and your secret key somewhat separated, that might still address your client's security concerns
[2013-02-02 19:56:51 -0500] zts: rlw: if client certficate auth was possible, how would you be managing your client certs?
[2013-02-02 19:58:15 -0500] rlw: the private key file can have a passphrase on it. The cert is in a different file.
[2013-02-02 19:59:46 -0500] zts: okay, how would chef get access to the passphrase?  or have I misunderstood, and the client certs and HTTP auth are two separate requirements?
[2013-02-02 19:59:53 -0500] rlw: so curl needs all three to work with https sites
[2013-02-02 19:59:59 -0500] zts: ah
[2013-02-02 20:00:30 -0500] rlw: that's what needs to be passed at a terminal prompt
[2013-02-02 20:01:31 -0500] rlw: btw, it recently occurred to me that chef could be used to replicate the 'rails installer' project as well as setup Mac's for rails development.
[2013-02-02 20:01:47 -0500] rlw: doing so would probably be a boost to chef's popularity
[2013-02-02 20:02:47 -0500] zts: that could be neat
[2013-02-02 20:16:14 -0500] rlw: @zts: looks like the remote_file provider does not have any obvious code to support curl or any curl options. It assumes a RESTful file server. Thanks for your help!
[2013-02-02 20:17:40 -0500] zts: rlw: sure, but HTTPS client certificates aren't exclusively implemented by curl
[2013-02-02 20:18:40 -0500] zts: rlw: I'd suggest that remote_file shouldn't shell out to curl (platforms Chef supports might not ship curl out of the box), but HTTPS client certs are a feature it would be nice to support everywhere
[2013-02-02 20:18:57 -0500] zts: others may disagree :)
[2013-02-02 20:39:36 -0500] jkyle: ah ha, it needed a hints fiel with the newer ohai...ought to put that on the wiki imo
[2013-02-02 20:40:20 -0500] jkyle: or in teh ohai gem readme
[2013-02-02 21:17:37 -0500] jberanek: Are there any good tools/scripts for viewing and querying the ohai output? Looking for anything either ohai specific or generic JSON.
