[2013-02-23 00:19:55 -0500] mihirc: hi
[2013-02-23 00:20:08 -0500] mihirc: has anybody been able to work with chef 11.06
[2013-02-23 00:20:09 -0500] mihirc: ?
[2013-02-23 00:25:14 -0500] spheromak: server ?
[2013-02-23 00:25:23 -0500] spheromak: 11.0.6
[2013-02-23 00:25:27 -0500] spheromak: im working with it now
[2013-02-23 00:34:23 -0500] jtgiri__: hey guys I tried creating new client on chef 11, first of all i noticed that it's looking for user name admin, I changed it to webui, now I am getting authentication failure
[2013-02-23 00:34:45 -0500] jtgiri__: new user creation process different on chef 11 ?
[2013-02-23 00:39:59 -0500] jtgiri__: anybody ? is there way to regenerate  keys  ? in chef 10 if you removed validation key and restarted it recreated the keys
[2013-02-23 00:44:23 -0500] spheromak: jtgiri__: use the admin.pem in /etc/chef-server
[2013-02-23 00:44:26 -0500] spheromak: and the admin user
[2013-02-23 00:44:37 -0500] jtgiri__: admin key is not there
[2013-02-23 00:44:47 -0500] jtgiri__: ls /etc/chef
[2013-02-23 00:44:47 -0500] jtgiri__: validation.pem  webui.pem
[2013-02-23 00:44:56 -0500] jtgiri__: centos6
[2013-02-23 00:45:03 -0500] spheromak: you have to remove the client.pem and delete the client from the chef server with knife client delete for a client to re-register (assuming the validation.pem is available to the client).
[2013-02-23 00:45:09 -0500] spheromak: this is a client
[2013-02-23 00:45:19 -0500] spheromak: sorry thought you were trying to setup knife
[2013-02-23 00:45:38 -0500] spheromak: on a new client it should just need the validation.pem  and a chef run
[2013-02-23 00:45:47 -0500] spheromak: assuming there is no /etc/chef/client.pem
[2013-02-23 00:47:10 -0500] sascha_d: can someone give me the memo on recipes with underscores preceding the name?
[2013-02-23 00:47:14 -0500] jtgiri__: so this is new chef server
[2013-02-23 00:47:14 -0500] sascha_d: I think I missed it
[2013-02-23 00:47:27 -0500] jtgiri__: i just want to create initial user
[2013-02-23 00:48:08 -0500] jtgiri__: I did knife configure -i , i see it's looking for admin user, i see no keys for admin user in /etc/chef
[2013-02-23 00:48:33 -0500] spheromak: sascha_d: usually (the way i use it) means thats a local/private recipe. not intended to be directly called.
[2013-02-23 00:48:44 -0500] sascha_d: that's kind of what I was guessing
[2013-02-23 00:48:44 -0500] spheromak: but theres no inherent meaning in an _foo recipe
[2013-02-23 00:48:54 -0500] sascha_d: I just seem to be encountering a lot these past few weeks
[2013-02-23 00:49:15 -0500] spheromak: yea its a newish trend, and one im behind.  in breaking up cooks so they are easier to re-use.
[2013-02-23 00:49:33 -0500] spheromak: jtgiri__: right so your setting up the knife client
[2013-02-23 00:49:44 -0500] spheromak: jtgiri__: knife client create -i stuff
[2013-02-23 00:51:44 -0500] jtgiri__: spheromak: knife client create  jgiri is throwing an error ERROR: Your private key could not be loaded from /root/.chef/root.pem
[2013-02-23 00:51:47 -0500] spheromak: jtgiri__: try this knife confifure  --admin-client-key /etc/chef-server/admin.pem --admin-client-name admin --validation-client-name chef-validator  --validation-key=/etc/chef-server/chef-validator.pem  -i
[2013-02-23 00:52:09 -0500] spheromak: from your chef-server
[2013-02-23 00:52:15 -0500] spheromak: assuming omni installed chef-server
[2013-02-23 00:52:18 -0500] spheromak: those paths should be correct
[2013-02-23 00:52:45 -0500] spheromak: and spell configure right D
[2013-02-23 00:52:47 -0500] spheromak: :)
[2013-02-23 00:53:00 -0500] jtgiri__: :)
[2013-02-23 00:53:01 -0500] jtgiri__: i fixed that
[2013-02-23 00:53:21 -0500] jtgiri__: but in /etc/chef i see no admin.pem
[2013-02-23 00:53:22 -0500] jtgiri__: ls /etc/chef
[2013-02-23 00:53:22 -0500] jtgiri__: validation.pem  webui.pem
[2013-02-23 00:53:28 -0500] jtgiri__: should the admin be there already ?
[2013-02-23 00:53:48 -0500] spheromak: its not in /etc/chef
[2013-02-23 00:53:53 -0500] mihirc: i am getting an error uploading a cookbook to the server
[2013-02-23 00:53:57 -0500] spheromak: its in chef-server if this is chef-server 11 omni installed
[2013-02-23 00:54:10 -0500] jtgiri__: oh okay thanks
[2013-02-23 00:54:38 -0500] mihirc: knife tries to upload files to localhost rather than chef-servert
[2013-02-23 00:54:39 -0500] spheromak: thats one of the changes.. the other is moving the default server api port from 4000 -> 443
[2013-02-23 00:55:02 -0500] spheromak: mihirc: chefck your knife.rb in ./.chef/ or ~/.chef/ or /etc/chef
[2013-02-23 00:55:38 -0500] mihirc: am able to run all other commands...
[2013-02-23 00:58:11 -0500] mihirc: i was using an ip for the chef-server in knife.rb
[2013-02-23 00:58:29 -0500] mihirc: changing it to a proper fdqn and adding host entries
[2013-02-23 00:59:50 -0500] mihirc: nope does not work
[2013-02-23 01:00:55 -0500] mihirc: i dont get it. why is knife trying to upload to localhost:443?
[2013-02-23 01:00:58 -0500] mihirc: any ideas?
[2013-02-23 01:01:47 -0500] spheromak: ah
[2013-02-23 01:01:51 -0500] spheromak: your hitting the redirect isue
[2013-02-23 01:02:10 -0500] spheromak: yea theres an internal redir coming from erchef-> bookshelf. if you change ports its not quite working out right
[2013-02-23 01:02:28 -0500] spheromak: its coming back to knife. are you using this on a vagrant box or something ?
[2013-02-23 01:03:06 -0500] mihirc: i am trying to upload a cookbook to the chef-server
[2013-02-23 01:03:09 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-02-23 01:03:11 -0500] spheromak: its chef 11
[2013-02-23 01:03:18 -0500] spheromak: is the server behind a nat ?
[2013-02-23 01:03:24 -0500] mihirc: my setup has 3 virtual machines
[2013-02-23 01:03:28 -0500] spheromak: or did you configure it to be on a different port ?
[2013-02-23 01:04:08 -0500] mihirc: the ports are the same. came with the 11.06 install from opscode
[2013-02-23 01:04:12 -0500] john__: hi. I am trying to use volume_dirs definition from volumes cookbook. I am geting 'ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 0)' for type attribute of the block. Do anyone know anything about this?
[2013-02-23 01:04:12 -0500] mihirc: no changes to port
[2013-02-23 01:04:56 -0500] spheromak: mihirc: whats the nodes fqdn.
[2013-02-23 01:05:11 -0500] mihirc: checking.
[2013-02-23 01:05:13 -0500] spheromak: the omni installer will set some internal urls to node[:fqdn] by default
[2013-02-23 01:05:26 -0500] spheromak: so if that resoves back to localhost it will make sesne that you are seing the behaviour
[2013-02-23 01:06:30 -0500] mihirc: how are the nodes involved if i am just uploading the cookbook from the workstation to the chef-server?
[2013-02-23 01:06:45 -0500] spheromak: its not nodes.
[2013-02-23 01:06:47 -0500] spheromak: its on the chef-server
[2013-02-23 01:07:07 -0500] spheromak: the omni-installer sets up the config inbetween the chef-server components.  bookshelf/erchef
[2013-02-23 01:07:20 -0500] mihirc: can we change it?
[2013-02-23 01:07:31 -0500] spheromak: when you upload a cookbook erchef sends a request to the bookshelf service. that service is returning a redirect to your client (knife) which is pointing at localhost
[2013-02-23 01:07:40 -0500] spheromak: i.e. why knife is bitching about not being able to connect to localhost
[2013-02-23 01:07:53 -0500] spheromak: you can fix it by making sure the fqdn is set right
[2013-02-23 01:07:56 -0500] spheromak: on your chef-server
[2013-02-23 01:08:08 -0500] mihirc: the fqdn on my chef-server is umentachef
[2013-02-23 01:08:42 -0500] spheromak: theres a couple coomonents you can try
[2013-02-23 01:08:54 -0500] mihirc: which files do i change at the server?
[2013-02-23 01:08:59 -0500] spheromak: cause im not 100% which component is reporting back, but when you did the omni install the fqdn prob wasn't right
[2013-02-23 01:09:38 -0500] mihirc: ohh okay
[2013-02-23 01:09:39 -0500] spheromak: mihirc: one sec ill get you the config options to try
[2013-02-23 01:09:48 -0500] mihirc: thanks. thanks a lot
[2013-02-23 01:10:07 -0500] mihirc: with the 11.06, the documents online are also not consistent
[2013-02-23 01:10:37 -0500] spheromak: mihirc: did you use the chef-server cookbook from git to setup or just did the omni install form shell ?
[2013-02-23 01:10:51 -0500] spheromak: mihirc: yes you have to dig intot he omni cooks to figure out whats going on :D
[2013-02-23 01:10:55 -0500] spheromak: thats what i've done.
[2013-02-23 01:11:09 -0500] mihirc: i installed it from the shell
[2013-02-23 01:11:14 -0500] spheromak: ok
[2013-02-23 01:11:19 -0500] mihirc: okay...
[2013-02-23 01:11:24 -0500] spheromak: so in /etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb
[2013-02-23 01:11:34 -0500] spheromak: you can set these and then run chef-server-ctl reconfigure
[2013-02-23 01:11:47 -0500] spheromak: bookshelf['vip'] = "your server name"
[2013-02-23 01:11:47 -0500] john__: is type attribute reserved?
[2013-02-23 01:12:00 -0500] mihirc: okay..
[2013-02-23 01:12:01 -0500] spheromak: ?
[2013-02-23 01:12:09 -0500] mihirc: let me give this a shot...
[2013-02-23 01:12:27 -0500] spheromak: thres more too
[2013-02-23 01:12:36 -0500] mihirc: bdw...i dont have that fine.. chef-server.rb
[2013-02-23 01:12:43 -0500] mihirc: will create it
[2013-02-23 01:12:54 -0500] spheromak: should have a version of it
[2013-02-23 01:12:57 -0500] spheromak: maybe not
[2013-02-23 01:12:58 -0500] spheromak: hrm
[2013-02-23 01:13:24 -0500] spheromak: also set api_fqdn = "your box"
[2013-02-23 01:13:27 -0500] mihirc: i have a json file
[2013-02-23 01:13:37 -0500] mihirc: chef-server-running.json
[2013-02-23 01:13:55 -0500] epta: > undefined method `load_cookbook' for #<Chef::CookbookLoader:0x7ff6bf30f2d8>
[2013-02-23 01:14:02 -0500] epta: How can I fix it in chef 10.12
[2013-02-23 01:14:02 -0500] epta: ?
[2013-02-23 01:14:15 -0500] spheromak: yea mihirc don't edit the json
[2013-02-23 01:14:19 -0500] spheromak: setup the chef-server.rb
[2013-02-23 01:14:28 -0500] mihirc: okay
[2013-02-23 01:16:59 -0500] spheromak: mihirc: https://gist.github.com/spheromak/5017833 example config  where i think i hit all the variables that controll naming
[2013-02-23 01:17:26 -0500] epta: Where can I found chef sources on the node?
[2013-02-23 01:17:27 -0500] spheromak: actually that may not work tho
[2013-02-23 01:18:06 -0500] mihirc: okay done
[2013-02-23 01:18:09 -0500] mihirc: running reconfigure
[2013-02-23 01:18:11 -0500] spheromak: mihirc: lemme test rq
[2013-02-23 01:19:24 -0500] spheromak: cause api_fqdn is a method i think. might change that up.
[2013-02-23 01:19:54 -0500] spheromak: mihirc: updated the gist.
[2013-02-23 01:20:02 -0500] mihirc: checking.
[2013-02-23 01:20:44 -0500] spheromak: that config worked for me here in my test env
[2013-02-23 01:20:54 -0500] mihirc: trying it out
[2013-02-23 01:21:07 -0500] spheromak: obviously change the server_name
[2013-02-23 01:21:15 -0500] mihirc: yup got that
[2013-02-23 01:22:26 -0500] mihirc: this is a new error " Error executing action `run` on resource 'execute[/opt/chef-server/embedded/bin/createdb -T template0 -E UTF-8 opscode_chef]' "
[2013-02-23 01:22:28 -0500] mihirc: trying again
[2013-02-23 01:22:47 -0500] spheromak: on a server-ctl reconfigure ?
[2013-02-23 01:22:52 -0500] mihirc: yaah
[2013-02-23 01:22:56 -0500] spheromak: weird
[2013-02-23 01:23:01 -0500] spheromak: try again yea :D
[2013-02-23 01:23:03 -0500] mihirc: could not connect to database template1
[2013-02-23 01:23:16 -0500] mihirc: postgresql server is causing an error
[2013-02-23 01:23:19 -0500] spheromak: seems somehting went wonkey in the reconfig
[2013-02-23 01:23:26 -0500] mihirc: yaah
[2013-02-23 01:23:27 -0500] spheromak: can always try a reinstall from scratch
[2013-02-23 01:23:34 -0500] mihirc: i know...
[2013-02-23 01:23:59 -0500] spheromak: i've been wrestling with getting our test env up on 11 for a few days now. I feel your pain
[2013-02-23 01:24:12 -0500] spheromak: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef/blob/master/files/chef-server-cookbooks/chef-server/attributes/default.rb
[2013-02-23 01:24:14 -0500] mihirc: wow...
[2013-02-23 01:24:15 -0500] spheromak: those are the cooks
[2013-02-23 01:24:21 -0500] spheromak: that omni uses
[2013-02-23 01:24:44 -0500] mihirc: i think i will have to clean the entire os up
[2013-02-23 01:24:56 -0500] mihirc: they have an uninstall command.
[2013-02-23 01:25:00 -0500] mihirc: lets see what that does
[2013-02-23 01:25:02 -0500] mihirc: :-)
[2013-02-23 01:25:12 -0500] kallistec: epta: how'd you hit that error? running some knife plugin?
[2013-02-23 01:26:35 -0500] mihirc: well uninstalled and reconfigured
[2013-02-23 01:26:43 -0500] mihirc: same error continues
[2013-02-23 01:27:19 -0500] epta: kallistec: yep, I write my own one
[2013-02-23 01:27:25 -0500] epta: kallistec: so I'm gonna fix it
[2013-02-23 01:27:46 -0500] spheromak: mihirc: hrm that config im runnign right now with omni server and no probs.
[2013-02-23 01:27:46 -0500] epta: It works fine with 11.14, but not with 10.12
[2013-02-23 01:28:04 -0500] mihirc: alright...this will require a reset of the VM
[2013-02-23 01:28:28 -0500] mihirc: its good since this is a test vm
[2013-02-23 01:28:36 -0500] spheromak: :)
[2013-02-23 01:28:45 -0500] mihirc: hehe
[2013-02-23 01:28:50 -0500] mihirc: now after the config file...
[2013-02-23 01:29:12 -0500] mihirc: the reconfigure has added config of its own and from the file
[2013-02-23 01:29:32 -0500] mihirc: i have two server names for each entry in chef-server-running.json
[2013-02-23 01:29:54 -0500] spheromak: really
[2013-02-23 01:30:12 -0500] kallistec: epta: yeah, there was a bit of churn between 10.x and 11.x there, your best bet is to just view the source on github at the specific tag you're interested in
[2013-02-23 01:30:13 -0500] mihirc: yaah
[2013-02-23 01:30:30 -0500] mihirc: am gonna delete the json, and just keep the config
[2013-02-23 01:30:32 -0500] mihirc: and give it a try
[2013-02-23 01:30:36 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-02-23 01:30:43 -0500] spheromak: or maybe shut it down
[2013-02-23 01:30:45 -0500] spheromak: delete config
[2013-02-23 01:30:48 -0500] spheromak: reconfigure
[2013-02-23 01:30:57 -0500] epta: kallistec: you mean, download tag source and look?
[2013-02-23 01:31:27 -0500] spheromak: epta: the git tag of the version of chef your interested
[2013-02-23 01:31:29 -0500] spheromak: in
[2013-02-23 01:31:55 -0500] kallistec: epta: for example, browsing on github: https://github.com/opscode/chef/tree/10.12.0/chef
[2013-02-23 01:32:09 -0500] epta: Nice
[2013-02-23 01:32:10 -0500] mihirc: yoo hoo
[2013-02-23 01:32:12 -0500] epta: Thnaks
[2013-02-23 01:32:12 -0500] mihirc: it worked
[2013-02-23 01:32:15 -0500] spheromak: mihirc: cool
[2013-02-23 01:32:23 -0500] mihirc: i dont know how...but config file saved me a lot of time
[2013-02-23 01:32:24 -0500] mihirc: thanks
[2013-02-23 01:32:28 -0500] mihirc: thanks a ton
[2013-02-23 01:32:41 -0500] spheromak: kallistec: is there a ticket that you know of about these redirect issues in chef-server 11 ?
[2013-02-23 01:33:03 -0500] spheromak: i.e. all the no relative redirects that are going on inbetween the services :D
[2013-02-23 01:33:41 -0500] kallistec: spheromak: redirects from 80 to 443 not working?
[2013-02-23 01:34:04 -0500] kallistec: or getting "bad" URLs to cookbook files from erchef?
[2013-02-23 01:34:21 -0500] spheromak: nah internal redirs. (includes the port shit). but if i access the server on an ip or aliased name. say when uploading cooks. I will get redirected to whatever servers idea of node[fqdn] is
[2013-02-23 01:34:31 -0500] spheromak: i.e. your not preserviing the clients host request
[2013-02-23 01:34:49 -0500] spheromak: nor are you preserving the port the request came in on (as it proxies throught he nginix to bookshelf or w/e else)
[2013-02-23 01:35:16 -0500] spheromak: the end is that the request bubbles back to knife and causes an error that is weird for most people.. I.e. knife cant connect to localhost
[2013-02-23 01:35:19 -0500] spheromak: :D
[2013-02-23 01:35:23 -0500] kallistec: I think there's at least a similar ticket, not sure
[2013-02-23 01:35:32 -0500] spheromak: i know htere was one about the login redirs
[2013-02-23 01:35:35 -0500] spheromak: but its more than that.
[2013-02-23 01:36:09 -0500] spheromak: and the root issue is that client request isn't being honored. relative redirects aren't being used. or some other proxy config isn't right.
[2013-02-23 01:37:34 -0500] kallistec: probably has to do with erchef itself, I'd guess
[2013-02-23 01:37:51 -0500] spheromak: thats what i concluded.
[2013-02-23 01:38:05 -0500] spheromak: I got burned by it trying to run the whole thing on non priv ports under vagrant.
[2013-02-23 01:38:32 -0500] spheromak: ended up having to use ipf forward rules cause internal redirects were coming back pushing me to :443
[2013-02-23 01:38:36 -0500] kallistec: There is some nginx config where you generally need to set x-forwarded-for or whatever
[2013-02-23 01:38:38 -0500] spheromak: *ipfw
[2013-02-23 01:38:42 -0500] spheromak: yea
[2013-02-23 01:38:50 -0500] spheromak: but then the ports aren't preserved either:D
[2013-02-23 01:38:59 -0500] spheromak: i tried to get a fix in on the nginx side.
[2013-02-23 01:39:11 -0500] spheromak: but it was something comin out  of erchef
[2013-02-23 01:39:37 -0500] kallistec: there's also a x-forwarded-host or something
[2013-02-23 01:39:45 -0500] spheromak: anyhow I think that needs to be looked into. as running the server in any non standard port will ause grief
[2013-02-23 01:39:50 -0500] spheromak: yep
[2013-02-23 01:39:58 -0500] spheromak: and you guys are rewriting the headers in the config
[2013-02-23 01:40:04 -0500] kallistec: but TBH I learned all of this from the merb source
[2013-02-23 01:40:14 -0500] spheromak: which is fine. its the downstream request thats coming back up to the client
[2013-02-23 01:40:28 -0500] chrisballinger: Hey guys, is there any reason why the template resource wouldn't overwrite an existing file?
[2013-02-23 01:40:29 -0500] spheromak: so its somehting on the backend server
[2013-02-23 01:40:45 -0500] kallistec: my guess without knowing for sure is that erchef is generating URLs from static config and not header values
[2013-02-23 01:40:59 -0500] spheromak: chrisballinger: when the existing file hasn't changed. or the chef process doesn't have permissions.
[2013-02-23 01:41:20 -0500] chrisballinger: hmmmm
[2013-02-23 01:41:21 -0500] spheromak: kallistec: thats my guess as well. I started poking at the source, but erl makes my head hurt still :D
[2013-02-23 01:41:44 -0500] chrisballinger: we just manually 'rm'ed the file and now it works
[2013-02-23 01:41:48 -0500] spheromak: chrisballinger: to qualify that. when the hash for the existing file matches the generated hash for the rendered template  it wont change :D
[2013-02-23 01:42:12 -0500] chrisballinger: we force rmed the file manually and it overwrote it properly
[2013-02-23 01:42:24 -0500] kallistec: chrisballinger: what chef version?
[2013-02-23 01:42:31 -0500] chrisballinger: oh wait nevermind, we broke something so bad it wasn't even writing the template anymore
[2013-02-23 01:42:38 -0500] spheromak: chrisballinger: hehe
[2013-02-23 01:45:36 -0500] chrisballinger: is there a way to tell chef to make directories when making a file
[2013-02-23 01:45:51 -0500] chrisballinger: or do we have to do that separately before we place files
[2013-02-23 01:46:02 -0500] spheromak: use a directory resource before your file/template resource
[2013-02-23 01:46:07 -0500] chrisballinger: ah ok thanks
[2013-02-23 01:46:45 -0500] spheromak: you can use recursive option to the directory resource. basically mkdir -p
[2013-02-23 01:47:53 -0500] chrisballinger: sweet
[2013-02-23 03:49:55 -0500] allaire: How gem install mail -v '~> 2.4.0' would convert using gem_package?
[2013-02-23 04:23:59 -0500] c0ff33: anybody around? need some help with rabbitmq
[2013-02-23 04:24:59 -0500] c0ff33: i'm trying to install chef-server but when trying to add clients with knife I'm getting a 500 response from rabbitmq and the logs make it look the the chef user does not have proper credentials
[2013-02-23 04:25:23 -0500] c0ff33: i did not use a strange password - i just used 1234. i used the debian setup package
[2013-02-23 04:39:04 -0500] maek: I just installed chef 11 on ubuntu 12.04 and I dont see anything bound to port 4k
[2013-02-23 05:04:44 -0500] ranjibd: maek, did you run chefserverctl ?
[2013-02-23 05:10:02 -0500] maek: ranjibd: I found out its not using 4k anymore
[2013-02-23 05:10:03 -0500] maek: thanks
[2013-02-23 05:10:09 -0500] maek: seems like 80 and 443 :D
[2013-02-23 05:15:55 -0500] ranjibd: maek, yeah..erchef :0-)  i guess its backed by nginx
[2013-02-23 06:01:07 -0500] cheezo_: hello, i am trying to debug my recipe using the chef-shell, now this recipe depends on some custom defined LWRPs
[2013-02-23 06:01:23 -0500] cheezo_: so when i include the recipe, it cannot find those resources
[2013-02-23 06:01:35 -0500] cheezo_: how do i load the resources before recipe in shef?
[2013-02-23 06:15:22 -0500] X-Jester: cheezo_: still there?
[2013-02-23 06:15:34 -0500] cheezo_: X-Jester: yep
[2013-02-23 06:15:42 -0500] X-Jester: cheezo_: i think you need a depends clause in your metadata.r b
[2013-02-23 06:16:02 -0500] cheezo_: X-Jester: ok, actually its broken in 11 :) http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3831
[2013-02-23 06:16:09 -0500] X-Jester: oh, snap
[2013-02-23 06:16:10 -0500] X-Jester: bummer
[2013-02-23 06:16:11 -0500] X-Jester: :)
[2013-02-23 06:20:53 -0500] maek: ranjibd: are you using chef 11
[2013-02-23 06:21:05 -0500] ranjibd:  yeah,
[2013-02-23 06:21:12 -0500] maek: how do you change the ip its bound to?
[2013-02-23 06:21:18 -0500] maek: Im getting 127.0.0.1
[2013-02-23 06:21:20 -0500] maek: default
[2013-02-23 06:21:26 -0500] maek: and I dont have an /etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb
[2013-02-23 06:23:44 -0500] maek: I do have an /etc/chef-server/chef-server-running.json
[2013-02-23 06:33:49 -0500] ranjibd: maek, it worked for me out of the box
[2013-02-23 06:34:39 -0500] ranjibd: i think its revere proxied .. via ngin , for ssl termination, didnt explored it in detail, was busy with exploring the chef 11 client features :-)
[2013-02-23 06:35:21 -0500] jtimberman: chef server has nginx as a reverse proxy in front of the erchef API and bookshelf (cookbook data store/API service)
[2013-02-23 06:35:54 -0500] maek: jtimberman: hi
[2013-02-23 06:36:00 -0500] maek: so this 127.0.0.1 is legit
[2013-02-23 06:36:21 -0500] jtimberman: maek: the default settings are attributes set in the bundled cookbooks used by chef-server-ctl reconfigure, which is here: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef/blob/master/files/chef-server-cookbooks/chef-server/attributes/default.rb
[2013-02-23 06:36:50 -0500] jtimberman: the server team is working on docs etc for managing the chef server
[2013-02-23 06:37:34 -0500] cheezo_: is it possible to run individual resources from a recipe in shef?
[2013-02-23 06:37:50 -0500] maek: jtimberman: thanks
[2013-02-23 06:38:04 -0500] jtimberman: cheezo_: sure
[2013-02-23 06:38:11 -0500] maek: jtimberman: do you know where I can modify those attributes?
[2013-02-23 06:38:21 -0500] jtimberman: maek: /etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb
[2013-02-23 06:38:23 -0500] maek: is there a file like private-chef.rb ?
[2013-02-23 06:38:27 -0500] maek: jtimberman: :D bam thanks
[2013-02-23 06:38:35 -0500] jtimberman: its a mixlib-config like client.rb
[2013-02-23 06:38:41 -0500] jtimberman: make sense?
[2013-02-23 06:38:46 -0500] cheezo_: jtimberman: so include_recipe loads everything, so resources is now populated, then?
[2013-02-23 06:38:59 -0500] jtimberman: those attributes namespaced under chef server in that link above.
[2013-02-23 06:39:09 -0500] maek: jtimberman: yes, thanks
[2013-02-23 06:39:36 -0500] jtimberman: cheezo_: include recipe will parse the specified recipe in the same context as a chef run. so the resources that are defined are added to the Resource Collection
[2013-02-23 06:39:47 -0500] cheezo_: correct
[2013-02-23 06:39:50 -0500] jtimberman: You can display the resource collection with resources
[2013-02-23 06:40:25 -0500] cheezo_: yep, so i want to step through each resource
[2013-02-23 06:40:33 -0500] cheezo_: as it gets applied
[2013-02-23 10:26:25 -0500] cheezo_: is it possible for resources to return data that can be used on recipes?
[2013-02-23 14:03:45 -0500] stPundit: hey guys, i am writing a chef recipe and have defined some attribute variables in attribute/default.rb.. having said that i want to use these attribute variable in a  for loop using array .. can you please guide me how can i achieve this
