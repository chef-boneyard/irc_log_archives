[2013-02-24 02:23:25 -0500] shanlar: is it possible to override attributes from recipeB that i am including in recipeA? id like to do it in recipeA's attribute file
[2013-02-24 02:59:57 -0500] sprack: what's the "best" way to run an apt-get dist-upgrade with a reboot before the rest of provisioning?
[2013-02-24 03:01:00 -0500] gchristensen: sprack: that is tricky, but I run apt-get update; apt-get upgrade in the bootstrap. I don't think Chef would particularly /like/ being rebooted...
[2013-02-24 03:04:26 -0500] sprack: gchristensen: that's kind of what I gathered. I want to build an instance with current kernel and other package-sets, but up'ing the kernel will require a reboot. I guess I have 2 choices, prebuild an AMI will upgrade already run or make role for the upgrade and then apply a 2nd role with the rest of setup
[2013-02-24 03:05:56 -0500] gchristensen: that's what I've been doing myself, using chef-solo to do my build steps
[2013-02-24 03:06:11 -0500] gchristensen: the last step I do is I remove all the chef remnants and reboot
[2013-02-24 03:07:26 -0500] gchristensen: unfortunately veewee doesn't have support for this kind of thing (which is what I use for vagrant box builds)
[2013-02-24 03:08:36 -0500] gchristensen: and now that I look it up, it seems you could use veewee and then convert it to an AMI: http://www.ioncannon.net/system-administration/1246/converting-from-virtualbox-or-vmware-to-ec2-now-easier-than-ever/
[2013-02-24 03:14:08 -0500] sprack: that's pretty cool. does it say how to make once for paravirtual vs hvm?
[2013-02-24 03:49:22 -0500] zpatten: ohai
[2013-02-24 03:57:43 -0500] maek: anyone use knife joyent with success?
[2013-02-24 04:58:24 -0500] hippiehacker: I've been thinking about a way to store files for distribution with chef.... for example creating data bag items with everything needed for remote_file entries
[2013-02-24 04:58:47 -0500] hippiehacker: https://github.com/easybake-ingredients/chef_server has some ruby and the resultant data bag items
[2013-02-24 04:59:16 -0500] hippiehacker: but what to do with it.... Nexus might be a valid choice
[2013-02-24 05:00:24 -0500] hippiehacker: or perhaps the chef-server itself as the files/*  of a recipe.... in chef 11 open source server those are stored in an s3 compatible erlang service, and in hosted chef they are actually stored in s3
[2013-02-24 05:00:44 -0500] hippiehacker: s/of a recipe/of a cookbook/
[2013-02-24 05:02:03 -0500] hippiehacker: but one would need to dynamically create and upload cookbooks with the files in them based on the dynamically created data bags 8)
[2013-02-24 05:02:14 -0500] hippiehacker: just random thoughts for late Saturday night 8)
[2013-02-24 13:00:55 -0500] poseid: hello... I am experimenting with berkshelf, however my vagrant up seems not to get up... see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15051938/how-to-use-berkshelf-with-chef-solo
[2013-02-24 13:05:41 -0500] zts: poseid: you should include the parts of your Vagrantfile that are relevant to the chef configuration
[2013-02-24 13:05:58 -0500] poseid: ok, one sec
[2013-02-24 13:07:24 -0500] poseid: ok, updates
[2013-02-24 13:09:38 -0500] poseid: what confuses me is that the run_list is generated by berkshelf, but some additional step needs to be necessary
[2013-02-24 13:14:28 -0500] zts: oh, that'll teach me for answering without too much familiarity with Berkshelf - sorry!
[2013-02-24 13:14:44 -0500] zts: that's definitely the the source of your problem
[2013-02-24 13:18:09 -0500] poseid: no problem...
[2013-02-24 13:18:18 -0500] poseid: always good to share ideas
[2013-02-24 13:18:36 -0500] zts: are you sure you haven't called something "berkshelf-test" something along the way?
[2013-02-24 13:19:02 -0500] poseid: i am now looking more in http://berkshelf.com/
[2013-02-24 13:19:18 -0500] zts: The Vagrantfile template is just dropping in the name of the cookbook - https://github.com/RiotGames/berkshelf/blob/master/generator_files/Vagrantfile.erb
[2013-02-24 13:19:34 -0500] poseid: now the thing is that berks init generates that run list from my directory
[2013-02-24 13:19:56 -0500] poseid: however I would expect vagrant up to provision just fine
[2013-02-24 13:20:34 -0500] zts: is the directory you ran "berks init" inside called "berkshelf-test", and is that a cookbook or just a directory?
[2013-02-24 13:20:46 -0500] poseid: indeed, it's berkshelf-test
[2013-02-24 13:20:54 -0500] poseid: since I want to experiment there
[2013-02-24 13:21:00 -0500] poseid: I probably would need to create that cookbook berkshelf-test
[2013-02-24 13:21:24 -0500] poseid: myself... but that confuses me... if I want to boot a VM with some opscode cookbooks
[2013-02-24 13:21:37 -0500] poseid: I thought I could take Berkshelf for this too
[2013-02-24 13:22:04 -0500] poseid: apparently, Berkshelf's job is more of a one cookbook, many dependencies setup
[2013-02-24 13:22:53 -0500] zts: I don't know - from what I've seen, it seems that it takes the common case of wanting to spin up a single cookbook (for development, or testing, or whatever) - which isn't unreasonable
[2013-02-24 13:23:25 -0500] zts: if you change the run_list to what you want to test, does it work?
[2013-02-24 13:24:11 -0500] poseid: good idea
[2013-02-24 13:24:20 -0500] poseid: I'll check
[2013-02-24 13:25:18 -0500] poseid: yes, that's actually solving my problem!
[2013-02-24 13:25:35 -0500] poseid: so, the run list does 'too much' for my simple tests
[2013-02-24 13:25:44 -0500] poseid: thank
[2013-02-24 13:26:38 -0500] zts: no problem, it's probably worth taking note of the fact that you're already doing something different to what berkshelf expects, though
[2013-02-24 13:27:02 -0500] zts: I notice the second thing on berkshelf.com says "Specify your dependencies in a Berksfile in your cookbooks root" - and your Berksfile here is not in a cookbook's root
[2013-02-24 13:27:21 -0500] zts: but anyway.  I know no more than you at this point, so I shall shut up until I've played with it more myself :)
[2013-02-24 14:20:41 -0500] jbowman: hi, does any one know of a good guide for log rotation for the various services install using the chef 11 omnibus installation method?
[2013-02-24 16:58:08 -0500] kesor: any idea why "application" cookbook does not work with attributes? I'm trying to do --  application "myapp" do  path node[:home]  end -- but it things the attribute is nil, although the "directory" resource just before application creates it (it is not nil, it is defined)
[2013-02-24 16:58:25 -0500] kesor: *thinks
[2013-02-24 16:59:25 -0500] zts: kesor: pastebin your recipe and the chef log please
[2013-02-24 17:00:05 -0500] kesor: zts: guess i'll need to create a smaller version of it first :/
[2013-02-24 17:03:19 -0500] zts: kesor: well, reducing your problem to the smallest example is always helpful to others (and sometimes helps you stumble upon the answer yourself)
[2013-02-24 17:03:28 -0500] kesor: zts: yep, doing it now.
[2013-02-24 17:15:12 -0500] kesor: why uploading to a chef server takes so long? :(
[2013-02-24 17:36:48 -0500] jfl0wers: hello
[2013-02-24 17:37:05 -0500] jfl0wers: Looking for a pointer on using Berkshelf
[2013-02-24 17:37:19 -0500] jfl0wers: how do you use it with chef-solo
[2013-02-24 17:38:29 -0500] jfl0wers: I understand that there is a vagrant plugin
[2013-02-24 17:38:44 -0500] jfl0wers: but I want to use chef-solo on my host OS
[2013-02-24 18:26:02 -0500] stathyinc: LWRP's - Is there a way in the resource def, to assign a default value for an attribute based on the value of a prev defined one?
[2013-02-24 19:59:42 -0500] kaiyou: hey guys, I am pretty sure I am going to die (way too young) tonight because of a Chef server configuration, should I just shoot with my question before I keep going with my last will ? :D
[2013-02-24 20:00:09 -0500] Mithrandir: kaiyou: don't ask to ask
[2013-02-24 20:01:10 -0500] kaiyou: perfect then :) I am setting up a very basic self-hosted chef server configuration on Debian Wheezy with packages from Opscode apt repo
[2013-02-24 20:01:50 -0500] poseid: hello... why is the user in this cookbook set to root?  https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/passenger_apache2
[2013-02-24 20:02:04 -0500] kaiyou: first apt-get complains at config time when trying to start chef-server-webui, then I cannot start the webui manually because of authentication errors with the server API
[2013-02-24 20:02:07 -0500] poseid: I would like to have a vagrant user set... but confused how to do this..
[2013-02-24 20:02:41 -0500] kaiyou: finally, it appears that i cannot do anything with the validation key (chef-client, knife configure, i cannot get any key signed and recognized by chef server)
[2013-02-24 20:03:16 -0500] kaiyou: i tried and regenerated the key a couple of time, with no success
[2013-02-24 20:05:26 -0500] kaiyou: i would first try and figure out where the certificate matching validation.pem is stored in order to check private/public key consistency
[2013-02-24 20:06:36 -0500] poseid: ok, I also ask here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15056040/how-can-i-change-the-user-for-this-cookbook
[2013-02-24 20:29:56 -0500] kaiyou: mmmh, currently trying to browse my couchdb instance, no trace of any document with chef_type=client, my validation client should live in there, right?
[2013-02-24 20:31:06 -0500] kaiyou: uh, finally found it, with the public key, now checking consistency with the private key from validation.pem
[2013-02-24 20:37:26 -0500] jtimberman: kaiyou: be aware that Chef 11 is out, and a lot of the things you're learning about (locations of files, etc) are totally different.
[2013-02-24 20:38:04 -0500] kaiyou: well, ok, but there is no supported apt repo for chef 11, right?
[2013-02-24 20:48:21 -0500] jtimberman: no repo yet. packages are available from opscode.com/chef/install  . select the chef server tab
[2013-02-24 20:49:47 -0500] jtimberman: its a single package install with everything required, including erlang, postgresql etc
[2013-02-24 20:51:24 -0500] kaiyou: well, does not sound stable or supported enough for production, for now
[2013-02-24 21:15:16 -0500] poseid: ok, when I create the directory mode 775 before running the web_app recipe, it seems to work
[2013-02-24 21:26:56 -0500] poseid: hmm.. again in the apache_passenger cookbook...
[2013-02-24 21:27:35 -0500] poseid: how could i check whether apache loads passenger correctly? I get apache serving "Welcome to ..." instead of a passenger page
[2013-02-24 21:33:31 -0500] poseid: hmm.. unsure why there is no passenger line https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/passenger_apache2
[2013-02-24 21:33:44 -0500] jtimberman: kaiyou: Chef 11's package is very stable.
[2013-02-24 21:34:06 -0500] kaiyou: mmmmh, I will consider testing then, thx jtimberman :)
[2013-02-24 21:34:46 -0500] jtimberman: kaiyou: just because we're not maintaining an apt repo for it yet doesn't make it unstable. in fact, the single package "omnibus" installation is probably more stable and better/easier to support for us because we know everything about all the bits that go into it.
[2013-02-24 21:35:11 -0500] jtimberman: instead of, "what distro? what version of postgres does it have? did the maintainer turn on this that or the other option" :)
[2013-02-24 21:36:16 -0500] kaiyou: yep, I understand the benefits of packaging a bundle, yet this goes opposite to usual packaging guidelines and makes security upgrades trickier
[2013-02-24 21:37:19 -0500] kaiyou: I do not want to depend on opscode for upstream security patches regarding pgsql for instance
[2013-02-24 21:38:16 -0500] blackstar257: If there any cookbooks for junos?
[2013-02-24 21:38:18 -0500] blackstar257: or juniper gear?
[2013-02-24 21:39:04 -0500] cwj: jtimberman: is there a timeline on opscode baseboxes w/ chef 11? i see someone opened BENTO-23 about it on tuesday.
[2013-02-24 21:45:59 -0500] jtimberman: cwj: there are 11.2.0 boxes in the bucket.
[2013-02-24 21:46:06 -0500] jtimberman: cwj: i'll update teh readme :)
[2013-02-24 21:46:16 -0500] cwj: i'll buy you a beer :)
[2013-02-24 21:46:24 -0500] jtimberman: i'll be at mwrc!
[2013-02-24 21:46:26 -0500] jtimberman: ;)
[2013-02-24 21:46:29 -0500] cwj: done
[2013-02-24 21:46:32 -0500] jtimberman: :D
[2013-02-24 21:46:46 -0500] jtimberman: just s/10.18.2/11.2.0/ in the URLs in the readme and there ya go
[2013-02-24 21:47:09 -0500] cwj: i will be there for the devops track, pimping the DevOpsUT meetup
[2013-02-24 21:48:14 -0500] jtimberman: pushed
[2013-02-24 21:48:17 -0500] jtimberman: nice
[2013-02-24 21:51:15 -0500] martinisoft: what about 11.4 ?
[2013-02-24 21:51:28 -0500] martinisoft: or is 11.2 close enough?
[2013-02-24 21:55:44 -0500] cwj: martinisoft: as long as the box's omnibus installed json gem doesn't get upgraded, i assume it is fine
[2013-02-24 21:56:17 -0500] cwj: to my knowledge changes in 11.4.0 and 10.22.0 were primarily dealing with changes in json 1.7.7
[2013-02-24 22:04:24 -0500] jpadilla: hey guys quick question, I'm trying to install postgresql::server_debian and I'm running into the following error
[2013-02-24 22:04:33 -0500] jpadilla: FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::Exec: package[postgresql-client] (postgresql::client line 32) had an error: Chef::Exceptions::Exec: apt-get -q -y install postgresql-client=9.1+129 returned 100, expected 0
[2013-02-24 22:10:38 -0500] jtimberman: cwj: correct
[2013-02-24 22:10:55 -0500] jtimberman: jpadilla: did you run 'apt-get update' prior?
[2013-02-24 22:11:10 -0500] jpadilla: jtimberman, I did not
[2013-02-24 22:11:41 -0500] jtimberman: jpadilla: i'd use the apt cookbook from opscode, put recipe[apt] in your node's run list
[2013-02-24 22:13:36 -0500] jpadilla: jtimberman, I'll give that a try
[2013-02-24 22:14:10 -0500] mswart: what is the best way to check whether a data bag exists?
[2013-02-24 22:14:54 -0500] jtimberman: mswart: in a recipe?
[2013-02-24 22:14:59 -0500] mswart: yes
[2013-02-24 22:15:53 -0500] poseid: hmm.. I get an error:  Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - bundle install --path=vendor/bundle --deployment --without development test cucumber staging
[2013-02-24 22:16:16 -0500] poseid: how could I debug this?
[2013-02-24 22:16:35 -0500] blacksta_: Does anyone know if there is a junos/juniper cookbook for chef?
[2013-02-24 22:17:19 -0500] mswart: jtimberman: chef-client raises a Net::HTTPServerException which a could catch but i would like to support chef solo, too. i could try to access the data bag an catch all errors. but i hope there is a better solution
[2013-02-24 22:17:48 -0500] jtimberman: https://gist.github.com/jtimberman/5025962
[2013-02-24 22:18:41 -0500] mswart: thx
[2013-02-24 22:18:48 -0500] jtimberman: blacksta_: i don't know of one.
[2013-02-24 22:19:08 -0500] jtimberman: gotta run
[2013-02-24 22:52:57 -0500] maek: anyone using joyent? is it possible to change /etc/resolv.conf with metadata?
[2013-02-24 22:53:18 -0500] fleish: I'm trying to figure out a way to run a single cookbook recipe on a node. I believe the way to do this is with shef, but am having trouble figuring out the method to achieve this
[2013-02-24 22:53:32 -0500] maek: fleish: in shef?
[2013-02-24 22:53:58 -0500] fleish: maek: I think shef is the only way to make this happen, but I've not used it much before so I could be wrong
[2013-02-24 22:54:11 -0500] maek: so you want to run a single recipe on a node?
[2013-02-24 22:54:21 -0500] maek: but then have it go back to its original run list?
[2013-02-24 22:57:49 -0500] fleish: kind of. I've got some nodes that have chef-client disabled from running regularly b/c they have been hacked up and running chef breaks the hacks. but occasionally I want to push a change to these machines and since I can't turn chef-client back on in full, I'd like to just be able to tell them to run this one recipe one time and not touch anything else
[2013-02-24 22:58:24 -0500] maek: fleish: thats easy
[2013-02-24 22:58:45 -0500] maek: 1 sec
[2013-02-24 22:59:07 -0500] maek: {"run_list":["recipe[apache2::default]"]}
[2013-02-24 22:59:10 -0500] maek: make a file
[2013-02-24 22:59:14 -0500] maek: called runlist.json
[2013-02-24 22:59:27 -0500] maek: put that in it with the recipe you want to run
[2013-02-24 22:59:28 -0500] maek: and then do
[2013-02-24 22:59:33 -0500] maek: chef-client -j runlist.json
[2013-02-24 22:59:47 -0500] maek: assuming that cookbook::recipe is on the chef server
[2013-02-24 22:59:51 -0500] maek: you should be good
[2013-02-24 22:59:59 -0500] maek: the down side of this is that it will replace the runlist
[2013-02-24 23:00:10 -0500] maek: of the node object on the chef server with that run list
[2013-02-24 23:02:28 -0500] fleish: hm, that's why I figured shef was the way to go. I thought it could do a one time run of something without changing anything on the server side
[2013-02-24 23:03:02 -0500] kallistec: fleish: use the `-o` option
[2013-02-24 23:04:04 -0500] fleish: kallistec: to chef-client ? so chef-client -o -j runlist.json ?
[2013-02-24 23:04:34 -0500] kallistec: fleish: just spell it out on the command line
[2013-02-24 23:04:42 -0500] kallistec: chef-client -o role[foo]
[2013-02-24 23:05:10 -0500] kallistec: (probably need quotes if your shell uses square brackets, e.g. zsh)
[2013-02-24 23:07:30 -0500] fleish: oh, so chef-client -o "[cookbook::recipe]"
[2013-02-24 23:08:28 -0500] fleish: will run cookbook::recipe for that one run ... and all other chef-client runs will continue to get the regular/full run list off the server?
[2013-02-24 23:10:13 -0500] fleish: correction, chef-client -o "recipe[cookbook::recipe]" ... seems to do the trick, thanks!
