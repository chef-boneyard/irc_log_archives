[2013-01-12 02:27:22 -0500] sascha_d: evening Chefs
[2013-01-12 02:28:39 -0500] sascha_d: about a year ago, I wrote a recipe with a template block that looked for templates dropped from outside the cookbook. It was executed with Chef solo. I tried to write a similar block this week using chef client, and it failed miserably.  Is this part of the overlay deprecation or am I doing it wrong?
[2013-01-12 02:55:36 -0500] paulmooring: sascha_d: something like 'source /file/on/the/fs'?
[2013-01-12 02:55:46 -0500] sascha_d: yessir
[2013-01-12 02:56:38 -0500] sascha_d: currently I have a ternary that sets a source variable by looking in the external dir first and then going back to the cookbook if nothing is there
[2013-01-12 02:57:11 -0500] paulmooring: I've never tried such a thing but I'm curious so I'm gonna take a look at the code
[2013-01-12 02:57:46 -0500] tamouse__: i don't know why that wouldn't work...
[2013-01-12 02:57:56 -0500] tamouse__: the external dir is already on the target node?
[2013-01-12 02:58:37 -0500] sascha_d: like I said, it did work with Chef solo but I haven't tried it in almost a year
[2013-01-12 02:58:39 -0500] tamouse__: my  stuff certainly has access
[2013-01-12 02:58:50 -0500] tamouse__: as it's putting files out there
[2013-01-12 02:58:52 -0500] paulmooring: sascha_d: trie 'local true'
[2013-01-12 02:58:53 -0500] tamouse__: obvsiously
[2013-01-12 02:59:02 -0500] sascha_d: in the template block?
[2013-01-12 02:59:25 -0500] paulmooring: yeah there's a local attribute for a template resource
[2013-01-12 02:59:32 -0500] sascha_d: I completely forgot about that
[2013-01-12 02:59:34 -0500] sascha_d: <3
[2013-01-12 02:59:36 -0500] paulmooring: and did I seriously just spell try trie?
[2013-01-12 02:59:44 -0500] sascha_d: haha
[2013-01-12 02:59:53 -0500] sascha_d: as long as you're communicating
[2013-01-12 03:00:28 -0500] paulmooring: it's been a long week :(
[2013-01-12 03:00:38 -0500] sascha_d: I told jtimberberman he was "doing it write" on Twitter the other day. Embarrassing.
[2013-01-12 03:00:45 -0500] sascha_d: timberberman
[2013-01-12 03:00:46 -0500] sascha_d: :)
[2013-01-12 03:00:51 -0500] sascha_d: and I'm not even tired
[2013-01-12 03:05:11 -0500] paulmooring: did the local attr work for you?
[2013-01-12 03:05:25 -0500] paulmooring: I'm a little suprised I've never had that come up
[2013-01-12 03:27:31 -0500] sascha_d: @paulmooring totally werked
[2013-01-12 03:27:37 -0500] sascha_d: you get hero of the day award
[2013-01-12 03:28:47 -0500] sascha_d: the funkiest part is because the devs wanted it in a remote artifact which gets expanded on the server at deployment time, so I had to set up a notfiy from the artifact retrieval block to avoid having the template try to execute without any erb file there yet
[2013-01-12 03:29:40 -0500] sascha_d: and as I finished typing that I wonder, what is my life? I'm not sure I approve of my solution
[2013-01-12 10:45:12 -0500] shredder12: hi everyone. I've run into a problem with solr indexer. The library on the client updates a node variable in order to register a service, but it doesn't seem to be getting indexed. Any suggestions?
[2013-01-12 10:46:05 -0500] shredder12: here is the code responsible for updating the attribute https://github.com/vmware-serengeti/serengeti-pantry/blob/master/cookbooks/cluster_service_discovery/libraries/cluster_service_discovery.rb#L141
[2013-01-12 13:48:08 -0500] hagzag: hi guys, trying to use the omnibus install on ubutnu 12.10 and getting the following error:
[2013-01-12 13:48:13 -0500] hagzag: curl: (51) SSL: certificate subject name '*.opscode.com' does not match target
[2013-01-12 13:49:42 -0500] hagzag: anyone ?
[2013-01-12 13:50:20 -0500] specialsauce: sorry, not familiar with omnibus installer. is it a simple script? if so just edit it and add "-k" to curl to skip cert checks
[2013-01-12 14:07:29 -0500] zts: uh, I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you're able to verify the download in some other way (checksum of the package, for example)
[2013-01-12 14:10:42 -0500] specialsauce: well yeah, if you downloaded your omnibus installer from warez.com yuo're probably got bigger issues. if you downloaded it from opscode, you probably don't have to worry too much about this
[2013-01-12 14:11:22 -0500] specialsauce: but i get your point, sometimes offering assistance is like handing a knife to a sprinting toddler
[2013-01-12 14:13:10 -0500] zts: sure, my point is that failing a certificate name check is a red flag that you /may/ be downloading from warez.com.  If you're confident that you're downloading from a trusted source that happens to have screwed up something harmless, disabling the check is indeed appropriate
[2013-01-12 14:17:36 -0500] gyre008: does anyone know why am I getting the following error when running berkshelf ? https://gist.github.com/4518238
[2013-01-12 14:18:19 -0500] gyre008: i can see that I have both versions of json gem installed...should I remove one of them ?
[2013-01-12 14:27:13 -0500] workmad3: zts: a.k.a. if you turn off the certificate verification, you could be securely communicating with a man-in-the-middle attack
[2013-01-12 14:28:13 -0500] specialsauce: workmad3: even with certificate verification on you can be party to man in the middle with SSL
[2013-01-12 14:28:58 -0500] workmad3: specialsauce: true, but it requires you to be trusting a non-trustworthy CA
[2013-01-12 14:29:00 -0500] specialsauce: common misconception
[2013-01-12 14:30:35 -0500] specialsauce: workmad3, depending on your device these days, even that doesn't hold true/is out of your control - see recent reports on nokia
[2013-01-12 14:31:02 -0500] specialsauce: anyway, this is more #ssl than #chef :-)
[2013-01-12 14:46:39 -0500] gyre008: I cant believe how useless knife ssh plugin is when you are in Rackspace cloud...tons of issues reported and none of them work...anyone got this working ??
[2013-01-12 15:44:44 -0500] mattt: which cookbook is best to handle iptables rules ?
[2013-01-12 16:25:02 -0500] countdigi: ls -al
[2013-01-12 16:25:03 -0500] countdigi: clear
[2013-01-12 16:25:15 -0500] countdigi: lol .. sorry
[2013-01-12 16:25:17 -0500] mattt: :P
[2013-01-12 16:25:28 -0500] mattt: gewd jarb
[2013-01-12 16:25:42 -0500] countdigi: messing w/ my hotkeys in wm - focus too efficient :-)
[2013-01-12 17:13:37 -0500] jhayden: Hey chefsters! In a recipe, is it possible to loop through the files section and perform an action with each file?
[2013-01-12 17:19:54 -0500] Guest85992: when adding recipes to an app
[2013-01-12 17:20:26 -0500] Guest85992: is it best to include in recipes/my_app.rb such as
[2013-01-12 17:20:28 -0500] Guest85992: include_recipe "apache2::mod_php5"
[2013-01-12 17:20:50 -0500] Guest85992: or in roles.rb such as
[2013-01-12 17:21:08 -0500] Guest85992: all_env = [   "recipe[apache2::mod_php5]", etc... ]
[2013-01-12 17:21:11 -0500] Guest85992: or both?
[2013-01-12 17:21:22 -0500] countdigi: jhayden: what do u mean by files section?
[2013-01-12 17:21:57 -0500] jhayden: the files section in the cookbook
[2013-01-12 17:22:03 -0500] Guest85992: and i meant roles/my_app.rb
[2013-01-12 17:22:24 -0500] countdigi: ah i see right cookbook_files - had a brain fart
[2013-01-12 17:22:59 -0500] jhayden: countdigi: I am having multiple ones right now! ;-)
[2013-01-12 17:24:25 -0500] countdigi: jhayden: im not sure off hand - if it was chef solo it would be easy to hack since all info is on disk on the node
[2013-01-12 17:25:00 -0500] countdigi: probably somewhere in the chef context object im hoping
[2013-01-12 17:28:54 -0500] zts: jhayden: what kind of action do you want to do with each file?
[2013-01-12 17:29:39 -0500] jhayden: I have base config files installed via cookbook_file resource
[2013-01-12 17:30:09 -0500] jhayden: I then could have have extra files (unknown amount) to cat onto existing files
[2013-01-12 17:30:25 -0500] jhayden: I would like to loop through list
[2013-01-12 17:30:39 -0500] jhayden: read file name and cat to existing file
[2013-01-12 17:32:32 -0500] zts: jhayden: I understand, I think that's possible, but perhaps not simple.  One approach could be to use remote_directory to copy the extra files from your files directory somewhere on the node
[2013-01-12 17:32:56 -0500] zts: jhayden: then notify another resource (like a script or ruby_block) that cats them all onto the other file
[2013-01-12 17:33:19 -0500] zts: jhayden: one problem with that is that Chef will end up doing it every time it runs
[2013-01-12 17:36:39 -0500] zts: Guest85992: my rule of thumb is to use include_recipe when one recipe absolutely requires the other.  If it's an optional dependency, I compose using roles.
[2013-01-12 17:37:39 -0500] zts: Guest85992: always using roles gives you extra flexibility (eg, to fork the dependencies without changing the dependent recipe), but it can be a bit more complex
[2013-01-12 17:46:20 -0500] Guest85992: <zts> is there a problem with including in both spots?  for example, mod_php5
[2013-01-12 17:46:51 -0500] DanR_e: I'm trying to learn chef.  Starting with quickstart with Hosted Chef and EC2.  I think I have a working workstation with chef-server and chef-client (not fully tested though). When I follow the quickstart instructions in a cloneed chef-repo (from opscode) and issue the command "knife cookbook site install COOKBOOKS", I get an error of" Object you are looking for could not be found".  Is this...
[2013-01-12 17:46:53 -0500] DanR_e: ...because file is missing at opscode.com?  What shoud I do to get initial cookbooks locally?
[2013-01-12 17:51:29 -0500] DanR_e: Opps, that should read "COOKBOOK", not "COOKBOOKS" above.
[2013-01-12 17:52:55 -0500] juliancdunn: DanR_e: you should replace "COOKBOOKS" with the name of an actual cookbook
[2013-01-12 17:53:54 -0500] zts: Guest85992: no, that's fine.  include_recipe makes sure that a recipe is on the run list - if that recipe is already there, it doesn't need to do anything
[2013-01-12 17:54:14 -0500] Guest85992: THANKS1
[2013-01-12 17:54:19 -0500] juliancdunn: DanR_e: a good one to get started with is... "getting-started", so do "knife cookbook site install getting-started"
[2013-01-12 17:59:42 -0500] DanR_e: Julian: Thanks, I'll try that.  Off to lunch first.  Fingers crossed.  hope that works.
[2013-01-12 18:26:27 -0500] DanR_e: Julian: Thanks again for your help.  "knife cookbook site install getting-started" worked without a hitch.  It put appropriate new cookbooks in a 'getting-started' folder within 'cookbooks'.
[2013-01-12 19:47:17 -0500] juliancdunn: DanR_e: no problem
[2013-01-12 23:59:52 -0500] clizzin: if i want my cookbook to depend on a gem, how would i do that?  specifically, i'm interested in having my cookbook pull creds out of an encrypted data bag and write them out to a configuration file in a format called EDN, which depends on an edn gem.
