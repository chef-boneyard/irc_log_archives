[2013-01-06 00:08:11 -0500] tightwork: how does knife-windows work in conjunction with knife-openstack?  I am trying to deploy windows instances from openstack. I may need both?
[2013-01-06 00:48:21 -0500] shamanime: Hello guys, I saw on the logs this was questioned a couple days ago but couldn't find the exact when to read the history. Trying to install 'nginx::source' fails with the error: undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass, /etc/chef/cookbooks/nginx/recipes/ohai_plugin.rb:27:in `from_file'. I can't find what I am doing wrong.
[2013-01-06 00:51:09 -0500] tightwork: shamanime: the file does not exist?
[2013-01-06 00:51:23 -0500] tightwork: shamanime: so its looping through a nil variable and dying
[2013-01-06 01:00:55 -0500] shamanime: tightwork: oh, it didn't download it automatically... managed to fix and learned something new... need to throw dependencies on the chef folder.
[2013-01-06 01:29:27 -0500] amccloud: anyway to reset my hosted chef server? I've locked myself out somehow.
[2013-01-06 01:32:41 -0500] amccloud: or even delete it

[2013-01-06 01:37:49 -0500] amccloud: zuhaib: Hey I saw in the irc log that you've had the same issue i'm having. Did you ever resolve it?
[2013-01-06 01:51:47 -0500] zuhaib: amccloud:? Oh with hosted chef
[2013-01-06 01:51:56 -0500] amccloud: zuhaib: yup
[2013-01-06 01:52:12 -0500] amccloud: permission denied issue
[2013-01-06 01:52:13 -0500] zuhaib: amccloud: any chance you created a client/node that is the same as your username
[2013-01-06 01:52:17 -0500] amccloud: I did
[2013-01-06 01:52:27 -0500] zuhaib: turns out you cant do that anymore on hosted chef
[2013-01-06 01:52:47 -0500] zuhaib: i contact their support and they deleted the bad node
[2013-01-06 01:53:24 -0500] tightwork: this is crazy arg
[2013-01-06 01:53:36 -0500] amccloud: Ah dang okay. Was hoping it was something I can fix on my own.

[2013-01-06 01:54:59 -0500] zuhaib: also make sure all your cookies and cached are clear if you are able to remove the client client
[2013-01-06 01:55:21 -0500] zuhaib: they should add some protection code to prevent you from naming a client the same as your username on hosted chef
[2013-01-06 07:30:31 -0500] WPsites: I'm trying to use the ufw cookbook but I'm having trouble adding rules to the node. They just don't take effect!? any roles set in roles are applied without a problem. Any ideas? http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/ufw
[2013-01-06 08:06:33 -0500] WPsites: How do you even create "override attributes applied on a node directly"? If I try and add an override element to a node it just never gets saved
[2013-01-06 10:24:08 -0500] railsraider: hi, i have roles within 2 directories, clusters and functions when i attempt to run chef solo it does not see the roles but chef-client with chef server does see all the roles how can i make chef-solo see all the roels?

[2013-01-06 17:10:41 -0500] pradeep: hey guys, quick question - can I set "default" & "override" attributes in the json file that we pass to chef-solo using -j? if yes, how can I do that?
[2013-01-06 17:20:48 -0500] cwj: pradeep: theres no such thing in solo
[2013-01-06 17:22:07 -0500] cwj: when you set attributes in the json file its analogous to editing the node attributes via knife node edit
[2013-01-06 17:23:25 -0500] cwj: you can do defaults and overrides in roles and environments
[2013-01-06 17:23:33 -0500] cwj: but not that json file
[2013-01-06 17:25:33 -0500] pradeep: cwj: thanks for the answer, you are correct and https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/node.rb#L280 confirms it
[2013-01-06 17:30:17 -0500] cwj: no problem

[2013-01-06 21:42:10 -0500] cheflevelramen: Hi Everyone. Hope you are all having a good weekend. I have question on how to best manage yum/chef. I've set up a cookbook to do a 'yum update' on initial boot, and that's working fine. Problem is is that the update updates the kernel, which requires restarting the server. When I restart, chef no-longer functions properly and gives me strange kernel error output. I imagine I need to reinstall/recompile chef after updating the
[2013-01-06 22:11:04 -0500] Cope: cheflevelramen: could you show the error output?
[2013-01-06 22:21:19 -0500] q54321: Howdy, newbie here. Installed chef-solo for first time, but got an error: 4:06:18-06:00] FATAL: Mixlib::ShellOut::CommandTimeout: java_ark[jdk] (java::oracle line 57) had an error: Mixlib::\
[2013-01-06 22:21:20 -0500] q54321: ShellOut::CommandTimeout: command timed out:
[2013-01-06 22:23:43 -0500] Cope: q54321: are you on a slow connection?
[2013-01-06 22:23:54 -0500] Cope: q54321: if so the curl command that the ark provider runs will time out
[2013-01-06 22:31:43 -0500] q54321: k, thx, will retry.
[2013-01-06 22:34:13 -0500] cheflevelramen: Cope: sorry I was away. Here's the error output after updating the kernel:
[2013-01-06 22:34:15 -0500] cheflevelramen: http://pastebin.com/LMPxfFPW
[2013-01-06 22:34:48 -0500] cheflevelramen: Cope: Funny thing is, sometimes chef runs fine (with that out output) and other times it fails (need to regenerate that error).
[2013-01-06 22:35:32 -0500] cheflevelramen: Cope: kernel updated from 3.2.30-49.59.amzn1.x86_64 to 3.2.34-55.46.amzn1.x86_64
[2013-01-06 22:40:31 -0500] cheflevelramen: Cope: I believe I just need to update chef, but I can't seem to find out how. My startup process was to use knife ec2 server create to create the server, which automatically installed chef. So from that point, I'm not sure how to uninstall/reinstall or upgrade
[2013-01-06 22:41:29 -0500] chip-: cheflevelramen: drop this on your evernote or similar: "curl -L http://opscode.com/chef/install.sh | sh"
[2013-01-06 22:41:51 -0500] chip-: (assuming your bootstrap from knife ec2 server create was recent, and Chef installed to /opt/chef, rather than to system gems)
[2013-01-06 22:47:36 -0500] cheflevelramen: chip: Thanks, I tried that and it installed successfully, but now `chef-client` doesn't return anything (not found). Do you know where it get's installed to?
[2013-01-06 22:50:06 -0500] chip-: cheflevelramen: should be in /opt/chef/bin
[2013-01-06 22:50:16 -0500] chip-: Should also have symlinked to your path
[2013-01-06 22:50:22 -0500] chip-: did you run it with root privilege?
[2013-01-06 22:52:13 -0500] cheflevelramen: chip: yep, you're right. Looks like it still produces the same kernel output, though I can see chef was indeed upgraded (INFO: *** Chef 10.16.4 *** vs INFO: *** Chef 10.16.0 ***)
[2013-01-06 22:53:48 -0500] amccloud: I'm having this issue where knife cookbook upload gets a sandbox error the first time I try to upload any cookbook. https://gist.github.com/20289f610d0cd846c9fb
[2013-01-06 22:55:06 -0500] cheflevelramen: chip: so looks like upgrading chef didn't fix the kernel issue. When updating kernels on a machine, do you find it's usually necessary to reinstall chef?
[2013-01-06 22:57:06 -0500] chip-: Nope, not usually.
[2013-01-06 22:58:09 -0500] cheflevelramen: chip: but you've been able to update the kernel before
[2013-01-06 23:02:35 -0500] chip-: Oh sure. The Chef client isn't dependent on any kernel modules.
[2013-01-06 23:03:24 -0500] cheflevelramen: chip: Hmm, maybe it was another package then that was updated, like Ruby or a library. I'll try isolating the kernel update and see if I still get the output
[2013-01-06 23:24:43 -0500] Cope: cheflevelramen: heh, I was also away.
[2013-01-06 23:26:03 -0500] Cope: cheflevelramen: not sure I am understanding what I am seeing.  Could you paste a full chef run?
[2013-01-06 23:26:06 -0500] chip-: cheflevelramen: If 'which chef' is returning /opt/chef/bin, then it's using a ruby that's at /opt/chef/embedded/bin.
[2013-01-06 23:54:13 -0500] Cope: chip-: right there
