[2013-01-27 00:18:58 -0500] coderanger: deed02392: Ruby's base64 library inserts newlines every 80 characters
[2013-01-27 00:19:12 -0500] coderanger: It is moot because \n is ignored during base64 decode, but thats a thing
[2013-01-27 01:27:50 -0500] serversideup: Hey all. Anyone having issues with the Apache2 cookbook? When I deploy it on a brand new Ubuntu 12.04 machine, I am getting this error:
[2013-01-27 01:27:51 -0500] serversideup: [2013-01-26T19:23:47-06:00] FATAL: Could not load Moneta back end "BasicFile"

[2013-01-27 01:28:07 -0500] serversideup: cannot load such file -- chef/monkey_patches/moneta
[2013-01-27 01:29:11 -0500] coderanger: serversideup: How did you install chef?
[2013-01-27 01:29:37 -0500] coderanger: That was an issue with gem-based installs a few versions ago
[2013-01-27 01:30:13 -0500] serversideup: I did this: sudo true && curl -L https://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh | sudo bash
[2013-01-27 01:30:17 -0500] coderanger: (moneta released a backwards-incompatible verison and our gemspec was too optimistic)
[2013-01-27 01:30:27 -0500] coderanger: Okay, so you should have an omnibus install
[2013-01-27 01:30:36 -0500] serversideup: My client is Chef 10.18.2
[2013-01-27 01:32:18 -0500] serversideup: Here is my run list: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13033256/RunList.png
[2013-01-27 01:32:45 -0500] coderanger: Can you pastebin the full traceback?
[2013-01-27 01:34:08 -0500] serversideup: http://pastebin.com/zWRGWJJh
[2013-01-27 01:35:30 -0500] coderanger: serversideup: You need a -l debug to get the full error, or /srv/chef/file_store/chef-stacktrace.out
[2013-01-27 01:37:29 -0500] coderanger: It looks like you have heavily customized your chef install though
[2013-01-27 01:37:33 -0500] coderanger: just from the paths in use
[2013-01-27 01:37:44 -0500] coderanger: So check that you aren't invoking moneta somewhere still
[2013-01-27 01:37:55 -0500] serversideup: I didn't change any of the cookbooks. There were all default I believe
[2013-01-27 01:39:13 -0500] serversideup: Here is the chef-stacktrace.out file : http://pastebin.com/jrMGh1D6
[2013-01-27 01:39:30 -0500] serversideup: SHould I try downloading the cookbooks again and reuploading them?
[2013-01-27 01:40:06 -0500] coderanger: That is the trace for a different exception
[2013-01-27 01:40:36 -0500] serversideup: How should I run the debug command? I ran vagrant up to start (sorry, this is my first experience with Chef)
[2013-01-27 01:41:25 -0500] coderanger: Are you using the vagrant provisioning stuff?
[2013-01-27 01:41:42 -0500] coderanger: Because that might explain this, vagrant ships with an older version of Chef I think
[2013-01-27 01:41:49 -0500] coderanger: the default baseboxes do anyway
[2013-01-27 01:42:21 -0500] coderanger: You might have two different chef installs
[2013-01-27 01:42:27 -0500] coderanger: but /srv/chef is definitely not a standard path
[2013-01-27 01:42:32 -0500] coderanger: so something you did is very non-standard
[2013-01-27 01:43:18 -0500] coderanger: what is the omnibus_updater cookbook?
[2013-01-27 01:44:38 -0500] serversideup: I found that from one of the Chef community leaders on his tutorials. I thought it was for updating Chef
[2013-01-27 01:45:07 -0500] coderanger: It looks like it is from heavywater, so I can't comment about if it does anything weird
[2013-01-27 01:45:12 -0500] coderanger: but check if you have two chef-client installs
[2013-01-27 01:46:46 -0500] serversideup: On my Macbook (the host)? For the guest, I created my own box and exported it with the "sudo true && curl -L https://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh | sudo bash" command
[2013-01-27 01:47:11 -0500] serversideup: Here is my Vagrant file: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13033256/Vagrantfile.txt
[2013-01-27 01:48:33 -0500] jtimberman: serversideup: we have published vagrant baseboxes that include chef 10.18.2: http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef-dev/2013-01/msg00039.html
[2013-01-27 01:48:36 -0500] velosa: Hi!  I'm a chef/vagrant newbie.  I'm trying to use the rvm::system recipe  and it's stalling when 'Building rvm_ruby'.  Not sure how to debug.
[2013-01-27 01:50:05 -0500] serversideup: Thanks timber man, I'll try the same recipes and it and see if it fixes it
[2013-01-27 01:51:03 -0500] dyer: Question, anyone here happen to be using the Ohai cookbook w/ Chef-Solo & Vagrant ?
[2013-01-27 02:08:20 -0500] coderanger: serversideup: I would drop the omnibus_updater thing for now too
[2013-01-27 02:08:35 -0500] serversideup: Thanks code ranger I will give that a try
[2013-01-27 02:28:55 -0500] serversideup: coderanger: That omnibus_updater was the issue! Thanks for your help
[2013-01-27 02:29:27 -0500] serversideup: It was trying to install an older version when I already had a newer one installed
[2013-01-27 02:46:26 -0500] coderanger: :)
[2013-01-27 03:36:54 -0500] dyer: Is there any way to force a reload of all the attributes in a chef run
[2013-01-27 03:42:28 -0500] dyer: I am using the Ohai cookbook to add an ohai plugin but that plugin isnt loaded the first time until well after the attributes file are loaded
[2013-01-27 03:42:48 -0500] dyer: wondering if there is a way to restart the run somehow, or reload the attributes
[2013-01-27 03:50:24 -0500] jtimberman: velosa: looks like it is a pretty hairy issue that fnichol is working to fix w/ rvm folks: https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm/issues/157#issuecomment-12747030
[2013-01-27 03:52:01 -0500] maek: jtimberman: hi, hello. can you provide a possibly better way to do this " log("node[:celery][:version] must be set to use install_type 'source'") { level :fatal } if node[:celery][:version] == nil " ?
[2013-01-27 03:52:09 -0500] maek: and is there a way I can make that log statement stop the chef run
[2013-01-27 03:52:26 -0500] jtimberman: maek: use raise or Chef::Application.fatal!
[2013-01-27 03:52:27 -0500] maek: right now it dies to the problem that missing attribute causes.
[2013-01-27 03:52:40 -0500] velosa: jtimberman: Thanks!  Didn't find that in my google searches.  Looks like a fresh issue which probably explains why it was working a few weeks ago.
[2013-01-27 03:53:00 -0500] maek: jtimberman: thanks!
[2013-01-27 03:53:22 -0500] maek: jtimberman: is one 'better' then the other?
[2013-01-27 03:54:00 -0500] jtimberman: maek: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14290397/how-do-you-abort-end-a-chef-run/14294011#14294011
[2013-01-27 03:54:50 -0500] maek: thank you google :( sorry.
[2013-01-27 03:55:20 -0500] jtimberman: np
[2013-01-27 03:55:29 -0500] jtimberman: i just provided that answer recently :)
[2013-01-27 03:55:59 -0500] maek: and what an answer, thank!
[2013-01-27 03:56:02 -0500] maek: thanks, even.
[2013-01-27 03:57:22 -0500] maek: jtimberman: Another approach is to use Chef::Application.fatal!. This logs a fatal message to the Chef logger and STDERR, and exits the application. You can also give it a return code (maybe you have a script that checks those?).   can you elaborate on that? like if a script is watching the exit status of the chef-client to do x y or z based on exit code?
[2013-01-27 03:57:56 -0500] dyer: jtimberman, question for you if you have a second I am trying to use your ohai cookbook to distribute a plugin and it doesnt seem to be working like I would expect it   I am trying to get this plugin into context before attributes are loaded.. is that possible somehow ?
[2013-01-27 04:07:29 -0500] jtimberman: maek: yeah probably.
[2013-01-27 04:07:30 -0500] jtimberman: :)
[2013-01-27 04:08:05 -0500] jtimberman: dyer: if you're distributing the plugin with chef, and want to use it in the same run you'd have to use the ohai resource to reload that plugin
[2013-01-27 04:08:16 -0500] jtimberman: dyer: our nginx cookbook does that in its ohai recipe
[2013-01-27 04:08:41 -0500] dyer: isnt the ohai cookbook itself supposed to be doing that ?
[2013-01-27 04:09:37 -0500] jtimberman: maybe..
[2013-01-27 04:10:43 -0500] dyer: so here is my problem..  I see it loading the plugin at the start of the chef run, but its well after all the chef attributes files have been loaded
[2013-01-27 04:11:15 -0500] jtimberman: oh - yeah, you'd have to do it in a recipe, it won't be available in an attributes file.
[2013-01-27 04:11:32 -0500] dyer: I am not sure I understand that last comment
[2013-01-27 04:11:33 -0500] jtimberman: this is a case of "is it possible? yes. is it easy? probably not."
[2013-01-27 04:12:01 -0500] jtimberman: don't use the custom plugin's attributes in your cookbook's attributes file(s) to set attributes, do that in a recipe instead.
[2013-01-27 04:12:33 -0500] dyer: oh, one more question
[2013-01-27 04:12:46 -0500] dyer: is there a default path for ohai plugins ?
[2013-01-27 04:16:57 -0500] jtimberman: dyer: yeah... https://github.com/opscode/ohai/blob/master/lib/ohai/config.rb#L39
[2013-01-27 04:17:08 -0500] jtimberman: the plugins directory in the ohai installed location
[2013-01-27 04:31:31 -0500] dyer: hrm
[2013-01-27 04:31:32 -0500] dyer: ok ty
[2013-01-27 04:32:00 -0500] dyer: I think I am going to submit a pull request to Mitchell to ohai_plugins_path in Vagrant
[2013-01-27 04:32:52 -0500] jtimberman: is there ohai_plugins_path in chef itself?
[2013-01-27 04:33:03 -0500] jtimberman: that'd be handy to pass that off too
[2013-01-27 04:33:20 -0500] dyer: you can put it in the the client.rb / solo.rb
[2013-01-27 04:33:40 -0500] dyer: Ohai::Config[:plugin_path] << "/somewhere"
[2013-01-27 04:35:28 -0500] jtimberman: right
[2013-01-27 04:35:32 -0500] jtimberman: but, handy dsl helpers :)
[2013-01-27 04:35:40 -0500] dyer: I am not sure I follow :(
[2013-01-27 04:40:32 -0500] jtimberman: ohai_plugin_path is nicer to write than Ohai::Config[:plugin_path]
[2013-01-27 04:40:44 -0500] jtimberman: thinking from a non-Rubyist perspective
[2013-01-27 04:52:56 -0500] dyer: ah, IC ur point
[2013-01-27 10:25:10 -0500] deed02392: anyone understand more the encrypted_data_bag_secret setting in knife.rb?
[2013-01-27 10:25:19 -0500] deed02392: the docs aren't very clear about what exactly it does
[2013-01-27 12:30:12 -0500] zts: deed02392: that sure is under-documented.... http://docs.opscode.com/chef/essentials_data_bags.html says that it'll be used by 'knife bootstrap', it's not clear whether the same option is used when encrypting/decrypting databags with knife
[2013-01-27 12:31:13 -0500] zts: deed02392: it should definitely be documented here: http://docs.opscode.com/config_rb_knife.html
[2013-01-27 12:32:06 -0500] deed02392: indeed zts, I looked there already
[2013-01-27 12:32:19 -0500] deed02392: as much as i'm not sure even what path to provide, the path that knife can read from so it copies it to the server? or the path that it will be copied to on the server it's bootstrapping
[2013-01-27 12:36:34 -0500] zts: deed02392: the path that knife can read
[2013-01-27 12:36:59 -0500] zts: deed02392: the location it will be copied to on the server comes from the bootstrap template
[2013-01-27 12:37:55 -0500] deed02392: ah all right zts
[2013-01-27 12:39:42 -0500] deed02392: where's the bs template stored?
[2013-01-27 12:40:57 -0500] zts: deed02392: it depends on how you've installed chef - the default ones are inside the gem
[2013-01-27 12:41:24 -0500] deed02392: i just cloned the default repos
[2013-01-27 12:41:37 -0500] zts: deed02392: if you can find a file called 'ubuntu12.04-gems.erb', that will be in a directory with all the templates
[2013-01-27 12:41:55 -0500] deed02392: what's the gem?
[2013-01-27 12:41:57 -0500] zts: deed02392: 'chef-full.erb' will be the default template for recent knifes though
[2013-01-27 12:42:43 -0500] zts: deed02392: I think the gem is just called 'chef'
[2013-01-27 12:43:06 -0500] deed02392: oh i found it
[2013-01-27 12:43:10 -0500] deed02392: it's in /opt/chef blah blah
[2013-01-27 12:44:17 -0500] deed02392: it looks like chef expects you to use one secret for all your encrypted data bags
[2013-01-27 13:06:02 -0500] zts: deed02392: that's certainly the common case.  Search for "Access Encrypted Data from a Recipe" in http://docs.opscode.com/chef/essentials_data_bags.html for an example of specifying a non-default secret when loading a particular data-bag item
[2013-01-27 13:06:50 -0500] deed02392: gotcha zts, thanks!
[2013-01-27 13:07:33 -0500] zts: no problem
[2013-01-27 14:03:53 -0500] zooz: has anyone installed a chef server on fedora?
[2013-01-27 15:55:02 -0500] jondot`: hey guys. do you recon logrotate being a deployment task or infra (chef) task? being that a certain server can host many services
[2013-01-27 16:01:22 -0500] asdmax: hi, I have about 3k instances, chef server is very slow, how much cpu/memory  should it have?  Currently it runs on virtual server, with 6 cpu, 4gb ram and it uses only 1 chef-server-api thread (no wonder).
[2013-01-27 16:01:50 -0500] asdmax: plan is to add more threads and add these behind nginx
[2013-01-27 16:03:49 -0500] asdmax: do you guys have more suggestions to boost chef server performance?
[2013-01-27 16:18:27 -0500] kallistec: asdmax: for now, you can run more chef-server-api instances with the default `thin` webserver, or run it with unicorn
[2013-01-27 16:19:13 -0500] kallistec: Chef 11 server is waaaay faster and gives you concurrency out of the box with erlang
[2013-01-27 16:19:37 -0500] kallistec: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+11+Server+Preview
[2013-01-27 16:24:33 -0500] asdmax: it's not production ready yet?
[2013-01-27 16:26:01 -0500] kallistec: asdmax: beta, release probably in a week or so. No open bugs that I know of, but also no migration tools yet.
[2013-01-27 16:27:32 -0500] kallistec: asdmax: so, depends on your tolerance for bleeding edge
[2013-01-27 16:27:40 -0500] jondot`: kallistec: any blogpost about the various decision points in taking the erlang path (and pg/mysql) other than the 'introducing erchef' post?
[2013-01-27 16:27:47 -0500] asdmax: ok, thanks
[2013-01-27 16:28:33 -0500] cheesepl_: jondot`: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRFekZrLNas some is in the video
[2013-01-27 16:28:39 -0500] kallistec: jondot`: no blog posts. Seth Falcon and Kevin Smith have done presentations
[2013-01-27 16:28:50 -0500] cheesepl_: ha, great timing
[2013-01-27 16:29:11 -0500] jondot`: ah thanks, this should be awesome to see
[2013-01-27 16:29:52 -0500] cheesepl_: jondot`: my takeaway was couch didn't fit the usage patterns and Ruby/Merb is a memory hog ;)
[2013-01-27 16:29:53 -0500] kallistec: I'm looking into rounding up some team members to do some "Chef 11 preview" blog posts similar to what we did for 0.10
[2013-01-27 16:30:56 -0500] kallistec: cheesepl_ && jondot` pretty much, yeah. Couch doesn't work so well with write-heavy loads
[2013-01-27 16:31:09 -0500] cheesepl_: it also GROWS
[2013-01-27 16:31:23 -0500] jondot`: i will keep my opinions of couch for myself. but i'll say that i *totally* understand any move off it.
[2013-01-27 16:31:49 -0500] jondot`: I also see omnibus did a clj -> ruby move :)
[2013-01-27 16:32:20 -0500] kallistec: as for ruby, some of the memory-hog stuff is because of how the app was originally written and coulda been fixed with a rewrite
[2013-01-27 16:32:34 -0500] kallistec: and/or move to, say, JRuby
[2013-01-27 16:33:26 -0500] kallistec: but erlang has lots of cool features for concurrency, such as per thread (erlang process/green thread) GC
[2013-01-27 16:34:13 -0500] kallistec: so you don't get a situation where one big GC blocks everything, which you do with Java and therefore JRuby
[2013-01-27 16:34:44 -0500] cheesepl_: I already am biased toward erlang so I was really happy to see the talk
[2013-01-27 16:34:51 -0500] cheesepl_: I'm*
[2013-01-27 16:35:39 -0500] jondot`: kallistec: well, I believe the Java GC is pretty smart about stop-the-world collections, isn't it?
[2013-01-27 16:36:15 -0500] kallistec: jondot`: you can change the algorithm and then tune it to mitigate the issue
[2013-01-27 16:36:36 -0500] jondot`: yup. you do get a good amount of tunability
[2013-01-27 16:36:46 -0500] kallistec: which involves learning about all the different algorithms and their tuning parameters
[2013-01-27 16:37:31 -0500] jondot`: reminds me, this was a good read about it: http://www.manning.com/evans/
[2013-01-27 16:38:50 -0500] kallistec: for a dev/ops person who doesn't have production java in their infrastructure, it's quite a lot to ask for someone to run a chef server
[2013-01-27 16:41:26 -0500] jondot`: so with erlang it was a fire-and-forget as far as you can tell?
[2013-01-27 16:42:16 -0500] kallistec: as far as GC, yeah, we've never had issues with that locking the app
[2013-01-27 16:42:42 -0500] kallistec: whereas we have that happen often enough with our Jenkins
[2013-01-27 16:43:01 -0500] kallistec: which gets quite a lot fewer req/s
[2013-01-27 16:43:05 -0500] kallistec: :P
[2013-01-27 16:43:26 -0500] cheesepl_: in my experience it scales with much, much less tuning
[2013-01-27 16:43:46 -0500] jondot`: hmm. Jenkins always felt sluggish to me I wouldn't take it as a baseline for JVM apps
[2013-01-27 16:43:50 -0500] cheesepl_: and if you do need to tune it then you are really pushing it
[2013-01-27 16:45:03 -0500] jondot`: well hopefull I can attempt reading erchef code soon :)
[2013-01-27 16:45:14 -0500] jondot`: thanks for the chat!
[2013-01-27 16:45:36 -0500] kallistec: The other thing is that JRuby perf really relies on invoke dynamic, which is only really good in the very newest JVM
[2013-01-27 16:46:07 -0500] kallistec: so at the time we were looking at this, we couldn't necessarily rely on it
[2013-01-27 16:46:47 -0500] jondot`: well I'm running JRuby in production for a while now. once JIT happens, it becomes much faster than MRI
[2013-01-27 16:47:26 -0500] jondot`: I think indy is off the table for a while now. until Java 8
[2013-01-27 16:48:11 -0500] jondot`: Truth is, I'm putting many 'traditional' Ruby infrastructure to shame with a mix of JRuby and Java interop :)
[2013-01-27 16:50:24 -0500] jondot`: As we speak, i'm looking at my JRuby background workers, my answer for Resque -- 80MB, 20 workers, 144000 jobs per day and I can up it to 300 workers without blinking
[2013-01-27 16:50:43 -0500] kallistec: for the latest java 7 VM, jruby will turn on indy by default
[2013-01-27 16:51:09 -0500] jondot`: kallistec: did it change? I remember it was off by default, and you could enable with a flag - till Java 8
[2013-01-27 16:51:41 -0500] kallistec: jondot`: I don't remember the details, just recall seeing that in a tweet from @headius
[2013-01-27 16:54:12 -0500] oliphox: hi all - anybody have any idea why the rvm cookbook can't install any rubies? I just get "Failed to install rvm_ruby[ruby-1.9.3-p327]. Check logs in /log/ruby-1.9.3-p327" (and that log file doesn't exist)
[2013-01-27 16:54:37 -0500] jondot`: hmm, mustve been very recent then
[2013-01-27 16:54:40 -0500] kallistec: jondot`: anyway, as far as reading erlang code, you just need to wrap your head around pattern matching and figure out the record syntax
[2013-01-27 16:54:53 -0500] kallistec: then it's pretty simple
[2013-01-27 16:56:07 -0500] jondot`: kallistec: yep. with reading I'm OK, I suppose. Did a fair bit of PROLOG so it comes somewhat of a natural. Idioms and project workflow still a bit rough on me.
[2013-01-27 16:56:55 -0500] jondot`: gotta hit the road. thanks, kallistec
[2013-01-27 16:57:02 -0500] kallistec: you bet
[2013-01-27 16:58:57 -0500] kallistec: oliphox: unfortunately, no. Only thing we do along those lines is install rbenv in our dev laptop cookbooks
[2013-01-27 16:59:23 -0500] kallistec: if you don't get a response in a while you might hit up the mailing list
[2013-01-27 16:59:37 -0500] kallistec: it gets pretty quiet in here on the weekends
[2013-01-27 17:00:12 -0500] oliphox: kallistec: thanks for the replyi'll have a look at rbenv for now and see if i get any joy on the chef-rvm github tracker
[2013-01-27 17:03:59 -0500] gyre007: is there any way I can specify passowrd and username to Github when doing checkout via git resource from private repo ?
[2013-01-27 17:05:40 -0500] asdmax: how big should be chef splay for +2k nodes?
[2013-01-27 17:15:06 -0500] kallistec: asdmax: you'll have the load most evenly spread out if you set splay == interval
[2013-01-27 18:03:33 -0500] mal__: Evenin' all
[2013-01-27 18:04:01 -0500] mal__: Anyone got any pointers regarding the name attribute in metadata.rb?
[2013-01-27 18:04:13 -0500] carldanley: as far as what goes?
[2013-01-27 18:04:46 -0500] mal__: I was hoping it allowed you to reference the cookbook via a different name
[2013-01-27 18:05:04 -0500] mal__: But it fails dependency checks, wondered if it was a bug or if I was using it wrong
[2013-01-27 18:06:12 -0500] ranjibd: mal__, what version of  chef you are using ?
[2013-01-27 18:06:13 -0500] mal__: i.e. folder name is cookbooks/app/ name attribute is 'company-app', then I wanted to do stuff like depends 'company-app' and include_recipe 'company-app'
[2013-01-27 18:06:23 -0500] mal__: client or server?
[2013-01-27 18:06:57 -0500] mal__: knife --version = Chef: 10.18.2
[2013-01-27 18:07:45 -0500] mal__: That was on my client; it's Chef: 10.14.2 on the server
[2013-01-27 18:08:28 -0500] ranjibd: mal__, there was a discussion on the mailing list on this , i cant recall the conclusion though, let me search the tickets & mailing list
[2013-01-27 18:08:57 -0500] mal__: Gah, guess I need to upgrade the server, it's the standard version bootstrapped on ubuntu 11.04
[2013-01-27 18:09:39 -0500] ranjibd: mal__, http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3307
[2013-01-27 18:10:15 -0500] mal__: ranjibd: I did find that, but it was 10.8 and there was no sort of discussion so I wondered if there was any more info
[2013-01-27 18:10:37 -0500] ranjibd: i dont think its fixed
[2013-01-27 18:11:25 -0500] mal__: ranjibd: Fair enough, thanks for your help
[2013-01-27 18:56:32 -0500] poseid: hm.. I am bit confused on how to get a new instance created with knife on AWS
[2013-01-27 18:56:56 -0500] poseid: not sure, where/how to use aws_access_key_id
[2013-01-27 19:05:27 -0500] kaerast: poseid, I've not used aws but presumably it'll be in your ~/.chef/knife.rb file as with the Rackspace api key
[2013-01-27 19:06:16 -0500] poseid: hmm.. I tried it there... but I get no valid AWS key... not sure, maybe an AWS problem
[2013-01-27 19:06:27 -0500] poseid: I'll likely go and check there
[2013-01-27 19:07:56 -0500] kaerast: the ec2 bootstrap wiki page seems to cover everything: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/EC2+Bootstrap+Fast+Start+Guide
[2013-01-27 19:10:33 -0500] poseid: ah, great, the AWS settings screenshots look helpful
[2013-01-27 19:14:39 -0500] tolland: i just setup a cookbook to generate a cron entry, and in my awesome wisdom tried this cron "do-this" do minute rand(60)
[2013-01-27 19:15:05 -0500] tolland: but presumably, thats resetting the minute value on every run
[2013-01-27 19:15:21 -0500] tolland: whats the idiom to generate a random number, and set it to the node?
[2013-01-27 19:19:13 -0500] tolland: chef having meetups like this
[2013-01-27 19:19:15 -0500] tolland: ""Opscode Chef Meetups near Random Lake""
[2013-01-27 19:19:22 -0500] tolland: is not helping for google results ;-)
[2013-01-27 19:26:14 -0500] kaerast: I suppose you'd want to store the minute value as a node attribute really, and only set it if it isn't yet set
[2013-01-27 19:27:33 -0500] kaerast: and/or you could use action create_if_missing so that it doesn't get updated on every run
[2013-01-27 19:28:40 -0500] kaerast: although create_if_missing would require you to create it as a file in cron.d rather than using the cron resource
[2013-01-27 19:28:44 -0500] tolland: the former sounds better, as id like to mess about with, and hence want to it updated
[2013-01-27 19:30:01 -0500] kaerast: I'm not sure there's much in it really, but ok
[2013-01-27 19:59:53 -0500] carldanley: sanity check
[2013-01-27 19:59:56 -0500] carldanley: is this valid: notifies :reload, 'service[php5-fpm] service[nginx]' ?
[2013-01-27 20:07:12 -0500] perfabio: hi all
[2013-01-27 20:12:35 -0500] carldanley: quick question, if I wanted to say, import a directory and all .sql files contained within that folder how would I go about it?
[2013-01-27 20:12:42 -0500] carldanley: without knowing the names first
[2013-01-27 20:14:41 -0500] perfabio: sorry to bother, I'm having a weird problem using rackspace private cloud. It uses chef to manage hosts but seems that it's updating wrongly my ips.
[2013-01-27 20:15:44 -0500] perfabio: I have 10nodes 10.100.0.11-21 called host01-11 ...hosts file is wrongly updated (by chef) pointing node11 to 10.100.0.60 instead of 10.100.0.21 ... so now, all my nodes can't work because the try to connect to 10.100.0.60 (my controller)!!  any idea how to fix it?
[2013-01-27 20:28:33 -0500] perfabio: anyone?
[2013-01-27 20:39:54 -0500] justincampbell: perfabio: im guessing thats what the chef server knows about
[2013-01-27 20:40:15 -0500] justincampbell: if youre managing chef, take a look at the nodes on the server and their IPs
[2013-01-27 20:40:20 -0500] justincampbell: if you dont, contact rackspace support
[2013-01-27 20:41:16 -0500] perfabio: can you point me how check nodes and ips?
[2013-01-27 20:41:32 -0500] maek: perfabio: knife node show nodename -a ipaddress
[2013-01-27 20:41:33 -0500] maek: or
[2013-01-27 20:41:36 -0500] maek: knife node show nodename -a
[2013-01-27 20:41:37 -0500] perfabio: thanks for the help
[2013-01-27 20:41:39 -0500] maek: will show ALL nodes
[2013-01-27 20:41:40 -0500] maek: er
[2013-01-27 20:41:42 -0500] maek: all the nodes attributes
[2013-01-27 20:41:56 -0500] maek: on cloud machines there are several attributes that have ips
[2013-01-27 20:42:12 -0500] maek: also it would be worth looking in the cahced cookbook directory for the template thats generating /etc/hosts
[2013-01-27 20:42:16 -0500] maek: to see what attribute its using
[2013-01-27 20:42:21 -0500] maek: or the cookbook itself
[2013-01-27 20:42:25 -0500] maek: if you have access
[2013-01-27 20:42:38 -0500] maek: cached cookbook dir is usually /var/cache/chef/cookbooks
[2013-01-27 20:43:19 -0500] perfabio: maek thanks! seems that ip is right: ipaddress:  10.100.0.21
[2013-01-27 20:44:46 -0500] maek: id do this
[2013-01-27 20:45:18 -0500] maek: knife search node "role:something_to_identify_these_10_boxes" -a |grep 10.100.0.60
[2013-01-27 20:45:24 -0500] maek: if I understand the problem
[2013-01-27 20:45:30 -0500] maek: that might help you see where that ip is coming from
[2013-01-27 20:48:35 -0500] perfabio: maek that ip is nowhere!
[2013-01-27 20:49:17 -0500] maek: are you sure your search string works?
[2013-01-27 20:49:20 -0500] maek: if you dont |grep
[2013-01-27 20:49:24 -0500] maek: do you see a metric butt load of json?
[2013-01-27 20:49:41 -0500] maek: perfabio: ^?
[2013-01-27 20:50:32 -0500] maek: seems like time to use that fanatical support rackspace boasts about :D
[2013-01-27 20:50:34 -0500] perfabio: 10.100.0.60 is the ip of a virtual machine...so it should have no roles... (maybe)
[2013-01-27 20:51:01 -0500] maek: well I was just getting at that if you could find that ip somewhere it might help figure out the problem
[2013-01-27 20:51:08 -0500] maek: but if its not an attribute on node11
[2013-01-27 20:51:17 -0500] perfabio: I tried knife search node "role:single-compute" -a ipaddress
[2013-01-27 20:51:37 -0500] perfabio: and I got a list of all my nodes with the right ips
[2013-01-27 20:51:54 -0500] maek: leave off ipaddress
[2013-01-27 20:52:00 -0500] maek: mah
[2013-01-27 20:52:03 -0500] maek: never mind
[2013-01-27 20:52:05 -0500] maek: call rackspace ;)
[2013-01-27 20:52:11 -0500] perfabio: without -a I get an error
[2013-01-27 20:53:21 -0500] perfabio: ... in `parse_options': missing argument: -a (OptionParser::MissingArgument) ...
[2013-01-27 20:53:46 -0500] perfabio: but you are right...nevermind!
[2013-01-27 20:53:54 -0500] maek: hrm. -a is supposed to give you all the node attributes
[2013-01-27 20:53:59 -0500] maek: if you dont pass one for it to show
[2013-01-27 20:54:21 -0500] perfabio: maek where can I find the template of /etc/hosts ?
[2013-01-27 20:54:34 -0500] perfabio: or how can I disable this recipe?
[2013-01-27 20:54:36 -0500] maek: perfabio: i would look in /var/cache/chef/cookbooks
[2013-01-27 20:54:42 -0500] maek: find . -name hosts.erb
[2013-01-27 20:54:46 -0500] maek: assuming thats how it works
[2013-01-27 20:55:36 -0500] perfabio: no files founded!
[2013-01-27 20:55:48 -0500] perfabio: maybe in /opt/rpcs/chef-cookbooks/cookbooks/osops-utils
[2013-01-27 20:56:09 -0500] maek: yeah im just guessing as to where it would be located by default
[2013-01-27 20:56:12 -0500] maek: ive never used rackspace
[2013-01-27 21:05:40 -0500] perfabio: tnx maek, I'll try to solve it
[2013-01-27 21:06:11 -0500] maek: can you do this
[2013-01-27 21:06:19 -0500] maek: mv that /etc/hosts file
[2013-01-27 21:06:22 -0500] maek: then run chef-clien in whyrun
[2013-01-27 21:06:31 -0500] maek: and see what recipes would modify /etc/hosts?
[2013-01-27 21:06:42 -0500] maek: perfabio: np, good luck.
[2013-01-27 21:12:03 -0500] perfabio: maek sorry again, where can I find this log Chef::Log.info(...) ?
[2013-01-27 21:12:23 -0500] maek: perfabio: Not sure what you mean
[2013-01-27 21:12:34 -0500] maek: that seems to be log level info method for chef-client output
[2013-01-27 21:12:40 -0500] maek: buzz
[2013-01-27 21:12:46 -0500] perfabio: sorry but my english is very bad :=
[2013-01-27 21:12:52 -0500] maek: is ok
[2013-01-27 21:13:07 -0500] perfabio: ah ok...
[2013-01-27 21:13:11 -0500] perfabio: tnx
[2013-01-27 21:13:18 -0500] maek: Chef::Log.info(...)  as far as I know is used to send output messages during chef-client at the log level warn
[2013-01-27 21:13:38 -0500] maek: can you run chef-client on node11?
[2013-01-27 21:14:27 -0500] perfabio: yes, I'm trying
[2013-01-27 21:14:42 -0500] maek: chef-client -l debug >  /tmp/chef-client.out
[2013-01-27 21:14:48 -0500] maek: and then dig through there for /etc/hosts
[2013-01-27 21:14:54 -0500] maek: and it should show what recipe is changing it
[2013-01-27 21:17:13 -0500] perfabio: hosts = search(:node, "chef_environment:#{node.chef_environment}") ...this should be the problem
[2013-01-27 21:17:43 -0500] perfabio: ops ...maybe later !!! debugging mode
[2013-01-27 21:17:59 -0500] maek: perfabio: thats just saying to grab all the nodes in the environment of the current node
[2013-01-27 21:18:18 -0500] maek: that doesnt make sense as to why node11 is getting a different ip
[2013-01-27 21:19:09 -0500] perfabio: http://pastebin.com/tWbyfUeh
[2013-01-27 21:19:38 -0500] perfabio: it retrieves the wrong ip!
[2013-01-27 21:21:36 -0500] perfabio: so I think that this is the real problem: ::Chef::Recipe::IPManagement.get_ip_for_net
[2013-01-27 21:22:48 -0500] maek: but its working for the other nodes right?
[2013-01-27 21:24:25 -0500] perfabio: yes, I'll explain what the problem is: I have physical nodes with ips 10.100.0.11 - 10.100.0.21
[2013-01-27 21:25:51 -0500] perfabio: openstack can build VMs (with private ip) and per VM, I can assign a "public ip". My public ips are 10.100.0.54-10.100.0.254
[2013-01-27 21:26:20 -0500] perfabio: this IPs are called floatting ips.
[2013-01-27 21:27:42 -0500] perfabio: /etc/hosts assign to some physical node the right ip, and wrong to other, assigning floating IP!!!
[2013-01-27 21:32:21 -0500] iroller: Ohai Chefs. Is there any good way go convert such things like GPG keys to encrypted data bags?
[2013-01-27 22:43:59 -0500] deed02392: what's the correct way to load an encrypted data bag and just have it use the default secret file? i.e. the one in /etc/chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret
[2013-01-27 22:44:32 -0500] deed02392: should I just call Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("bag", "item") and it'll use that secret by default?
[2013-01-27 23:18:38 -0500] mal__: Does anyone know how to mark a ticket as Fixed Provided? Do you have to own the ticket?
