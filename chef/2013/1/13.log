[2013-01-13 00:40:19 -0500] clizzin: found a possible solution: http://www.opscode.com/blog/2009/06/01/cool-chef-tricks-install-and-use-rubygems-in-a-chef-run/
[2013-01-13 12:07:49 -0500] ezotrank: Good day. It's possible by native way to append template to some file?
[2013-01-13 13:52:56 -0500] WPsites: Decommission servers. What is the best way to deal with this? i.e. run a script to deregister the VPN ip and another to backup/move the web files
[2013-01-13 14:43:27 -0500] danryan: Ohai chefs! Is there a framework that tests the outcome of a Chef run and not the resource implementation?
[2013-01-13 14:45:12 -0500] danryan: I thought minitest-chef-handler might be what I want, but it works by infecting assertions onto the resource objects and testing what I put in my cookbooks, not the resulting behavior of the resource. I know my cookbook is right because Chef already tests it by running it :)
[2013-01-13 14:53:46 -0500] Babar: danryan: maybe you could use cucumber?
[2013-01-13 14:55:20 -0500] danryan: Babar: Sure, and I could use vanilla rspec/minitest/etc, too, but I miss out on all the Chef-specific matchers and assertions.
[2013-01-13 15:00:02 -0500] danryan: I'm not opposed to writing something myself, just curious about options before I reinvent someone else's wheel :)
[2013-01-13 15:11:17 -0500] specialsauce: danryan: i don't know if there *is* a way of testing things in a worthwhile manner
[2013-01-13 15:12:17 -0500] specialsauce: the things we break tend to be subtle and/or only show up on certain environments and/or show up weeks after change was made on a triggered action such as logrotate or service restart - its impossible to prove whether you have or have not got all your subscriptions/notifications registered correctly for example
[2013-01-13 15:12:52 -0500] specialsauce: i think people are too hooked on testing infra code as if it were application code, and there's some very different underlying requirements
[2013-01-13 15:18:04 -0500] Babar: specialsauce: yeah, that's why people invented monitoring :)
[2013-01-13 15:18:52 -0500] specialsauce: yep, despite all the new ideas, monitoring is still more important for us than testing for chef code
[2013-01-13 15:35:09 -0500] Babar: I'd dare call that "unit testing" vs "functionnal testing". The former is nice, but won't ever replace the latter
[2013-01-13 15:48:59 -0500] solarce: ya'll should read http://erik.hollensbe.org/2012/12/21/chef-workflow/
[2013-01-13 15:56:59 -0500] Babar: interesting, indeed
[2013-01-13 16:03:06 -0500] jhayden: I need help badly with an error I don't understand https://gist.github.com/4524812
[2013-01-13 16:45:20 -0500] danryan: jhayden: can you please gist the content of chef-client::default?
[2013-01-13 16:45:59 -0500] danryan: jhayden: er, also chef-client::service too please :)
[2013-01-13 16:46:21 -0500] jhayden: danryan: Ha! I just realized I was on ver 1.2.1 of the client and have upgraded
[2013-01-13 16:46:29 -0500] jhayden: let me see if that helps
[2013-01-13 16:53:21 -0500] jhayden: danryan: That was it! I have other errors but understandable ones
[2013-01-13 16:53:54 -0500] jhayden: Thanks
[2013-01-13 17:07:31 -0500] kesor: any examples how to modify a cookbook that has LWRP and remove some of the conditionals it has in it, but in chef-rewind style?
[2013-01-13 18:14:24 -0500] jhayden: in a cookbook_file recipe can you use the following for source
[2013-01-13 18:14:27 -0500] jhayden: source "alpha2/" + filePrefix + "dataos.conf"
[2013-01-13 18:14:48 -0500] jhayden: where filePrefix is set conditionally earlier in the recipe?
[2013-01-13 18:20:31 -0500] whilp: jhayden: jup
[2013-01-13 18:20:50 -0500] amccloud: Anyone have tips for managing chef-clients memory footprint?
[2013-01-13 18:21:23 -0500] whilp: jhayden: or "alpha2/#{filePrefix}dataos.conf", etc -- it's ruby
[2013-01-13 18:22:12 -0500] jhayden: whilp: Yes, I think that would work
[2013-01-13 18:22:16 -0500] jhayden: let me try it
[2013-01-13 18:23:06 -0500] yfeldblum: amccloud, kill -kill ?
[2013-01-13 19:02:28 -0500] bmcgee: hey i've been away from chef for a while and I'm having a bit of a branfart. I'm trying to use the cloudant cookbooks for big couch: https://github.com/cloudant/cloudant_cookbooks. I've clone the repo and I've run berks init in each. Trying to install and upload them to my chef server. When I try to upload bigcouch it moans about libicu not being found in the default location
[2013-01-13 19:02:46 -0500] bmcgee: *brainfart lol damn autocorrect
[2013-01-13 19:55:14 -0500] gyre007: in file resource...if I specify action delete..will chef-client try to delete the file on every run even if it was deleted on previous run ? idempotency is a bit tricky in this one...as you can have chef-client running as  ademon and deleting the files on every run
[2013-01-13 20:19:16 -0500] yfeldblum: gyre007, yes, chef-client will try to delete the file on every run
[2013-01-13 20:19:33 -0500] yfeldblum: gyre007, if the file exists, chef-client will delete it; if the file doesn't exist, chef-client won't do anything
[2013-01-13 20:20:38 -0500] gyre007: cool...cheer yfeldblum
[2013-01-13 20:58:48 -0500] drev1: is anyone here familiar with the application cookbook?
[2013-01-13 20:59:48 -0500] drev1: I'm having trouble with the migration command; it is not being executed for some reason
[2013-01-13 21:39:15 -0500] gyre007: anyone here has any experience with deploy_revision resource ?
[2013-01-13 21:40:04 -0500] gyre007: IM getting the following error BUT I dont understand why as revision DOES exist: https://gist.github.com/4526337
[2013-01-13 21:51:22 -0500] gyre007: drev1: we were using it but we dropped it...it's a bit of a crazy thing :)...we created our own LWRPs instead...
[2013-01-13 21:57:02 -0500] gyre007: really strange...unless theres a bug in deploy_revision resource
[2013-01-13 22:02:10 -0500] gyre007: the tag should be correct based on this too https://github.com/sensu/sensu-admin/tags
[2013-01-13 22:05:25 -0500] mh`: i'd like to know where the ENOENT comes from
[2013-01-13 22:05:38 -0500] mh`: oh
[2013-01-13 22:05:42 -0500] mh`: i think i know what's happening perhaps
[2013-01-13 22:06:15 -0500] mh`: i don't know chef hardly at all yet, just undertaking transitioning from puppet, but
[2013-01-13 22:06:27 -0500] mh`: try putting a full path to the git binary wherever that command is run instead of just 'git'
[2013-01-13 22:06:39 -0500] mh`: like from your shell where you ran the command successfully, do `which git`
[2013-01-13 22:06:51 -0500] mh`: and put the value of that in the chef script that's running the git command
[2013-01-13 22:06:54 -0500] mh`: that make sense?
[2013-01-13 22:15:36 -0500] gyre007: mh`: that command is run by chef - I can't influence the path...but it might just be the case that chef doesn't call it properly
[2013-01-13 22:16:04 -0500] gyre007: ahhhhhhhh
[2013-01-13 22:16:08 -0500] gyre007: git package wasnt installed
[2013-01-13 22:16:15 -0500] gyre007: mh`:  youre legend! :)
[2013-01-13 22:17:35 -0500] mh`: yeah np
[2013-01-13 22:17:44 -0500] mh`: the ENOENT is what gave it away
[2013-01-13 22:17:57 -0500] mh`: http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/uapi/asm-generic/errno-base.h#L5
[2013-01-13 22:18:04 -0500] mh`: <-linux person not chef person haha
[2013-01-13 22:18:15 -0500] mh`: i knew that error was from your local system, not being returned by that git remote
[2013-01-13 22:20:51 -0500] gyre007: :)
[2013-01-13 22:25:32 -0500] WPsites: I've got an environment and the only difference is one extra recipe is needed. I need this to go last but if I put the recipe in env_run_lists of the role this is relevant to but because there is only this single recipe in the run list it's added/merged with the rest. Problem is it's added first which is too early. Is there a way to modify the order?
