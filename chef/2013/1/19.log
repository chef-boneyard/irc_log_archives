[2013-01-19 00:00:03 -0500] mjolk: it's like it's not finding the cookbook
[2013-01-19 00:02:06 -0500] maplebed: occupwnt: you could put a versioned file in the tarball, then change to use a new versioned file with the newer version.
[2013-01-19 00:02:27 -0500] maplebed: I'm not sure how you would tell it not to extract the tarball and yet still be able to get a new version.
[2013-01-19 00:03:33 -0500] occupwnt: maplebed:  I thought it would work like a template file that has a notify restart. restart the service if you're updating the file, otherwise don't do anything.
[2013-01-19 00:05:18 -0500] xerxas: I'm deploying an application that needs some cron. I'm writing a cookbook for that application, using the application resource. Should my cron be in a seperate recipe or should they be nested somewhere in a callback of the application resource ?
[2013-01-19 00:10:33 -0500] mjolk: it's like it's not finding the recipe that it's part of
[2013-01-19 00:10:38 -0500] mjolk: which is messed up because it's in the same recipe
[2013-01-19 00:10:42 -0500] mjolk: gewrALNGIOPUEQRWBGU89PILQ35PH[350FGHX,[]
[2013-01-19 00:13:08 -0500] mjolk: are the resources loading out of ordered?
[2013-01-19 00:15:24 -0500] MrWGW-: hey there, I was just reading in the book Test Driven Development with Chef that its rather difficult to setup your own chef server instance
[2013-01-19 00:15:27 -0500] MrWGW-: is that true?
[2013-01-19 00:15:36 -0500] MrWGW-: it seems tome that it would be hazardous to rely purely on opscode
[2013-01-19 00:15:58 -0500] MrWGW-: because obviously while unlikely, PaaS outages do occur, and if their network did go down you would find yourself unable to manage your infrastructure
[2013-01-19 00:17:38 -0500] kallistec: MrWGW-: depends. There's a fair number of moving parts, and if you don't know how they fit together, it can be difficult to debug everything. OTOH, in the soon-to-be-released Chef 11, we ship the whole thing as a single package with unified management tools, that makes it all a lot easier
[2013-01-19 00:18:17 -0500] version2beta: kallistec, Chef 11 will have the Erlang core?
[2013-01-19 00:18:37 -0500] MrWGW-: kallistec: outstanding
[2013-01-19 00:19:07 -0500] kallistec: Opscode has a SLA for paid customers, though it's a refund on the service price, not whatever money/street cred you lost
[2013-01-19 00:19:55 -0500] kallistec: if you're starting with Chef, it's totally the easiest way to go, learn the recipe DSL, etc. Then you can tackle setting up the server and have a better idea what's happening
[2013-01-19 00:20:18 -0500] kallistec: IOW, you can pick one path and change your mind later
[2013-01-19 00:20:40 -0500] kallistec: version2beta: yeah, the API server is erlang w/ postgres database in Chef 11
[2013-01-19 00:21:08 -0500] kallistec: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+11+Server+Preview if you want to try it now
[2013-01-19 00:21:25 -0500] MrWGW-: such a system would only be safe to use though if you had a backup management system in place in the event opscode went down
[2013-01-19 00:21:29 -0500] version2beta: kallistec, excellent :-) I'm using hosted chef now, but it's nice to know the two will converge a little more. I assume hosted will still offer features the OSS version will not?
[2013-01-19 00:21:34 -0500] MrWGW-: otherwise it would be too dangerous
[2013-01-19 00:21:49 -0500] MrWGW-: and note that I'm also not a fan of people putting all of their servers into one datacenter, or using a single cloud provider exclusively
[2013-01-19 00:21:56 -0500] kallistec: MrWGW-: you have to rely on other services unless you run the whole internet
[2013-01-19 00:22:02 -0500] kallistec: it's not that black and white
[2013-01-19 00:22:56 -0500] kallistec: If you don't have expertise with chef server's components so that you have to wait on a mailing list response to fix a problem, then you could have less uptime than you would have with the hosted service
[2013-01-19 00:23:02 -0500] MrWGW-: but the beauty of the internet in general is it allows for redundancy
[2013-01-19 00:23:26 -0500] MrWGW-: for my own operations for example I have an ASN, and my own IP ranges from ARIN, so if I lose one upstream provider, I stay up, and I also have two separate datacenter sites, in LA and Dallas
[2013-01-19 00:24:30 -0500] kallistec: you can still be borked by global BGP fuckups
[2013-01-19 00:25:08 -0500] MrWGW-: yes but these are fairly uncommon
[2013-01-19 00:25:30 -0500] MrWGW-: the last one I remember happened a few years ago when the Pakistanis tried to censor MySpace
[2013-01-19 00:25:34 -0500] version2beta: Best practices question: If my app has a config file that points to the database (host, users, passwords, etc), is it best to update that config file when running the DB server recipe (when the information is right at hand), or the app server recipe (when I have to derive it from other nodes?)?
[2013-01-19 00:25:46 -0500] MrWGW-: they created a null route for MySPace's prefixes at their national edge routers, but inadvertantly redistributed it upstream
[2013-01-19 00:25:51 -0500] kallistec: but anyway, my point is that there's a cost/benefit calculation, if you want to pay more to have total control and have a kick ass ops team with deep knowledge of all your components, then yeah, you should run all your own stuff
[2013-01-19 00:25:53 -0500] MrWGW-: and one of their upstream ISPs, a tier 1, didn't route-filter against them
[2013-01-19 00:26:01 -0500] MrWGW-: and in that manner the bad route got injected into the entire global routing tabl
[2013-01-19 00:26:17 -0500] MrWGW-: since then most providers have been much more careful about route filtering their customers
[2013-01-19 00:26:33 -0500] MrWGW-: and there's a proposed BGPSec standard which would make such incidents impossible
[2013-01-19 00:27:43 -0500] version2beta: Or maybe the answer is neither, that the config should go in a configuration recipe?
[2013-01-19 00:28:13 -0500] kallistec: version2beta: depends. We tend to keep that kind of stuff in data bags if it's more static than not
[2013-01-19 00:28:25 -0500] kallistec: or search if it's more dynamic
[2013-01-19 00:28:34 -0500] maplebed: Anybody have experience with zookeeper cookbooks?  Opinions on http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/zookeeper_cluster vs. http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/zookeeper ?
[2013-01-19 00:29:02 -0500] version2beta: That makes sense. I can assign users and passwords in an encrypted databag. Is it difficult to tie that to environment?
[2013-01-19 00:29:34 -0500] kallistec: version2beta: have a databag named my-app-config and then one item per environment
[2013-01-19 00:30:05 -0500] kallistec: then look up the data bag item via node.chef_environment
[2013-01-19 00:30:15 -0500] version2beta: kallistec, I'm a noob. That means I'll hash it with node.chef_environment, right?
[2013-01-19 00:31:24 -0500] kallistec: version2beta: no. a data bag is like a namespace that you can create, and then you can put objects in it keyed by id
[2013-01-19 00:31:42 -0500] kallistec: so you have one object per environment
[2013-01-19 00:32:03 -0500] kallistec: the key you use to encrypt is a separate concern
[2013-01-19 00:33:17 -0500] maplebed: barring any other feedback, starting with http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/zookeeper_cluster since it was modified more recently and has a higher version number.  :P
[2013-01-19 00:33:25 -0500] version2beta: kallistec, okay clearly I need to study databags a bit more. Thank you!
[2013-01-19 00:41:51 -0500] cagdas: hello
[2013-01-19 00:42:11 -0500] cagdas: I get the following error after "knife cookbook site install yumrepo"
[2013-01-19 00:42:21 -0500] cagdas: Cannot open or read cookbooks/yumrepo/metadata.rb
[2013-01-19 00:42:28 -0500] cagdas: what could be the reason?
[2013-01-19 00:42:36 -0500] cagdas: yumrepo cookbook folder is empty right now
[2013-01-19 00:43:01 -0500] maplebed: rmdir the folder.
[2013-01-19 00:43:16 -0500] cagdas: ok
[2013-01-19 00:43:48 -0500] cagdas: I tried again
[2013-01-19 00:43:50 -0500] cagdas: didn't help
[2013-01-19 01:56:40 -0500] occupwnt: whew, finally solved my problem. is syntax like "notifies :run, "execute[my_command]", :immediately" not valid any longer? I pulled that from opscode documentation, but could never get it working.
[2013-01-19 01:56:56 -0500] occupwnt: but I found reference to someone using "notifies :run, resources(:execute => "my_command"), :immediately" and that works
[2013-01-19 01:58:33 -0500] tomdzk: occupwnt: maybe only for execute ? this still works (10.16.x at least): notifies :run, "script[myscript]", :immediately
[2013-01-19 02:04:15 -0500] occupwnt: tomdzk:  perhaps. the example I stole was using execute though, only thing I changed was the name of the resource itself. trying to decide if this is worth filing bug over or not.
[2013-01-19 02:57:35 -0500] JFray: would it be worthwhile (or possible) to use knife-ec2 as a library as opposed to shelling out to system()?
[2013-01-19 02:59:01 -0500] JFray: I'm working on a knife exec wrapper to build images for multiple providers and just gaging the amount of effort to refactor away from shelling out
[2013-01-19 03:05:20 -0500] JFray: nm..found this: https://gist.github.com/774460
[2013-01-19 03:05:29 -0500] JFray: will go ahead and try it out. Thanks!

[2013-01-19 10:01:39 -0500] aruntomar: wlll: try your role or recipe one at a time and then try to figure out which one is causing the problem. you are getting a "end of file" error
[2013-01-19 10:06:35 -0500] wlll: aruntomar: thanks, I pruned the run list to just recipe[build-essential] (http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/build-essential) and still get the error
[2013-01-19 10:06:45 -0500] wlll: same for my base recipe, which is now effectively empty
[2013-01-19 10:07:47 -0500] aruntomar: wlll: that's strange
[2013-01-19 10:07:58 -0500] wlll: Yeah :)
[2013-01-19 10:08:33 -0500] aruntomar: wlll: try to upgrade the chef version and see. there's a new version released with certain bug fixes http://www.opscode.com/blog/2013/01/18/chef-10-18-2-bugfix-release/
[2013-01-19 10:11:42 -0500] wlll: Same error :(
[2013-01-19 10:11:56 -0500] wlll: Any idea why /reports/nodes/build-local/runs 404s?
[2013-01-19 10:12:24 -0500] wlll: Maybe that's a red herring
[2013-01-19 10:19:39 -0500] aruntomar: wlll: i also get that report error, but none the less, run's fine on my system
[2013-01-19 10:19:49 -0500] wlll: Ah, OK

[2013-01-19 12:54:47 -0500] aruntomar: wlll: ok
[2013-01-19 13:15:05 -0500] WPsites: I've got a quick question about your version controlled chef repo. Some cookbooks I pull in from github and such end up being their own repo inside of the main chef repo. So if I make changes I commit to that and then I also have to commit again in the main repo above. How should I deal with this? Should I just clear out the .git element of any new cookbooks and then commit to my main repo only or do I put every cookbook in it's own repo and then commit
[2013-01-19 13:15:06 -0500] WPsites: to the cookbook repo and then commit all over again to the chef-repo??
[2013-01-19 13:39:19 -0500] aruntomar: WPsites: well, the way we do it is, we have a separate cookbooks dir for all the site/pulled cookbooks, and we don't make changes to them, unless we want to send a pull request. and we develop all our internal cookbooks in another dir.
[2013-01-19 13:40:03 -0500] aruntomar: WPsites: other methods are to use librarian or bershelf
[2013-01-19 13:42:22 -0500] WPsites: what if I have made a small change to a site cookbook? I just thought going forward if opscode make a change to the cookbook I will just merge it with my little change?
[2013-01-19 13:47:47 -0500] aruntomar: WPsites: now i don't know what changes you are making, but i'm assuming, suppose you want to override the templates, that have come with the site cookbook. you could override them by including the site cookbook in a new one. obviously, overriding attributes are much easier using roles etc. if you are adding functionality and if that's useful to others, y not just send a pull request, so that it can be merged in the site cookbook as well.
[2013-01-19 13:49:12 -0500] WPsites: aruntomar: Yeah that sort of thing. OK thanks for your advise.
[2013-01-19 13:49:18 -0500] WPsites: advice even
[2013-01-19 13:53:34 -0500] aruntomar: WPsites: welcome :)
[2013-01-19 14:57:30 -0500] gebbione: hi i am trying to add mcrypt to my php set up, is this file all i need to have it install https://github.com/msonnabaum/cookbooks/blob/new_php_modules/php/recipes/module_mcrypt.rb ?
[2013-01-19 15:09:09 -0500] WPsites: If I'm to create my own web application LWRP would it be acceptable to create it with the following actions: install, symlink, standalone ?
[2013-01-19 15:10:24 -0500] WPsites: install will install on the HD various versions of the web application, symlink will symlink your web app to that version and standalone would download/install a standalone version of the app (not symlinked)
[2013-01-19 15:11:25 -0500] WPsites: or should I just create a "create" action and then add logic in there for if method=symlink if. else..
[2013-01-19 15:15:53 -0500] gebbione: is there a quick start for chef solo?
[2013-01-19 15:24:03 -0500] gebbione: WPsites, i guess saturdays everyone is relaxing
[2013-01-19 15:48:45 -0500] omgTravis: does chef provide a breakpoint that you could throw in a recipe in order to inspect your system at a certain point in the recipe?

[2013-01-19 16:21:53 -0500] cwj: also, strictly speaking, its not necessary to add recipes to your metadata file for them to work
[2013-01-19 16:25:33 -0500] gebbione: cwj,  in the module_mcrypt i don't see a line 58, do you mean line 28?
[2013-01-19 16:26:07 -0500] cwj: sorry, i'm working from the line numbers in your pastebin which dont match your file
[2013-01-19 16:26:12 -0500] cwj: recipe "php::module_mcrypt, "Install the php5-mcrypt package"

[2013-01-19 16:32:28 -0500] mattt: what's the best way to install php5-mysql?  i'm already using mysql and apache2 cookbooks
[2013-01-19 16:33:10 -0500] cwj: gebbione: a recipe runs if it is included in your node's run list or if a recipe in your node's run list includes it (i.e. via include_recipe)
[2013-01-19 16:33:54 -0500] cwj: gebbione: so when you are adding a new recipe, it generally isn't going to run unless you add it to your run list
[2013-01-19 16:34:18 -0500] gebbione: so even if i have lots of recipes under the php folder
[2013-01-19 16:34:29 -0500] gebbione: they would run only if i include them in the run list?
[2013-01-19 16:34:33 -0500] gebbione: in my local.json
[2013-01-19 16:34:47 -0500] cwj: right
[2013-01-19 16:35:14 -0500] cwj: mattt: have you looked at the opscode php cookbook? http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/php
[2013-01-19 16:35:32 -0500] cwj: it includes a recipe called module_mysql
[2013-01-19 16:35:53 -0500] cwj: i dont have a lot of experience with the php cookbook myself
[2013-01-19 16:36:02 -0500] cwj: but it seems to have worked well enough for me in the past
[2013-01-19 16:36:28 -0500] mattt: cwj: i think that's pecl stuff tho, i want to install the debian package
[2013-01-19 16:36:43 -0500] mattt: not to worry, will just install it w/ the package resource
[2013-01-19 16:36:49 -0500] cwj: ok :)
[2013-01-19 16:39:23 -0500] WPsites: when crating a LWRP should i add default values in the resource or concentrate on keeping the default values in the attribute file? for paths and stuff
[2013-01-19 16:39:25 -0500] gebbione: damn now mysql is not starting anymore :/
[2013-01-19 16:42:18 -0500] cdmwebs: if I install ruby1.9.1-full with solo cook, how can I start using that ruby instead of /opt/chef/embedded/bin/ruby for the rest of the deploy?
[2013-01-19 16:42:26 -0500] cdmwebs: change the PATH?
[2013-01-19 16:42:33 -0500] mattt: gebbione: heh, i ran into an issue w/ that this morning, make sure you have enough free ram :P
[2013-01-19 16:42:50 -0500] cwj: WPsites: i would avoid using attributes directly in a LWRP
[2013-01-19 16:43:20 -0500] cwj: WPsites: set reasonable defaults and let those who use the LWRP set values via the resource attributes
[2013-01-19 16:45:09 -0500] gebbione: going to close as many apps as i can
[2013-01-19 16:45:23 -0500] WPsites: OK so if I expect the default path to be "/var/www" do I add that as a default in the resource and then in my cookbooks attribute file indicate that as well
[2013-01-19 16:45:57 -0500] WPsites: Maybe I'm just over complicating things
[2013-01-19 16:49:16 -0500] cwj: WPsites: you can certainly use node attributes when using the LWRP in a recipe, but dont use them in the LWRP itself
[2013-01-19 16:49:37 -0500] WPsites: ok thanks
[2013-01-19 17:03:26 -0500] gebbione: strange  closed lots of apps but still i get problems with mysql not starting successfully
[2013-01-19 17:18:12 -0500] gebbione: can't understand why the mysql service won't start anymore
[2013-01-19 17:18:13 -0500] gebbione: http://pastebin.com/SiMHvMH8
[2013-01-19 17:30:53 -0500] WPsites: gebbione: Processing service[mysql] action nothing just doesn't seem to be doing anything to the service
[2013-01-19 17:32:01 -0500] gebbione: no clue what thats suddenly happening 
[2013-01-19 17:32:06 -0500] WPsites: needs an immediate enable or restart surely (I'm no pro so might be talking bull)
[2013-01-19 17:33:39 -0500] WPsites: actually, thinking about it. i think mysql might be one of those things that isn't meant to restart unless it REALLY needs to
[2013-01-19 17:34:28 -0500] WPsites: so you might have to go that extra mile to have it restart like a change to the my.cnf file or something that requires a restart
[2013-01-19 17:34:54 -0500] gebbione: it might do, i am using a set up built by somebody else and adding small changes here and there  some definitely affecting the my.cfg for mysql that would require a restart
[2013-01-19 17:34:55 -0500] gebbione: but
[2013-01-19 17:35:22 -0500] gebbione: still there is no reason why it fails the start up
[2013-01-19 17:35:31 -0500] gebbione: if i go on the machine i can start it manually
[2013-01-19 17:35:40 -0500] WPsites: ssh into the server and issue a restart and make sure its working
[2013-01-19 17:35:51 -0500] WPsites: hmm odd
[2013-01-19 17:36:23 -0500] gebbione: it does, chef solo also imports a grant sql that sets the proper remote access so that i can connect from sequel pro to the machine locally
[2013-01-19 17:36:23 -0500] yfeldblum: so this yajl-ruby dependency blocks installing chef on jruby ...
[2013-01-19 17:38:33 -0500] WPsites: maybe double check that the configuration of mysql is setup to accept socket connections...socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
[2013-01-19 17:40:46 -0500] WPsites: as in, is the mysql service actually running at all - the mysql service might be running but the configuration isn't quite right so you can't connect to it. Or is it just that chef isn't restarting the service
[2013-01-19 17:40:48 -0500] gebbione: yes thats in the my.cnf
[2013-01-19 17:40:49 -0500] gebbione: socket          = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
[2013-01-19 17:41:01 -0500] cnf: no, MY cnf!
[2013-01-19 17:41:21 -0500] WPsites: and the service is running now?
[2013-01-19 17:41:35 -0500] gebbione: it won't run from vagrant reload command
[2013-01-19 17:41:45 -0500] gebbione: i need to ssh and start it
[2013-01-19 17:41:49 -0500] gebbione: then it would run
[2013-01-19 17:42:07 -0500] mattt: any reason to add dependent recipes to a runlist versus include_recipe in a recipe itself?
[2013-01-19 17:43:05 -0500] WPsites: gebbione: odd. I hate issues like this that crop up out of nowhere and just don't make any sense!
[2013-01-19 17:43:17 -0500] cwj: mattt: no reason comes to mind for me, just make sure your cookbooks declare dependencies in metadata on any recipes their recipes include
[2013-01-19 17:43:49 -0500] cwj: recipes included from external cookbooks that is
[2013-01-19 17:44:10 -0500] mattt: cwj: cool, thanks man
[2013-01-19 17:44:15 -0500] mattt: (or woman)
[2013-01-19 17:44:52 -0500] cwj: sure thing
[2013-01-19 17:49:26 -0500] gebbione: i m going to revert and start from scratch again
[2013-01-19 18:01:18 -0500] mattt: there is a lot of inconsistencies w/ cookbooks
[2013-01-19 18:01:37 -0500] mattt: you can enable god monitoring for apache2, but not mysql
[2013-01-19 18:02:15 -0500] mattt: email addresses are hard-coded in god, and you can't override
[2013-01-19 18:07:19 -0500] WPsites: I don't believe in god..
[2013-01-19 18:15:36 -0500] mattt: WPsites: :-/
[2013-01-19 18:15:48 -0500] mattt: odd name for a program tho
[2013-01-19 18:18:02 -0500] WPsites: Yeah. I've never used it. I'm currently using hsflow that sends data points to graphite. I've then got some software that I can't remember the name of that checks certain things are online and have data points within a certain range. then also various logs going to a central logstash store
[2013-01-19 18:20:17 -0500] mattt: i've always used monit, but noticed some cookbooks had god integration, so tried that
[2013-01-19 18:56:12 -0500] jwitrick: Has there been changed (chef 10.18.2) with how conditional logic is handled ?
[2013-01-19 18:59:25 -0500] jwitrick: https://gist.github.com/4574327
[2013-01-19 19:01:14 -0500] kallistec: jwitrick: no changes there, only changes in how cloned resources are handled. Are you seeing this in conjunction with CHEF-3694 warnings?
[2013-01-19 19:02:50 -0500] jwitrick: Yes those warnings are there also. but that is not what is bothering me. Normally (in past versions of chef) I have been able to put conditional execution statements in resources to keep them from being run (even when called) but now Im seeing the chef-client is ignoring those conditional checks
[2013-01-19 19:04:56 -0500] siezer: jwitrick gist an example?
[2013-01-19 19:05:13 -0500] jwitrick: https://gist.github.com/4574327
[2013-01-19 19:05:22 -0500] kallistec: jwitrick: can you run that example in debug and add the output?
[2013-01-19 19:06:08 -0500] jwitrick: one sec. running now.
[2013-01-19 19:08:34 -0500] kallistec: jwitrick: tried it just now with a recipe w/ a log resource+ only_if
[2013-01-19 19:08:35 -0500] kallistec: chef/bin/chef-solo -c /tmp/solo.rb -o test -l debug
[2013-01-19 19:08:52 -0500] kallistec: DEBUG: Skipping log[RESOURCE EXECUTED] due to only_if ruby block
[2013-01-19 19:11:41 -0500] jwitrick: updated gist above
[2013-01-19 19:12:35 -0500] jwitrick: so if the action is :run/create etc... then the conditional statements do there job.
[2013-01-19 19:12:35 -0500] kallistec: https://gist.github.com/5ccaf9f5f4d55c884132
[2013-01-19 19:13:08 -0500] jwitrick: but if the resources are defined first and then called elsewhere in the run the conditional statements fail
[2013-01-19 19:13:24 -0500] Glacee: Hi, anyone had an issue with the windows cookbook that when you add a binary key it add 30 in front?
[2013-01-19 19:13:46 -0500] Glacee: I tried with Windows Cookbook 1.3.0 and 1.7.0
[2013-01-19 19:15:24 -0500] kallistec: jwitrick: see http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2812, this is intentional when you use resource cloning
[2013-01-19 19:16:10 -0500] kallistec: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3694 we haven't figured out the exact plan, but in general, just don't use resource cloning
[2013-01-19 19:16:18 -0500] siezer: jwitrick what do you mean "defining and then calling elsewhere"
[2013-01-19 19:17:18 -0500] kallistec: siezer: this: http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-26 which we're gonna revert when we figure what to do about it
[2013-01-19 19:17:53 -0500] jwitrick: In my gist take a look at gistfile1 and you will notice i define the resources with action nothing. And starting on line 27 I call those resouces.
[2013-01-19 19:18:10 -0500] jwitrick: when the resources are called the conditional logic is ignored.
[2013-01-19 19:19:06 -0500] kallistec: jwitrick: see the tickets I referenced
[2013-01-19 19:20:02 -0500] kallistec: unfortunately the behavior you were relying on was a regression that was introduced when the internal code for conditionals was refactored
[2013-01-19 19:20:34 -0500] Glacee: Is it in the plan for Ohai tu detect cloudformation stacks in which the node is running?
[2013-01-19 19:20:51 -0500] Glacee: That would be very useful for rolling stacks under one chef environment
[2013-01-19 19:21:06 -0500] jwitrick: hum. that is really inconvient as looking at it, I would expect this to be the correct behavior
[2013-01-19 19:22:18 -0500] siezer: jwitrick are you familliar with the resource collection? what you're doing there is "refedining" the executes
[2013-01-19 19:23:52 -0500] jwitrick: so well yes technically I am, the intended behavior was to be able to define a resource with no actions, and then override the action later during a run (keeping hte same conditional checks)
[2013-01-19 19:23:54 -0500] kallistec: jwitrick: in both cases it confuses people and produces unexpected behavior, which is why we're planning to kill the feature entirely
[2013-01-19 19:24:30 -0500] jwitrick: kill the conditional logic (or the ability to refedine resources ) ?
[2013-01-19 19:24:32 -0500] kallistec: jwitrick: I have to run, if you can more naturally express what you're trying to do with notifications, I'd recommend you do that
[2013-01-19 19:24:40 -0500] siezer: https://gist.github.com/4574538
[2013-01-19 19:24:51 -0500] jwitrick: kallistec: thanks for hte help
[2013-01-19 19:25:24 -0500] kallistec: jwitrick: see the tickets, you're not really redefining them, you're making a "copy" minus some stuff and adding that to the resource collection at a later point in the list
[2013-01-19 19:26:38 -0500] jwitrick: correct and its the minus of hte conditional checks thats killing me.
[2013-01-19 19:26:55 -0500] siezer: kallistec wat? my shef gist modified the original one in place in the resource collection as far as I can tell
[2013-01-19 19:27:42 -0500] jwitrick: but ill manage, it might be a little ugler then usual but there are work arounds
[2013-01-19 19:28:55 -0500] kallistec: this is the code that does it: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/integrate-chef-10-18-0/lib/chef/resource.rb#L266
[2013-01-19 19:30:19 -0500] siezer: oh shit. so its explicitly removing the conditionals? what was the reasoning behind that?
[2013-01-19 19:31:34 -0500] siezer: actually let me read the ticket first
[2013-01-19 19:33:53 -0500] siezer: ooooh aha.
[2013-01-19 19:34:33 -0500] siezer: shit brb
[2013-01-19 20:55:09 -0500] Qapf: Heya. I'm a bit new to chef and wondering wondering, how is it best to fix timing issues with scripts? I'm in a weird problem where restarting confluence too soon after starting it results in a failure because the sub-services that confluence starts take time to even get to the point of being ready to process commands. by calling them too fast, chef ends up failing out. i'm wondering if i should start throwing a sleep into the init scripts o
[2013-01-19 20:55:10 -0500] Qapf: r if chef has a way to ask it to observe a delay.
[2013-01-19 21:02:55 -0500] gebbione: trying to enable remote access to mysql as root 
[2013-01-19 21:02:57 -0500] gebbione: https://github.com/bizmate/vagrant_demo/blob/master/roles/local.json
[2013-01-19 21:03:22 -0500] gebbione: does it sound right to you? (not concerned with security  Atm)
[2013-01-19 21:45:38 -0500] gebbione: is the mysql option set in this local.json enough to run this if statement, <% if node['mysql']['allow_remote_root'] -%> , https://github.com/bizmate/vagrant_demo/blob/master/roles/local.json ?
[2013-01-19 21:45:56 -0500] gebbione: or instead of being true should be set to something else?
[2013-01-19 21:51:30 -0500] WPsites: if it's the opscode mysql cookbook true or false is correct
[2013-01-19 21:56:44 -0500] WPsites: Are you sure you haven't firewall blocked the mysql port  "recipe[iptables-writer]"
[2013-01-19 22:00:03 -0500] gebbione: yes, somehow it was working before when i changed the line that binds the address
[2013-01-19 22:00:13 -0500] gebbione: i think i ll try to disable the bind-address
[2013-01-19 22:02:29 -0500] WPsites: try 0.0.0.0 for the bind address
[2013-01-19 22:06:04 -0500] WPsites: gebbione: Yeah looking at it, it looks like you have that attribute wrong. It should be bind_address not bind_ipaddress?
[2013-01-19 22:06:37 -0500] gebbione: i don't think the bind_ipaddress works anyway in there
[2013-01-19 22:07:07 -0500] gebbione: and most definitely the allow_remoteaccess doesn't either as the sql that grants remote access is not working
[2013-01-19 22:16:28 -0500] gebbione: removing the bind rule (well commuting out) worked :)
