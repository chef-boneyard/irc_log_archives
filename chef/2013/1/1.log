[2013-01-01 02:44:26 -0500] elado: (mysql recipe + chef-solo) I'm getting "uninitialized constant Opscode::OpenSSL" -- how do i solve this?
[2013-01-01 07:03:48 -0500] tamouse__: happy new year
[2013-01-01 07:31:02 -0500] lehrblogger: happy new year!
[2013-01-01 08:38:16 -0500] lehrblogger: i've defined a service (for ejabberd), and there are resources that i need to run in my recipe when it finishes starting up
[2013-01-01 08:38:21 -0500] lehrblogger: i've been trying to use subscribes, but i haven't been able to get it to work
[2013-01-01 08:38:24 -0500] lehrblogger: any pointers?
[2013-01-01 08:42:12 -0500] lehrblogger: should i just add retries and a retry_delay?
[2013-01-01 11:47:41 -0500] bear: question about knife bootstrap use when the chef server is locked down behind a firewall.  I have my management knife config chef server url set to http://chef:8002 with /etc/hosts set to point "chef" to 127.0.0.1 and I am running a vpn
[2013-01-01 11:48:48 -0500] bear: but on the node I want to bootstrap I won't have the vpn configured.  I can get it to work if I open an ssh -L portforward command in another terminal.  Is there an example of getting knife to issue that port forward command as needed?
[2013-01-01 11:49:29 -0500] renchap: cant you use an http proxy ?
[2013-01-01 11:50:16 -0500] bear: no, the chef server cannot have an open http port to the public internets
[2013-01-01 11:50:17 -0500] renchap: and how will it work after chef is installed ? vpn running on the host ?
[2013-01-01 11:50:40 -0500] renchap: it would not be open
[2013-01-01 11:50:48 -0500] renchap: filtered to the server IP, using https
[2013-01-01 11:50:50 -0500] bear: yea, that's why I'm trying to get .ssh/config to enable the port forward on the node - but knife seems to not want to use .ssh/config
[2013-01-01 11:51:55 -0500] renchap: i think it uses net-ssh ruby gem
[2013-01-01 11:52:19 -0500] renchap: not forking an ssh client
[2013-01-01 11:52:21 -0500] bear: yea, that is what I was reading also
[2013-01-01 11:52:27 -0500] renchap: http://net-ssh.github.com/net-ssh/
[2013-01-01 11:52:37 -0500] renchap:  # forward connections on local port 1234 to port 80 of www.capify.org
[2013-01-01 11:52:38 -0500] renchap:   ssh.forward.local(1234, "www.capify.org", 80)
[2013-01-01 11:52:45 -0500] renchap: so it is implemented in net-ssh
[2013-01-01 11:53:10 -0500] renchap: and if you have access to the Net:SSH instance, you could add the redirect
[2013-01-01 11:53:21 -0500] renchap: but i dont know how it is possible with knife bootstrap, never used it
[2013-01-01 11:54:42 -0500] renchap: like what ?
[2013-01-01 11:55:05 -0500] bear: not using the ssh command line tool
[2013-01-01 11:55:25 -0500] renchap: well, if you need to ssh from some language, it is cleaner to not fork the ssh command
[2013-01-01 11:55:35 -0500] renchap: but, well
[2013-01-01 11:55:45 -0500] renchap: you can wrap your knife bootstrap into a shell script
[2013-01-01 11:55:59 -0500] renchap: that opens an ssh connection right before, and set up the redirection
[2013-01-01 11:56:27 -0500] bear: hmm, you mean the script that knife runs on the remote node?
[2013-01-01 11:56:36 -0500] bear: did not realize it was tweakable
[2013-01-01 11:57:35 -0500] bear: ah, rtfm knows all
[2013-01-01 11:57:47 -0500] bear: thanks renchap - let me explore this path
[2013-01-01 11:57:55 -0500] renchap: or you make a shell script
[2013-01-01 11:58:01 -0500] renchap: ssh -L ... user@host &
[2013-01-01 11:58:05 -0500] renchap: knife bootstrap ...
[2013-01-01 11:58:22 -0500] renchap: and you need to kill the first ssh connection after the bootstrap is finished
[2013-01-01 11:59:30 -0500] renchap: i dont use knife bootstrap to install my servers, so i dont know what it really does
[2013-01-01 11:59:31 -0500] bear: I tried a couple variations of that but I was trying to also use the same knife.rb to allow chef server work as well as bootstrap work
[2013-01-01 12:01:45 -0500] renchap: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Custom+Knife+Bootstrap+Script
[2013-01-01 12:01:57 -0500] renchap: you can also customize the shell script that bootstrap uses
[2013-01-01 12:02:09 -0500] bear: yep, that's the page I am reading now
[2013-01-01 12:02:16 -0500] renchap: it might be a good idea to install your VPN
[2013-01-01 12:02:20 -0500] renchap: before installing chef
[2013-01-01 12:02:28 -0500] renchap: with a very basic config
[2013-01-01 12:02:40 -0500] renchap: and then, when chef is installed, chef will replace it with the one from your cookbook
[2013-01-01 12:03:04 -0500] bear: that's what I was hoping to do with the .ssh/config file
[2013-01-01 15:36:59 -0500] pasties: Is there some documentation available on what is available within the run_context's resource_collection without actively running a cookbook? Is there some way to explore it with shef?
[2013-01-01 15:58:46 -0500] sklr: Hi
[2013-01-01 16:00:12 -0500] sklr: I'm passing json attributes to chef-client via -j in order to override deployment revisions.  This bit works fine, but of course the attribute is sticky; if I run chef-client again without -j the attribute has the value most recently set from JSON
[2013-01-01 16:00:50 -0500] sklr: is there any way of removing an attribute overriden in this way (ideally using chef-client), so that it falls back to the version set in the environment?
[2013-01-01 16:10:32 -0500] sklr: actually, i guess I can get around that with a default value and some trickery in the recipe
[2013-01-01 16:10:41 -0500] sklr: I'd still be interested in knowing if there's a proper way though
[2013-01-01 21:51:09 -0500] saas2013: hello, i am new to chef and i am trying to setup my infrastructure (postgres, mysql, nginx, php-fpm) for now, i am trying to setup everything in a test server. once in production, every database will have his own server. Is there a step-by-step documentation on how to connect clients and servers in, for example, mysql?
[2013-01-01 22:12:46 -0500] coderanger: saas2013_: Chef doesn't really care what kind of DB it is
[2013-01-01 22:13:03 -0500] coderanger: Just setup the roles on the right nodes, and use search() to find things when needed
[2013-01-01 22:14:27 -0500] saas2013_: i am still a bit confused about search. i can not see the whole picture, where can I read more about that?
[2013-01-01 22:14:52 -0500] coderanger: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_search.html
[2013-01-01 22:15:05 -0500] saas2013_: thank you coderanger
[2013-01-01 22:17:12 -0500] saas2013_: a final question. is there any example on the documentation on how to setup a client/server using the standard cookbooks? something like "node server.json" and "node client.json" with the attributes on the server, the passwords, etc..?
[2013-01-01 22:17:29 -0500] coderanger: 1) there are no "standard cookbooks"
[2013-01-01 22:18:00 -0500] coderanger: the opscode-maintained ones are not special in any way, just the ones we happen to use and maintain of good ones aren't from us though :)
[2013-01-01 22:18:06 -0500] coderanger: 2) check out the quickstart guides
[2013-01-01 22:18:17 -0500] coderanger: A bit out of date by now, but it would be something
[2013-01-01 22:20:21 -0500] saas2013_: i have everything setup already, chef-server and client and i have been setting up recipes and roles, but miss the glue with the attributes, data bags, etc..
[2013-01-01 22:20:42 -0500] coderanger: If you don't need them, then there is nothing to add
[2013-01-01 22:20:54 -0500] coderanger: data bags kind of sit off to the side, useful in some cases but not always
[2013-01-01 22:21:13 -0500] coderanger: and usually you don't touch node attrs directly, just set up overrides in roles and envs as needed
[2013-01-01 22:23:07 -0500] saas2013_: then, you mean that the right way to go is overriding attribute on client node like ["mysql"]["password"] = search(.)?
[2013-01-01 22:23:23 -0500] saas2013_: s/client node/role/
[2013-01-01 22:23:54 -0500] coderanger: DB passwords are an example where data bags might be the right way to go
[2013-01-01 22:24:20 -0500] coderanger: Depends on which way you want to drive things
[2013-01-01 22:24:31 -0500] coderanger: you can either let the DB server generate the passwords on the fly
[2013-01-01 22:24:35 -0500] saas2013_: the simpler, the better ;)
[2013-01-01 22:24:36 -0500] coderanger: or specify them all up front
[2013-01-01 22:25:00 -0500] coderanger: the former is simpler, but if you have an existing setup it is harder to integrate
[2013-01-01 22:26:42 -0500] saas2013_: my plan is to migrate everything into a chefist way and finally chef also the server. my idea is to bootstrap a whole new infrastructure and migrate the existing one to the automated one
[2013-01-01 22:27:36 -0500] coderanger: If you are going the self-generating way, then it looks like this usually
[2013-01-01 22:28:35 -0500] cwj: coderanger: i have a question about the django provider in application_python cookbook. is it the case that the provider should be looking for a requirements file in the release checked out from VCS repo?
[2013-01-01 22:28:37 -0500] coderanger: db_master = search(:node, 'roles:database-master').first; raise "No DB server found" unless db_master; password = db_master['mysql']['whatever_password']
[2013-01-01 22:28:49 -0500] cwj: i.e. https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application_python/blob/master/providers/django.rb#L49-L50
[2013-01-01 22:29:01 -0500] cwj: should it be searching under new_resource.release_path also?
[2013-01-01 22:29:03 -0500] coderanger: cwj: yes
[2013-01-01 22:29:07 -0500] coderanger: Hmm?
[2013-01-01 22:30:43 -0500] coderanger: cwj: Looks like that code is a bit out of sync with other changes
[2013-01-01 22:30:54 -0500] cwj: ok, i will submit my fix
[2013-01-01 22:31:02 -0500] cwj: i just wanted to make sure i understood the intent
[2013-01-01 22:31:20 -0500] cwj: guessing that it should search release_path instead of path, not in addition to path
[2013-01-01 22:32:03 -0500] coderanger: Is there even a #path on the resource anymore?
[2013-01-01 22:32:10 -0500] cwj: yes
[2013-01-01 22:32:28 -0500] cwj: its the root dir where the repo is checked out, shared directory is created etc
[2013-01-01 22:32:58 -0500] cwj: so i guess if you wanted to drop off a requirements file in there, you could override the one from the repo
[2013-01-01 22:33:04 -0500] cwj: but that feels like an antipattern
[2013-01-01 22:33:05 -0500] coderanger: Oh right, sub-resource objects delegate unknown methods to the app instance
[2013-01-01 22:33:16 -0500] cwj: ah
[2013-01-01 22:34:29 -0500] coderanger: Yeah, I think thats just an oversight
[2013-01-01 22:34:37 -0500] coderanger: No one noticed since it just always comes back false :)
[2013-01-01 22:50:29 -0500] cwj: opened COOK-2147 and provided fix
