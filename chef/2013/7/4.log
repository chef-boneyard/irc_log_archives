[2013-07-04 00:09:30 -0400] ignatz: amazing in that it took be two hours to figure out wtf was wrong
[2013-07-04 00:19:27 -0400] cwj: da clouuud
[2013-07-04 00:34:34 -0400] hakunin: Is recipe going to error out if you notify a resource that isn't declared?
[2013-07-04 00:35:23 -0400] hakunin: I think it does, in which case, can the error be avoided?
[2013-07-04 00:37:12 -0400] cwj: hakunin: you can put conditionals on notifications
[2013-07-04 00:37:23 -0400] hakunin: cwj: oh i didn't know
[2013-07-04 00:37:24 -0400] cwj: or you can subscribe instead of notify
[2013-07-04 00:37:38 -0400] hakunin: cwj: that i knew but it would be pretty awkward that way
[2013-07-04 00:38:07 -0400] hakunin: cwj: two unrelated resources would have to know of a list of almost 10 various config files
[2013-07-04 00:38:18 -0400] cwj: yeah depends on the project
[2013-07-04 00:38:47 -0400] hakunin: cwj: do you have a link for conditions?
[2013-07-04 00:38:52 -0400] hakunin: cwj: doc or example
[2013-07-04 00:39:21 -0400] cwj: notifies :restart, "service[foo]" if node[:roles].include?('foo')
[2013-07-04 00:39:25 -0400] cwj: or something like that
[2013-07-04 00:39:55 -0400] hakunin: cwj: oh you mean use ruby : )
[2013-07-04 00:40:12 -0400] hakunin: cwj: didn't think of that for some reason
[2013-07-04 00:40:15 -0400] hakunin: thanks
[2013-07-04 00:40:25 -0400] cwj: any time :)
[2013-07-04 00:41:01 -0400] hakunin: cwj: the condition info is available at compile time, so should work
[2013-07-04 02:11:26 -0400] johndeere: hey all
[2013-07-04 02:12:41 -0400] johndeere: I am trying to get my chef installation working but I am hitting walls. Yesterday I installed chef-server on ubuntu 12.04 in a lxc container. After installing all the tests pass. This morning however I am getting: Creating client pedant_admin_client... Encountered an error attempting to create client pedant_admin_client Response Code was: 500 Response Body was: {"error":["internal service error"]} Exception during Pedant credentials 
[2013-07-04 02:12:50 -0400] johndeere: any ideas?
[2013-07-04 02:32:34 -0400] johndeere: found the issue, jetty wasn't starting
[2013-07-04 02:48:18 -0400] joonas: ohai chefs
[2013-07-04 05:34:52 -0400] stormerider: so to disable ohai plugins inside chef, you add them to the blacklist in /etc/chef/client.rb. how can you disable them when running ohai manually?
[2013-07-04 06:13:55 -0400] coderanger: stormerider: -f option
[2013-07-04 06:16:29 -0400] stormerider: coderanger: i ended up figuring out how to do what i ultimately wanted, but for future reference, what needs to be in the file you pass with -f?
[2013-07-04 06:17:02 -0400] coderanger: Should just be the same options, its all just mixlib::config
[2013-07-04 06:27:48 -0400] stormerider: hm, not getting it working. no matter :) to migrate from hosted chef towards a private chef server, is there anything i need to do besides set up the new chef server, upload databags/envs/roles/cookbooks/clients and repoint the nodes at the new server? at 5 node cap currently and want to use some VMs and add in my windows boxes, too.
[2013-07-04 07:18:01 -0400] hippiehacker: Happy 4th
[2013-07-04 07:26:02 -0400] coderanger: stormerider: You'll need to fix the keys for all clients, but yes, also ACLs if you set any of those away from the defauls
[2013-07-04 07:26:48 -0400] stormerider: coderanger: if i download the clients from the HC with knife-backup, can't i reuse those?
[2013-07-04 07:26:58 -0400] stormerider: hippiehacker: likewise :)
[2013-07-04 07:27:01 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, that should take care of it
[2013-07-04 07:27:26 -0400] stormerider: also, are ACLs a HC/PC org thing?
[2013-07-04 07:28:44 -0400] bigbigbang: Ohai ! Can someone explain me what is Load balancing in chef open source ? And also vnode  ?
[2013-07-04 07:32:17 -0400] bigbigbang: chef expander has cluster worker ( vnode ) ? and chef-server-webui has worker too (not called vnode)
[2013-07-04 07:33:00 -0400] coderanger: bigbigbang: By default there is no load balancing or HA in open source chef
[2013-07-04 07:33:04 -0400] coderanger: stormerider: yes
[2013-07-04 07:33:20 -0400] coderanger: bigbigbang: vnode is a rabbitmq/amqp term
[2013-07-04 07:34:15 -0400] bigbigbang: coderanger: so what are all those attributes in chef-server recipe ? like HA , VIP  ??
[2013-07-04 07:34:23 -0400] bigbigbang: coderanger: thanks for helping
[2013-07-04 07:34:39 -0400] coderanger: which recipe do you mean?
[2013-07-04 07:35:21 -0400] bigbigbang: coderanger: the one that is in opt/chef-server/embedded/cookbooks/chef-server .. before you run chef-server-ctl reconfigure ..
[2013-07-04 07:36:04 -0400] coderanger: bigbigbang: Those are modified from our private chef config system, which does include HA support
[2013-07-04 07:36:29 -0400] coderanger: There are still some vestiges in open-source, but the bulk of the work you need to do yourself
[2013-07-04 07:38:03 -0400] bigbigbang: coderanger: ok that's what I was thinking ... just another question while you're here ... would it improve performance to add worker for chef-expander ?
[2013-07-04 07:38:30 -0400] coderanger: Not usually, the bottleneck is generally solr
[2013-07-04 07:40:49 -0400] bigbigbang: coderanger: all right then , mine is synchronised but must not be enough efficient , maybe I will look for solrcloud ..(to cluster instead of synchronise) thanks for your advice ;-)
[2013-07-04 07:43:23 -0400] coderanger: bigbigbang: What is your rate of object updates?
[2013-07-04 07:45:50 -0400] stormerider: coderanger: are all the omnibus 11 server packages for x64?
[2013-07-04 07:45:57 -0400] coderanger: Yes
[2013-07-04 07:46:06 -0400] coderanger: Pretty sure they don't make 32-bit servers anymore
[2013-07-04 07:46:10 -0400] coderanger: :)
[2013-07-04 07:47:06 -0400] bigbigbang: coderanger: Oh I don't know it yet .. I'm in internship in a regional bank and they ask me to look for automation system , I choosed chef, so now what they want is sort of HA/failover (more failover for now).. I think i will be for our hadoop cluster and also agent workstation .. so ~ 1500 nodes ..
[2013-07-04 07:47:14 -0400] stormerider: yeah, unfortunately my old VPSes have been kicking around since 32-bit days
[2013-07-04 07:47:54 -0400] coderanger: bigbigbang: I would highly recommend looking in to private chef, it isn't free, but it is battle tested and known to work for big HA deployments
[2013-07-04 07:48:00 -0400] coderanger: stormerider: lulz
[2013-07-04 07:48:49 -0400] coderanger: stormerider: heres a nickel, boot an EC2 instance ;-)
[2013-07-04 07:48:52 -0400] stormerider: coderanger: release upgrade by release upgrade :) ah well. time to ask Linode about how to migrate to x64 without having to pay 2x for a month anyways
[2013-07-04 07:49:28 -0400] stormerider: ive been avoiding setting up EC2 for myself. i have a feeling i would end up using it more than i should :P
[2013-07-04 07:50:53 -0400] bigbigbang: coderanger: they are big fan of open source too, so they prefer to use open source .. We have looked after private chef but if I can provide sort of similar thing (failover mostly) they will be happy, and doesn't care about having to configure chef everytime they have too ...
[2013-07-04 07:51:28 -0400] coderanger: bigbigbang: Private Chef is mostly open source components still, just with our added config expertise and packaging
[2013-07-04 07:51:52 -0400] stormerider: it's OSC with improvements and most importantly... paid support
[2013-07-04 07:52:15 -0400] coderanger: While I'm sure you are excellent at operations, it will be hard for you in a summer to rival a year-ish of a dedicated team and support staff :)
[2013-07-04 07:52:55 -0400] bigbigbang: coderanger: yeah for sure no doubt on that ! ^
[2013-07-04 07:55:14 -0400] bigbigbang: coderanger: But like I said i'm in internship ..."I don't really get any word to say ..on what they ask me to do .." I know private chef would be more efficient for them and much more "battle tested"
[2013-07-04 07:55:26 -0400] coderanger: scaling out a large, HA open source chef server cluster is certainly possible, but it would easily require a full-time team of 3-4 people to operate
[2013-07-04 07:55:43 -0400] coderanger: Just don't want to you set yourself up for failure
[2013-07-04 07:56:02 -0400] stormerider: especially when it comes to compliance audits and such
[2013-07-04 07:56:23 -0400] coderanger: At a minimum you need need to handle clustering and failover of postgres, solr, rabbitmq, the nginx proxy, and the bookshelf file data
[2013-07-04 07:56:55 -0400] coderanger: and then through load balancing in on top of that (though fortunately 1500 nodes isn't thaaaat many)
[2013-07-04 07:59:38 -0400] bigbigbang: coderanger: yeah that's what I was doing ( postgre master/slave , (could be master/master with burcado but company don't want it..) solr is for now synchronised, rabbitmq is clustered, bookshelf is replicated .. I didn't look the nginx part .. So for now it's more failover than HA ..
[2013-07-04 07:59:46 -0400] stormerider: huh, wow. i love how quick linode is at getting back to me on tickets. also, been with them 3 years as of today exactly :)
[2013-07-04 08:01:30 -0400] bigbigbang: coderanger: Is there something on the limits of a single instance of chef OSC ?
[2013-07-04 08:01:56 -0400] coderanger: bigbigbang: Not that I know of
[2013-07-04 08:02:30 -0400] coderanger: But OPC is the same basic components and we've seen small OPC clusters run 10k+ nodes @15m intervals
[2013-07-04 08:03:20 -0400] bigbigbang: coderanger: thanks
[2013-07-04 08:04:21 -0400] stormerider: coderanger: that's a nice stat to know.
[2013-07-04 08:10:21 -0400] bigbigbang: coderanger: You really point me out that HA will be quite hard to implement , I will more go to a sort of "clustered part" and "hot-standby" and hoping that the OSC limits won't be reached soon.. as it will be quite new in our company ..
[2013-07-04 08:11:18 -0400] coderanger: That works too, though getting smooth failover can be quite hard even in that kind of setup :)
[2013-07-04 08:11:28 -0400] coderanger: Depends on how H the HA needs to be
[2013-07-04 08:11:54 -0400] coderanger: If "someone has to poke at it for 15m to make sure services are all running" counts, then not so bad
[2013-07-04 08:12:01 -0400] coderanger: Otherwise, learn to love pacemaker configs :)
[2013-07-04 08:17:48 -0400] bigbigbang: coderanger: :-)
[2013-07-04 08:46:21 -0400] hdanak: Hi, does anyone know if there's a way to run a lwrp as a different user (or switch users in general)?
[2013-07-04 08:47:56 -0400] coderanger: hdanak: an LWRP is just a bit of Ruby code, it doesn't run as any user per se
[2013-07-04 08:48:15 -0400] hdanak: coderanger: I guess I mean, switch users for the duration of the lwrp action
[2013-07-04 08:48:28 -0400] coderanger: Again, that isn't a thing
[2013-07-04 08:48:30 -0400] coderanger: Its just code
[2013-07-04 08:48:41 -0400] coderanger: I think you mean change the user that subprocs will be run as
[2013-07-04 08:49:13 -0400] coderanger: To which the answer is that there is no global option for that, its a parameter to the shell_out help and to the execute and related resources
[2013-07-04 08:49:15 -0400] hdanak: coderanger: does the lwrp code run as a subprocess?
[2013-07-04 08:49:18 -0400] coderanger: No
[2013-07-04 08:49:50 -0400] coderanger: It is just a resource/provider like any other in Chef
[2013-07-04 09:50:07 -0400] stormerider: coderanger: what versions of windows 7 / 8 map to the ones listed for chef? 2008 and 2012?
[2013-07-04 09:54:16 -0400] bianster: getting "undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass" errors raised from /home/vagrant/chef-solo/cookbooks-1/nginx/recipes/ohai_plugin.rb:27:in `from_file' when trying to run the nginx::source recipe from knife solo
[2013-07-04 09:55:33 -0400] stormerider: that seems to be a blanket error as far as ive seen. look at what the code is actually trying to do on those lines as to what might be erroring.
[2013-07-04 10:14:24 -0400] maruq: stormerider: I'm pretty sure 2008 & 2012 refers to the server releases
[2013-07-04 10:16:25 -0400] maruq: stormerider: I'm not entirely sure about your question, but this cookbook may help: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/windows
[2013-07-04 10:22:04 -0400] stormerider: maruq: thanks, was looking for what installers to use but i got set up. now bit by the windows service bug fixed for 11.6 :) dont really need to do anything special with those at the moment, just looking to expand the reach of my dev environment right now.
[2013-07-04 10:27:15 -0400] maruq: stormerider: ah, okay. admittedly I haven't done much on the windows side, still learning ;)
[2013-07-04 10:27:37 -0400] stormerider: maruq: exactly why im setting these nodes up with chef ;)
[2013-07-04 10:28:10 -0400] stormerider: "why? because i CAN" *grin*
[2013-07-04 10:29:54 -0400] maruq: stormerider: "why? because then I don't have to go through 400 pages of GUIs to add a user!"
[2013-07-04 10:45:21 -0400] UukGoblin: in chef minitest, how do you check that one thing is equal to another?
[2013-07-04 10:45:53 -0400] UukGoblin: doing "stuff.nil?.should == false" fails with undefined method `should' for false:FalseClass
[2013-07-04 10:55:53 -0400] zaargy: UukGoblin: assert_equal
[2013-07-04 10:57:11 -0400] UukGoblin: zaargy, cheers thanks :-)
[2013-07-04 11:04:45 -0400] UukGoblin: zaargy, is there a list of assertions that I can make?
[2013-07-04 11:15:52 -0400] joshmyers: hey guys, I im using the notify resource
[2013-07-04 11:16:07 -0400] joshmyers: how can I find out what notified it???
[2013-07-04 11:32:55 -0400] CaptainQuirk: Hi there !
[2013-07-04 11:33:20 -0400] CaptainQuirk: Was wondering how to deal with tasks that cannot be handled by chef
[2013-07-04 11:33:31 -0400] CaptainQuirk: in an intelligent way
[2013-07-04 11:34:06 -0400] CaptainQuirk: example, trying to write a lwrp I stumbled accross a bug in an npm module
[2013-07-04 11:34:42 -0400] CaptainQuirk: a --quite switch that doesn't prevent a progress bar to be used
[2013-07-04 11:35:07 -0400] CaptainQuirk: There is no way for me to integrate this in my chef provisioning for the moment
[2013-07-04 11:35:50 -0400] gudmundur: shouldn't the chef server block uploads of a modified cookbook with the same version number?
[2013-07-04 11:36:24 -0400] CaptainQuirk: But, if I have to do some things manually, is there a built-in or standard way to do it
[2013-07-04 11:48:48 -0400] zaargy: UukGoblin: http://bfts.rubyforge.org/minitest/MiniTest/Assertions.html
[2013-07-04 11:57:56 -0400] geewiz: gudmundur: Only if the version has been explicitly frozen.
[2013-07-04 12:01:37 -0400] CaptainQuirk: does it happen to move task that cannot be provisionned by chef to some scripts
[2013-07-04 12:01:43 -0400] CaptainQuirk: to execute afterwards
[2013-07-04 12:06:11 -0400] daxroc1: How do I install an rpm package from a local source using chef solo?
[2013-07-04 12:38:15 -0400] CaptainQuirk: daxroc1, there is a dpkg_resource for direct debian package install
[2013-07-04 12:38:26 -0400] CaptainQuirk: maybe there is the equivalent for rpm ?
[2013-07-04 12:39:40 -0400] meineerde: daxroc1: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_rpm_package.html
[2013-07-04 12:40:03 -0400] meineerde: use the source attribute
[2013-07-04 12:45:05 -0400] daxroc1: CaptainQuirk: Thanks
[2013-07-04 12:45:12 -0400] daxroc1: meineerde: Appreciate it
[2013-07-04 12:46:32 -0400] adam_: hi...anyone have some ideas on how to handle distribution of private keys with chef? will encrypted data bags be enough for that? or should it be handled differently?
[2013-07-04 12:50:56 -0400] meineerde: adam_: that's one on the few remaining hard issues in general :)
[2013-07-04 12:51:34 -0400] meineerde: adam_: I personally use encrypted data bags for some keys, webservices for others and some never leave their origin box...
[2013-07-04 12:51:58 -0400] meineerde: it ll depends on what you need to do with the keys and how paranoid you are :)
[2013-07-04 12:53:25 -0400] null_route: Hi all - Does anyone here use the git plugin on knife spork?
[2013-07-04 12:53:56 -0400] adam_: meineerde: thanks for the input. i think for my purposes encrypted data bags will work, but it's nice to hear someone else's opinion on that too
[2013-07-04 13:26:04 -0400] joshmyers: hey guys, using a notify resource, how can I tell what has caused the notify to restart a service?
[2013-07-04 13:32:39 -0400] maruq: joshmyers: the client.log should tell you, no?
[2013-07-04 13:36:30 -0400] joshmyers: erm, it may do, but that's I want to be able to access it from within my cookbook
[2013-07-04 13:39:44 -0400] jleveque: Hello
[2013-07-04 13:40:56 -0400] jleveque: I see a weird knife ssh behaviour : when I run the command with knife ssh it fails, and when running the same command 'sudo service pacemaker start' from the same user account locally it starts ok. Always
[2013-07-04 13:41:58 -0400] jleveque: Do you have an explanation for those who know knife ssh internals ?
[2013-07-04 14:28:46 -0400] stormerider: jleveque: what's the error when it fails? might be sudo being configured to require a tty
[2013-07-04 15:02:33 -0400] jleveque: stormerider, I would need to digg in but thing is there is no error message but pacemaker fails to start properly. Thanks for the tty tip
[2013-07-04 15:02:57 -0400] stormerider: np.
[2013-07-04 15:07:16 -0400] stormerider: so im running into a conflict between logstash and chef-server, since they both use rabbitmq-server. they don't seem to want to co-exist on the same box; is there some config i need to tweak so that they'll identify as different configs/realms/whatever? or can i disable the rabbitmq-server from the omnibus chef and point it at the OS install?
[2013-07-04 15:12:53 -0400] cwj: its probably possible to configure each for a specific vhost on the same rabbitmq broker instance
[2013-07-04 15:13:43 -0400] cwj: we use hosted chef so i am not much help when it comes to configuring chef server these days
[2013-07-04 15:14:33 -0400] stormerider: *nod* i just migrated off of HC for my personal setup because i needed to go beyond 5 nodes
[2013-07-04 15:15:38 -0400] stormerider: and yet paying for HC/PC for dev environment is a bit overkill :)
[2013-07-04 16:01:28 -0400] _JamieD_: anyone know if there's a better way to change a users password than to drop and re-create the user when using the database cookbook? https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/database
[2013-07-04 16:03:46 -0400] gchristensen: _JamieD_: you can ... use SQL :)
[2013-07-04 16:11:14 -0400] _JamieD_: gchristensen: how ditry! ;)
[2013-07-04 16:12:47 -0400] gchristensen: you can only abstract away so much
[2013-07-04 16:15:06 -0400] _JamieD_: would be nice to update the cookbook to support changing a password but I don't have time to do it correctly at the moment, so a dirty hack is will have to be.
[2013-07-04 16:15:32 -0400] _JamieD_: what would be the best way to check if a users password needs changing?
[2013-07-04 16:16:35 -0400] _JamieD_: I guess either attempt to use mysql with the credentials or hash then compare passwords
[2013-07-04 16:17:31 -0400] gchristensen: probably so
[2013-07-04 16:24:19 -0400] ehaselwanter: ohai :-)
[2013-07-04 16:24:32 -0400] s2r2_: hi
[2013-07-04 16:24:38 -0400] ehaselwanter: weird problem with search on chef server 10.18.2
[2013-07-04 16:25:10 -0400] ehaselwanter: can not find knife search node roles:<any-role>
[2013-07-04 16:25:21 -0400] ehaselwanter: of roles shown in knife node show
[2013-07-04 16:25:34 -0400] ehaselwanter: any idea?
[2013-07-04 16:30:58 -0400] stormerider: ehaselwanter: i would guess that chef-solr is having issues.
[2013-07-04 16:31:07 -0400] ehaselwanter: yes
[2013-07-04 16:31:19 -0400] ehaselwanter: I guess that too. re-indexing does not help
[2013-07-04 16:31:19 -0400] stormerider: check the logs for it?
[2013-07-04 16:31:36 -0400] coderanger: ehaselwanter: Also worth noting that roles: is only updated after a chef run
[2013-07-04 16:31:59 -0400] coderanger: so if you update a node's run list it will show up in the node show output, but not be searchable until a run completes
[2013-07-04 16:32:18 -0400] ehaselwanter: we have successful chef runs
[2013-07-04 16:32:31 -0400] ehaselwanter: try it again
[2013-07-04 16:35:26 -0400] aruntomar: any suggestions or experiences, as to which orchestration tool to use with chef eg: ironfan or rundeck etc.
[2013-07-04 16:36:46 -0400] ehaselwanter: ok. re-run chef-client. client-run successful
[2013-07-04 16:36:53 -0400] ehaselwanter: still no search result
[2013-07-04 16:38:59 -0400] ehaselwanter: roles is an attribute of the node. right?
[2013-07-04 16:39:18 -0400] gchristensen: yes
[2013-07-04 16:39:19 -0400] coderanger: aruntomar: I use fabric
[2013-07-04 16:39:41 -0400] coderanger: ehaselwanter: Okay, next question is do you see opscode-expander running on the server
[2013-07-04 16:39:41 -0400] gchristensen: is spice-weasel a poor-man's fabric?
[2013-07-04 16:39:55 -0400] coderanger: gchristensen: No, more like poor mans cloud formation
[2013-07-04 16:40:03 -0400] coderanger: except that it predates cloudformat so lol
[2013-07-04 16:40:05 -0400] gchristensen: aahh
[2013-07-04 16:40:11 -0400] ehaselwanter: coderanger: chef-expander?
[2013-07-04 16:40:24 -0400] ehaselwanter: restarting and trying again
[2013-07-04 16:40:30 -0400] coderanger: ehaselwanter: Yes, it is a daemon that should be running on your server
[2013-07-04 16:40:45 -0400] coderanger: Thats what takes stuff out of rabbitmq and updates the solr index
[2013-07-04 16:40:50 -0400] ehaselwanter: knife search node *:* -a roles gives back the roles we want to search for
[2013-07-04 16:41:26 -0400] stormerider: hm. anyone know how i might go about configuring chef-server's rabbitmq to use a different hostname than the OS default? trying to get two rabbitmqs to play together (since logstash cookbook requires a system rabbitmq)
[2013-07-04 16:42:49 -0400] coderanger: ehaselwanter: Thats not related
[2013-07-04 16:43:07 -0400] coderanger: stormerider: Pretty sure it will only use the system's FQDN
[2013-07-04 16:43:20 -0400] coderanger: or at least thats how we do it, and I know its a PITA about hostnames
[2013-07-04 16:43:42 -0400] ehaselwanter: coderanger: restarted chef-expander => not in the search result
[2013-07-04 16:43:44 -0400] stormerider: yeah.
[2013-07-04 16:44:01 -0400] ehaselwanter: coderanger: re-run chef-client => now we get it back
[2013-07-04 16:44:14 -0400] coderanger: ehaselwanter: issue a re-index then, in chef 10 that was `knife reindex`
[2013-07-04 16:44:22 -0400] coderanger: Also of note: you should move to chef 11 server ASAP
[2013-07-04 16:44:33 -0400] ehaselwanter: coderanger: we did that as the very first task
[2013-07-04 16:44:37 -0400] ehaselwanter: did not help
[2013-07-04 16:44:59 -0400] ehaselwanter: we used knife index rebuild
[2013-07-04 16:45:13 -0400] coderanger: ehaselwanter: Yes, if you did that while expander was down or hung, it wouldn't help :)
[2013-07-04 16:45:22 -0400] ehaselwanter: ahhhh
[2013-07-04 16:45:31 -0400] stormerider: alternatively, is there a way to tell an omnibus install to ignore the embedded rabbitmq and use the system one instead?
[2013-07-04 16:45:56 -0400] ehaselwanter: coderanger: any indication sign if expander hangs?
[2013-07-04 16:45:57 -0400] coderanger: stormerider: Probably, look through the chef-server.rb flags
[2013-07-04 16:46:11 -0400] ehaselwanter: other that the obvious "search is broken" ;-)
[2013-07-04 16:46:17 -0400] aruntomar: coderanger: from what i know about fabric is it's primarily used for app deployment and is similar to capistrano
[2013-07-04 16:46:20 -0400] coderanger: ehaselwanter: You can check solr for the last document update time
[2013-07-04 16:46:36 -0400] coderanger: aruntomar: Its just a scripted SSH client
[2013-07-04 16:46:51 -0400] coderanger: aruntomar: Most of my tasks just happen to end with sudo('chef-client')
[2013-07-04 16:47:01 -0400] coderanger: aruntomar: Check out pychef.fabric for a bunch of nice integration stuffs
[2013-07-04 16:49:03 -0400] aruntomar: coderanger: k, i'll look into that. thanks.
[2013-07-04 16:49:49 -0400] ocharles: Hello. I have a template that refers to some attributes, but I'd like these attributes to be entirely optional. I'm currently doing '<% unless @dbdefs.gpg_sign_key.nil? -%>', but that's apparently not good enough because I get an error like 'Attribute gpg_sign_key is not defined!' if I specify 'dbdefs => {}'
[2013-07-04 16:49:57 -0400] ocharles: is there a way around that? or do I really have to provide defaults for all these attributes?
[2013-07-04 16:50:24 -0400] coderanger: ocharles: What does the data you are giving the template look like?
[2013-07-04 16:50:39 -0400] coderanger: Do you mean to do @dbdefs['gpg_sign_key']?
[2013-07-04 16:50:55 -0400] ocharles: coderanger: @dbefs is a hash, so perhaps
[2013-07-04 16:51:07 -0400] ocharles: it does seem to work with dot, if I fill all the values in
[2013-07-04 16:51:23 -0400] ocharles: I'm afraid my Ruby is not as strong as my Perl :)
[2013-07-04 16:51:26 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, thats Chef's Mash class "helping" you
[2013-07-04 16:51:33 -0400] gchristensen: ocharles: ruby is close enough to perl :P
[2013-07-04 16:51:34 -0400] coderanger: Just use the normal hash access
[2013-07-04 16:51:36 -0400] ocharles: ok
[2013-07-04 16:51:43 -0400] ocharles: so @dbdefs['gpg_sign_key'].nil?
[2013-07-04 16:52:02 -0400] coderanger: ocharles: You can just do "if @dbdefs['gpg_sign_key']"
[2013-07-04 16:52:19 -0400] coderanger: .nil? is only needed if you need to tell if it is nil or false
[2013-07-04 16:52:20 -0400] ocharles: what is ruby's definition of truth? the same as perl? (anything but '' and '0')?
[2013-07-04 16:52:35 -0400] coderanger: only null and false are false-y
[2013-07-04 16:52:40 -0400] coderanger: everything else is true-y
[2013-07-04 16:52:42 -0400] ocharles: yay, more sane than perl
[2013-07-04 16:52:59 -0400] coderanger: And yet still a royal pain, Python ftw
[2013-07-04 16:53:29 -0400] ocharles: Well, I'm still a Haskell programmer at heart, which is still my favourite form of truth (nothing but booleans)
[2013-07-04 16:53:36 -0400] ocharles: but we digress :)
[2013-07-04 16:53:41 -0400] ocharles: thanks for the help!
[2013-07-04 17:03:21 -0400] ehaselwanter: coderanger: think we figured out what is going on
[2013-07-04 17:07:08 -0400] ehaselwanter: some config change on rabbitmq did lead to not updating the index anymore ...
[2013-07-04 17:07:44 -0400] ehaselwanter: still. why does a restart of expander and a re-index afterwards not fully recover the search?
[2013-07-04 17:09:24 -0400] coderanger: It should, might just take some time
[2013-07-04 17:10:52 -0400] ehaselwanter: some time is 15sec, right? there is this timeout
[2013-07-04 17:10:55 -0400] ehaselwanter: did not help.
[2013-07-04 17:10:59 -0400] ehaselwanter: hm. hm.
[2013-07-04 17:11:05 -0400] coderanger: Depends on how much data you have
[2013-07-04 17:11:06 -0400] ehaselwanter: will investigate further
[2013-07-04 17:11:15 -0400] ehaselwanter: very small cluster
[2013-07-04 17:11:16 -0400] coderanger: A full re-index on hosted chef takes something like 3 days :)
[2013-07-04 17:11:18 -0400] ehaselwanter: 3 nodes
[2013-07-04 17:11:24 -0400] ehaselwanter: ;-)
[2013-07-04 17:11:24 -0400] coderanger: Then yeah, should be fast
[2013-07-04 17:11:48 -0400] gchristensen: also you should look at hosted chef :) isn't it free for 3 nodes?
[2013-07-04 17:11:58 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, up to 5 is free
[2013-07-04 17:11:59 -0400] gchristensen: unless you have extenuating circumstances
[2013-07-04 17:12:03 -0400] ehaselwanter: but the re-index would take the data from chef-server and push it again to solr, right?
[2013-07-04 17:12:27 -0400] coderanger: Yes, via rabbitmq
[2013-07-04 17:13:13 -0400] ehaselwanter: gchristensen: thx. ;-)
[2013-07-04 18:08:59 -0400] stormerider_: coderanger: by the way, if anyone runs into the same issue with two rabbitmqs on the same box, i figured it out: http://stormerider.com/blog/2013/07/04/running-a-system-rabbitmq-on-a-server-with-chef-server/
[2013-07-04 19:46:35 -0400] fly9: anyone using the elasticsearch cookbook that can give me a hand?
[2013-07-04 19:47:01 -0400] fly9: it seems to be ignoring my attributes
[2013-07-04 19:47:16 -0400] fly9: ref: https://gist.github.com/stevepereira/5929555
[2013-07-04 19:50:20 -0400] stormerider_: fly9: try override_attributes instead of default?
[2013-07-04 19:51:25 -0400] fly9: @stormerider in the role file?
[2013-07-04 19:51:37 -0400] fly9: never done that but I'll try
[2013-07-04 20:01:22 -0400] fly9: @stormerider that worked! thanks! man I had no idea that was a thing
[2013-07-04 20:01:35 -0400] stormerider: fly9: np.
[2013-07-04 20:26:50 -0400] netty195: hi all
[2013-07-04 20:28:09 -0400] netty195: with Open source chef-server, to remove  a node, do I need to do both :
[2013-07-04 20:28:10 -0400] netty195: knife node delete <node-name>
[2013-07-04 20:28:11 -0400] netty195: knife client delete <node-name>
[2013-07-04 20:30:29 -0400] coderanger: Yes
[2013-07-04 20:30:39 -0400] coderanger: Though I think there is now an option for node delete to clear the client too
[2013-07-04 20:30:44 -0400] coderanger: but its two API calls no matter what
[2013-07-04 20:32:42 -0400] netty195: doesn't says yet about the new option in docs yet:
[2013-07-04 20:32:42 -0400] netty195: http://docs.opscode.com/knife_node.html
[2013-07-04 20:32:55 -0400] netty195: just pointing out, if it helps
[2013-07-04 20:33:01 -0400] netty195: thanks for your help
[2013-07-04 20:37:29 -0400] coderanger: Looks like we didn't add it to node delete
[2013-07-04 20:37:36 -0400] coderanger: only to the cloud server delete commands
[2013-07-04 20:48:43 -0400] netty195: I think you mean knife azure and such
[2013-07-04 20:49:16 -0400] coderanger: Yes
[2013-07-04 20:49:17 -0400] netty195: can you see if it 'node delete' gets this as well? :)
[2013-07-04 20:49:38 -0400] coderanger: Just build it into your delete scripts
[2013-07-04 20:53:27 -0400] netty195: very new to Chef and ruby, so can't think of such simple things. thanks for the tip
[2013-07-04 21:46:58 -0400] stormerider: i thought there was a purge command/option that did both, but its been a while since i tried that
[2013-07-04 21:48:13 -0400] stormerider: might be specific to ec2 though
[2013-07-04 21:48:28 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, --purge on the cloud delete commands kills the node and client
[2013-07-04 23:48:06 -0400] visof: hello
[2013-07-04 23:49:43 -0400] visof: i have this error when trying knife node list http://pastebin.com/gmBVciGX
[2013-07-04 23:49:57 -0400] visof: i have changed my .pem key
[2013-07-04 23:50:04 -0400] visof: but i got the same problem
