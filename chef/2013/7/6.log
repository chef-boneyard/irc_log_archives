[2013-07-06 00:32:54 -0400] banachtarski: how can I leverage chef resources inside a ruby block?
[2013-07-06 00:33:25 -0400] banachtarski: for example, suppose I wanted to use ruby logic to decide between running one resource versus another one
[2013-07-06 00:33:33 -0400] banachtarski: what's the correct idiom to do this?
[2013-07-06 00:38:28 -0400] coderanger: banachtarski: You mean ruby logic that can only happen at execution time?
[2013-07-06 00:38:37 -0400] coderanger: or rather, what kind of logic are you trying to write?
[2013-07-06 00:43:48 -0400] banachtarski: at execution time yes
[2013-07-06 00:44:20 -0400] banachtarski: coderanger: so basically, i want to choose what resources get applied based on the result of another resource
[2013-07-06 00:46:00 -0400] coderanger: banachtarski: You just have to use the resources as raw Ruby classes then
[2013-07-06 00:46:27 -0400] coderanger: This is generally not recommended as multi-tier convergent systems can be really hard to debug
[2013-07-06 00:46:46 -0400] coderanger: but just instantiate the resource class and call run_action on it
[2013-07-06 00:46:58 -0400] coderanger: you'll need to pass through the current run_context too
[2013-07-06 00:51:32 -0400] coderanger: In general it is better to have it controlled declaratively, enforce state rather than query it

[2013-07-06 04:09:10 -0400] koaps: heh nice
[2013-07-06 04:10:49 -0400] koaps: i'm trying to figure out when you create a provider, and call it like myprovider "something" do ... end  how do you get the "something" part? it seems to require passing a name, but I'm not sure how you get it in the provider
[2013-07-06 04:15:31 -0400] coderanger: new_resource.name
[2013-07-06 04:16:22 -0400] koaps: is it always "name" or is it what I have the :name_attribute set to true on?
[2013-07-06 04:16:35 -0400] koaps: in the resource file
[2013-07-06 04:18:35 -0400] coderanger: name will always work, but if you set something else as name_attribute it acts as an alias
[2013-07-06 04:20:10 -0400] koaps: humm not sure why its giving me grief, does the name of the provider need to match the attribute? I looked at how the rabbitmq cookbook does the vhost but it does have vhost as the name of the provider and the attribute
[2013-07-06 04:20:51 -0400] coderanger: Not sure what you mean, but if you pastebin some code I can look
[2013-07-06 04:23:28 -0400] flaccid: i'm looking at https://github.com/opscode/chef/commit/43d01dcc6bfc44571d72a2e9bc4f32524f547ea7 but i don't think a new gem has been rendered yet?
[2013-07-06 04:23:45 -0400] flaccid: its from http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3933

[2013-07-06 04:26:25 -0400] koaps: coderanger: I'm having to pass it ssl_name, but I wanted it to pick that up from the part passed in to provider, the 'server' value
[2013-07-06 04:26:27 -0400] coderanger: koaps: And which part isn't working?
[2013-07-06 04:27:09 -0400] coderanger: koaps: Oh, you are using new_resource.ssl_name
[2013-07-06 04:27:13 -0400] coderanger: change that to #name :)
[2013-07-06 04:28:31 -0400] koaps: ok, so the resource attribute ssl_name having the :name_attribute => true doesn't control that part?
[2013-07-06 04:29:22 -0400] flaccid: does 11.6 rc actually include https://github.com/opscode/chef/commit/43d01dcc6bfc44571d72a2e9bc4f32524f547ea7 ?

[2013-07-06 04:37:05 -0400] koaps: coderanger: oh ok, I think I found my issue, must be some order of operations issue
[2013-07-06 04:37:54 -0400] koaps: having ssl_name being required fails before it becomes an alias for the name attribute
[2013-07-06 04:38:32 -0400] coderanger: name_attribute is really often more trouble than its worth
[2013-07-06 04:38:40 -0400] coderanger: Mildly useful for self-documention
[2013-07-06 04:39:27 -0400] koaps: i was mostly following the rabbitmq cookbook on how it handled the vhosts, since I didn't know much about LWRP's, guess this is one of those gotcas
[2013-07-06 04:40:01 -0400] coderanger: name_attribute: true ~= default: self.name
[2013-07-06 14:25:02 -0400] avalarion: Hey ho, I am trying to use chef-solo for my first steps. I found https://github.com/shingara/oh-my-zsh-chef and would like to enable that for only one user on my vagrant box, but I do not understand what I have to write into the default.rb of my recipe...
[2013-07-06 14:51:51 -0400] maruq: avalarion: It looks like you'd set the attribute with node.default[:oh_my_zsh][:users] = [{... the users & prefs go here ...}]
[2013-07-06 14:52:14 -0400] maruq: (assuming you want it at the default level, and are defining the attribute in a recipe)
[2013-07-06 14:52:23 -0400] avalarion: maruq: so I just missed node.default?
[2013-07-06 14:52:29 -0400] avalarion: give me a moment to check that =)
[2013-07-06 14:52:35 -0400] maruq: and then you would add the cookbook to the run list
[2013-07-06 14:53:28 -0400] maruq: avalarion: I think so. set that attribute & add "recipe['oh_my_zsh']" to the run_list
[2013-07-06 14:56:54 -0400] Moltar: Hello.  Is there a recommend way to check if an app's version (saved in a text file), and tell Chef to exit the recipe early if the version is already current?
[2013-07-06 14:57:14 -0400] avalarion: as I cloned the folder it is named oh-my-zsh-chef right now... Do I need to edit that array fields name?
[2013-07-06 14:57:27 -0400] avalarion: maruq: I just get: Cannot find a resource for oh_my_zsh_chef on debian version 6.0.7
[2013-07-06 14:57:31 -0400] Moltar: e.g. do you wrap the entire deploy portion in an only-if statement?
[2013-07-06 14:59:27 -0400] maruq: avalarion: did you add it to the run list?
[2013-07-06 14:59:46 -0400] avalarion: before my own cookbook, yep
[2013-07-06 15:00:36 -0400] avalarion: maruq:         run_list << "recipe[oh-my-zsh-chef]"
[2013-07-06 15:00:36 -0400] avalarion:         run_list << "recipe[bbnetz]"
[2013-07-06 15:00:49 -0400] avalarion: and I added those lines to bbnetz
[2013-07-06 15:00:56 -0400] maruq: avalarion: you may need "depends 'oh-my-zsh'" in your cookbook, depending on what you're doing
[2013-07-06 15:01:07 -0400] Moltar: For clarification, I already created the Ruby block that compares the version. I am just wondering how to do the 'exit now' part.
[2013-07-06 15:03:18 -0400] maruq: Moltar: you could use an only_if clause on the installer block
[2013-07-06 15:03:26 -0400] maruq: Moltar: or not_if
[2013-07-06 15:04:04 -0400] maruq: Moltar: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_common.html#conditionals
[2013-07-06 15:04:55 -0400] maruq: there's an example about running a bash block, but not_if a file exists.
[2013-07-06 15:05:36 -0400] avalarion: maruq: I wrote "depends 'oh_my_zsh'" actually the folder is named oh-my-zsh-chef. In my Vagrantfile I include "oh-my-zsh-chef". Do I need to adjust the foldersname?
[2013-07-06 15:05:59 -0400] Moltar: maruq: Great - thanks a lot. I'll use that then.
[2013-07-06 15:06:36 -0400] avalarion: maruq: As I still get: FATAL: NameError: Cannot find a resource for depends on debian version 6.0.7
[2013-07-06 15:07:11 -0400] maruq: avalarion: the cookbook declare's it's name as "oh_my_zsh", so it should find it
[2013-07-06 15:07:27 -0400] maruq: Moltar: no worries ;)
[2013-07-06 15:08:12 -0400] maruq: avalarion: you have the cookbook available to vagrant? Ie. checked out locally?
[2013-07-06 15:08:30 -0400] maruq: er, as in it's in the cookbooks dir you passed to vagrant
[2013-07-06 15:08:47 -0400] avalarion: one moment, I guess I found the mistake
[2013-07-06 15:09:09 -0400] avalarion: did not work...
[2013-07-06 15:10:15 -0400] avalarion: maruq: the cookbook is a submodule of my bbnetz cookbook repo. /REPO/bbnetz <- full dir and /REPO/oh-my-zsh-chef <- git submodule
[2013-07-06 15:10:39 -0400] maruq: okay, and vagrant knows that path?
[2013-07-06 15:11:12 -0400] maruq: there's an option you pass in to tell it how to find your cookbooks
[2013-07-06 15:11:19 -0400] avalarion: yep. My user and the whole apache config is handled in bbnetz right now
[2013-07-06 15:11:51 -0400] avalarion: will split it up later, first I wanted to understand how everything is working
[2013-07-06 15:13:55 -0400] maruq: avalarion: okay. sorry, I don't quite know enough at the moment. I can maybe fire up a vm & look, once I'm done with the current vms ;)
[2013-07-06 15:14:22 -0400] avalarion: no hurry, it's only ssh, that is not that important
[2013-07-06 15:14:54 -0400] avalarion: https://git.typo3.org/Teams/Server/Vagrant/Typo3Org.git/blob/HEAD:/site-cookbooks/t3org/recipes/default.rb is my basic file I am trying to understand^^
[2013-07-06 15:22:21 -0400] avalarion: maruq: If I enser a wrong one I have problems... My Runlist has oh_my_zsh than bbnetz. bbnetz depends on oh_my_zsh but fails loading. Makes no sense at all...
[2013-07-06 15:24:38 -0400] maruq: avalarion: can you get the oh-my-zsh to run by itself?
[2013-07-06 15:25:38 -0400] avalarion: it's after my apache cook book but did not enter anything in my Debug CLI output
[2013-07-06 15:33:16 -0400] maruq: hmm... I'm not entirely sure. can you get to the cookbook cache on the vagrant node?
[2013-07-06 15:33:31 -0400] maruq: I believe it's something like /var/cache/chef ?
[2013-07-06 15:34:37 -0400] maruq: see if there's anything in there that looks like the cookbook
[2013-07-06 15:34:49 -0400] avalarion: maruq: please don't hate me... I missed a : I guess^^
[2013-07-06 15:35:14 -0400] maruq: avalarion: haha, it's fine
[2013-07-06 15:35:19 -0400] maruq: so you got it working?
[2013-07-06 15:35:27 -0400] avalarion: yep, it is =)
[2013-07-06 15:35:46 -0400] maruq: great!
[2013-07-06 15:36:23 -0400] maruq: also, I would advise maybe breaking that default.rb out to a few smaller recipes & calling them from default.rb, but it's totally formatting
[2013-07-06 15:37:02 -0400] maruq: glad you got it working though

[2013-07-06 18:54:15 -0400] coderanger: Is rpm.pbone.net still state of the art for checking what packages exist for rhel/fedora flavors?
[2013-07-06 19:37:11 -0400] patcon: Just a heads up, but finding hints of a significant issue with a attributes files not being properly included from a corresponding recipe that is run by "include_recipe"
[2013-07-06 19:38:20 -0400] patcon: it has to do with a revamp of the percona cookbook, which leverages the mysql cookbook, replaces its package (set as attributes) with percona ones
[2013-07-06 19:40:26 -0400] patcon: i'll file a ticket when I have time to investigate more, but just wanted to get this indexed in the irc logs :)
[2013-07-06 19:44:59 -0400] coderanger: patcon: Thats correct?
[2013-07-06 19:45:12 -0400] coderanger: I mean thats how it is supposed to work, include_recipe only runs the recipe files
[2013-07-06 19:45:47 -0400] coderanger: however as long as your metadata has the depends on the other cookbook, it will be present for the attribute load and attributes are loaded for all cookbook in the dependency set
[2013-07-06 19:50:42 -0400] patcon: coderanger: ah really?? wow. i had no idea. funny it hasn't exploded sooner then :)
[2013-07-06 19:50:46 -0400] patcon: thanks man!
[2013-07-06 19:52:59 -0400] coderanger: patcon: I mean it should have exploded earlier because if the mysql cookbook wasn't being loaded, it wouldn't be present for the include_recipe
[2013-07-06 19:53:01 -0400] patcon: coderanger: so wait... the include_recipe is for a recipe in the same cookbook, so its maybe not so simple.
[2013-07-06 19:53:03 -0400] coderanger: unless you are using chef-solo
[2013-07-06 19:53:12 -0400] patcon: yep, that's what I'm using
[2013-07-06 19:53:42 -0400] coderanger: Hah, part of the contract of using solo is you have to make your own runtime set algorithm :)
[2013-07-06 19:53:55 -0400] coderanger: Since ours is baked into chef-server
[2013-07-06 19:54:18 -0400] patcon: no pressure troubleshoot for me here, but for context: percona::server includes percona::client, and each has a respective attribute file that does a "normal" level override of the respective myql packages
[2013-07-06 19:54:18 -0400] coderanger: berkshelf and librarian are both options for that, or just doing it by hand
[2013-07-06 19:54:44 -0400] patcon: ah hey, yep, using berkshelf since I'm finding this while writing test-kitchen support :)
[2013-07-06 19:54:50 -0400] coderanger: If you want to make the attr stuff explicit you can use include_attributes 'mysql' or something
[2013-07-06 19:55:01 -0400] coderanger: but in theory that shouldn't be required if your metadata is setup correctly
[2013-07-06 19:55:37 -0400] patcon: anyhow, i think i still have some mileage before I'm out of troubleshooting power. I'll file a ticket if i find anything i can explain as a legit bug
[2013-07-06 19:55:48 -0400] patcon: WHOA. "inlcude attribute"???

[2013-07-06 19:56:12 -0400] coderanger: yes, include_attributes also exists similar to include_recipe, but is almost never needed since chef 0.10
[2013-07-06 19:56:25 -0400] coderanger: because we changed it to load attributes from cookbook files in runlist order
[2013-07-06 19:56:38 -0400] coderanger: or rather, in topological order
[2013-07-06 19:56:47 -0400] patcon: I'll see if that solves it. if it DOES, would that lead you to believe its a bug?
[2013-07-06 19:56:56 -0400] coderanger: Indeed
[2013-07-06 19:57:08 -0400] patcon: ok coolio. thanks again coderanger
[2013-07-06 19:57:11 -0400] coderanger: I'm going afk for a bit to find lunch though
[2013-07-06 20:11:22 -0400] patcon: coderanger: enjoy lunch! think I figured out the issue. Was setting default attr for version in attributes/default.rb, then trying to have logic for the package_name attr in attributes/client.rb based on node['percona']['version']. it was "nil", so it was doing some wonky stuff :)
[2013-07-06 20:30:00 -0400] patcon: coderanger: for the record, seems that I needed `include_attribute "percona::default"` in attributes/client.rb and attributes/server.rb in order for the version logic (with version set in attributes/default.rb). The attributes seem to load properly in the first run, but fail in all subsequent
[2013-07-06 20:31:11 -0400] patcon: I'll probably write a test using chef-stage to test for this sort of regression, since there's lots of indirection in the kinda cookbook like percona that uses mysql as a dep: https://github.com/ranjib/chef-stage
[2013-07-06 20:31:57 -0400] patcon: or maybe I should file a ticket with test-kitchen so that a "double converge" is possible :)
[2013-07-06 20:33:02 -0400] patcon: perhaps for certain suites...? cc: jtimberman fnichol ^^
[2013-07-06 20:39:54 -0400] patcon: FYI, opened an issue: https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen/issues/162

[2013-07-06 21:42:46 -0400] shupp: Hi folks.  I'm new to chef, am running chef-server myself, and am getting "EROOR: Failed to upload  : 501 Not Implemented" when I try to upload a cookbook to my server.  Here's a gist of the output:  https://gist.github.com/shupp/bf4dfbc430a01fed8544  - Any thoughts?
[2013-07-06 23:16:05 -0400] kerouac: are there any caveats to appylying promise theory to my chef infrastructure?
[2013-07-06 23:16:38 -0400] kerouac: to be more clear: can I map hte principles laid out in promise theory in the same way i would cfengine?
[2013-07-06 23:26:04 -0400] stormerider: promise theory?
[2013-07-06 23:29:06 -0400] kerouac: yeah, thinking about the directives in a recipe as promises
[2013-07-06 23:29:12 -0400] kerouac: like cfengine
[2013-07-06 23:30:27 -0400] coderanger: kerouac: Not really
[2013-07-06 23:30:39 -0400] coderanger: Promise theory talks about isolated agents
[2013-07-06 23:31:15 -0400] coderanger: chef notifications are much more direct than promise theory would allow
[2013-07-06 23:31:35 -0400] kerouac: ok, this is the missing link , then
[2013-07-06 23:32:16 -0400] kerouac: is ut a bad idea to think of the notifications as a layer on top of the promise theory
[2013-07-06 23:32:37 -0400] coderanger: I mean I guess you could, the metaphor becomes both tenuous and unhelpful though
[2013-07-06 23:33:14 -0400] coderanger: Chef is not a network of isolated agents, it is a set of procedural actions
[2013-07-06 23:33:40 -0400] coderanger: most of which are idempotent, but overall there is no guarantee of that
[2013-07-06 23:34:16 -0400] kerouac: ahhh, see i was thinking of how the procedural actions are set into cookbooks, and was thinking of the cookbooks as promises, which was stupid
[2013-07-06 23:34:48 -0400] coderanger: I mean if you do it right, that is the case, but chef doesn't enforce it :)
[2013-07-06 23:34:52 -0400] kerouac: yeah, i'm getting used to the lack of guarantees
[2013-07-06 23:35:02 -0400] kerouac: was reading some of omalleys stuff
[2013-07-06 23:35:06 -0400] coderanger: and I wouldn't saw a cookbook is a promise, a resource is a promise (if it is idempotent)
[2013-07-06 23:35:14 -0400] kerouac: and was wondering where it fit in with convergence
[2013-07-06 23:35:22 -0400] kerouac: yeah, i see that now
[2013-07-06 23:35:36 -0400] coderanger: a recipe is a list of resources, a cookbook is an unordered hash of recipes
[2013-07-06 23:35:46 -0400] kerouac: ok, then
[2013-07-06 23:35:58 -0400] kerouac: how do i overcome some of the pitfalls in why-run
[2013-07-06 23:36:17 -0400] kerouac: like say whne playing with an authconfig cookbook or suders file bound for a diff host?
[2013-07-06 23:36:29 -0400] kerouac: vagrant?
[2013-07-06 23:36:36 -0400] coderanger: Just be careful to make your resources idempotent, either via not_if/only_if, or more complex checks in an LWRP
[2013-07-06 23:36:44 -0400] coderanger: bound for a different host?
[2013-07-06 23:37:00 -0400] kerouac: yeah, say i am on my workstation
[2013-07-06 23:37:05 -0400] kerouac: and working on a cookbook
[2013-07-06 23:37:27 -0400] kerouac: do i have ot upload it to the server for full expectations to be set when doing a dry run?
[2013-07-06 23:37:37 -0400] kerouac: or can i do why-run on hte workstation?
[2013-07-06 23:38:15 -0400] kerouac: i'm probably being really unclear, so no worries if i need to co back to the opscode docs and geta cup of coffee
[2013-07-06 23:38:18 -0400] coderanger: You can do it anywhere, usually you would be testing your cookbook inside a VM though
[2013-07-06 23:38:30 -0400] kerouac: yeah, i was avoiding vagrant
[2013-07-06 23:38:35 -0400] kerouac: i have no idea why
[2013-07-06 23:38:51 -0400] coderanger: Only because 1) usually your workstation and target OS and config don't match and 2) if you break something having to rebuild your workstation is unpleasant
[2013-07-06 23:39:29 -0400] kerouac: rightnow my testing is liek this: edit recipe on worksattion , upload to private chef server, run chef-client on target ( a third hot)
[2013-07-06 23:39:32 -0400] kerouac: host*
[2013-07-06 23:39:36 -0400] coderanger: vagrant + berkshelf + test-kitchen is the general way to do local development these days
[2013-07-06 23:39:49 -0400] kerouac: awesome, thanks coderanger
[2013-07-06 23:40:02 -0400] kerouac: i saw a good borkshelf ref on hte reddits
[2013-07-06 23:40:09 -0400] kerouac: will have a look
