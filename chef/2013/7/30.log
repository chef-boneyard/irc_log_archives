[2013-07-30 22:09:14 -0400] coderanger: Testing
[2013-07-30 22:13:37 -0400] pwf: did it work
[2013-07-30 22:14:59 -0400] ssd7: Yup!
[2013-07-30 22:15:44 -0400] gkra: *facepalm*
[2013-07-30 22:15:59 -0400] gkra: note to self: node.chef_environment works a lot better than node['chef_environment']
[2013-07-30 22:16:14 -0400] eherot: speaking of chef environments
[2013-07-30 22:16:26 -0400] eherot: anyone know if there's a way to override it in the chef.vm.provision part of a Vagrantfile?
[2013-07-30 22:21:59 -0400] Majost: gkra: What is the difference? I honestly don't know.
[2013-07-30 22:22:36 -0400] gkra: Majost: in my recipe, node.chef_environment worked, and node['chef_environment'] didn't.
[2013-07-30 22:22:50 -0400] Majost: heh
[2013-07-30 22:23:53 -0400] jhunter: q: how can you display a node's role inside of a recipe?
[2013-07-30 22:25:18 -0400] gchristensen: node['roles'] I think
[2013-07-30 22:27:05 -0400] coderanger: Majost: #chef_environment is a real method, not a node attr
[2013-07-30 22:27:17 -0400] coderanger: Ditto node.run_list, node.name, etc
[2013-07-30 22:28:05 -0400] aocole: kallistec: thanks that worked
[2013-07-30 22:32:20 -0400] Sauraus|2: Anyone have experience installing jpackage on CentOS/RH 6.x?
[2013-07-30 22:37:20 -0400] jhunter: yep, ty
[2013-07-30 22:42:03 -0400] aocole: is it possible to use an absolute directory path as the 'source' for remote_directory?
[2013-07-30 22:44:46 -0400] Majost: coderanger: thanks
[2013-07-30 23:07:44 -0400] dgarstang: it looks like the community chef users cookbook is pushing out my ssh keys on the second run...
[2013-07-30 23:09:56 -0400] troyready: dgarstang, And not the first?
[2013-07-30 23:11:25 -0400] pulsejc: node.run_context does not seem to work with chef 10. what is the best way to get the run_context in a resource method that will work for chef 10 and 11?
[2013-07-30 23:16:03 -0400] dgarstang: troyready: I think so. about to run again
[2013-07-30 23:23:08 -0400] dgarstang: troyready: So... it wrote my key the first time, I think it updated it the second time.... not sure.... but the logs indicated it wrong to ~/doug/.ssh/authorized_keys... On the third run it didn't touch the file....
[2013-07-30 23:23:45 -0400] troyready: dgarstang, weird.
[2013-07-30 23:24:29 -0400] aneto: was it from the # Generated by Chef for <%= node['fqdn'] %> ?
[2013-07-30 23:24:36 -0400] dgarstang: troyready: *Sigh* very
[2013-07-30 23:25:03 -0400] dgarstang: aneto: yes, that's what the authorized keys has... except node['fqdn'] .... ah wait
[2013-07-30 23:25:05 -0400] aneto: which cookbook is doing it? the community openssh cookbook?
[2013-07-30 23:25:42 -0400] troyready: dgarstang, FWIW, that's not an area that I've seen Chef have a problem before. Every time I've had something like that, it's because multiple recipes were touching the same file, changing it in some way, causing the template resource to want to 'fix' it in the next run
[2013-07-30 23:25:49 -0400] dgarstang: aneto: users. I think this is because the hostname is being set after users runs.... which means on the next run, <%= node['fqdn'] %> has changed, and thefore it updates the comment.
[2013-07-30 23:26:06 -0400] dgarstang: troyready: ^
[2013-07-30 23:26:09 -0400] Sauraus|2: What is the easiest way to test for a linux version in a cookbook? I need to detect if I am on el5 vs el6
[2013-07-30 23:26:15 -0400] troyready: Ah, right, exactly :)
[2013-07-30 23:26:16 -0400] aneto: well node['fqdn'] should be whatever, hostname --fqdn is
[2013-07-30 23:27:36 -0400] aneto: dgarstang: I was having quite a few cookbooks do what your describing, the first chef run, my templates would say # Generated by Chef for, then next chef run it would be updated to # Generated by Chef for Localhost
[2013-07-30 23:27:42 -0400] dgarstang: aneto: Well, i'm using the hostname cookbook. it's changing the hostname.
[2013-07-30 23:28:00 -0400] dgarstang: aneto: the hostname changing would explain that
[2013-07-30 23:29:28 -0400] dgarstang: that's weird, cuz the hostname recipe is 2nd.
[2013-07-30 23:34:19 -0400] dgarstang: hm, shouldn't my recipes be applied in the order specified in the run list?
[2013-07-30 23:35:36 -0400] aneto: yes, your recipes will be run in order according to your run_list
[2013-07-30 23:36:22 -0400] pulsejc: Sauraus|2: if node['platform_family'] == "rhel" and node['platform_version'].to_i >= 6 (or something similar)
[2013-07-30 23:36:29 -0400] dgarstang: aneto: ok, so I see right out of the gate, it's runnng Recipe: lvm::default ..... but that's not first in my run list
[2013-07-30 23:37:10 -0400] Sauraus|2: pulsejc: Yeah just found the platform_version node info using google thanks
[2013-07-30 23:37:31 -0400] dgarstang: Also... it seems like the users commnity cookbook puts a comment with node[fqdn] in the authorized keys file. At the end of the run, this is empty. But, the hostname has been set by then, so on the second run, it gets updated correctly.
[2013-07-30 23:38:33 -0400] dgarstang: It looks like this affects a few other recipes too. It seems that on a default install of an amazon image that node[fqdn] is not set.
[2013-07-30 23:38:54 -0400] dgarstang: and yes, I am passing -N to knife bootstrap
[2013-07-30 23:41:03 -0400] s2t2: hi, i'm hoping someone might be able to help me out with this error I've been getting... "No resource found for rails. Tried application_rails, application_ruby_rails, rails" ... When I add "depends 'application_ruby'" to site-cookbooks/main/metadata.rb and try to cook again, I get a very non-helpful error message in the form of "Checking Chef version... Starting Chef Client, version 11.6.0 Compiling Cookbooks... [2013-07-30T23:32:49+00:
[2013-07-30 23:42:08 -0400] s2t2: ...

[2013-07-30 23:49:03 -0400] troyready: dgarstang, the -N IIRC sets the node name in chef, so it wouldn't affect a recipe referencing node[fqdn]. If it's a problem, might be worth investigating an automated process to set the hostname before the first chef client run
[2013-07-30 23:49:16 -0400] troyready: or modify the cookbooks to reference the node name instead or something
[2013-07-30 23:49:39 -0400] dgarstang: troyready: your saying that -N does or doesn't set node[fqdn] ?
[2013-07-30 23:50:22 -0400] dgarstang: v: oh, node[fqdn] != node[node_name]
[2013-07-30 23:50:33 -0400] troyready: yeah, that
[2013-07-30 23:50:56 -0400] troyready: It's best/common practice to match them, but it's not required
[2013-07-30 23:51:03 -0400] dgarstang: troyready: kk
[2013-07-30 23:51:04 -0400] gchristensen: oh it is?
[2013-07-30 23:51:05 -0400] troyready: errr, I shouldn't call it best, I don't know, but I know it's common
[2013-07-30 23:51:10 -0400] gchristensen: oh
[2013-07-30 23:51:19 -0400] jtimberman: dgarstang: if you don't set a node_name in the /etc/chef/client.rb or on the command-line with -N, chef will identify the node by it's FQDN, node['fqdn'] attribute, which comes from ohai.
[2013-07-30 23:52:01 -0400] dgarstang: jtimberman: but it doesn't set node[fqdn] to the value passed to -N from knife.... ?
[2013-07-30 23:52:05 -0400] jtimberman: dgarstang: on the chef server, nodes are unique objects, and thus should be named uniquely. system admin best practice says that FQDNs should be unique
[2013-07-30 23:52:08 -0400] jtimberman: nope
[2013-07-30 23:52:28 -0400] dgarstang: it would seem convenient if chef did that
[2013-07-30 23:52:58 -0400] jtimberman: chef isn't magic. it needs to ask the system about itself before it can make configuration decisions.
[2013-07-30 23:53:21 -0400] dgarstang: jtimberman: setting node[fqdn] to -N is magic?
[2013-07-30 23:53:40 -0400] jtimberman: chef doesn't make changes to the node that aren't in a recipe.
[2013-07-30 23:54:02 -0400] dgarstang: jtimberman: i'm passing json data to knife with -j, and it can access those as node[var]
[2013-07-30 23:54:06 -0400] jtimberman: -N is a command-line argument to chef-client that tells it what options to use in the application.
[2013-07-30 23:54:19 -0400] dgarstang: jtimberman: doesn't seem like a leap to set node[fqdn] to -N value therefore
[2013-07-30 23:54:38 -0400] jtimberman: it's totally a leap
[2013-07-30 23:55:09 -0400] jtimberman: -j is informing chef-client that it should use the specified JSON file as the initial node information that didn't come from detection through ohai plugins.
[2013-07-30 23:55:11 -0400] dgarstang: jtimberman: so I guess knife bootstrap is really bootstrap - setting the host name...
[2013-07-30 23:55:34 -0400] dgarstang: jtimberman: right, but you said in order for chef to know the value of -N, it'd be magic
[2013-07-30 23:56:02 -0400] dgarstang: anyway, not that big a deal for now I suppose. means running chef twice.
[2013-07-30 23:56:03 -0400] aneto: jtimberman: does ohai populate the fqdn before the initial chef run?
[2013-07-30 23:56:15 -0400] dgarstang: aneto: apparently not
[2013-07-30 23:57:31 -0400] witchking: I have a question on accessing node attributes during a run. I am defining a role, where I have define an attribute, which is the version number of the software that I want to install. In my recipe, I would like to proceed based on the version of the software (if any) that already exists on the node
[2013-07-30 23:58:04 -0400] witchking: when I try to access using the node.attribute?("attribute_name") method, I always get back the attribute defined in the role file
[2013-07-30 23:58:10 -0400] shanlar: jtimberman: does ohai run before the first chef-client run?
[2013-07-30 23:58:24 -0400] jtimberman: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_nodes_chef_run.html
[2013-07-30 23:58:24 -0400] witchking: is there a way that I can get the value of the attribute *BEFORE* the chef run
[2013-07-30 23:58:37 -0400] shanlar: node[hostname] doesnt seem to be set during the first run, but it IS set during the 2nd run
[2013-07-30 23:58:53 -0400] jtimberman: or visually: https://speakerdeck.com/jtimberman/anatomy-of-a-chef-run-and-authentication-cycle-1
[2013-07-30 23:59:21 -0400] aneto: miah: oh lord being a vampire =(
[2013-07-30 23:59:31 -0400] shanlar: according to those, it seems ohai runs first
[2013-07-30 23:59:43 -0400] jtimberman: if you run chef-client -l debug
[2013-07-30 23:59:46 -0400] shanlar: but then i cant explain why node[hostname] is NOT available during the first chef client run
[2013-07-30 23:59:47 -0400] jtimberman: you'll see all the things happen
