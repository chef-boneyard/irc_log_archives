[2013-12-21 01:15:11 -0500] coderanger: sethvargo: Do I need to go add chef_gem support to library files? :)
[2013-12-21 01:15:51 -0500] coderanger: sethvargo: Alternatively, miah and I talked about if it would be good to add a depends_gem metadata to cookbooks
[2013-12-21 01:20:57 -0500] someara: meh
[2013-12-21 02:32:30 -0500] jameson__: oo that would be nice
[2013-12-21 02:32:32 -0500] jameson__: depends_gem
[2013-12-21 02:33:50 -0500] jameson__: coderanger: is the idea to bring out the gem dependency at the metadata so it can be dealt with before the chef run kicks in?
[2013-12-21 02:39:23 -0500] gemperms:  I'm missing.I'm dealing with a recipe that does: execute(gem install X), but it needs (I think) to do: sudo gem install, because it's installing to system ruby and the (non-root) user doesn't have perms on teh gem dir. This seems like a widespread problems since many recipes are choking in a similar way. This is even when running the Vagrantfile that comes with the app. So, I'm wondering if there's a way to deal with this that
[2013-12-21 02:39:45 -0500] gemperms: I'm missing. Because, I can't imagine so many recipes are just broken. Any ideas?
[2013-12-21 02:57:42 -0500] jstump: I'm finally getting around to tying my cookbooks into my CI environment (yay!). Do people normally exercise a `vagrant up` in a build?
[2013-12-21 02:58:00 -0500] jstump: Right now I just have foodcritic and chefspec running.
[2013-12-21 03:01:12 -0500] sethvargo: @coderanger if you want to. But that still doesn't solve things like activation errors and stuff that bundler "fixes"
[2013-12-21 03:27:30 -0500] bitgangsta: What's the official process for updating a cookbook in the opscode repo?
[2013-12-21 03:27:49 -0500] bitgangsta: The RVM cookbook has been out of date for years, and there's a much better one on github. We should replace the community one!
[2013-12-21 03:52:23 -0500] jstump: Anyone ever see a chefspec fail with "Could not open library 'kernel32': kernel32: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory."?
[2013-12-21 04:07:35 -0500] gemperms: bitgangsta: what is the preffered version of RVM?
[2013-12-21 04:07:50 -0500] gemperms: I mean, the recipe that works, that's not the one on Opscode.
[2013-12-21 04:20:37 -0500] vt102: What's your opinion about red hat vs. debian?  I keep struggling to get community recipes to install under rhel, and they seem to work much, much better on debian.  I'm guessing that means the majority of chef users are using debian-based distros?  Do you agree?
[2013-12-21 04:55:56 -0500] coderanger: vt102: Ubuntu, not Debian, but yes
[2013-12-21 04:56:23 -0500] coderanger: vt102: Ubuntu LTS has a lot higher usage in the FOSS-involved world I'd say
[2013-12-21 04:56:34 -0500] coderanger: RHEL is still king of enterprise land though
[2013-12-21 05:00:31 -0500] vt102: coderanger: that's what I'm seeing.
[2013-12-21 05:12:29 -0500] ignatz: i've found debian-based distros easier to manage with chef, but it's very subjective
[2013-12-21 06:34:06 -0500] robsonpeixoto: hi guys. I'm testing the chef enterprise and I deleted my client from the client list. So my organization are without client and I can't admin it. Are there a way to restore it? Thanks
[2013-12-21 06:36:49 -0500] coderanger: robsonpeixoto: Hosted or on prem?
[2013-12-21 06:37:06 -0500] robsonpeixoto: on prem
[2013-12-21 06:37:47 -0500] robsonpeixoto: @coderanger I learning and since I started doing stupid things. rsrsrs
[2013-12-21 06:38:24 -0500] coderanger: robsonpeixoto: You shouldn't have been able to leave an org without an admin
[2013-12-21 06:39:20 -0500] robsonpeixoto: There area only one user on the org. But I delete myself of the client list and now I can't do anything.
[2013-12-21 06:39:43 -0500] robsonpeixoto: I always got it "Permission denied. You do not have permission to create a client in this organization. (Error 22015)"
[2013-12-21 06:40:06 -0500] robsonpeixoto: And is "Permission denied. You do not have permission to list the clients in this organization. (Error 22001)" ...
[2013-12-21 06:40:44 -0500] robsonpeixoto: @coderanger I'll need to give up of this org and create another ?
[2013-12-21 06:40:58 -0500] coderanger: robsonpeixoto: contact support
[2013-12-21 06:41:03 -0500] coderanger: they can guide you through fixing it
[2013-12-21 06:41:11 -0500] robsonpeixoto: @coderanger thanks
[2013-12-21 13:21:40 -0500] glen: how is multilib packages to be solved in chef package providers?
[2013-12-21 13:21:55 -0500] glen: i.e @current_resource needs to contain two values, one for x64 other for x32
[2013-12-21 16:10:06 -0500] glen: ... i upgraded chef client 11.6 -> chef-11.8.2, and now i get this weird error. ideas? http://sprunge.us/DZLJ
[2013-12-21 16:18:51 -0500] juliancdunn: glen: chef_server_url is not a symbol? what's your knife.rb look like?
[2013-12-21 16:19:50 -0500] glen: juliancdunn: missing. note the configure -i command
[2013-12-21 16:19:55 -0500] juliancdunn: and for multiarch, you can branch based on node['kernel']['machine'] or somesuch
[2013-12-21 16:20:06 -0500] glen: i think i'm missing some mixlib config dep
[2013-12-21 16:20:47 -0500] juliancdunn: could be, I can't repro
[2013-12-21 16:21:13 -0500] glen: juliancdunn: kernel.machine tells kernel architecture not userspace architecture. but i get your point
[2013-12-21 16:35:51 -0500] glen: how do i disable single test in mixlib-shellout (3 tests fail here with 1.3.0)
[2013-12-21 16:36:26 -0500] glen: http://sprunge.us/TdND
[2013-12-21 16:41:15 -0500] juliancdunn: are you building for EL6 by any chance? I maintain some of the dependent gems in EPEL
[2013-12-21 16:41:18 -0500] juliancdunn: like mixlib-shellout
[2013-12-21 16:42:20 -0500] glen: no. not el or any redhat stuff
[2013-12-21 16:45:34 -0500] juliancdunn: not sure you can do it without tagging the test a priori
[2013-12-21 16:45:43 -0500] juliancdunn: you could apply a patch to it in prebuild
[2013-12-21 16:50:04 -0500] glen: is chef-zero really runtime dependency in 11.8?
[2013-12-21 17:15:49 -0500] glen: and why puma < 2 in deps?
[2013-12-21 18:20:54 -0500] glen: kind of no explanation from the commit https://github.com/opscode/chef/commit/ded680b1decec30b470f26c8faa1d637f26add77
[2013-12-21 18:21:05 -0500] glen: and source matches 0 matches for "require puma"
[2013-12-21 18:21:16 -0500] glen: i guess it's chef-zero dependency?
[2013-12-21 18:21:54 -0500] chip-: fwiw Chef-zero 2.0.0 is released and removes Puma, though that doesn't help you now.
[2013-12-21 18:22:27 -0500] glen: and 11.8 has c-z < 2 in gemspec
[2013-12-21 18:22:56 -0500] glen: and seems i can run chef-client fine without chef-zero and it's deps installed
[2013-12-21 18:41:45 -0500] chip-: Haven't tried that. It's in there so --local-mode will function.
[2013-12-21 18:52:04 -0500] sethvargo: @glen puma 2 was/is broken on windows and there were some other issues with native extensions. We've removed puma in the 2.0 release of Chef Zero. I'll open a ticket to bump the version in Chef
[2013-12-21 18:59:30 -0500] sethvargo: @glen https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4901
[2013-12-21 19:14:30 -0500] sethvargo: @glen the test suite uses Puma to spin up a server

[2013-12-21 21:40:07 -0500] billiam_: I am getting a NoMemoryError: failed to allocate memory when trying to run the execute resource
[2013-12-21 21:40:26 -0500] billiam_: has anybody else had that problem? If so, is there a solution to it
[2013-12-21 21:42:03 -0500] coderanger: billiam_: The solution is you need more RAM
[2013-12-21 21:43:30 -0500] billiam_: possible, but not entirely sure that is the solution.
[2013-12-21 21:43:52 -0500] billiam_: when I run sudo chef-client on the recipe, it runs once
[2013-12-21 21:44:00 -0500] coderanger: billiam_: That is a standard Ruby error meaning it failed calling malloc()
[2013-12-21 21:44:10 -0500] coderanger: chef isn't really involved beyond the fact that Chef uses a lot of memory
[2013-12-21 21:44:29 -0500] billiam_: okay
[2013-12-21 21:44:54 -0500] coderanger: How much ram and/or swap does the system have?
[2013-12-21 21:45:10 -0500] coderanger: 512 is generally fine unless you seriously abuse search()
[2013-12-21 21:45:30 -0500] billiam_: 2gb on a Vagrant VM
[2013-12-21 21:45:49 -0500] coderanger: Running anything RAM-intensive on it?
[2013-12-21 21:46:02 -0500] coderanger: Also what version of Chef?
[2013-12-21 21:46:10 -0500] billiam_: 11.8
[2013-12-21 21:46:39 -0500] coderanger: it should default to forking mode, so memory leaks over time aren't possible
[2013-12-21 21:47:07 -0500] billiam_: hmmm okay.
[2013-12-21 21:47:55 -0500] billiam_: CDH4 is pretty memory intensive, but I have been able to run the install using shell scripts up to this point without memory errors
[2013-12-21 21:48:36 -0500] coderanger: Standard OOM debugging tools are about all you have, top, free, smaps.py
[2013-12-21 21:49:25 -0500] sorgener: Hello. Can I bootstrap a node without internet access?
[2013-12-21 21:50:04 -0500] coderanger: sorgener: In the abstract yes, but you can't use the default bootstrap template
[2013-12-21 21:50:20 -0500] sorgener: ok
[2013-12-21 21:50:22 -0500] coderanger: sorgener: You can modify the template to pull down the relevant package from a local HTTP server though
[2013-12-21 21:52:46 -0500] sorgener: Can I have two workstations  i.e. two machines with knife  and do the bootstrap from the second machine? (not going into details I'll have internet accessible this way)
[2013-12-21 21:53:03 -0500] coderanger: sorgener: You can use an HTTP proxy, sure
[2013-12-21 21:53:22 -0500] coderanger: I think you just set knife[:http_proxy] in your knife.rb, but check the docs to be sure
[2013-12-21 21:53:52 -0500] sorgener: coderanger: I rather think about having two knifes. Not sure if chef supports this
[2013-12-21 21:54:42 -0500] coderanger: eNot sure what you mean
[2013-12-21 21:55:08 -0500] sorgener: you have workstation  machine with knife  and clients which you manage, right
[2013-12-21 21:56:08 -0500] coderanger: Yes
[2013-12-21 21:57:23 -0500] sorgener: can you have second workstation, also with knife?
[2013-12-21 21:58:50 -0500] coderanger: Sure, you can have as many as you want
[2013-12-21 21:58:58 -0500] billiam_: sorgener. Yes, just copy your .chef folder with Pems in it
[2013-12-21 21:59:05 -0500] coderanger: In a company normally everyone has a knife setup on their workstation
[2013-12-21 21:59:15 -0500] coderanger: knife is just a tool for talking to the Chef API (mostly)
[2013-12-21 21:59:41 -0500] sorgener: ok :) thanks
[2013-12-21 22:19:04 -0500] sorgener: billiam_: I should also git clone the chef-repo git repository?
[2013-12-21 22:19:35 -0500] coderanger: sorgener: Depends on what workflow you are using
[2013-12-21 22:21:58 -0500] sorgener: I thought that the git repo is the database from which knife selects things to apply on machine (when bootstrapping) or to upload to the hosted codeops. So I should have everything there in most cases?
[2013-12-21 22:24:57 -0500] sorgener: coderanger: correct? With this information I'll be ready to go
[2013-12-21 22:25:37 -0500] coderanger: sorgener: That was the original workflow when chef was created, tools like berkshelf offer other options
[2013-12-21 22:25:45 -0500] coderanger: sorgener: Check out some tutorials and find something that works for you
[2013-12-21 22:26:32 -0500] sorgener: coderanger: I'm configuring my home PCs & macs, so it's simple "workflow" :)
[2013-12-21 22:26:41 -0500] sorgener: just need a fallback knife machine
