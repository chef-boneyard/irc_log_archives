[2013-12-22 01:01:41 -0500] AfroResurrection: Hey, so quick newbie question, is it possible to have more than the "default" recipe in a recipe? For example, if I wanted to rename it "defaultdb.rb," would it still be possible to include that within the "default.rb" file as well?
[2013-12-22 01:16:12 -0500] douglaswth: AfroResurrection: I think what you are looking for is include_recipe http://docs.opscode.com/chef/dsl_recipe.html#include-recipes
[2013-12-22 01:22:57 -0500] AfroResurrection: douglaswth: awesome, include_recipe "myapp::defaultdb" with defaultdb.rb in the recipes folder and "myapp" being the cookbook name worked, thanks.
[2013-12-22 01:28:04 -0500] someara: that's known as the "application cookbook" pattern by the way.
[2013-12-22 01:28:45 -0500] someara: I'm for it.
[2013-12-22 03:17:49 -0500] someara: cut windows 1.12.4
[2013-12-22 03:18:08 -0500] carmstrong: cool, thanks
[2013-12-22 03:24:16 -0500] someara: I can't wait until test-kitchen supports windows =)
[2013-12-22 03:24:57 -0500] AntelopeSalad: would you guys say it's unreasonable to use hosted chef with separate accounts to manage multiple completely isolated server groups?
[2013-12-22 03:25:15 -0500] carmstrong: AntelopeSalad: you can have separate orgs
[2013-12-22 03:25:29 -0500] carmstrong: my personal account belongs to my work org and my personal org, which is just my personal server
[2013-12-22 03:25:41 -0500] AntelopeSalad: ex. you have clients A, B, C -- each of them only require 1 or 2 nodes -- is it iffy to make a new account to just use the free version of hosted chef?
[2013-12-22 03:25:44 -0500] carmstrong: so I can hop between them in hosted chef
[2013-12-22 03:26:18 -0500] carmstrong: that's probably bypassing the intended use of free hosted chef ;)
[2013-12-22 03:26:21 -0500] carmstrong: but I would send them an e-mail and ask
[2013-12-22 03:26:54 -0500] AntelopeSalad: yeah i wasn't sure, i'll send them an e-mail to double check
[2013-12-22 03:27:42 -0500] AntelopeSalad: i just don't think i can convince a client who is spending $800 on a website to pay $120/month for hosted chef
[2013-12-22 03:28:10 -0500] carmstrong: why not use open source chef?
[2013-12-22 03:28:38 -0500] AntelopeSalad: almost every tutorial i've read said to use the free version of hosted chef and to avoid chef-solo
[2013-12-22 03:29:12 -0500] carmstrong: hosted chef is great, but you can just host your own open source server
[2013-12-22 03:29:16 -0500] carmstrong: no need to use chef-solo
[2013-12-22 03:29:23 -0500] carmstrong: it works just the same
[2013-12-22 03:29:47 -0500] carmstrong: AntelopeSalad: http://docs.opscode.com/chef/manage_server_open_source.html
[2013-12-22 03:29:59 -0500] AntelopeSalad: is the universe going to explode if i try to run chef-server and chef-client on the same machine?
[2013-12-22 03:30:23 -0500] carmstrong: nope
[2013-12-22 03:30:25 -0500] carmstrong: I do that
[2013-12-22 03:30:42 -0500] carmstrong: I use Chef to manage Chef
[2013-12-22 03:30:44 -0500] carmstrong: Chefception
[2013-12-22 03:30:52 -0500] AntelopeSalad: that might work then, most of these sites are really small -- i would say 2 nodes max
[2013-12-22 03:31:19 -0500] carmstrong: you could have each client sign up for hosted chef and use the free account, since they are indeed separate companies
[2013-12-22 03:31:25 -0500] carmstrong: then add you as an admin in the organization
[2013-12-22 03:31:30 -0500] carmstrong: so you can hop between them and manage them
[2013-12-22 03:31:45 -0500] carmstrong: I would think that use case falls within Chef's expectations, but I'd still email and ask to be sure
[2013-12-22 03:31:47 -0500] AntelopeSalad: so hosted chef's free version is ok in my case?
[2013-12-22 03:31:57 -0500] someara: Antelope make as many orgs as you need. That's what they're there for =)
[2013-12-22 03:32:10 -0500] AntelopeSalad: technically they are separate clients , but it would be me alone managing each one
[2013-12-22 03:32:42 -0500] someara: you definitely want to isolate your customer infrastructures into seperate orgs.
[2013-12-22 03:32:54 -0500] AntelopeSalad: yeah someara
[2013-12-22 03:33:00 -0500] someara: we have many users with multiple orgs
[2013-12-22 03:33:12 -0500] AntelopeSalad: the iffy part was if i was able to create new free accounts for each one
[2013-12-22 03:33:21 -0500] someara: go for it
[2013-12-22 03:33:23 -0500] AntelopeSalad: since all of them would certainly use less than 5 nodes
[2013-12-22 03:34:00 -0500] someara: yep. all good.
[2013-12-22 03:34:13 -0500] AntelopeSalad: if i ever got to the point where i had 5+ nodes i wouldn't mind paying the fee at all
[2013-12-22 03:34:19 -0500] AntelopeSalad: 5+ nodes actually seems like a lot
[2013-12-22 03:34:24 -0500] carmstrong: #hugops
[2013-12-22 03:34:28 -0500] carmstrong: #feelgood
[2013-12-22 03:34:32 -0500] AntelopeSalad: especially if you're dealing with something like ec2 where a single node could be very beefy
[2013-12-22 03:34:39 -0500] carmstrong: #hashtagsareforsituationslikethis
[2013-12-22 03:35:12 -0500] someara: they'll grow, trust me =)
[2013-12-22 03:35:31 -0500] AntelopeSalad: i hope so, i only started learning chef recently
[2013-12-22 03:36:08 -0500] AntelopeSalad: it got me really excited in an area that made me want to kill myself
[2013-12-22 03:38:52 -0500] someara: what area is that?
[2013-12-22 03:39:03 -0500] AntelopeSalad: managing and provisioning servers
[2013-12-22 03:39:33 -0500] AntelopeSalad: going from a 160 line server.txt file with random notes and instructions to a berksfile is a pretty big win
[2013-12-22 04:45:28 -0500] JoelMcCracken: so, one of the things that irritates me about chef is the large amount of files required by cookbooks, recipes, etc
[2013-12-22 04:46:21 -0500] JoelMcCracken: is there some other way to write cookbooks? Say, everything is contained within a single file, and possibly things are factored via traditional ruby methods?

[2013-12-22 19:24:39 -0500] the_lord: Hello, I'm currently deploying with chef
[2013-12-22 19:25:20 -0500] the_lord: but once I start a new node and provision it, it doesn't show in the search results for the role immediately
[2013-12-22 19:25:41 -0500] the_lord: is there any way to make it show as soon as it bootstraps?
