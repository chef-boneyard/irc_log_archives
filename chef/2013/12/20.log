[2013-12-20 00:00:56 -0500] mconigliaro: ah, cool
[2013-12-20 00:00:58 -0500] mconigliaro: thanks @juliancdunn
[2013-12-20 00:01:25 -0500] juliancdunn: np... if you're going to make comparisons though, may I suggest using Gem::Requirement
[2013-12-20 00:01:28 -0500] juliancdunn: example code: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-client/blob/master/recipes/windows_service.rb#L27
[2013-12-20 00:01:45 -0500] mconigliaro: actually, maybe this is a better way..
[2013-12-20 00:01:49 -0500] mconigliaro: if node.respond_to?(:run_context)...
[2013-12-20 00:01:59 -0500] mconigliaro: because that's really what I'm checking

[2013-12-20 00:10:26 -0500] xapak: Hello there!
[2013-12-20 00:10:57 -0500] xapak: Is there a way to know which cookbooks versions were used to create X environment?
[2013-12-20 00:12:33 -0500] maplebed: sethvargo: quick question for you, if you remember to a cookbook with a 2yr old timestamp. tmpreaper. It looks to me like the tmpreaper::schedule puts in a cronjob but doesn't configure it to read the configuration file. Am I missing something?
[2013-12-20 00:12:52 -0500] maplebed: https://github.com/customink-webops/tmpreaper/
[2013-12-20 00:13:39 -0500] AntelopeSalad: is chef server + berkshelf + vagrant still considered a modern way to setup a cluster of servers?
[2013-12-20 00:14:03 -0500] AntelopeSalad: i actually know very little about chef but i found what looks to be a nice sample github repo to work off of , but i noticed it's around a year old
[2013-12-20 00:25:22 -0500] sethvargo: @maplebed tmpreaper reads /etc/tmpreaper.conf by default
[2013-12-20 00:25:38 -0500] maplebed: that's not what it says when I run it. :(
[2013-12-20 00:25:52 -0500] maplebed: unless adding the --test flag prohibits it reading the conf file.
[2013-12-20 00:26:17 -0500] maplebed: the comments in the conf file also disagree.
[2013-12-20 00:27:18 -0500] maplebed: ok, so maybe nevermind, sorta.
[2013-12-20 00:27:39 -0500] maplebed: it gets added to /etc/cron.daily, but the tmpreaper::schedule recipe also adds it to root's crontab
[2013-12-20 00:27:49 -0500] maplebed: I think the former is going to work and the latter will fail.
[2013-12-20 00:30:03 -0500] maplebed: which is actually fine; I only care that I run it once/day. I misunderstood from the cookbook README that I had to use the schedule recipe to get it to run daily, though it looks like the package by default drops it in cron.daily.
[2013-12-20 00:30:40 -0500] maplebed: sethvargo: does that all sound closer to reality? or do I still have it wrong?
[2013-12-20 00:49:31 -0500] coderanger: jtimberman: Lol at sysadvent
[2013-12-20 00:50:10 -0500] coderanger: jtimberman: Go try https://github.com/balanced-cookbooks/citadel ;-)
[2013-12-20 00:57:03 -0500] spicy: node search is supposed to work with chef-zero, right? I am running into a weird problem with the ssh_known_hosts cookbook giving connection refused with chef-zero when trying to do a search for node keys_ssh:*
[2013-12-20 01:10:15 -0500] jameson__: federate users via IAM
[2013-12-20 03:05:30 -0500] jtimberman: coderanger: heh. :P
[2013-12-20 03:05:41 -0500] jtimberman: coderanger: you didn't have that when i was writin the IAM stuff I did :)
[2013-12-20 03:06:07 -0500] coderanger: jtimberman: No one asked for it ;-)
[2013-12-20 03:06:28 -0500] jtimberman: :)
[2013-12-20 03:18:27 -0500] jkeiser: spicy: node search is supposed to work, yes
[2013-12-20 03:18:55 -0500] jkeiser: Connection refused means it's hitting the wrong server or port
[2013-12-20 03:19:05 -0500] jkeiser: If it was unsupported, it would get back a 404 or 405
[2013-12-20 03:27:53 -0500] spheromak: jkeiser: schisamo is the chef-metal tk work intending to bring some multi-host provisioning possiblities to TK ?
[2013-12-20 03:28:26 -0500] jkeiser: spheromak: it hasn't started yet, but definitely, yeah
[2013-12-20 03:29:01 -0500] jkeiser: I'm wrapping up with making ec2 provisioning reliable as hell.  Then it's time to integrate test-kitchen drivers
[2013-12-20 03:29:03 -0500] coderanger: Has anyone had segault issues with TK's --parallel?
[2013-12-20 03:29:33 -0500] coderanger: It reliably dies in the thread.join
[2013-12-20 03:31:30 -0500] spheromak: jkeiser: thats impemented via fog right ? should be able to point it at opensstack as well. I  will have to find the time to look at yer ec2 stuff. I was just wondering if it was the thinking (using chef-metal for TK multihost testing).
[2013-12-20 03:32:47 -0500] jkeiser: spheromak: yeah, it's using fog so we can point at openstack.  It's just only been tested against ec2 right now :)  But, a lot of the reliability work should transfer over, like rebooting the server if it doesn't work just after creation (grrrr ec2)
[2013-12-20 03:33:05 -0500] jkeiser: And the net-scp fix, assuming the net-scp maintainer is active
[2013-12-20 03:33:19 -0500] schisamo: spheromak: yes we are hoping metal can be integrated into TK and possibly expose a new top level config key called topology (or similar).
[2013-12-20 03:33:27 -0500] spheromak: yup
[2013-12-20 03:33:45 -0500] jkeiser: The next thing at any rate is to join TK drivers and the metal provisioner, so everybody gets all the things
[2013-12-20 03:33:49 -0500] schisamo: There is also hope metal can leverage TK drivers directly for talking to virtualization engines...but that is TBD.
[2013-12-20 03:33:50 -0500] spheromak: thats great. It was what i thought of immediately when jkeiser ran me through using chef-metal.
[2013-12-20 03:34:04 -0500] jkeiser: yep
[2013-12-20 03:34:04 -0500] schisamo: Still need to talk with fnichol about all this also :)
[2013-12-20 03:34:05 -0500] spheromak: schisamo: yea that could be cool
[2013-12-20 03:34:25 -0500] jkeiser: Indeed :)
[2013-12-20 03:34:39 -0500] schisamo: Chef's releng team has big plans for the TK + metal combo...we want to leverage it for enterprise chef topology testing.
[2013-12-20 03:35:00 -0500] schisamo: HA, EC + LDAP etc.
[2013-12-20 03:35:05 -0500] spheromak: what I need as well from the openstack build/test/deploy pipe side. I got alot of hacky shit right now.
[2013-12-20 03:35:06 -0500] jkeiser: schisamo and I have been talking about what we'd need to do to get the multi-node stuff into TK configs.  It looks pretty nice
[2013-12-20 03:35:08 -0500] spheromak: yep
[2013-12-20 03:35:51 -0500] jkeiser: I think I may have reliability licked--or at least, enough to move on
[2013-12-20 03:35:52 -0500] spheromak: super stoked on this stuff. I need to get into it more and take some cards
[2013-12-20 03:35:54 -0500] spheromak: :D
[2013-12-20 03:36:28 -0500] jkeiser: I got 47 servers created in a row successfully before I got an error--and that was because OS X went to sleep and took down my network while I was at dinner :)
[2013-12-20 03:36:30 -0500] jkeiser: My goal is 100
[2013-12-20 03:36:56 -0500] spheromak: jkeiser: nice
[2013-12-20 03:37:16 -0500] schisamo: later all, gotta run..present wrapping time!
[2013-12-20 03:38:42 -0500] jkeiser: Other fun things included net-scp not understanding the ssh error protocol, and ec2 sometimes giving me back servers with recycled IPs and messing up the known_hosts file
[2013-12-20 03:38:46 -0500] jkeiser: Lots of fun
[2013-12-20 03:39:06 -0500] jkeiser: Not to mention 1 out of 30 or so ec2 servers I get starts out broken :(
[2013-12-20 03:39:09 -0500] jkeiser: ok back in a bit
[2013-12-20 03:39:31 -0500] spheromak: jkeiser: par for the course
[2013-12-20 03:41:15 -0500] someara: jkeiser are you test-kitchening?
[2013-12-20 03:42:46 -0500] someara: er, kitchen-ec2
[2013-12-20 04:12:26 -0500] frustrated: Any suggestions on a good cookbook for gitlab? I'm pulling my hair out dealing with broken recipes.
[2013-12-20 04:15:15 -0500] frustrated: Do people post working role-recipes? It's fun, for example,  discovering that Postgres's recipe has to be downgraded, but the percentage of working public cookbooks is astoundingly low.
[2013-12-20 04:33:18 -0500] thekev: Gitlab is a nightmare to install without automation. If someone bakes a decent recipe, it may only be useful for a single version.
[2013-12-20 04:40:04 -0500] frustrated: I'm finding there's no good way to install gitlab. And recipes of any complexity seem to depend on something broken somewhere. For example, this fundamental recipe has been broken for about a month, with 2 discussed fixed floating. I'm finding recipes that opscode metadata says support CentOS, but clearly they don't. The sad thing is that Chef and Git *could* be used to deal with this. Some people name their Git branches "stable". So
[2013-12-20 04:40:58 -0500] frustrated: in their Berksfiles. So, if people actually had a sense of shame about leaving broken software out there, and just updating metadata.rb and Berksfile with working versions of things, this really could all be 1000x more awesome.
[2013-12-20 04:43:29 -0500] frustrated: It's the same thing on Puppetforge. So, nothing against Chef. It just blows me away that there aren't "stable" directories published as a matter of course. You could write  a script to generate the restricted Berksfile and metadata.rb so that things would be available to others as they were on the day your stuff worked. But, that would require some conventions, like being able to depend on someone to create a stable Git branch. Point
[2013-12-20 04:43:52 -0500] jkeiser: someara: no, chef-metaling right now
[2013-12-20 04:45:08 -0500] jkeiser: spheromak: well, I found out that you can increase your odds from 1 in 30 by rebooting the server instead of giving up on it.  If it fails, I kick it and see if it starts working instead of immediately failing the chef run
[2013-12-20 04:45:25 -0500] frustrated: doesn't help. Well, I know I'm not alone in the way I feel, so I'm wondering if people post such working restricted role-recipes, instead of just dev Vagrantfiles which very often don't work because of a broken dependent recipe somewhere.
[2013-12-20 05:32:26 -0500] eeek: hiya, I've got a (hopefully) quick question if anyone can help me out... trying to detect windows OS version so I can fix a junction issue before installing something, but I can't figure out how to include/use the features in version.rb from opscode/windows cookbook
[2013-12-20 05:33:58 -0500] eeek: I've tried ::Chef::Recipe.send(:include, Windows::Version), but that just nets an error that what I'm trying to include is a class and not a module (which it is, but not sure why that's a problem). Should probably add that I'm new to Ruby as well, so there may just be something I'm not understanding about the language...
[2013-12-20 05:36:36 -0500] eeek: Noting the lack of a question mark thus far: How do I use/access the version.rb from opscode/windows from a recipe in another cookbook if Recipe.send, include, and require all return errors?
[2013-12-20 05:41:15 -0500] juliancdunn: eeek: actually, what version of Chef are you? a lot of that stuff has been superseded by core version checks in Chef proper
[2013-12-20 05:41:22 -0500] eeek: 11.8
[2013-12-20 05:41:36 -0500] eeek: .2
[2013-12-20 05:43:14 -0500] juliancdunn: cool, then you can just do:
[2013-12-20 05:43:19 -0500] juliancdunn: require 'chef/win32/version'
[2013-12-20 05:43:21 -0500] juliancdunn: and then
[2013-12-20 05:43:31 -0500] juliancdunn: v = Chef::ReservedNames::Win32.new
[2013-12-20 05:44:05 -0500] juliancdunn: v will now be an object that has methods like :windows_server_2012_r2?
[2013-12-20 05:44:25 -0500] eeek: oh neat
[2013-12-20 05:44:28 -0500] eeek: :)
[2013-12-20 05:44:58 -0500] juliancdunn: whoops, make that Chef::ReservedNames::Win32::Version.new
[2013-12-20 05:45:06 -0500] juliancdunn: you get the idea
[2013-12-20 05:46:35 -0500] eeek: thank you!
[2013-12-20 05:46:45 -0500] juliancdunn: you're welcome!

[2013-12-20 13:03:00 -0500] ay: is it possible to "group by" in knife search?
[2013-12-20 13:03:10 -0500] ay: Let says i do nife search node 'languages_php_version:5*' -a languages.php.version
[2013-12-20 13:03:14 -0500] ay: +k
[2013-12-20 13:03:34 -0500] ay: but want to group the different servers on each version of php
[2013-12-20 13:03:42 -0500] ay: Is that possible?
[2013-12-20 13:17:44 -0500] ay: Anyone?
[2013-12-20 13:58:09 -0500] juliancdunn: ay: no, it's not possible.
[2013-12-20 14:08:37 -0500] ay: juliancdunn: Ok. Bummer.
[2013-12-20 14:08:51 -0500] ay: juliancdunn: But it would be a nice feature don't you agree?
[2013-12-20 14:09:09 -0500] ay: Would it make sense to make it a knife plugin maybe?
[2013-12-20 14:29:07 -0500] juliancdunn: ay: yeah -- it's good for asset tracking & reporting
[2013-12-20 14:29:22 -0500] juliancdunn: traditionally the search has been flat since it's intended to be used in recipes for dynamic discovery
[2013-12-20 14:34:00 -0500] allaire: Currently, I use chef to set my node hostname. Is there a way to automate that process instead of having to knife edit node manually ?
[2013-12-20 14:47:52 -0500] micgo: allaire: Are you letting chef set the node name automatically from your hostname?
[2013-12-20 14:48:15 -0500] allaire: micgo: hum nope
[2013-12-20 14:48:40 -0500] micgo: allaire: you can force a node to have a specific name on bootstrap by passing the -N flag
[2013-12-20 14:48:51 -0500] micgo: knife bootstrap 0.0.0.0 -N "my_node"
[2013-12-20 14:49:28 -0500] micgo: or are you just trying to change the actual hostname on the node?
[2013-12-20 14:50:44 -0500] allaire: micgo: Trying to change the actuel hostname on the node yes
[2013-12-20 14:50:51 -0500] allaire: not the 'chef node name'
[2013-12-20 14:50:55 -0500] allaire:  /etc/hostname
[2013-12-20 14:51:41 -0500] micgo: have you tried this: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/hostname
[2013-12-20 15:11:27 -0500] karl: What is the best SSH client to use on windows when you are working with knife (bootstrapping, chef-client, etc.)?
[2013-12-20 15:12:33 -0500] storme_away: Guest94556: putty is decent and free
[2013-12-20 15:14:05 -0500] Guest94556: cool, putty sounds fine as the client
[2013-12-20 15:14:22 -0500] Guest94556: what about server though on the node that needs to be bootstrapped?
[2013-12-20 15:24:22 -0500] storme_away: afaik you need a unix box to run the server.

[2013-12-20 16:29:03 -0500] tsimmons: Hey guys, noob question. How can I manually run "chef-client" on all nodes in an environment. I'm getting errors using "knife ssh" of the type "Failed to connect to  -- SocketError: getaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known"
[2013-12-20 16:33:47 -0500] freerobby: For some reason the network/interfaces ohai plugin does not seem to be running on one of my boxes. When I run it on the command line it works fine, but I'd like it to save its chef attributes on a chef run. Is there a way to explicitly tell it to run in chef/
[2013-12-20 16:36:55 -0500] freerobby: It seems not to run on ec2 boxes by default, but on rackspace boxes by default
[2013-12-20 16:37:05 -0500] freerobby: possibly something to do with knife-ec2 vs knife-rackspace?
[2013-12-20 16:43:03 -0500] j^2: ok, here's a question. I'd like to start writing up a chef-[recipe||cookook] to use the windows opscode cookbook/lwrp. How do i leverage it; or do i write my recipe inside the cookbook?
[2013-12-20 16:49:43 -0500] BeemanR9: I am able to use the Windows registry_key resource to create keys and values at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components keys but the exact same use of the resource fails to HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main
[2013-12-20 16:50:09 -0500] darron: freerobby: sometimes you need to pass along -a to feed them the proper ip address
[2013-12-20 16:50:20 -0500] darron: at least I think it was command -a
[2013-12-20 16:52:10 -0500] BeemanR9: Guess I should add that this is using Berkshelf/Vagrant/Virtualbox to a Windows2012 image
[2013-12-20 16:52:14 -0500] CPS: j^2: in the cookbook's metadata.rb file, add depends "windows"
[2013-12-20 16:52:32 -0500] CPS: BeemanR9: what error does the registry thing give
[2013-12-20 16:54:08 -0500] BeemanR9: That's what is so cool.  None.  The handlers run and all is good.  Until you go look at the registry.
[2013-12-20 16:54:51 -0500] CPS: oh fun
[2013-12-20 16:55:31 -0500] CPS: are you using the env resource?
[2013-12-20 16:55:54 -0500] CPS: oh wait, that's something else, njm
[2013-12-20 16:56:14 -0500] CPS: dig into the registry resource to see what command it's executing
[2013-12-20 16:56:30 -0500] CPS: it might silently ignore errors of that command
[2013-12-20 16:57:15 -0500] freerobby: darron: right, but i'm wondering why that isn't running at all
[2013-12-20 16:59:24 -0500] BeemanR9: CPS: Already has the Windows depends but do not think that that is relevant since I am using the core resource registry_key.  Not sure how to 'dig into' the resource.  I have read the docs which give me no indication.
[2013-12-20 17:00:20 -0500] CPS: the actual code for what the provider does is in windows\providers\registry.rb and windows\libraries\helper.rb
[2013-12-20 17:00:26 -0500] CPS: the depends thing was for someone else
[2013-12-20 17:01:02 -0500] CPS: there's a rescue statement with this comment:  #subkey does not exist (ok)
[2013-12-20 17:01:16 -0500] CPS: might be that?
[2013-12-20 17:03:01 -0500] zanshin: is there a knife command that will download all the cookbooks on the server to my local chef-repo?
[2013-12-20 17:04:15 -0500] CPS: zanshin: knife download is a command
[2013-12-20 17:04:32 -0500] BeemanR9: CPS: Ok.  I thought it might have to do with the architecture switch (32 vs 64) but it failed both ways.  What is weird is that it succeeds as I said to the other hive.  Almost feels like a permissions thing. I will look at the code.  Is there a way to enable verbose logging on the target host?
[2013-12-20 17:04:47 -0500] zanshin: CPS: but it works against individual cookbooks, right?
[2013-12-20 17:05:01 -0500] ctote_: Hey everyone - I keep getting Chef::Exceptions::InvalidRemoteFileURI when specifying default["server_files"] = "\\winmomfs1\3rdParty\Oracle Client\Oracle_11g\win64_11gR2_client.zip" and then trying to access that attribute in my default.rb recipe
[2013-12-20 17:05:03 -0500] ctote_: Any ideas?
[2013-12-20 17:05:54 -0500] CPS: BeemanR9: log_level is defined in client.rb. I believe it defaults to :info, which should show you everything. it is however using ruby libraries under the hood, and I don't think you can control the output from them in chef
[2013-12-20 17:06:11 -0500] _tinman_: So I have a service resource that exits correctly but shuts down as soon as converge is finished.
[2013-12-20 17:06:17 -0500] CPS: zanshin: not sure, you'd have to play around with it
[2013-12-20 17:06:33 -0500] CPS: ctote_: escape the slashes
[2013-12-20 17:06:49 -0500] _tinman_: When I ssh into my vagrant, and use the service start command at the cli, the service starts fine and stays running.
[2013-12-20 17:06:50 -0500] CPS: \\\\winsomething\\stuffs
[2013-12-20 17:06:52 -0500] drywheat: i'm create a wrapper for the rbenv cookbook and i'm having a little trouble figuring out where i should set attributes
[2013-12-20 17:06:54 -0500] zanshin: OK. I can parse the output from `knife cookbook list` and pass it through `knife cookbook download`
[2013-12-20 17:06:59 -0500] ctote_: CPS: I did, but I got the same message.
[2013-12-20 17:07:03 -0500] _tinman_: Any ideas?
[2013-12-20 17:07:14 -0500] drywheat: the cookbook leverages rbenv lwrps to install rubies and gems, etc...
[2013-12-20 17:07:27 -0500] drywheat: but i also want to add a list of users to the rbenv group
[2013-12-20 17:07:41 -0500] drywheat: thing is, those users are created in a separate recipe
[2013-12-20 17:07:54 -0500] ctote_: CPS: [2013-12-20T12:07:37-05:00] FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::InvalidRemoteFileURI: "\\\\winmomfs1\\3rdParty\\Oracle Client\\Oracle_11g\\win64_11gR2_client.zip" is not a valid `source` para meter for remote_file. `source` must be an absolute URI or an array of URIs.
[2013-12-20 17:07:58 -0500] drywheat: so, should i depend on that other cookbook?
[2013-12-20 17:08:17 -0500] CPS: oooh ctote_ that's a nas path, not a uri
[2013-12-20 17:08:36 -0500] CPS: it wants something like ftp://ftpserver
[2013-12-20 17:08:49 -0500] j^2: CPS: nice thanks
[2013-12-20 17:08:59 -0500] ctote_: Hm, is there no way to just copy a share without using ftp or something?
[2013-12-20 17:09:01 -0500] drywheat: that's too complicated of a question, let me try again
[2013-12-20 17:09:30 -0500] CPS: ctote_: i'm on windows and my hacky workaround is to execute a copy command
[2013-12-20 17:09:34 -0500] drywheat: should i set attributes inside a role cookbook, or just include recipes?
[2013-12-20 17:09:47 -0500] CPS: if you're on another platform, the regular file resource may work
[2013-12-20 17:10:13 -0500] ctote_: CPS I'm on windows also:  remote_file "Copy Oracle Files" do path "c:\\chef-tmp" source "#{node["server_files"]}" end
[2013-12-20 17:11:22 -0500] CPS: ctote_: you might try http://docs.opscode.com/resource_file.html
[2013-12-20 17:11:47 -0500] CPS: I'm literally just executing "copy #{source} #{dest}"
[2013-12-20 17:12:16 -0500] CPS: which is sort of nice because if you don't specify a file it just copies everything in the directory
[2013-12-20 17:15:13 -0500] allaire: If I'm using berkshelf, I suppose it's normal to always have empty `coobkooks` directory in my chef-repo correct?
[2013-12-20 17:18:19 -0500] marcusmorris: I have a question about something that's always confused me
[2013-12-20 17:19:00 -0500] marcusmorris: if I update a cookbook, how do I make sure the client it is updated on has no remnants of the changes from the old cookbook version?
[2013-12-20 17:19:15 -0500] marcusmorris: without reprovisioning the server
[2013-12-20 17:19:43 -0500] CPS: a chef-client run downloads the node's asigned cookbooks every time
[2013-12-20 17:19:53 -0500] CPS: it will run the new version
[2013-12-20 17:20:15 -0500] marcusmorris: yes, but if there are changes made by the old cookbook, how can I be sure they are overwritten by the new version?
[2013-12-20 17:20:25 -0500] CPS: you may have to take care to remove things the old version added that shouldn't be in the new version
[2013-12-20 17:20:30 -0500] marcusmorris: yea
[2013-12-20 17:20:38 -0500] marcusmorris: like how do I even track those things?
[2013-12-20 17:20:47 -0500] marcusmorris: i feel like it's less hassle to just start from scratch
[2013-12-20 17:20:53 -0500] CPS: well you should know what your cookbooks do :D
[2013-12-20 17:20:53 -0500] marcusmorris: but that's not always an option
[2013-12-20 17:21:01 -0500] marcusmorris: what about community cookbooks
[2013-12-20 17:21:02 -0500] CPS: delete files, remove env vars, etc.
[2013-12-20 17:21:23 -0500] CPS: they should be thoroughly evaluated and understood before being put into production
[2013-12-20 17:21:41 -0500] mattsurabian: marcusmorris: otherwise it's the equivalent of random copy-paste coding
[2013-12-20 17:22:02 -0500] mattsurabian: just because they're community maintained doesn't mean "wash your hands of knowing what this does or how it does it"
[2013-12-20 17:22:25 -0500] marcusmorris: but to know and remember every single thing all community cookbooks change?
[2013-12-20 17:22:50 -0500] mattsurabian: marcusmorris: as opposed to what?
[2013-12-20 17:23:07 -0500] mattsurabian: mystery box deployments? :-p
[2013-12-20 17:23:27 -0500] marcusmorris: i know your right, just thought I'd ask
[2013-12-20 17:23:34 -0500] mattsurabian: plus, just cause you pull in a cookbook, doesn't mean you have to use every recipe
[2013-12-20 17:23:39 -0500] mattsurabian: or definition or whatever
[2013-12-20 17:23:51 -0500] mattsurabian: only the stuff you include in your runlist or otherwise run
[2013-12-20 17:26:15 -0500] BeemanR9: CPS: Found a way to enable debug-level logging for Chef Solo provisioner in VagrantFile.  It reports this:  Processing registry_key[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\Test] action create_if_missing (iees-disable::default line 71)  just like the other changes I make.  No exception.  But no registry change either.
[2013-12-20 18:11:54 -0500] workmad3: anyone around who can answer a quick question about load orders please? :)
[2013-12-20 18:14:29 -0500] spicy: Hi Chefs - is anyone using test-kitchen with chef-zero successfully? I'm having an issue where a cookbook trying to do a search gets connection refused, but I'm able to talk to the chef-zero server inside the instance that is converging via a ssh session to that instance (knife node list seems to work). Any thoughts?
[2013-12-20 18:14:50 -0500] coderanger: workmad3: I probably can
[2013-12-20 18:15:17 -0500] jkeiser: spicy: can you enable debug logging and find out what URL the cookbook is trying to hit when it fails?  Connection refused is not something I would expect to see
[2013-12-20 18:15:35 -0500] jkeiser: spicy: connection refused tends to mean that you're hitting a machine which is up, but a port which is unavailable
[2013-12-20 18:16:07 -0500] jkeiser: spicy: if chef-zero denied the request, you'd get a 404 or 405
[2013-12-20 18:16:21 -0500] spicy: jkeiser: http://127.0.0.1:8889/nodes/app-ubuntu-1204
[2013-12-20 18:16:48 -0500] jkeiser: That's the URL it's trying to hit when it fails?  That doesn't seem to be a search URL
[2013-12-20 18:16:51 -0500] workmad3: coderanger: I'm basically wondering if I'm seeing a bug in chefspec or an issue with chef... I'm trying to split a cookbook I've made with quite a few resource providers in out into separate, smaller cookbooks. In the big cookbook, I've created some base classes for providers and resources that provide some helper methods. Now when I'm splitting out into smaller cookbooks, I'd like to have those classes available without copy
[2013-12-20 18:17:19 -0500] workmad3: coderanger: so I'm wondering if that's a case of chef itself would have this issue, or is it a case where the chefspec mocked runner is doing the wrong thing? :)
[2013-12-20 18:17:28 -0500] jkeiser: spicy: since chef-zero has no authentication, you can verify whether that works with wget
[2013-12-20 18:17:44 -0500] jkeiser: spicy: wget http://127.0.0.1:8889/nodes/app-ubuntu-1204 from the machine that is running chef-client
[2013-12-20 18:17:54 -0500] jkeiser: or curl
[2013-12-20 18:17:59 -0500] spicy: jkeiser: oh sorry, no. search url is: /search/node?q=keys_ssh:*%20NOT%20name:app-ubuntu-1204&sort=X_CHEF_id_CHEF_X%20asc&start=0&rows=1000
[2013-12-20 18:18:19 -0500] jkeiser: spicy: what is the full url?  Biggest, most important thing is the host:port
[2013-12-20 18:18:40 -0500] jkeiser: If you start chef-client with -l debug, it should show you
[2013-12-20 18:19:07 -0500] workmad3: coderanger: I did a bit of googling, and I found a patch that seems to indicate that chef 11 will load dependency libraries before a cookbook's libraries
[2013-12-20 18:19:19 -0500] coderanger: workmad3: All lib files are loaded in topological order between cookbooks
[2013-12-20 18:19:22 -0500] workmad3: coderanger: so I guess I'm really just looking for confirmation on this :)
[2013-12-20 18:19:30 -0500] coderanger: (as are attr files, resources, providers, etc)
[2013-12-20 18:19:42 -0500] workmad3: coderanger: ah, so it's just chefspec not being quite right... great, thanks :)
[2013-12-20 18:21:00 -0500] workmad3: I'll finish my re-organising then delve into chefspec, see if I can figure out a fix for it/them :)
[2013-12-20 18:22:52 -0500] spicy: jkeiser: DEBUG: HOST: :
[2013-12-20 18:23:09 -0500] spicy: jkeiser: looks like it is not passing through a proper url somehow?
[2013-12-20 18:23:45 -0500] jkeiser: spicy: do you feel safe posting the whole output to a gist?
[2013-12-20 18:24:04 -0500] jkeiser: Might help those of us who have read logs to have the whole thing
[2013-12-20 18:24:23 -0500] spicy: jkeiser: yeah i think so, let me just double check :)
[2013-12-20 18:24:40 -0500] jkeiser: You can send me in private too.  It might be a bit, doing a code review right now
[2013-12-20 18:24:55 -0500] spicy: jkeiser: no worries, appreciate the help!
[2013-12-20 18:29:09 -0500] darron: Really confused about the sudo LWRP and how it's failing for me - https://gist.github.com/darron/8059131#file-gistfile1-txt-L245-L249 - that's what I've done - and it's failing - but I can't find "node" anywhere in the standard sudo templates: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/sudo/tree/master/templates/default - can somebody point me in the right
[2013-12-20 18:29:09 -0500] darron: direction?

[2013-12-20 18:46:00 -0500] j^2: if you are using chef-solo you it runs as sudo
[2013-12-20 18:46:06 -0500] j^2: test it with sudo before hand
[2013-12-20 18:46:12 -0500] divbell: just sudo -i
[2013-12-20 18:46:27 -0500] workmad3: or sudo !! if you've just run it without sudo
[2013-12-20 18:57:17 -0500] Sauraus: So I am going to bring this up yet again, how can a chef server 'loose' nodes from the status tab?
[2013-12-20 18:58:15 -0500] Sauraus: The nodes exists on the nodes tab just fine and chef-client on those nodes checks-in every ~30 minutes and downloads/applies any updates as needed and yet the status page has no knowledge of the node
[2013-12-20 19:01:04 -0500] jbz: Sauraus: is this on Chef 11?
[2013-12-20 19:01:34 -0500] Sauraus: yes
[2013-12-20 19:01:41 -0500] Sauraus: Brand new server setup
[2013-12-20 19:01:54 -0500] Sauraus: Even a reindex does not recover the nodes that have gone missing.
[2013-12-20 19:01:57 -0500] jbz: There are several bugs in the tracking system about the status page
[2013-12-20 19:02:01 -0500] jbz: for various reasons
[2013-12-20 19:02:03 -0500] jbz: e.g. https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3883
[2013-12-20 19:02:12 -0500] jbz: but that one has links at the bottom to other issues
[2013-12-20 19:02:26 -0500] jbz: I guess my tl;dr is that "I'm not surprised it's acting wonky."  Sorry, I know that isn't totally helpful.
[2013-12-20 19:02:50 -0500] Sauraus: Even the total randomness of nodes going AWALK?
[2013-12-20 19:04:29 -0500] Sauraus: One of the nodes was showing up for 2 days and then disappeared, the other nodes were just added and never showed up
[2013-12-20 19:05:32 -0500] CPS: what are my options for handling when a chef client run fails? as in a recipe has some unhandled exception or something? how can i notify the people in charge of the nodes that something went wrong?
[2013-12-20 19:15:21 -0500] Sauraus: https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3883 its just another one of those tickets that confirms my feeling that Chef is great, but it lacks the polish to be considered truly enterprise ready.
[2013-12-20 19:17:21 -0500] jbz: CPS:  You can use an error handler, which executes on errors.
[2013-12-20 19:18:25 -0500] jbz: CPS: Sorry, exception handler: http://docs.opscode.com/handlers.html#exception-report-handlers
[2013-12-20 19:19:56 -0500] werdnativ: I'm trying to set up chefspec, does it follow and execute `include_recipe` or does it behave as a strictly isolated unit test?

[2013-12-20 19:20:52 -0500] werdnativ: I have `include_recipe 'timezone'` and checking `expect(chef_run).to render_file("/etc/timezone")` ; Is that overreaching?

[2013-12-20 20:23:13 -0500] freerobby: Is it possible for a cookbook to have dependencies on other cookbooks when using berkshelf?
[2013-12-20 20:24:08 -0500] darron: freerobby: Yes.
[2013-12-20 20:25:42 -0500] freerobby: darron: How do you do that? I know it doesn't support sub-Berksfiles within cookbooks and it doesn't seem to lock into the metadata.rb either. Am I missing something?
[2013-12-20 20:25:47 -0500] surge_: How might I force a 'knife client/node bulk delete' without confirmation?

[2013-12-20 20:27:05 -0500] darron: Look in metadata.rb and in the Berkfile
[2013-12-20 20:27:24 -0500] freerobby: darron: e.g. I have a cookbook called "ohai-public_ip" that my cookbook depends on. But a berks install will yield "Cookbook 'ohai-public_ip' not found in any of the default locations" because it's in a git repo rather than on opscode
[2013-12-20 20:27:50 -0500] freerobby: darron: Interesting. Are any of the cookbooks in your berksfile not also on opscode?
[2013-12-20 20:28:17 -0500] freerobby: I can hack this by requiring them from the roles, but I hate to be so sloppy.
[2013-12-20 20:28:39 -0500] darron: You bet - most of my cookbooks weren't from opscode.
[2013-12-20 20:28:43 -0500] darron: In that repo.
[2013-12-20 20:30:49 -0500] masterkorp: hello
[2013-12-20 20:31:07 -0500] masterkorp: Guys what are your toughs on chefspec vs test-kitchen
[2013-12-20 20:31:40 -0500] freerobby: darron: Interesting. I don't understand how that works based on my reading of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20479174/problems-with-using-non-community-cookbooks-with-berkshelf
[2013-12-20 20:31:48 -0500] freerobby: I can't seem to get it to work on my end
[2013-12-20 20:34:50 -0500] darron: Hmm - not sure why honestly - I have been using a cookbook template and building off of that: https://github.com/darron/skeleton-cookbook
[2013-12-20 20:35:15 -0500] freerobby: Maybe those cookbooks happen to be required by other cookbooks as well?
[2013-12-20 20:35:20 -0500] freerobby: I'm just taking a stab in the dark
[2013-12-20 20:36:47 -0500] darron: The octohost cookbook is just an application or a wrapper cookbook that just does this: https://gist.github.com/darron/8061113
[2013-12-20 20:37:04 -0500] darron: Everything happens in the other cookbooks.
[2013-12-20 20:37:46 -0500] freerobby: This is frustrating. I don't understand how berkshelf is even useful given that restriction
[2013-12-20 20:37:50 -0500] surge_: Nevermind, found my answer (using the knife exec command)
[2013-12-20 20:37:53 -0500] freerobby: The whole benefit of bundler is that it can manage subdependencies.
[2013-12-20 20:37:58 -0500] freerobby: If Berkshelf doesn't support that, why bother?
[2013-12-20 20:38:16 -0500] darron: Berkshelf does do that - it works for me. There must be something up with a config file somewhere.
[2013-12-20 20:38:58 -0500] darron: To use packer and chef solo all I do is: berks install --path vendor/cookbooks; packer build template.json
[2013-12-20 20:39:18 -0500] darron: That installs the cookbooks so that packer can find them (it doesn't have native Berkshelf support) and then builds from that.
[2013-12-20 20:40:25 -0500] freerobby: I mean, I believe you, but I think it's a fluke on your end that is making it work.
[2013-12-20 20:40:26 -0500] freerobby: https://github.com/berkshelf/berkshelf/issues/369
[2013-12-20 20:40:34 -0500] freerobby: They seem to acknowledge this as unsupported
[2013-12-20 20:41:00 -0500] freerobby: It might work with chef-solo because of looser dependency checks.
[2013-12-20 20:41:10 -0500] werdnativ: Trying this in chefspec: expect(chef_run).to render_file("/etc/timezone").with_content("UTC")
[2013-12-20 20:41:37 -0500] werdnativ: My recipe has: include_recipe 'timezone' and it's obviously doing it but the test fails.
[2013-12-20 20:41:58 -0500] werdnativ: does chefspec not cross "include_recipe" boundaries?
[2013-12-20 20:42:07 -0500] ranjib: it does
[2013-12-20 20:42:44 -0500] werdnativ: oh, so it might not be using the file resource?
[2013-12-20 20:42:52 -0500] darron: Might be a fluke - dunno - it seems to work pretty well though with test-kitchen and chef-solo - I honestly haven't tried it with chef-server in a while.
[2013-12-20 20:43:34 -0500] ranjib: darron, what error you are getting ?
[2013-12-20 20:44:20 -0500] darron: I'm not getting an error - freerobby is
[2013-12-20 20:44:31 -0500] ranjib: oh.
[2013-12-20 20:45:05 -0500] ranjib: masterkorp, chefspec is unit testing. so its fast, white boxed and more helpful in designing and some branch logic testing
[2013-12-20 20:46:12 -0500] ranjib: test kitchen on the other hand is functional testing. so you can find loads of bugs using tk. also its an actual convergence. but its also time consuming . depending upon what you want from ur test harness you can choose any of those
[2013-12-20 20:46:37 -0500] ranjib: i use chefspec and lxc+rspec (instead of test kitchen).
[2013-12-20 20:48:58 -0500] darron: I have been using chefspec and serverspec with test kitchen lately - love it
[2013-12-20 20:54:24 -0500] pwelch_: darron: how are you testing different scenarios with test-kitchen and serverspec? Example: a database recipe that could install mysql or postgres. I havent figured out how to setup serverspec to test each scenario
[2013-12-20 20:54:43 -0500] darron: I haven't done that yet.
[2013-12-20 20:55:25 -0500] darron: Not sure I will - I like my chef recipes really simple and would likely make 2 recipes for that myself.
[2013-12-20 20:55:43 -0500] adnichols: pwelch_: pwelch_ serverspec just runs commands and checks the output - so you could do a variety of things to validate that your db was installed correctly
[2013-12-20 20:57:01 -0500] pwelch_: adnichols: I guess my question is how do I configure it or where do I put the serverspec tests? right now its just test/integration/path/to/localhost. If I had two different suites in my .kitchen.yml how would I tell it which serverspec to run (mysql vs postgres)
[2013-12-20 20:57:25 -0500] adnichols: each suite has a directory with it's name
[2013-12-20 20:57:53 -0500] adnichols: so for each suite you run, you have a different set of serverspec tests
[2013-12-20 20:58:11 -0500] adnichols: .... this is assuming test-kitchen
[2013-12-20 20:59:00 -0500] pwelch_: adnichols: yes, I am using test-kitchen. I just didnt know how to setup my directories
[2013-12-20 20:59:03 -0500] adnichols: so for a suite called "mysql" you have test/integration/mysql
[2013-12-20 20:59:08 -0500] pwelch_: just been following the basic guide
[2013-12-20 20:59:24 -0500] pwelch_: how is test-kitchen smart enough to know which one to load?
[2013-12-20 20:59:41 -0500] adnichols: it looks for a directory matching the suite name
[2013-12-20 21:00:47 -0500] pwelch_: adnichols: ok, cool. Thanks
[2013-12-20 21:01:48 -0500] adnichols: for most of our cookbooks we have a 'default' suite which does our normal integration tests
[2013-12-20 21:02:15 -0500] adnichols: if we want more specific suites then we can create others
[2013-12-20 21:03:12 -0500] darron: adnichols: Do you know if there's a way to get the serverspec integration tests to run in your dependant cookbooks? I have a wrapper that pulls in dependancies via Berkshelf but doesn't run any of their Integration tests and have been mulling over that.
[2013-12-20 21:03:51 -0500] adnichols: darron: it will not run serverspec inside those cookbooks - you have to decide if it's appropriate to duplicate your integration tests
[2013-12-20 21:04:09 -0500] darron: OK - that's what I had thought to do - just hadn't bothered to do it yet - thanks for confirming.
[2013-12-20 21:04:34 -0500] adnichols: for wrapper cookbooks we will often simply use chefspec to test the behavior & logic of the wrapper and leave it at that - let the included cookbooks have their own integration tests to ensure they do what they are supposed to
[2013-12-20 21:05:05 -0500] adnichols: most wrappers have very little logic so there's very little testing to do
[2013-12-20 21:05:08 -0500] darron: yeah
[2013-12-20 21:05:15 -0500] darron: it's such a small cookbook
[2013-12-20 21:05:23 -0500] adnichols: you shouldn't have to test that setting attributes gets the right results - that should be tested in the cookbook you are including
[2013-12-20 21:05:45 -0500] darron: Yeah - all of that is covered - just wanted to make sure that all the daemons were running at the end really.
[2013-12-20 21:05:57 -0500] adnichols: but you may want to check that your wrapper includes the correct set of cookbooks if you change that based on some attribute - so we use chefspec for that
[2013-12-20 21:06:03 -0500] adnichols: ah yeah
[2013-12-20 21:06:24 -0500] darron: Thanks.
[2013-12-20 21:09:23 -0500] adnichols: it's interesting finding the right balance - we've backed off on a lot of duplicated tests in the interest of making things easier to change w/out having to update all your wrappers and such
[2013-12-20 21:10:51 -0500] darron: Yeah - for certain.
[2013-12-20 21:45:08 -0500] rayrod2030: anyone having issues with berks upload pulling from http://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/cookbooks?
[2013-12-20 21:45:28 -0500] rayrod2030: I'm using berks 2.0.10
[2013-12-20 22:03:15 -0500] adnichols: rayrod2030: we just ran into some problems - you still having issues?
[2013-12-20 22:03:51 -0500] rayrod2030: I think so.  upgraded to berkshelf 3.0.x to see if that fixes it but 2.0 was definitely having issues with the standard chef cookbook repo endpoint
[2013-12-20 22:05:01 -0500] adnichols: yeah so far only one cookbook (docker) for us - going to try just working around it
[2013-12-20 22:05:09 -0500] rayrod2030: yup still issues building berks 3.0 universe
[2013-12-20 22:05:20 -0500] rayrod2030: http://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1 shouldn't that endpoint return a shit ton more json?
[2013-12-20 22:05:57 -0500] rayrod2030: or this one http://community.getchef.com/api/v1/cookbooks
[2013-12-20 22:06:22 -0500] adnichols: I would think so
[2013-12-20 22:10:13 -0500] adnichols: rayrod2030: http://status.opscode.com/ <- just updated
[2013-12-20 22:11:07 -0500] rayrod2030: ah ok good thing it wasn't my company network.  I was about to ragequit
[2013-12-20 22:11:33 -0500] rayrod2030: anyway this is probably natures way of telling me it's whiskey o'clock.
[2013-12-20 22:11:45 -0500] adnichols: :)

[2013-12-20 22:18:42 -0500] Guest72202: I have a question about the cookbooks site -- is there an issue with it at the moment?
[2013-12-20 22:18:47 -0500] rayrod2030: yes
[2013-12-20 22:18:55 -0500] rayrod2030: http://status.opscode.com/
[2013-12-20 22:19:19 -0500] rayrod2030: anything talking to the community cookbook metadata endpoint most likely affected.
[2013-12-20 22:19:20 -0500] Guest72202: ah
[2013-12-20 22:19:33 -0500] darron: No - you're not going crazy.
[2013-12-20 22:19:37 -0500] Guest72202: some cookbooks download and others don't
[2013-12-20 22:19:41 -0500] Guest72202: I'll just be patient
[2013-12-20 22:19:42 -0500] darron: It is b0rken.
[2013-12-20 22:21:38 -0500] anotherjesse: http://status.opscode.com/ says resolved 1 minute ago
[2013-12-20 22:21:50 -0500] anotherjesse: and I was able to install cookbooks
[2013-12-20 22:22:03 -0500] jstump: anotherjesse, rayrod2030: Yeah, it's looking like it might be back. Berkshelf is less angry all of the sudden.
[2013-12-20 22:22:28 -0500] rayrod2030: \o/
[2013-12-20 22:22:45 -0500] rayrod2030: well at least it got me to upgrade to berks 3.0.x
[2013-12-20 22:22:50 -0500] adnichols: heh
[2013-12-20 22:23:13 -0500] rayrod2030: tools are amaze. wow.
[2013-12-20 22:23:36 -0500] jstump: rayrod2030: Ha, nice. I can't wait for the new dependency resolver in 3.
[2013-12-20 22:27:18 -0500] aneel: hey, is http://community.getchef.com/ giving an index page for everyone, or just me?
[2013-12-20 22:27:47 -0500] coderanger: aneel: Yes, it is down
[2013-12-20 22:27:57 -0500] aneel: okay, thanks
[2013-12-20 22:32:39 -0500] coderanger: aneel: http://community.opscode.com/ works though
[2013-12-20 22:33:08 -0500] aneel: oh, great. thanks!

[2013-12-20 22:58:55 -0500] Vocino: Hello
[2013-12-20 23:00:00 -0500] Vocino: Can anyone recommend a decent writeup for getting a Rails app up and running on OpsWorks?  I've read a lot of information about how the default cookbooks from Amazon don't work very well.
[2013-12-20 23:01:12 -0500] AntelopeSalad: Vocino: have you looked at karmi's repo?
[2013-12-20 23:01:38 -0500] Vocino: AntelopeSalad: i don't believe so
[2013-12-20 23:01:47 -0500] Vocino: unless i'm not recognizing the name
[2013-12-20 23:02:17 -0500] AntelopeSalad: i'm new to chef too but i've been looking at this https://github.com/karmi/chef-hello-cloud for inspiration / tips
[2013-12-20 23:02:55 -0500] AntelopeSalad: he has a chef-solo version too, but i didn't really explore that one yet
[2013-12-20 23:03:12 -0500] Vocino: this does look promising, thanks!
[2013-12-20 23:33:09 -0500] slillibri: Is there a way to pass arguments to a service in a notification? I want to have a single service that can restart multiple instances such as 'notifies :reload, service[:bob], extraArgs' turns into something like 'bob reload extraArgs'?
[2013-12-20 23:36:56 -0500] Vocino: AntelopeSalad: are you using Amazon Linux or Ubuntu?
[2013-12-20 23:40:24 -0500] AntelopeSalad: Vocino: i'm using a single ubuntu 13.x ec2 instance , i have not deployed karmi's setup yet
[2013-12-20 23:40:45 -0500] Vocino: via OpsWorks or just standard EC2?
[2013-12-20 23:42:24 -0500] AntelopeSalad: standard ec2, 100% cowboy style manual setup
[2013-12-20 23:42:40 -0500] AntelopeSalad: after doing that twice i wanted to throw myself off a cliff so now i'm in the process of learning chef
