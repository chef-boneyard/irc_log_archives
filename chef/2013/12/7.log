[2013-12-07 00:02:07 -0500] kcb_: foo = Chef::Provider::Package::Yum::YumCache.instance seems to let you do foo.installed_version('ntp')
[2013-12-07 00:02:27 -0500] kcb_: but i'm guessing that makes my own yum cache so runs yum-dump.py again rather than using the one chef already ran which seems unnecessary
[2013-12-07 00:06:41 -0500] force: I've confirmed this behavior through experimentation. Extending/mixing in to your Recipe class "enhances" (pollutes) the Recipe class across all cookbooks.
[2013-12-07 00:06:45 -0500] spox: force: yes, it will. you are adding methods directly into the recipe class. depending on where you are doing that, you may have some instances that do not contain those methods if they were instantiated prior to the module inclusion
[2013-12-07 00:08:30 -0500] force: Thanks spox. That's a bummer. :/ But I'm glad to have the behavior confirmed. I can namespace around that.
[2013-12-07 00:08:57 -0500] spox: force: if you want to isolate it to just your recipes in your cookbook, you can probably use extend within each recipe
[2013-12-07 00:34:58 -0500] troyready: Would appreciate some ruby debugging help in trying to get a knife plugin to work: any idea why the following line would generate a "uninitialized constant GraphViz" error? https://github.com/aglarond/knife-role-spaghetti/blob/server-roles/lib/chef/knife/spaghetti.rb#L86
[2013-12-07 00:36:26 -0500] zambs: is there anyone else getting the following error while bootstrapping?

[2013-12-07 00:36:36 -0500] lewiz1: zambs: I joined to ask the same question
[2013-12-07 00:37:03 -0500] zambs: looks like they replaced the certificate
[2013-12-07 00:37:09 -0500] zambs: did you get any response?
[2013-12-07 00:37:26 -0500] lewiz1: zambs: I joined ten seconds before you asked :-)
[2013-12-07 00:37:41 -0500] zambs: you fast :P

[2013-12-07 00:51:32 -0500] force: spox: yes! of course.
[2013-12-07 00:57:16 -0500] mesmer: troyready: I think your class must be in the Chef::Knife class
[2013-12-07 00:57:22 -0500] force: Here's a Gist demonstrating extending an instance with a module, which achieves what I want. Thanks again, spox! https://gist.github.com/justinforce/7835834
[2013-12-07 00:57:46 -0500] mesmer: So, deps is probably not getting run
[2013-12-07 00:59:27 -0500] mesmer: http://docs.opscode.com/plugin_knife_custom.html
[2013-12-07 00:59:51 -0500] mesmer: See the Winrm example
[2013-12-07 00:59:51 -0500] troyready: mesmer, the same issue appears to occur in irb when I do a "require "graphviz" "g = GraphViz...", so it seems like it's not specific to knife?
[2013-12-07 01:00:02 -0500] mesmer: ah ok
[2013-12-07 01:00:03 -0500] mesmer: no idea then
[2013-12-07 01:01:44 -0500] troyready: Thanks anyway :)
[2013-12-07 01:02:32 -0500] juliancdunn: lewiz1: we had some temporary issues with the cert - should be fixed
[2013-12-07 01:04:29 -0500] lewiz1: juliancdunn: cool - thanks
[2013-12-07 01:06:33 -0500] lewiz1: juliancdunn: I can confirm the download is once again working for me.  thanks
[2013-12-07 01:09:46 -0500] troyready: regarding my graphviz issue from earlier -- the error was having the "graphviz" gem installed alongsize "ruby-graphviz" -- uninstalling the former cleared up the issue
[2013-12-07 01:27:41 -0500] edwardc: teukka: thanks. i will file the bug later.
[2013-12-07 01:28:50 -0500] edwardc: teukka: but i found that my knife solo will fail only if i execute the command within a script called by php exec();
[2013-12-07 01:28:58 -0500] edwardc: teukka: that's weird ...
[2013-12-07 01:58:42 -0500] acoulton: Hi, I'm having a strange problem with attributes in chef-solo - values that are defined as defaults in attribute files are present at compile time, but disappear at runtime.
[2013-12-07 02:00:19 -0500] acoulton: Are attributes recompiled between compile time and convergence?
[2013-12-07 02:21:01 -0500] teukka: edwardc: maybe it's using another ruby version that you are from your shell session?
[2013-12-07 02:21:54 -0500] edwardc: teukka: well, maybe. i am looking for system environment and/or other issues.
[2013-12-07 02:22:50 -0500] edwardc: teukka: btw what's recommended ruby version for chef ?
[2013-12-07 02:25:02 -0500] teukka: 1.9.3 is probably most tested one as the omnibus installer bundles it. but latest versions are supposed to work with 2.0 too
[2013-12-07 02:27:34 -0500] gregkare: You should use the Omnibus installer unless you have a really good reason not to
[2013-12-07 02:28:37 -0500] teukka: well, I like to use bundler on my workstation. but YMMV
[2013-12-07 02:29:15 -0500] teukka: knife-solo will install the omnibus chef to the node if the platform is known to be supported
[2013-12-07 03:10:51 -0500] edwardc: teukka: i just make sure there's no other version of ruby on my machine. so still a myth.
[2013-12-07 03:12:29 -0500] teukka: edwardc: the stack trace you gave earlier showed that it came from ruby 1.8. and sure enough that is a knife-solo issue there
[2013-12-07 03:13:26 -0500] edwardc: teukka: yep, i notice your message. actually i setup a whole clean environment here with ruby 2.0.0p353
[2013-12-07 03:14:04 -0500] edwardc: teukka: so here's new stack trace: https://gist.github.com/edwardchuang/7836827
[2013-12-07 03:14:25 -0500] edwardc: ruby 2 + chef 11.6.2 ...
[2013-12-07 03:16:41 -0500] teukka: edwardc: ah, ok. that might be a configuration issue. or at least knife issue. no knife-solo on the stack trace so probably it is not even loaded yet
[2013-12-07 03:20:29 -0500] edwardc: teukka: ok, so environment might be a good guess
[2013-12-07 03:31:39 -0500] edwardc: teukka: i think PATH is the same regardless use script or not. any clue ?
[2013-12-07 03:33:22 -0500] teukka: edwardc: could you gist .chef/knife.rb?
[2013-12-07 03:35:08 -0500] edwardc: teukka: sure, https://gist.github.com/edwardchuang/7836966
[2013-12-07 03:35:30 -0500] edwardc: i think it's normal, maybe that's not included while i called chef by script ?
[2013-12-07 03:36:53 -0500] teukka: edwardc: does the script have the same working directory?
[2013-12-07 03:37:55 -0500] edwardc: yes, i am sure it's same directory. coz i print out $PWD
[2013-12-07 03:38:40 -0500] edwardc: teukka: the point is, if i use same script in command line, it's OK. but called same script by php exec(), it failed.
[2013-12-07 03:39:43 -0500] teukka: edwardc: I should read the code. but it's late and I'm too tired. sorry :/
[2013-12-07 03:40:05 -0500] teukka: edwardc: I'll get back to it tomorrow. now off to bed =)
[2013-12-07 03:40:33 -0500] edwardc: teukka: thanks !! and good nite
[2013-12-07 04:21:16 -0500] chefa: Hi I have just signed up to hosted chef and want to spin up a node... how do I do this in opscode manage?
[2013-12-07 04:25:06 -0500] jmickle: chef you need to use knife or something to spin up with your virtualization platform
[2013-12-07 04:25:16 -0500] jmickle: or use knife to bootstrap a node
[2013-12-07 04:25:19 -0500] jmickle: chefa: *
[2013-12-07 04:26:02 -0500] chefa: don't I get 5 nodes for free?
[2013-12-07 04:26:27 -0500] jmickle: huh those aren't 5 servers
[2013-12-07 04:26:29 -0500] juliancdunn: you get to register 5 nodes for free
[2013-12-07 04:26:33 -0500] chefa: how do I start using a hosted chef free node?
[2013-12-07 04:26:43 -0500] jmickle: you can register 5 nodes for free to be managed by chef
[2013-12-07 04:26:48 -0500] juliancdunn: bring your own nodes -- I recommend Amazon EC2
[2013-12-07 04:27:03 -0500] chefa: can I do it for free though?
[2013-12-07 04:27:20 -0500] jmickle: chefa where is your infrastructure hosted?
[2013-12-07 04:27:51 -0500] chefa: about 7 months ago, I used to spin up to 5 nodes for free on ec2
[2013-12-07 04:27:57 -0500] chefa: via hosted chef
[2013-12-07 04:28:02 -0500] chefa: has this changed?
[2013-12-07 04:28:19 -0500] jmickle: hosted chef has nothing to do with amazon's pricing model
[2013-12-07 04:28:34 -0500] jmickle: amazon and opscode are 2 different companies
[2013-12-07 04:28:49 -0500] chefa: I am pretty sure I fired up nodes for free 7 months ago
[2013-12-07 04:28:53 -0500] jmickle: hosted chef will let you manage 5 of your ec2 nodes for free through htheir hosted platform
[2013-12-07 04:29:10 -0500] jmickle: but you will still have to pay amazon
[2013-12-07 04:29:12 -0500] jmickle: for your nodes
[2013-12-07 04:29:19 -0500] chefa: hmmmm ok
[2013-12-07 04:29:20 -0500] jmickle: you can use hosted chef for 5 nodes for free
[2013-12-07 04:29:35 -0500] jmickle: and i guarantee you 7 months ago you probably paid amazon as well :-P
[2013-12-07 04:29:54 -0500] juliancdunn: amazon gives you 750 hours of machine time for free when you first signup
[2013-12-07 04:29:59 -0500] juliancdunn: after that, you pay
[2013-12-07 04:30:06 -0500] chefa: I think I did... can't you use the free t1.micro offerings? for testing?
[2013-12-07 04:30:15 -0500] jmickle: oh that may be
[2013-12-07 04:30:19 -0500] juliancdunn: yes, but that's for a maximum of one year -- again, Amazon policy
[2013-12-07 04:30:21 -0500] c_t: that's between you and Amazon though
[2013-12-07 04:30:23 -0500] jmickle: the like t1.micro free tier on a new account
[2013-12-07 04:30:31 -0500] jmickle: yeah thats all between you and amazon
[2013-12-07 04:30:34 -0500] jmickle: nothing to do with opscode chef
[2013-12-07 04:31:03 -0500] chefa: ok, so which t1.micro ec2 instance should I use?
[2013-12-07 04:31:34 -0500] jmickle: i can't parse what you are asking chefa
[2013-12-07 04:32:46 -0500] chefa: <jmickle> so I go off and signup for ec2, start a t1.micro instance, and then come back to opscode and add it as a node?
[2013-12-07 04:32:51 -0500] jmickle: what are you trying to do? maybe i can help you understand the technology better
[2013-12-07 04:33:35 -0500] jmickle: chefa that is one way to do it, or you can sign up for an amazon ec2 account grab your api keys and configure your knife and spin up/bootstrap with knife
[2013-12-07 04:34:00 -0500] chefa: <jmickel> I just want to start using Hosted Chef with ec2, is there an entry level doc for this?
[2013-12-07 04:34:04 -0500] juliancdunn: if you are just starting out learning Chef, may I recommend: https://learnchef.opscode.com/screencasts/chef-lab/
[2013-12-07 04:34:14 -0500] juliancdunn: you can use the training AMI that we provide -- the AMI # is on that page
[2013-12-07 04:34:15 -0500] jmickle: thanks julian was about to link that
[2013-12-07 04:34:15 -0500] jmickle: ;-)
[2013-12-07 04:34:18 -0500] juliancdunn: and then just start watching the videos
[2013-12-07 04:34:48 -0500] c_t: also when I first started playing with chef I used local VMs to experiment with
[2013-12-07 04:34:54 -0500] juliancdunn: the narrator will walk you through all aspects of setting up everything to do with Chef
[2013-12-07 04:35:13 -0500] c_t: later I got a call from someone at Opscode because I forgot to delete some experimental nodes and went over
[2013-12-07 04:35:28 -0500] chefa: I am thinking of using your training lab
[2013-12-07 04:35:47 -0500] c_t: forgot who it was, but he was real nice about it
[2013-12-07 04:36:07 -0500] juliancdunn: c_t: salespeople generally are :-)
[2013-12-07 04:36:29 -0500] juliancdunn: chefa: so yeah, just fire up a new VM in EC2 using the training lab #, and start with Chef Fundamentals Module One
[2013-12-07 04:37:01 -0500] chefa: so can I log onto this training lab ubuntu instance remotely?
[2013-12-07 04:37:23 -0500] juliancdunn: yessir
[2013-12-07 04:37:33 -0500] juliancdunn: but again, it's all covered in the videos :)
[2013-12-07 04:38:55 -0500] chefa: and it works for 24 hours?
[2013-12-07 04:39:06 -0500] chefa: can I come back in 2 days an still use the training lab?
[2013-12-07 04:39:49 -0500] juliancdunn: if you're using your own AMI, you can use it for as long as you want
[2013-12-07 04:40:04 -0500] juliancdunn: but if you're using the "BETA" CloudShare lab, there are time limits, which are explained to you when you sign up for it
[2013-12-07 04:40:25 -0500] chefa: it has a clock counting down for 24 hours
[2013-12-07 04:40:25 -0500] juliancdunn: and by "your own AMI" I mean if you fire up our AMI in your own Amazon account
[2013-12-07 04:40:43 -0500] chefa: I just want to use the training lab for a few days at this stage
[2013-12-07 04:43:17 -0500] chefa: ok so I am ssh'd into my training lab instance
[2013-12-07 04:46:53 -0500] c_t: holy moly, it's only 8:46
[2013-12-07 05:09:09 -0500] chefa: hi I have fired up a training lab instance ..... how do I install chef please
[2013-12-07 05:12:32 -0500] chefa: any assistance would be greatly appreciated
[2013-12-07 05:51:49 -0500] thun_: Can I use a value like this directly in my attributes file?
[2013-12-07 05:51:52 -0500] thun_: ruby { :ebs =>  { :volumes =>  { '/data' =>  { :size => 4, :piops => 1000, :fstype => 'xfs', :mount_options => 'noatime' } } } }
[2013-12-07 05:53:30 -0500] thun_: or do I have to convert it to something like default['ebs']['volumes'] ... blah blah
[2013-12-07 06:11:16 -0500] thun_: D/C Did I miss anything?
[2013-12-07 06:12:57 -0500] thun_: Also what does : represent in a variable default[:blah] ?
[2013-12-07 06:21:32 -0500] thun_: node.default[:ebs][:volumes]['/data'][:mount_options] = 'noatime'; ?
[2013-12-07 07:06:59 -0500] webframp: thun_ that's just ruby syntax for a symbol
[2013-12-07 08:13:02 -0500] chefa: hi, can someone assist me with explaining worstation vs server
[2013-12-07 08:18:31 -0500] coderanger: chefa: What part?
[2013-12-07 08:19:12 -0500] chefa: ok I just read the docs, workstation is where most of the crunching is done .... server is what you are automating ?? correct
[2013-12-07 08:19:35 -0500] chefa: where should I go for the steps to setup workstation and server?  I can't seem to find the right doc
[2013-12-07 08:20:47 -0500] coderanger: The chef server basically just stores data via a convenient API
[2013-12-07 08:21:08 -0500] coderanger: your workstation interacts with that API to do things like upload cookbooks and edit node run lists
[2013-12-07 08:22:10 -0500] n1ko: anyone using maps with templates? something like servername => [ip1,ip2] etc. Can't get it to work with nested loops
[2013-12-07 08:22:45 -0500] n1ko: basicly trying to do each pair loop first, then loop trough the values
[2013-12-07 08:24:17 -0500] chefa: thanks <@codranger>
[2013-12-07 08:24:42 -0500] chefa: how do I setup my opscode manage dashboard to speak to my ec2 instances?
[2013-12-07 08:25:49 -0500] coderanger: chefa: The WebUI doesn't speak to your instances
[2013-12-07 08:26:19 -0500] chefa: coderanger:  so how do they appear?
[2013-12-07 08:26:21 -0500] coderanger: n1ko: Can you pastebin the code?
[2013-12-07 08:26:31 -0500] coderanger: chefa: chef-client on your server pulls data from the chef-server
[2013-12-07 08:26:36 -0500] coderanger: and saves back up to it
[2013-12-07 08:26:49 -0500] coderanger: but its all initiated from the client side
[2013-12-07 08:27:22 -0500] chefa: coderanger: I have just install chef to my workstation .... to /opt/chef is that correct?
[2013-12-07 08:27:36 -0500] coderanger: chefa: Correct, thats the easiest way
[2013-12-07 08:28:12 -0500] chefa: coderanger: and from my workstation.... I can pretty much configure my server etc?    Just need that little bit of help to take the next step
[2013-12-07 08:29:04 -0500] coderanger: chefa: Yep, from your workstation you can upload the needed data into your chef server, and you can use ssh (or knife ssh) to run chef-client on your servers
[2013-12-07 08:29:32 -0500] chefa: ok, now how to I get an ec2 server up and running?
[2013-12-07 08:30:34 -0500] chefa: coderanger:  automated server on ec2, i presume there are some ec2 tools that can be used?
[2013-12-07 08:30:51 -0500] n1ko: coderanger: actually just got it to work. Just a wrongly placed %>. Asking on irc always helps
[2013-12-07 08:30:51 -0500] coderanger: chefa: There is knife-ec2 which has some very basic tools to start and stop VMs
[2013-12-07 08:30:54 -0500] n1ko: :p
[2013-12-07 08:31:07 -0500] coderanger: chefa: Emphasis on the "very basic" though
[2013-12-07 08:31:40 -0500] coderanger: n1ko: http://www.rubberduckdebugging.com/
[2013-12-07 08:32:14 -0500] chefa: coderanger: knife-ec2 is an apt-get install?
[2013-12-07 08:32:30 -0500] coderanger: chefa: No, its a gem
[2013-12-07 08:32:43 -0500] coderanger: chefa: /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install knife-ec2
[2013-12-07 08:34:08 -0500] chefa: coderanger: say ruby 1.9.1 and rubygems are not installed .... as I was eluding too, is there a magical page that I should follow to setup my workstation environment?
[2013-12-07 08:34:21 -0500] coderanger: chefa: Use the omnibus installer
[2013-12-07 08:34:33 -0500] coderanger: chefa: It includes ruby, rubygems, and everything else you need
[2013-12-07 08:34:45 -0500] chefa: coderanger: I have an ubuntu 13.10 server
[2013-12-07 08:34:58 -0500] chefa: coderanger: as my workstation
[2013-12-07 08:35:02 -0500] coderanger: Okay
[2013-12-07 08:35:31 -0500] coderanger: Not sure how thats relevant :)

[2013-12-07 08:47:07 -0500] chefa_: coderanger:  I did install the omnibus to /opt/chef however it still wants me to install rubygems and ruby 1.9.1 ... why is this?
[2013-12-07 08:48:47 -0500] chefa_: coderanger:  any assistance would be wonderful

[2013-12-07 14:55:03 -0500] holms: anybody have an idea=/? Cookbook 'elasticsearch' not found in any of the default locations
[2013-12-07 14:55:12 -0500] holms: i mean why..  it was working just a minute ago
[2013-12-07 15:52:24 -0500] maniacal: chef is failing to "restorecon" on a directory it's creating on an nfs mount
[2013-12-07 15:52:30 -0500] maniacal: I have selinux disabled
[2013-12-07 15:52:36 -0500] maniacal: this is making me nuts
[2013-12-07 15:53:07 -0500] maniacal: STDERR: /sbin/restorecon set context /path/to/nfs/mounted/directory->system_u:object_r:default_t:s0 failed:'Operation not supported'
[2013-12-07 15:53:22 -0500] maniacal: if selinux is disabled why is chef trying to do this
[2013-12-07 17:25:02 -0500] teukka: edwardc: ping?
[2013-12-07 17:25:55 -0500] teukka: edwardc: finally looking at the code in your stack trace it is splitting $PATH elements (as you maybe already had checked?)
[2013-12-07 17:26:12 -0500] teukka: edwardc: so in your script env you have an empty PATH
[2013-12-07 18:24:05 -0500] teukka: edwardc: btw, knife-solo master should now be anyway again compatible with ruby 1.8
[2013-12-07 18:39:34 -0500] gverri: What is the best way to clone a private repo (github) using chef?
[2013-12-07 18:54:26 -0500] Mellett68: hi all, does anybody know if there is a publicly-available cookbook for quassel core?
[2013-12-07 18:59:01 -0500] kallistec: gverri: set up a machine user like this: https://help.github.com/articles/managing-deploy-keys then configure root's ssh config to use that key
[2013-12-07 18:59:54 -0500] gverri: @kallistec using agent forwarding or deploy keys?
[2013-12-07 19:00:29 -0500] kallistec: gverri: deploy keys work, too but machine user account is the easiest
[2013-12-07 19:00:55 -0500] kallistec: last option on the github article
[2013-12-07 19:01:04 -0500] gverri: @kallistec thanks bro
[2013-12-07 19:44:51 -0500] streamfan: #learnchef
[2013-12-07 19:45:22 -0500] streamfan: guess I need to #learnirc first
[2013-12-07 19:53:25 -0500] jmkacz: I just inherited a cookbook and I want to run it through test kitchen. It makes use of search, and I haven't found anything online about mocking out that data. Can someone point me in the right direction?
[2013-12-07 19:59:08 -0500] gleam: look at chef-zero
[2013-12-07 19:59:40 -0500] jkeiser: The chef-zero provisioner should do you
[2013-12-07 19:59:55 -0500] gleam: supports data bags and search, unlike chef solo
[2013-12-07 20:00:09 -0500] jkeiser: You set up a chef_repo_path that has nodes/, roles/ or whatever it is you are searching for, and put .json files in those directories with the nodes or roles you want to search for
[2013-12-07 20:00:11 -0500] gleam: does chef solo do data bags? ig uess it might, i forget
[2013-12-07 20:00:36 -0500] jkeiser: My dim recollection is it has some issues with data bags, but I might be wrong about that
[2013-12-07 20:01:14 -0500] gleam: ah it's just that you can't search data bags, because you can't search anything
[2013-12-07 20:02:57 -0500] teukka: gleam: yeah, data_bags work. but for search you have to add chef-solo-search cookbook to your run_list
[2013-12-07 20:05:11 -0500] gleam: might as well just use chef zero
[2013-12-07 20:05:56 -0500] jforest: hef solo does databags just fine
[2013-12-07 20:06:07 -0500] jforest: it can't search the server, since there isn't one
[2013-12-07 20:06:38 -0500] teukka: gleam: oh, for sure
[2013-12-07 20:10:16 -0500] LuHe: hello. i want to deploy a django app on amazon aws, which is using chef-solo. i installed the following cookbooks: application, application_python, build-essential, python and yum. but when i run my custom recipe i get the following error: NameError - Cannot find a resource for application on amazon version 2013.09
[2013-12-07 20:10:25 -0500] LuHe: does anybody know what i've done wrong?
[2013-12-07 20:14:00 -0500] jmkacz: gleam: are you saying to use chef-zero with test-kitchen?
[2013-12-07 20:16:36 -0500] gleam: yeah
[2013-12-07 20:17:23 -0500] jmkacz: ok
[2013-12-07 20:17:24 -0500] jmkacz: thanks
[2013-12-07 20:37:51 -0500] jkeiser: jmkacz, gleam test-kitchen 1.0 has a chef-zero provider as the main example, so it shouldn't be hard to hook up
[2013-12-07 21:16:05 -0500] streamfan: I am in the process of trying to learn chef using recipes someone started on.  One recipe gets the latest source code. How can I run that recipe to force it to get the latest source?
[2013-12-07 21:17:27 -0500] mdpatrick: vagrant provision if you're using chef-solo
[2013-12-07 21:17:44 -0500] mdpatrick: and assuming the recipe is included by a recipe currently in the run_list
[2013-12-07 21:17:55 -0500] mdpatrick: or in the run_list itself :)
[2013-12-07 21:21:39 -0500] streamfan: ty, mdpatrick. I think I am using chef-solo...the recipe is in the run list, but the code does not change. Can I just run the one recipe something like vagrant provision myrecipe?
[2013-12-07 21:22:03 -0500] mdpatrick: is this box a virtual machine on your own system or one in the cloud?
[2013-12-07 21:22:13 -0500] mdpatrick: if its on your own system, youre probably using chef-solo
[2013-12-07 21:22:27 -0500] streamfan: mdpatrick, this is my own system so yes chef-solo
[2013-12-07 21:22:42 -0500] mdpatrick: if you want to run just one recipe, you can edit your Vagrantfile
[2013-12-07 21:23:21 -0500] mdpatrick: Your vagrantfile will have probably your primary recipe... you could comment out ::default and just put mycookbook::my_specific_recipe
[2013-12-07 21:23:50 -0500] mdpatrick: then when you run vagrant provision (or vagrant up, if its the first time you've started the virtual machine... or the first time since you ran "vagrant destroy", which deletes the virtual machine)
[2013-12-07 21:23:58 -0500] mdpatrick: it'll only use that recipe
[2013-12-07 21:25:46 -0500] streamfan: but no way from a command line?
[2013-12-07 21:26:17 -0500] streamfan: what is the best way to debug that my recipe is in fact bring run?
[2013-12-07 21:40:18 -0500] mdpatrick: streamfan: If you edit your vagrantfile and your recipe that you're working on mycookbook::this_specific_recipe is the only thing in the run list... it's either getting run, or chef will throw an error
[2013-12-07 21:40:41 -0500] mdpatrick: (If you run vagrant provision afterward, that is)
[2013-12-07 21:40:50 -0500] mdpatrick: if you run vagrant up it's not going to run your recipes
[2013-12-07 21:59:57 -0500] mdpatrick: If I want my node to automatically check for and run updates for recipes in its run list... do I need to just setup a cronjob to run chef-client???
[2013-12-07 22:00:07 -0500] mdpatrick: or is this done automatically somehow (like on machine reboot) already
[2013-12-07 22:08:13 -0500] gleam: you can run chef-client in daemon mode
[2013-12-07 22:08:37 -0500] gleam: it'll run automatically every X seconds, i think every hour? or maybe 30 minutes. i forget.
[2013-12-07 22:20:07 -0500] edwardc: teukka: pong, thanks. i'll check that later. but i am sure my script print $ENV and everything is okay
[2013-12-07 22:33:35 -0500] dmin7b5: n00b question.  Just installed Chef Server and after sshing into the VM chef-server-ctl test gave no errors.  How do you setup remote web access?  I can see the login page via lynx so it works via localhost.  Firewall port 80 access is correct.
[2013-12-07 22:37:57 -0500] dmin7b5: I also tried changing chef-server-running.json localhost entries to point to external ip address and used chef-server-ctl restart nginx
[2013-12-07 22:40:36 -0500] dmin7b5: Perhaps you are expected to ssh tunnel?
[2013-12-07 22:58:32 -0500] jtimberman: mark
[2013-12-07 22:58:34 -0500] jtimberman: oops :)
[2013-12-07 23:23:56 -0500] chefa: hi getting error .... no knife configuration file found
