[2013-12-29 00:00:05 -0500] stormerider: oh, my work pushes my limits and i can't necessarily do say.... vmware stuff at home, but chef cookbook hacking, i can certainly do
[2013-12-29 00:00:27 -0500] geggam: coderanger, thanks for that convoluted line
[2013-12-29 00:00:52 -0500] coderanger: Reminder that Rackspace offers free resources to FOSS projects
[2013-12-29 00:00:53 -0500] geggam: get a free ec2 account... use that... but delete the storage...
[2013-12-29 00:01:13 -0500] geggam: i got hit with a whopping 4 dollar charge for not deleting
[2013-12-29 00:01:33 -0500] geggam: well... my account isnt free anymore
[2013-12-29 00:01:38 -0500] geggam: like 3 years old
[2013-12-29 00:02:54 -0500] stormerider: i dont really have time (or really an itch to scratch) to write a project of my own, i just like to contribute back to the projects i use
[2013-12-29 00:04:28 -0500] stormerider: gchristensen: can you remind me what problem you ran into with COOK-3262? i think i finally have time to get back to that
[2013-12-29 00:39:52 -0500] geggam: thanks again coderanger ... out for a bit
[2013-12-29 00:42:43 -0500] jidar: they sure do make it enticing with the free teir
[2013-12-29 00:43:39 -0500] jidar: I'm not sure I'll stick with them after my year runs out though. The rackspace is a little cheaper for everything
[2013-12-29 00:43:57 -0500] jidar: but my prod envs and the like, that's all aws.
[2013-12-29 00:45:26 -0500] AntelopeSalad: that's how i felt too
[2013-12-29 00:45:39 -0500] AntelopeSalad: $15/month is pretty steep for their micro specs
[2013-12-29 00:46:58 -0500] jidar: I still end up paying $5/month because I just wanted a static ip
[2013-12-29 00:52:43 -0500] jidar: oh, it looks like they upped the cost to $.04/hour on rackspace, t1.micros are only $.02/hour
[2013-12-29 00:52:51 -0500] jidar: guess I'll stick with aws then
[2013-12-29 00:56:10 -0500] AntelopeSalad: DO is $0.007/our for their smallest instance
[2013-12-29 00:56:17 -0500] AntelopeSalad: *hour
[2013-12-29 00:56:44 -0500] jidar: DO?
[2013-12-29 00:56:58 -0500] AntelopeSalad: https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing
[2013-12-29 00:58:11 -0500] jidar: hurm, never heard of these guys
[2013-12-29 01:31:02 -0500] coderanger: jidar: They were the first major place to go all SSD
[2013-12-29 01:31:24 -0500] coderanger: Currently very popular for the "personal VPS" crowd
[2013-12-29 01:31:41 -0500] jidar: fun times
[2013-12-29 01:31:45 -0500] jidar: and cheap too
[2013-12-29 01:32:41 -0500] coderanger: depends on your use case, they round up to the hour for billing
[2013-12-29 01:32:47 -0500] coderanger: so bad for anything ephemeral
[2013-12-29 01:35:28 -0500] coderanger: But if you want to run a mail server or IRC bouncer or whatever, they are great
[2013-12-29 05:20:54 -0500] coderanger: Anyone around to proofread/gutcheck some docs? https://github.com/poise/berkshelf-api/blob/master/README.md
[2013-12-29 07:33:41 -0500] someara: AntelopeSalad I've been using DO for COOK dev testing: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/yum/blob/master/.kitchen.yml#L17
[2013-12-29 08:32:55 -0500] coderanger: someara: Its not wonderful for that given they round up to the hour
[2013-12-29 08:33:15 -0500] coderanger: someara: As compared to EC2, Rackspace, et al which round to the minute for billing
[2013-12-29 08:41:46 -0500] MrHeavy: How do I get a full list of roles defined on a node, including roles included from other roles?
[2013-12-29 08:42:35 -0500] coderanger: MrHeavy: node['roles']
[2013-12-29 08:43:21 -0500] MrHeavy: Looks like I never actually uploaded my updated role JSON, sweet
[2013-12-29 08:43:35 -0500] MrHeavy: 3:43 AM, that explains it
[2013-12-29 08:48:42 -0500] MrHeavy: Looking good, thanks much
[2013-12-29 10:18:57 -0500] railsraider: im having some hard time figuring out how to clear node attributes on run, my problem is that the node attributes from the run before are being merged into the new node.set that i do on the recipe and that messes up everything
[2013-12-29 10:19:03 -0500] railsraider: how do i resolve this
[2013-12-29 10:19:38 -0500] coderanger: railsraider: Stop using node.set
[2013-12-29 10:19:47 -0500] railsraider: what should i use then?
[2013-12-29 10:19:54 -0500] coderanger: node.default or node.override
[2013-12-29 10:20:00 -0500] coderanger: those are cleared before each run
[2013-12-29 10:20:11 -0500] coderanger: node.set is explicitly for things that should be stateful
[2013-12-29 10:20:14 -0500] railsraider: i have recipe that run on all ec2 tags and saves them into a node a ttribute
[2013-12-29 10:20:26 -0500] coderanger: Thats already part of the node data
[2013-12-29 10:20:29 -0500] coderanger: via ohai
[2013-12-29 10:20:29 -0500] railsraider: so from a recipe i can do node.default
[2013-12-29 10:20:57 -0500] railsraider: i want to do that dynamically for all nodes on one monitoring server
[2013-12-29 10:21:07 -0500] coderanger: Yes you could, but as I said, EC2 metadata is already part of the node data
[2013-12-29 10:21:16 -0500] railsraider: so i am storing all servers info into a node attribute
[2013-12-29 10:21:22 -0500] coderanger: Why?
[2013-12-29 10:21:31 -0500] coderanger: Just use the chef-server APIs to access that info
[2013-12-29 10:21:33 -0500] railsraider: because im calling it from other cookbooks
[2013-12-29 10:21:40 -0500] railsraider: problem is autoscale
[2013-12-29 10:21:56 -0500] railsraider: when it kills a machine it does not delete it from chef
[2013-12-29 10:22:05 -0500] railsraider: i need realtime data from ec2
[2013-12-29 10:22:12 -0500] coderanger: Are you using autoscaling groups?
[2013-12-29 10:22:16 -0500] railsraider: yes
[2013-12-29 10:22:27 -0500] coderanger: Use the scaling event notifications they send out
[2013-12-29 10:22:49 -0500] coderanger: Or make an init script that wipes the node out on shutdown (only works if you don't use spot instances)
[2013-12-29 10:22:50 -0500] railsraider: to sqs? and write a handler that deletes the node?
[2013-12-29 10:22:54 -0500] coderanger: Yep
[2013-12-29 10:23:00 -0500] railsraider: ok
[2013-12-29 10:23:10 -0500] railsraider: good idea
[2013-12-29 10:23:14 -0500] railsraider: thanks
[2013-12-29 10:23:25 -0500] coderanger: Or, if you want your point of truth to be EC2, just use the EC2 APIs directly
[2013-12-29 10:23:42 -0500] coderanger: and don't bother with all this stuff about chef attributes :D
[2013-12-29 10:24:51 -0500] coderanger: Like if you want to drive your mointoring system from that data, just bust out a call to fog in the recipe that write out the template for it :)
[2013-12-29 10:24:55 -0500] railsraider: i am using aws-sdk to pull all tags for each instance
[2013-12-29 10:25:00 -0500] coderanger: Or that
[2013-12-29 10:25:09 -0500] railsraider: i do that
[2013-12-29 10:25:18 -0500] railsraider: my issue was that i use node.set
[2013-12-29 10:25:21 -0500] coderanger: Why do they need to go in node attrs though?
[2013-12-29 10:25:27 -0500] railsraider: and then the data would stick
[2013-12-29 10:25:37 -0500] railsraider: im calling it from another cookbook
[2013-12-29 10:25:42 -0500] coderanger: Just pass them through to the template for your nagios config or whatever
[2013-12-29 10:25:59 -0500] railsraider: but munin needs those servers as well
[2013-12-29 10:26:16 -0500] railsraider: so i thought to make it a node attribute
[2013-12-29 10:26:17 -0500] coderanger: If you need a safe-ish global variable to cram stuff in, node.run_state
[2013-12-29 10:26:30 -0500] coderanger: its a hash that is not persisted, and is reset between runs
[2013-12-29 10:26:47 -0500] coderanger: so node.run_state[:omgstuff] = all_the_tags
[2013-12-29 10:26:47 -0500] railsraider: ok i think i'll move them to be methods in libarary of the recipe
[2013-12-29 10:26:58 -0500] coderanger: That works too
[2013-12-29 10:27:01 -0500] railsraider: this way its always fresh
[2013-12-29 10:27:14 -0500] coderanger: Just the usual caveats apply to global-y things :D
[2013-12-29 10:27:20 -0500] railsraider: yeah
[2013-12-29 10:27:26 -0500] railsraider: cool man thanks alot
[2013-12-29 10:27:32 -0500] coderanger: Good luck
[2013-12-29 10:55:39 -0500] joshmyers: hey guys, https://github.com/danielsdeleo/omnibus-rubies
[2013-12-29 10:56:01 -0500] joshmyers: having problems installing the omnibus-software gem
[2013-12-29 10:56:19 -0500] joshmyers: gem install omnibus-software
[2013-12-29 10:56:19 -0500] joshmyers: ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'omnibus-software' (>= 0) in any repository
[2013-12-29 10:56:22 -0500] joshmyers: any ideas?
[2013-12-29 11:01:37 -0500] coderanger: Why are you installing it manually?
[2013-12-29 11:01:49 -0500] coderanger: https://github.com/danielsdeleo/omnibus-rubies/blob/master/Gemfile#L4
[2013-12-29 11:01:55 -0500] coderanger: It is part of the gemfile
[2013-12-29 11:03:57 -0500] joshmyers: coderanger: Because it fails when running bundle
[2013-12-29 11:04:08 -0500] joshmyers: Make sure that `gem install omnibus-software -v '0.0.1'` succeeds before bundling.
[2013-12-29 11:24:04 -0500] zxd: hi
[2013-12-29 11:24:41 -0500] zxd: how do I update the FQDN name that appears in the command 'knife node show nodename'
[2013-12-29 11:37:17 -0500] zxd: what's the difference between knife client delete   and node delete?
[2013-12-29 11:44:38 -0500] zxd: is it possible to revert the changes chef made to the system
[2013-12-29 13:31:54 -0500] prognostikos: anyone else having trouble with version 1.17.3 of the java cookbook? I'm getting an `uninitialized constant Opscode::OpenJDK` error
[2013-12-29 14:04:00 -0500] storme_away: zxd: in order, change it on the system, make sure it's reflected in your shell, rerun chef-client... you'll likely see it reregister. a client is what talks to Chef, a node is what Chef configures. a workstation setup is an admin client but doesn't need to be a client, for example. and to my knowledge, no there is no way to revert. my standard response to that question is "you have backups, right?"
[2013-12-29 14:15:42 -0500] AntelopeSalad: hmm is vagrant the only way to use test kitchen?
[2013-12-29 14:17:12 -0500] storme_away: no, theres vagabond and some others
[2013-12-29 14:17:43 -0500] AntelopeSalad: my situation is really dumb, but long story short i can't use vagrant but i can run a separate virtualbox instance
[2013-12-29 14:19:19 -0500] AntelopeSalad: is there no way to have it use virtualbox directly by passing in an ip address or something?
[2013-12-29 14:19:35 -0500] AntelopeSalad: i did not see virtualbox as a driver with $ kitchen driver discover , was hoping there was another way
[2013-12-29 14:21:41 -0500] gchristensen: AntelopeSalad: test kitchen also supports rackspace etc
[2013-12-29 14:22:21 -0500] AntelopeSalad: gchristensen: i only have access to another vanilla instance inside of virtualbox directly
[2013-12-29 14:22:53 -0500] AntelopeSalad: my computer is too crippled to run vagrant inside of a VM
[2013-12-29 14:23:58 -0500] gchristensen: also virtualbox doens't work inside virtualbox
[2013-12-29 14:24:20 -0500] AntelopeSalad: hmm
[2013-12-29 14:24:36 -0500] AntelopeSalad: seriously?
[2013-12-29 14:24:48 -0500] gchristensen: AntelopeSalad: seriously
[2013-12-29 14:24:56 -0500] AntelopeSalad: how is that possible
[2013-12-29 14:25:23 -0500] AntelopeSalad: i develop inside of virtualbox , are you saying even if i had a good computer i wouldn't be be able to run vagrant inside of that virtualbox instance?
[2013-12-29 14:25:28 -0500] AntelopeSalad: *inside of a VM
[2013-12-29 14:25:57 -0500] gchristensen: VB doesn't AFAIK emulate the processor capabilities that VB uses to virtualize machnes
[2013-12-29 14:26:41 -0500] AntelopeSalad: wow that's disgusting...
[2013-12-29 14:27:15 -0500] gchristensen: you could use the vagrant rackspace or ec2 or digitalocean et al providers
[2013-12-29 14:27:22 -0500] AntelopeSalad: i thought developing inside of a VM is really popular
[2013-12-29 14:27:35 -0500] AntelopeSalad: why would anyone want a million dev resources overtaking their "main" install
[2013-12-29 14:27:54 -0500] AntelopeSalad: yeah but that involves paying $
[2013-12-29 14:27:57 -0500] gchristensen: surely it is fairly common, but its less common to spin up a VM in a VM.
[2013-12-29 14:28:49 -0500] AntelopeSalad: all of these server admin tools expect you to spin up an instance with vagrant for testing tho
[2013-12-29 14:29:02 -0500] AntelopeSalad: i'm really surprised virtualbox hasn't solved a VM within a VM
[2013-12-29 14:29:24 -0500] gchristensen: I don't know what to tell you. I pay the less-than-$5/mo to run VMs elsewhere.
[2013-12-29 14:30:25 -0500] AntelopeSalad: i setup one on vps.me the other day but test kitchen doesn't seem to support it
[2013-12-29 14:30:34 -0500] AntelopeSalad: DO is $5/month, ec2 is $15/month for a micro instance
[2013-12-29 14:30:48 -0500] AntelopeSalad: $5/month is really expensive to learn how to test with chef
[2013-12-29 14:31:29 -0500] gchristensen: when I dev I spin up a box, test, spin down rinse and repeat - running for < 50% of the month - billed by the hour.
[2013-12-29 14:33:04 -0500] AntelopeSalad: it's basically a nickel for each test you run
[2013-12-29 14:33:54 -0500] gchristensen: walk down town for an hour, yuo'll have a month worth of nickles
[2013-12-29 14:34:55 -0500] AntelopeSalad: maybe, but i'd rather just be able to test on a local VM -- i'll look for another testing solution other than test kitchen
[2013-12-29 14:35:53 -0500] gchristensen: just install it on your main box. its pretty much the way to roll right now.
[2013-12-29 14:36:41 -0500] AntelopeSalad: there's a 0% chance i'm going to install chef and vagrant on my windows host box
[2013-12-29 14:37:19 -0500] AntelopeSalad: it's much easier to just not run tests, or find alternative (i'm not trolling either, if it's difficult to test then people don't test)
[2013-12-29 14:37:24 -0500] AntelopeSalad: *alternatives
[2013-12-29 14:39:35 -0500] gchristensen: its defintely a PITA and a reason most people don't test, you're right
[2013-12-29 14:40:24 -0500] zxd: what does node[:platform]-version_components  print ? if I am running ubuntu 13.10 on the node per example?
[2013-12-29 14:41:31 -0500] zxd: I want to add an if statement to apache2 cook book to check whether it is ubuntu ver 13.10 or higher then if so change the LockFile /var/lock/apache2/accept.lock  that is currently set on the apache2.conf.erb
[2013-12-29 14:41:38 -0500] zxd: it dosen't work anymore
[2013-12-29 14:53:22 -0500] viknesh: can any on tell what is the next step to do after setting up chef server
[2013-12-29 15:01:19 -0500] varun53: Hello there, Is there a way to update a node from the node?
