[2013-12-08 00:14:51 -0500] chefa: anybody here to assist?
[2013-12-08 00:15:30 -0500] sethvargo: @chefa I'm half here. What's up?
[2013-12-08 00:25:37 -0500] chefa: sethvargo: when I run knife ec2 server list it states:  you did not provide a valid 'AWS Access Key Id' value ... even though I have my aws credentials in my knife.rb
[2013-12-08 00:27:01 -0500] sethvargo: @chefa can you remove the creds and post your `knife.rb`? What key are you setting?
[2013-12-08 00:32:15 -0500] chefa: sethvargo:  http://pastebin.com/2sRsqeWR
[2013-12-08 00:32:50 -0500] sethvargo: @chefa - its `knife[:aws_access_key_id]` (you have a dash instead of an underscore)
[2013-12-08 00:33:11 -0500] sethvargo: Also, please make sure ENV['myawskey'] is actually set. You can check by running `env | grep myawskey`
[2013-12-08 00:33:26 -0500] sethvargo: also, chef-server-url should be chef_server_url
[2013-12-08 00:33:40 -0500] sethvargo: log-location should be log_location
[2013-12-08 00:34:12 -0500] sethvargo: As a general rule, you dont use dashes in the configuration options (the stuff to the left of the equals sign (=))
[2013-12-08 00:35:25 -0500] chefa: so it should read knife[:awsaccesskeyid] ??
[2013-12-08 00:36:43 -0500] chefa: I had to retype that as my ubuntu in vmware fusion wont let me cut and paste :( :( apologies everying is underscore
[2013-12-08 00:37:36 -0500] chefa: its almost like it isn't reading this file in /.chef/knife.rb
[2013-12-08 00:38:06 -0500] sethvargo: @chefa no, you want what is shown in the docs: https://github.com/opscode/knife-ec2#configuration
[2013-12-08 00:38:16 -0500] sethvargo: knife[:aws_access_key_id] = "Your AWS Access Key ID"
[2013-12-08 00:38:16 -0500] sethvargo: knife[:aws_secret_access_key] = "Your AWS Secret Access Key"
[2013-12-08 00:38:54 -0500] sethvargo: The easy way to find if it's reading the file is to put something like `raise "I was read"` at the very top of that file and run any knife command. if you don't get an error, that file isn't being read
[2013-12-08 00:39:08 -0500] sethvargo: If the file isn't being read, that can mean Chef isn't finding it and/or the permissions are not correct
[2013-12-08 00:40:03 -0500] chefa: sethvargo: yes this worked ... adding "
[2013-12-08 00:43:37 -0500] coderzach: I'm trying to build a hosting service where users can push to a git repo, and their code gets deployed to multiple nginx boxes.  Is this deployment process something I should do with chef?
[2013-12-08 00:43:57 -0500] chefa: sethvargo:  thanks this now works. if you could help with vmfusion with ubuntu not being able to copy paste that would be grand
[2013-12-08 00:44:58 -0500] sethvargo: @chefa I think that's probably outside of my skill set. It probably has to do with guest operating system permissions or the installed VMWare extensions
[2013-12-08 00:46:31 -0500] chefa: sethvargo: thanks man .... I will go have a look
[2013-12-08 02:58:56 -0500] mdpatrick: How do I get chef to remove a user, only if it exists?
[2013-12-08 02:59:01 -0500] mdpatrick: e.g. i'm trying to make it idempotent
[2013-12-08 02:59:18 -0500] mdpatrick: its crashing when it tries to remove a user that apparently doesnt already exist
[2013-12-08 03:03:35 -0500] mdpatrick: Nevermind! Got it resolved with a not_if block. :)
[2013-12-08 05:27:22 -0500] gverri: Any user of the application_ruby cookbook?
[2013-12-08 05:40:09 -0500] knuckolls: gverri: i've used it in the past
[2013-12-08 05:41:19 -0500] gverri: knuckolls do you remember if you have to hardcode the app documentroot in the passenger_apache2 LWRP for it to work?
[2013-12-08 05:41:58 -0500] knuckolls: i didn't remember it until you mentioned it and then i remembered all that shit i had to do to get passenger to behave with it
[2013-12-08 05:42:05 -0500] knuckolls: so yes, i do remember doing that
[2013-12-08 05:42:13 -0500] knuckolls: i feel like i had a pull request for it at some point
[2013-12-08 05:42:18 -0500] knuckolls: this was well over a year ago
[2013-12-08 05:43:03 -0500] gverri: Oh, so its normal
[2013-12-08 05:43:09 -0500] knuckolls: "normal"
[2013-12-08 05:43:19 -0500] gverri: shouldn't be
[2013-12-08 05:43:27 -0500] knuckolls: correct
[2013-12-08 05:43:55 -0500] knuckolls: my experience with all of the application cookbooks is that they're neglected
[2013-12-08 05:44:13 -0500] gverri: Yeah, having the same feeling.
[2013-12-08 05:44:16 -0500] knuckolls: i haven't fooled with them in well over a year. at my new gig we handrolled our own lwrps
[2013-12-08 05:44:29 -0500] gverri: But I'm just beginning so it's an easy start.
[2013-12-08 05:44:43 -0500] knuckolls: and frankly, in my opinion i feel like that is a best practice so you know exactly how your own code is being initialized
[2013-12-08 05:45:11 -0500] knuckolls: it'd be nice if the application ruby cookbook was a nice neat layer of abstraction that was pluggable for how you wanted it to work
[2013-12-08 05:45:18 -0500] knuckolls: but it's opinionated and neglected
[2013-12-08 05:45:20 -0500] gverri: I'm planning on switching piece by piece once I get a better hold on the framework.
[2013-12-08 05:45:21 -0500] knuckolls: circa a year ago
[2013-12-08 05:45:34 -0500] knuckolls: makes sense
[2013-12-08 14:33:34 -0500] Blizzik: Hi, I am new to chef server. I just wanted to add docker and nginx to my cookboos, so I used berks to do so. I have done berks install and berks upload and now I have my cookboos messed up with the dependencies. Is it somehow possible to not install all of them? For example I see that it installed 'yum' and 'windows'. I am pretty sure I will only run debian based servers
[2013-12-08 14:33:42 -0500] michael_mbp: hi all
[2013-12-08 14:40:47 -0500] gregkare: Blizzik: You need all the dependencies from your cookbooks (and their dependencies), including those you won't need (windows and yum for example)
[2013-12-08 14:41:50 -0500] michael_mbp: hi all
[2013-12-08 14:41:52 -0500] michael_mbp: hmm
[2013-12-08 14:43:07 -0500] Blizzik: AhA! I just found that maybe I am looking for recipes?
[2013-12-08 14:43:42 -0500] Blizzik: gregkare: Thank you btw
[2013-12-08 15:10:12 -0500] michael_mbp: if I've got a cookbook named foo-bar, how can I reference it?
[2013-12-08 15:10:51 -0500] michael_mbp: oh right.
[2013-12-08 17:29:48 -0500] DandyPandy: I'm trying to use the Bento vagrant boxes and getting an error that it couldn't untar it when it downloads the box. I've tried the CentOS 6.5 and Ubuntu 12.04 box files. The 12.04 box from vagrant worked just fine. Any ideas? Do I need the Bento box to get started with test-kitchen?
[2013-12-08 17:30:34 -0500] DandyPandy: derp. I just remembered you can use test-kitchen with all sorts of provisioners.
[2013-12-08 17:56:23 -0500] Blizzik: Hi, could someone help me with installing nginx to my Debian linux using chef and 'apt' cookbook?
[2013-12-08 17:57:05 -0500] Blizzik: http://hastebin.com/ceruyaleju.vbs this doesn't work :/
[2013-12-08 17:58:11 -0500] Blizzik: The comand should be just:
[2013-12-08 17:58:23 -0500] Blizzik: deb http://nginx.org/packages/debian/ squeeze nginx
[2013-12-08 17:58:23 -0500] Blizzik: deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/debian/ squeeze nginx

[2013-12-08 19:07:37 -0500] robinpc: I've got an odd situation involving decrypting a databag on a node, and appreciate some thoughts.  The secret key needs to be on the node before it's used, so I force it there in the compile phase, and in fact, it is there.  But if I subsequently load it in a recipe in the converge phase the load fails ... either claiming the secret is nil if defaulted to the default location, or claiming...
[2013-12-08 19:07:38 -0500] robinpc: ...the secret is wrong if I force the file location.  But ... if I subsequently run the recipe accessing the DBag again, it succeeds.  So the key is good, but not good at that moment.  Any clues?
[2013-12-08 19:34:20 -0500] gverri: what is the best way to update the chef-client in a vagrant/ec2 machine? without having to do it manually?
[2013-12-08 19:40:44 -0500] subdigital: Is there a way to have a deferred node attribute?  For example:   node.default[:foo][:bar] = ->{ node[:actual][:bar] }
[2013-12-08 19:42:29 -0500] subdigital: basically I have a cookbook that needs a key defined, I already have this in a different node attribute, but IIRC I can't just set this in my cookbook attributes since they are set by a recipe later on (from a data bag)
[2013-12-08 19:45:10 -0500] subdigital: I could copy the value over to the right key in a recipe where I know that value's already been set, but this seems... ghetto
[2013-12-08 21:06:26 -0500] cwj: subdigital: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_common.html#lazy-attribute-evaluation
[2013-12-08 21:18:30 -0500] michael_mbp: hmm
[2013-12-08 21:18:43 -0500] michael_mbp: what's this about Cannot symlink shared data /opt/apps/demo/deploy/shared/assets to /opt/apps/demo/deploy/releases/384bd0f98df6bf1b07dc3b0d0222917b9e855bff/public/: File exists -
[2013-12-08 21:30:47 -0500] subdigital: cwj: so I should be able to say node[:attr] = lazy { node[:real_attr] } ?
[2013-12-08 21:31:01 -0500] subdigital: in an attribute file?
[2013-12-08 21:31:25 -0500] coderanger: subdigital: It depends on how you are using it, and I'm sure thats active in the attr file dsl
[2013-12-08 21:32:20 -0500] subdigital: I mean it works by setting it explicitly inside of the recipe, but that feels like not the correct way to do it
[2013-12-08 21:33:36 -0500] michael_mbp: coderanger: any ideas?
[2013-12-08 21:34:04 -0500] coderanger: michael_mbp: The error seems pretty clear, you are trying to create a symlink to a name that already exists
[2013-12-08 21:34:35 -0500] michael_mbp: coderanger: indeed, I'm trying to figure out why it exists
[2013-12-08 21:34:39 -0500] michael_mbp: in this case public/assets
[2013-12-08 21:35:14 -0500] coderanger: Is it a thing in git and/or does an earlier step create it?
[2013-12-08 21:35:14 -0500] michael_mbp: hmm unless, there's another setting I'm missing to have precompile_assets run elsewhere?
[2013-12-08 21:35:34 -0500] michael_mbp: it's part of Rails's sprockets/pipeline
[2013-12-08 21:39:34 -0500] michael_mbp: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17053467/how-to-precompile-assets-with-chef
[2013-12-08 21:39:34 -0500] coderanger: Why are you symlinking it anyway?
[2013-12-08 21:39:35 -0500] michael_mbp: hmm
[2013-12-08 21:39:43 -0500] coderanger: That seems like a bad idea
[2013-12-08 21:40:44 -0500] michael_mbp: well I could add it to purge_before_symlink
[2013-12-08 21:41:16 -0500] coderanger: Why not just run the asset build as per normal, the only downside is builds taking forever
[2013-12-08 21:44:00 -0500] michael_mbp: hmm I think that fixed that issue
[2013-12-08 22:03:45 -0500] robinpc: Trying to access an encrypted databag via a shared secret file downloaded in the compile phase.  Always get a compile error when done in a single run, the problem being with the secret file (nil when defaulted, wrong key when explicit).  But a subsequent client run will succeed.  Is this some wierd timing thing?  Do we need to sleep in the compile?  Anybody done this pattern?
[2013-12-08 22:04:23 -0500] robinpc: Sorry, to clarify, the "compile" error is in the converge phase; the run in compile phase works fine
[2013-12-08 22:15:54 -0500] coderanger: robinpc: The secret is loaded when the run is started
[2013-12-08 22:25:34 -0500] robinpc: @coderanger -- loaded before the compile phase, and therefore fails?  So we need to always do two runs?  Or do I misunderstand
[2013-12-08 22:25:53 -0500] coderanger: You just need to manually update the config in a ruby_block
[2013-12-08 22:26:50 -0500] robinpc: @coderanger - so sorry, I don't understand.  Are we correct in fetching in compile?  And if so, how would we update the config?
[2013-12-08 22:27:15 -0500] coderanger: robinpc: Where are fetching the secret from, thats not really a thing that makes sense in terms of security
[2013-12-08 22:27:57 -0500] robinpc: coderanger: it's gotta come from somewhere -- in this case a secured location
[2013-12-08 22:29:00 -0500] robinpc: coderanger: Is there a preferred pattern?  Or an example of how to manually update the (which?) config in a ruby block?
[2013-12-08 22:30:11 -0500] coderanger: robinpc: Generally secret distribution is done when the node is booted
[2013-12-08 22:30:15 -0500] coderanger: And is out of band from Chef
[2013-12-08 22:31:01 -0500] coderanger: as putting in in-bound means that a compromised chef-server could instruct the client to fetch the key and send to somewhere
[2013-12-08 22:31:36 -0500] coderanger: Or rather, could see where it is, is what I mean
[2013-12-08 22:31:37 -0500] coderanger: :-)
[2013-12-08 22:33:36 -0500] robinpc: coderanger: Interesting ... I wonder how people actually put the key there ... by hand?  By awscli but not called in a recipe?
[2013-12-08 22:33:38 -0500] robinpc: That said, are you saying that if, instead of accessing the $databag in the recipe naked, i do it in a ruby_block resource, the result will be better?
[2013-12-08 22:34:10 -0500] coderanger: robinpc: knife bootstrap and all things based on it will automatically copy the key to the server
[2013-12-08 22:34:18 -0500] coderanger: robinpc: Lets rewind, are you using Hosted Chef?
[2013-12-08 22:35:28 -0500] robinpc: coderanger: OK, rewinding ---
[2013-12-08 22:35:29 -0500] robinpc: Not using hosted chef
[2013-12-08 22:35:31 -0500] robinpc: Using knife ec2 plugin to start the node and run its roles
[2013-12-08 22:35:32 -0500] robinpc: The roles initially install the secret using a secure AWS mechanism
[2013-12-08 22:35:34 -0500] robinpc: After that the compile fails as noted, but maybe won't if we enclose in ruby_block?
[2013-12-08 22:35:52 -0500] coderanger: If oyu are not using Hosted Chef there is a nearly 100% chance that encrypted data bags are not what you want to be using
[2013-12-08 22:36:26 -0500] coderanger: What problem are you trying to solve?
[2013-12-08 22:36:46 -0500] robinpc: coderanger: really, why?  Struck me as a perfect way to keep creds under configuration but safe.  We run our own chef server.  The problem is trying to keep creds under revision control but secure
[2013-12-08 22:38:05 -0500] coderanger: robinpc: Because you already have a trusted third party you are using to distribute the decryption keys, just use that to distribute secrets
[2013-12-08 22:39:21 -0500] robinpc: coderanger: yes, if we were cloud specific we could do that, but we're writing a multicloud platform and would prefer not to redo that mechanism for each cloud.
[2013-12-08 22:39:22 -0500] robinpc: I thought this was what the encrypted databags were for
[2013-12-08 22:40:42 -0500] coderanger: Only a little, the biggest reason to use encrypted data bags is if you are worried about data disclosure from the chef server, and want to move the problem
[2013-12-08 22:40:49 -0500] coderanger: note that it doesn't solve anything, just moves the issue
[2013-12-08 22:41:00 -0500] coderanger: from distributing secrets to distributing keys for those secrets
[2013-12-08 22:42:29 -0500] coderanger: Note that if you can do one safely, you can do the other
[2013-12-08 22:42:35 -0500] coderanger: :-)
[2013-12-08 22:43:11 -0500] robinpc: coderanger: That's certainly true, but it makes managing the secrets much easier
[2013-12-08 22:43:21 -0500] coderanger: Every now and then encrypted data bags are useful to interface with external cookbooks that only read data from bags, but thats getting rarer
[2013-12-08 22:43:28 -0500] coderanger: How?
[2013-12-08 22:45:29 -0500] robinpc: coderanger: Well, if we use encrypted dbags we can easily keep and fetch our creds in source control, and only worry about managing and rotating a single key from the trusted 3p.  We could do what you suggest, but it would mean (see if I got this right?) a json file of creds on the trusted 3p, fetching it by trusted mechanism (in the clear) onto the node, reading up the JSON and acting on...
[2013-12-08 22:45:31 -0500] robinpc: ...it.  Seems much clumsier and less secure.  Am I missing something key?
[2013-12-08 22:46:08 -0500] robinpc: as it were :)
[2013-12-08 22:46:09 -0500] coderanger: Key rotation is not supported in encrypted data bags
[2013-12-08 22:46:12 -0500] coderanger: So thats not a thing
[2013-12-08 22:46:12 -0500] coderanger: :-)
[2013-12-08 22:47:20 -0500] robinpc: No, but if under source control it's easy to rotate manually.  Is reading the bag in a ruby block the key to my procedural (not architectural) woes?  And do I understand your recommended alternative right?
[2013-12-08 22:47:48 -0500] coderanger: Well I wouldn't read anything "in the clear", but basically other than that yeah, just read your secrets from the trusted source
[2013-12-08 22:47:59 -0500] coderanger: see also https://github.com/balanced-cookbooks/citadel
[2013-12-08 22:48:46 -0500] robinpc: =Thanks, been looking for a decent book!  If we do fetch the encrypted bags, is the key to my problem referencing the bag in the ruby_block resource or am I trying something not supported?
[2013-12-08 22:49:27 -0500] robinpc: Whups, that's a cookbook!  Maybe I should use it!  But there's that cross-cloud thing ...
[2013-12-08 22:49:39 -0500] robinpc: (sounds like 'to serve man')
[2013-12-08 22:50:03 -0500] coderanger: robinpc: Yeah, I don't have a great solution :-(
[2013-12-08 22:50:08 -0500] coderanger: Barbican might be an answer
[2013-12-08 22:50:21 -0500] coderanger: robinpc: https://github.com/stackforge/barbican
[2013-12-08 22:50:30 -0500] coderanger: robinpc: This is a Really Hard Problem though
[2013-12-08 22:50:51 -0500] coderanger: robinpc: Also check out chef-vault
[2013-12-08 22:51:11 -0500] coderanger: robinpc: Its closer to encrypted data bags in model, but somewhat easier to manage (in certain ways)
[2013-12-08 22:51:27 -0500] robinpc: Wow, the citadel is basically what we're doing.  But I'm ashamed to say I never could figure out how to access a library from a foreign cookbook.  Much as I love chef, we could use some more doc.
[2013-12-08 22:51:49 -0500] coderanger: robinpc: Heh, well feel free to steal from that one, if you look in the lib folder its all pretty simple
[2013-12-08 22:52:21 -0500] coderanger: But yeah, citadel is very very AWS-only
[2013-12-08 22:52:30 -0500] coderanger: and that is :-(
[2013-12-08 22:53:08 -0500] robinpc:  two things would really help me if you have them --
[2013-12-08 22:53:09 -0500] robinpc: Any idea why my compile blows up.
[2013-12-08 22:53:11 -0500] robinpc: and any idea of a decent reference on how to call a library from a different cookbook.  (I know, simple, but all examples I see are same-cookbook)
[2013-12-08 22:54:40 -0500] coderanger: So your compile issue can probably be fixed by using https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/9c1f86712d9982e6ea23f4207224a070d577065d/lib/chef/encrypted_data_bag_item.rb#L49 manually
[2013-12-08 22:55:00 -0500] coderanger: and re: libraries, they aren't scoped to a cookbook, lib files are just raw Ruby code that is eval'd
[2013-12-08 22:55:57 -0500] coderanger: So anything declared is just dumped into the global namespace, you need to namespace it yourself if you want
[2013-12-08 22:56:27 -0500] robinpc: Thanks ... can I assume the former is an update to code.  For the libs, sounds like you just include libname, but that failed for me, so I'll have to fool around some
[2013-12-08 22:56:50 -0500] coderanger: I mean you could scope stuff using the cookbook name
[2013-12-08 22:56:53 -0500] coderanger: which is what I usually do
[2013-12-08 22:56:56 -0500] coderanger: but its all explicit
[2013-12-08 22:57:01 -0500] coderanger: https://github.com/balanced-cookbooks/citadel/blob/master/libraries/default.rb#L19
[2013-12-08 22:57:29 -0500] coderanger: Or a (much) more complex example https://github.com/poise/poise/blob/master/libraries/lazy_default.rb#L19
[2013-12-08 22:59:39 -0500] robinpc: Yes, I see those are libraries; the place I break down is referencing them in a recipe.  Sounds like you're saying 'no include needed', just reference the library by name, e.g. Poise::Resource::LazyDefault::ClassMethod::lazy  ??
[2013-12-08 23:00:10 -0500] coderanger: Yep, you just call it like Ruby code
[2013-12-08 23:00:12 -0500] coderanger: No special magic
[2013-12-08 23:00:42 -0500] robinpc: Thanks so much.  I've got a lot to dig into; very much appreciate your taking the time :)
[2013-12-08 23:01:30 -0500] coderanger: Good luck!
[2013-12-08 23:01:48 -0500] robinpc: Thanks!  Walk dog!  Eat dinner!  Seek luck.  Same to you!
[2013-12-08 23:02:04 -0500] coderanger: Distributing secrets is super mega hard, the only long term solution (I think) is to move everything to identity-based mechanisms (like Postgres supports SSL client certs for auth rather than passwords)
[2013-12-08 23:02:49 -0500] coderanger: But that means retrofitting huge swaths of infra tools
[2013-12-08 23:04:47 -0500] robinpc: I know ... don't really have resources to do that infrastructure in this pass.  Which is why the encbags look so appealing as an interim solution.  Each cloud provider then needs to come up with a cloud-specific way of storing secrets.  Or (as you point out) we can use AWS as a hub and work across providers using them as a cred store. I'm chewing on that.
[2013-12-08 23:05:44 -0500] robinpc: gtg
[2013-12-08 23:21:30 -0500] supercom32: When I create a fairly long run_list with recipes in sequence,  eventually I get a "HTTPServerException: 403 "Forbidden" error during folder creation. This does not seem to happen when running singley. Any ideas?
