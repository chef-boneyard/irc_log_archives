[2013-12-26 07:09:12 -0500] FlorianGray: Hi.. does anyone know the best way to report an error with one of the docs.opscode.com pages ?
[2013-12-26 09:09:59 -0500] railsraider: Hi how do i always make sure a node attribute is reset completely at the beginning of each run? i am struggling with saved attributes left overs from before and it drives me nut
[2013-12-26 09:10:26 -0500] railsraider: do i juts set an empty one on the default recipe?
[2013-12-26 09:14:15 -0500] railsraider: by the way i am using default attributes and the manual says its reset them on the start of the run
[2013-12-26 09:14:42 -0500] railsraider: but i think if chef didnt exit (run failed) it takes the old attributes
[2013-12-26 09:14:52 -0500] railsraider: ami i right?
[2013-12-26 09:30:04 -0500] zxd: hi
[2013-12-26 09:30:43 -0500] zxd: I am the installing chef workstation stage, what is 3.Select the omnibus installer
[2013-12-26 09:30:52 -0500] zxd: what is omnibus installer and how do I select it
[2013-12-26 09:33:27 -0500] zxd: why isn't .chef directory there by default under chef-repo?
[2013-12-26 09:36:51 -0500] zxd: I installed using the debian and rpm packages
[2013-12-26 09:36:54 -0500] zxd: do I need omnibus
[2013-12-26 12:23:19 -0500] zxd: d
[2013-12-26 13:02:40 -0500] masterkorp: What do guys do when a test is usable for more than one suite in test kitchen ?
[2013-12-26 13:02:47 -0500] masterkorp: you symlink the file ?
[2013-12-26 14:49:51 -0500] siddc: Hi, I am just getting started with Chef. I added a 40 machines to the Chef Server using knife command. Is there anyway to run a recipe on all 40 servers at the same time via the Chef Server?
[2013-12-26 14:52:31 -0500] masterkorp: siddc: you can invoke chef-client with knife ssh
[2013-12-26 14:52:40 -0500] masterkorp: but you may doing something wrong
[2013-12-26 14:52:50 -0500] masterkorp: what do you want to achieve ?
[2013-12-26 14:53:26 -0500] siddc: I am trying to LDAP all servers and to that effect I have written a recipe. I want that recipe to run on all servers so all of them are LDAP enabled
[2013-12-26 14:54:26 -0500] masterkorp: better to create a role for that
[2013-12-26 14:54:34 -0500] masterkorp: and get the recipes in the run_list
[2013-12-26 14:54:50 -0500] masterkorp: then add that role to the node's run_list itslef
[2013-12-26 14:54:59 -0500] siddc: I see.
[2013-12-26 14:55:09 -0500] siddc: Thanks!
[2013-12-26 14:55:11 -0500] siddc: Let me try that
[2013-12-26 14:56:12 -0500] tscanausa: is there a feature in knife to bootstrap a server with a specific role?
[2013-12-26 14:56:31 -0500] masterkorp: tscanausa: yeah this is a parameter for that
[2013-12-26 14:56:42 -0500] masterkorp: its on the docs
[2013-12-26 14:57:17 -0500] tscanausa: masterkorp: so I think that worked but then it seems like it did not persist to the chef server
[2013-12-26 14:57:58 -0500] masterkorp: weird
[2013-12-26 14:58:06 -0500] tscanausa: if it is expected behavior to persist or not persist that is fine, I just want to know either way.
[2013-12-26 14:58:08 -0500] masterkorp: knife node show confirms that ?
[2013-12-26 14:58:40 -0500] tscanausa: masterkorp: I already added the role now. so that I cant tell you know
[2013-12-26 14:58:45 -0500] tscanausa: now*
[2013-12-26 15:00:20 -0500] tscanausa: the log on the server was reporting "WARN: empty run list"
[2013-12-26 15:25:18 -0500] Guest89309: Some one used chef to configure sumocollector
[2013-12-26 15:45:55 -0500] isbaran: hi, is there a way to notify/subscribe to specific action of a service ?
[2013-12-26 15:46:35 -0500] Guest89309: any own installed sumocollector using chef
[2013-12-26 15:46:52 -0500] Guest89309: i need help with a error
[2013-12-26 15:49:52 -0500] jbz: isbaran:  I don't know of any direct way.  Depending on the circumstance, you might be able to use EXTREME CLEVERNESS.
[2013-12-26 15:52:11 -0500] jbz: isbaran: i.e. notify an execute resource which checks to see how it was notified.
[2013-12-26 15:59:05 -0500] isbaran: jbz: how can i check the notifier ?
[2013-12-26 16:03:45 -0500] jbz: isbaran: Sorry, I was being slightly facetious and, it turns out, slightly wrong.  I thought you could set a flag first, but looking at it I don't see where you'd do that.
[2013-12-26 16:06:54 -0500] rfx86: hey guys, i'm having a doubt here, i have a recipe that uses bash do that i need to be sure it is completed before moving on to the next chef script in the batch
[2013-12-26 16:07:00 -0500] rfx86: any ideas on how to achieve this please?
[2013-12-26 16:09:25 -0500] isbaran: rfx86: b = bash "xx" do ... b.run_action(:run)
[2013-12-26 16:09:45 -0500] rfx86: ui sir, thanks will give it a try
[2013-12-26 16:10:33 -0500] isbaran: rfx86: there is a wiki page explaining those patterns on wiki.opscode.com
[2013-12-26 16:10:43 -0500] rfx86: how should i look for it?
[2013-12-26 16:10:59 -0500] isbaran: maybe "run resource on compile time"
[2013-12-26 16:11:04 -0500] isbaran: or sth. like that
[2013-12-26 16:11:12 -0500] rfx86: thanks!
[2013-12-26 16:55:29 -0500] shlant: can someone explain to me if there would be a reason why you would build a server with an initial run list of say 6 recipes, and then once built, remove all recipes but one?
[2013-12-26 16:55:41 -0500] shlant: isn't that bad news bears?
[2013-12-26 16:56:47 -0500] shlant: shouldn't all recipes be run to ensure holistic configuration maagement?
[2013-12-26 16:57:05 -0500] shlant: shouldn't all recipes be run *everytime*
[2013-12-26 16:57:19 -0500] zdeptawa: it's best practice to write recipes that are idempotent
[2013-12-26 16:57:49 -0500] zdeptawa: generally speaking, at least with things I work on, I want to make sure the configurations remain how chef sets them
[2013-12-26 16:58:06 -0500] zdeptawa: so if anything is changed, I want it changed back - and everything I write can be run over and over without causing ill effects
[2013-12-26 17:05:37 -0500] adnichols: shlant: agree w/ zdeptawa, what you're describing isn't very good. Even if your recipes aren't idempotent there are ways to make them run once and never again for a given host w/out altering the runlist
[2013-12-26 17:06:33 -0500] shlant: that's what I thought. If you don't have the same run list the server was built withbase-files, then the interaction between recipes and cookbooks isn't the same
[2013-12-26 17:07:29 -0500] shlant: thanks for clarifying
[2013-12-26 17:07:36 -0500] adnichols: yeah, otoh, that sounds intentional so I'd want to understand why. Maybe there's a better way, but maybe there's a good reason
[2013-12-26 17:07:51 -0500] shlant: haha
[2013-12-26 17:08:16 -0500] shlant: well from what I gather, the reason why they are doing it that way is because there is no version constraints such as environments implemented
[2013-12-26 17:08:37 -0500] adnichols: so the concern is a change will get executed which isn't expected?
[2013-12-26 17:08:39 -0500] shlant: so this tactic is to prevent prod cookbook changes from being propagated
[2013-12-26 17:09:07 -0500] adnichols: ic, so in that case it sounds like they solved the right problem in likely the wrong way
[2013-12-26 17:09:12 -0500] shlant: indeed
[2013-12-26 17:09:24 -0500] shlant: i just came into this role so I'm sorting out what needs changing
[2013-12-26 17:09:27 -0500] shlant: that's one of them ahah
[2013-12-26 17:09:32 -0500] adnichols: sure, been there
[2013-12-26 17:10:46 -0500] adnichols: I'd just say that fixing that problem correctly requires a fair amount of discipline and process and for some orgs it may just be safer to do what they are doing
[2013-12-26 17:11:12 -0500] jonlives_: adnichols: easier, not safer.
[2013-12-26 17:15:55 -0500] adnichols: jonlives: maybe a false sense of security, sure.
[2013-12-26 17:15:55 -0500] adnichols: I say safer because the alternative is to not solve the problem
[2013-12-26 17:16:28 -0500] jonlives: adnichols: right - my point was more that not solving a dangerous or undesirable problem does not result in safety :)
[2013-12-26 17:16:40 -0500] adnichols: jonlives: fair, agreed
[2013-12-26 17:16:48 -0500] jonlives: in this case, I'd say it may well have been done with the best of intentions, but should definitely be fixed.
[2013-12-26 17:17:16 -0500] jonlives: ie, it's very much an anti-pattern to use chef like that.
[2013-12-26 17:17:23 -0500] adnichols: yes
[2013-12-26 17:18:27 -0500] jonlives: shlant: I would hazard a guess that whoever did that was trying to write a "installer" for the system, and mapped that way of thinking onto chef.
[2013-12-26 17:19:36 -0500] shlant: jonlives: I think the person who wrote most of the chef code is very much a sysadmin and not operations
[2013-12-26 17:24:46 -0500] jonlives: shlant: it also means that if you try to copy the config of your server, you have to know those 5 recipes were removed - you can't just use the existing config. that makes for pain further down the line.
[2013-12-26 17:42:22 -0500] siddc: I have created a role that has three recipes in it and assigned that role to relevant clients. How do I force all the clients to run the recipes in the role now?
[2013-12-26 17:44:51 -0500] jbz: siddc:  You mean you assigned the role to *nodes*, right?
[2013-12-26 17:45:00 -0500] siddc: jbz: Yup
[2013-12-26 17:45:17 -0500] jbz: siddc:  OK then the next time those nodes run chef-client, they'll execute the runlist in that role
[2013-12-26 17:45:33 -0500] jbz: siddc:  If they're not running chef-client either as a daemon or via cron, you might need to manually kick off the client run
[2013-12-26 17:45:44 -0500] siddc: jbz: Ah, that's what I wanted
[2013-12-26 17:46:05 -0500] jbz: siddc:  If you're not running the client automatically, you coudl use knife ssh to do it.
[2013-12-26 17:46:32 -0500] siddc: jbz: I have all my nodes in spacewalk. I can just issue the chef-client command to all of them using that.
[2013-12-26 17:46:46 -0500] jbz: ah so, then you're on top of it!
[2013-12-26 17:53:16 -0500] yuri1: hey all, as part of a cookbook I'm creating, I need to be able to set up each server (set up by chef) to be able to connect to a different server using shared keys
[2013-12-26 17:53:32 -0500] yuri1: I can't seem to find a cookbook that will allow me to do something like ssh-copy-id
[2013-12-26 17:53:36 -0500] yuri1: any suggestions?
[2013-12-26 17:55:07 -0500] someara: yuri1: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/ssh_known_hosts
[2013-12-26 17:55:43 -0500] yuri1: yeah, I saw that so that allows me to set up another server as a known host
[2013-12-26 17:55:53 -0500] yuri1: but how do I get my public key over to the remote server
[2013-12-26 18:00:43 -0500] someara: every time you run chef, ohai digs information about the system and puts it in the node object
[2013-12-26 18:01:00 -0500] someara: after the chef run, it posts the node object to chef-server
[2013-12-26 18:01:04 -0500] someara: ohai host_rsa_public
[2013-12-26 18:01:36 -0500] someara: that cookbook searches chef-server, harvests the host_rsa_public info from node objects, and renders then into a template
[2013-12-26 18:02:11 -0500] yuri1: does that mean the other server also needs to be a node?
[2013-12-26 18:02:24 -0500] someara: yea they all need to be on chef-server
[2013-12-26 18:02:30 -0500] someara: you cant use solo for this
[2013-12-26 18:03:02 -0500] yuri1: well if for example I want to connect to an svn server that's not chef managed
[2013-12-26 18:03:31 -0500] someara: then you'll have to use another method
[2013-12-26 18:03:43 -0500] yuri1: and is there a suggested method for this?
[2013-12-26 18:03:56 -0500] someara: not off the top
[2013-12-26 18:04:35 -0500] someara: put the svn server in your org =)
[2013-12-26 18:04:52 -0500] someara: or you can write something custom
[2013-12-26 18:05:11 -0500] tscanausa: yuri1: I just set up shared keys for my servers using the users cookbook. and you could simply have a very small recipe to run your svn server
[2013-12-26 18:05:36 -0500] someara: wait
[2013-12-26 18:05:40 -0500] someara: acually
[2013-12-26 18:05:40 -0500] someara: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/ssh_known_hosts/blob/master/recipes/default.rb#L51
[2013-12-26 18:05:59 -0500] someara: it looks like you can stick keys in data bags on top of search results
[2013-12-26 18:08:58 -0500] siddc:  I am trying to set an attribute to true using knife. Can somebody help with the syntax? I am using this - knife exec -E "nodes.transform('name:a4ldp01p1') {|n| n.normal_attrs['first_run']}"
[2013-12-26 18:09:29 -0500] yuri1: hm Ok I'll play around with that, thanks someara
[2013-12-26 18:09:35 -0500] someara: np
[2013-12-26 18:40:26 -0500] gyre007: i have a q
[2013-12-26 18:40:35 -0500] gyre007: if i include recipe from another cookbook
[2013-12-26 18:40:52 -0500] gyre007: are the attributes of that cookbook included automatically too ?
[2013-12-26 18:41:23 -0500] gyre007: like Im overriding some attributes in attributes files in some cookbook out of which i want to include a recipe in another cookbook
[2013-12-26 18:41:38 -0500] gyre007: and im wondering if the attributes transfer too
[2013-12-26 18:43:48 -0500] micgo: gyre007: yes. when you use include_recipe, the attributes from the included recipe are evaluated first, then anything you set in your cookbook attribute file overrides them
[2013-12-26 18:44:24 -0500] micgo: this happens during the compilation phase, so the attributes are all worked out before the execution phase runs whatever is in your included recipe
[2013-12-26 18:44:48 -0500] gyre007: so if I include recipe from cookbook A, attributes overridden in cookbook A (IN ATTRIBUTES FILE - NOT THE INCLUDED RECIPE) will be included/overridden in Cookbook B where I'm doing include_recipe ?
[2013-12-26 18:44:56 -0500] gyre007: this is importan
[2013-12-26 18:45:04 -0500] gyre007: im NOT overriding attributes in RECIPE
[2013-12-26 18:45:09 -0500] gyre007: but rather in ATTR file
[2013-12-26 18:45:28 -0500] micgo: yes
[2013-12-26 18:45:49 -0500] gyre007: but i gues if the include recipe is done, the whole cookbook is loaded and all attrs are evaluated...
[2013-12-26 18:47:14 -0500] micgo: exactly
[2013-12-26 18:48:52 -0500] gyre007: cool
[2013-12-26 18:48:53 -0500] gyre007: thanks
[2013-12-26 19:11:34 -0500] moted: if I have a resource that I eval during compile time with .run_action() that notifies another resource, does it get evaluated in compile time as well?
[2013-12-26 19:32:30 -0500] martz_: hi what is the recomended syntax for attributes with single quotes or with a colon ?
[2013-12-26 19:35:38 -0500] cwj: martz_: i think the official recommendation has been to use single quotes, because it tends to be less confusing to those who are new to ruby
[2013-12-26 19:36:07 -0500] martz_: but it's more typing :)
[2013-12-26 19:36:09 -0500] cwj: martz_: that said, i personally think the most important thing is to choose one and be consistent with it
[2013-12-26 19:37:11 -0500] martz_: @cwj so I guess single quotes are more common, not necessarily right ...
[2013-12-26 19:40:21 -0500] cwj: yep
[2013-12-26 20:54:38 -0500] mdpatrick_: Hi guys -- I've been using chef to setup servers on AWS & DigitalOcean which ahs been super easy. How do I configure a VPS that doesnt have an API & gem specially built for it to provision to?
[2013-12-26 20:55:34 -0500] tscanausa: mdpatrick_: what do you mean a gem built for it?
[2013-12-26 20:55:51 -0500] mdpatrick_: tscanausa: knife-ec2
[2013-12-26 20:56:06 -0500] mdpatrick_: e.g. my only experience of provisioning a server so far has been with knife-ec2 :)
[2013-12-26 20:56:29 -0500] tscanausa: so you are actually using knife to setup servers that different then chef running on the server.
[2013-12-26 20:57:49 -0500] tscanausa: mdpatrick_: for the vps you will need to go through their system to setup a server then run "knife bootstrap &ldquo;IPADDRESS&rdquo; -x &ldquo;USERNAME --sudo"
[2013-12-26 20:58:08 -0500] tscanausa: knife bootstrap "IPADDRESS" -x "USERNAME" --sudo
[2013-12-26 20:58:51 -0500] mdpatrick_: Wow, thats actually a lot less challenging than I thought it might be :)
[2013-12-26 21:01:00 -0500] mdpatrick_: thank you, tscanausa
[2013-12-26 21:04:03 -0500] coderanger: mdpatrick_: The knife cloud plugins literally just call knife bootstrap for you internally :)
[2013-12-26 21:04:17 -0500] coderanger: And in general they are just a pretty thin wrapper around Fog + knife bootstrap
[2013-12-26 21:51:01 -0500] bitgangsta: Hi! I'm trying to override the nginx cookbook's values in my (wrapper) cookbook. I override node.override[:nginx][:version] in my wrapper, but when it runs nginx[:source][:version] is wrong. It's set by nginx's attributes file as: default['nginx']['source']['version']  = node['nginx']['version']. I thought attribute evaluation was fixed in chef v11.
[2013-12-26 21:51:32 -0500] bitgangsta: confused why node['nginx'][v
[2013-12-26 21:51:46 -0500] bitgangsta: ['version'] is evaluating as the default even though I've overridden it.

[2013-12-26 22:34:07 -0500] berkelep: any suggestions?
[2013-12-26 22:48:27 -0500] coderanger: berkelep: How did you download that cookbook?
[2013-12-26 22:48:43 -0500] coderanger: and do you have the windows cookbook locally?
[2013-12-26 22:50:03 -0500] berkelep: coderanger: i'm using vagrant up --provision
[2013-12-26 22:50:18 -0500] coderanger: berkelep: Yes, but are you using berkshelf, librarian, etc?
[2013-12-26 22:50:23 -0500] berkelep: berkshelf
[2013-12-26 22:50:45 -0500] coderanger: Okay, so it should have download the windows cookbook for you
[2013-12-26 22:50:53 -0500] berkelep: i think it's working now. i'm pointing powershell to master instead of v1.1.2
[2013-12-26 22:51:14 -0500] coderanger: Sounds believable
[2013-12-26 22:51:22 -0500] berkelep: master now has this fix in it: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/powershell/commit/0f8b20447449ac5b8b0ae63921d27e4932b7b990
[2013-12-26 22:51:41 -0500] berkelep: a version bump would be nice on that
[2013-12-26 22:51:58 -0500] coderanger: sethvargo: ^^
[2013-12-26 22:52:28 -0500] sethvargo: @coderanger @someara is the release master now
[2013-12-26 22:52:38 -0500] coderanger: someara: ^^ :)
[2013-12-26 23:14:02 -0500] mdpatrick_: Hmm... looks like the most popular mysql cookbook doesn't allow you to create users other than root... am I reading that right? Anyone got a preferred cookbook alternative?
[2013-12-26 23:16:04 -0500] coderanger: mdpatrick_: The mysql_user resource is, for reasons lost to the mists of time, in the database cookbook
[2013-12-26 23:16:09 -0500] coderanger: so install that one too
[2013-12-26 23:16:36 -0500] mdpatrick_: lol... such is the way of things often. Thank you :)
[2013-12-26 23:48:43 -0500] misentropic: Hi all. I am getting a strange error from a file resource on windows. What I'm trying to do is add NT rights for a given user on some files and I get a Win32APIError but the output says the command succeeded. See gist here: https://gist.github.com/TheSultan/8140309
[2013-12-26 23:48:50 -0500] misentropic: Any ideas or debugging hints?
[2013-12-26 23:56:51 -0500] coderanger: misentropic: Not too many windows folks hang out on IRC a lot, the ML might be a better bet
[2013-12-26 23:58:10 -0500] misentropic: @coderanger, ok thanks. I'll shoot a message to the ML. I was hoping that @someara or @juliancdunn may have some ideas :-)
