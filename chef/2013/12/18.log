[2013-12-18 20:06:52 -0500] jstump: Anyone have an idea on how to resolve this message: Unable to satisfy constraints on package runit, which does not exist, due to solution constraint (nagios >= 0.0.0)
[2013-12-18 20:07:01 -0500] jstump: (Both runit and nagios are on the server. No problems there.)
[2013-12-18 20:07:20 -0500] jtimberman: jstump: there may be another cookbook that depends on a version of runit that doesn't exist.
[2013-12-18 20:07:55 -0500] jtimberman: where are you seeing that message?
[2013-12-18 20:08:03 -0500] jstump: jtimberman: When I run chef-client.
[2013-12-18 20:08:06 -0500] jstump: On the node.
[2013-12-18 20:08:30 -0500] jstump: jtimberman: All cookbooks that depend on runit are ~> 1.2.0 or >= 1.0.0. I have 1.5.1 on the server.
[2013-12-18 20:09:25 -0500] JayF: ~> 1.2.0 I think will make you need 1.2.x
[2013-12-18 20:09:40 -0500] JayF: if it works the same way as ~> does for rubygems
[2013-12-18 20:09:58 -0500] jtimberman: jstump: i believe the pessimistic constraint against 1.2.0 is the culprit, and you'll want ~> 1.2
[2013-12-18 20:10:47 -0500] jstump: jtimberman: Given these are all community cookbooks I'm not really sure how to go about resolving this issue. Sounds like the answer is to *downgrade* runit so that checks in the jenkins and nginx community cookbooks will pass.
[2013-12-18 20:12:52 -0500] jtimberman: jstump: are the cookbooks with the ~> 1.2.0 upstream from the community?
[2013-12-18 20:13:01 -0500] jtimberman: if so yea, i'd use 1.2.x of runit.
[2013-12-18 20:15:29 -0500] jstump: jtimberman: I'm even more confused now that I look at this because I'm using jenkins 1.2.2 from the community site, but the metadata.rb clearly says ">= 1.0.0" with no pessimistic check.
[2013-12-18 20:16:19 -0500] jstump: jtimberman: And the locally cached cookbook has no "depends" at all in the metadata.rb.
[2013-12-18 20:16:26 -0500] jstump: I'm not sure where those checks are coming from to be honest.
[2013-12-18 20:18:53 -0500] jtimberman: hm, appears taht nginx has: depends 'runit',           '~> 1.2' - that should be okay. jenkins has depends => 1.0.0
[2013-12-18 20:19:24 -0500] jstump: jtimberman: It might be the nginx one. I've changed my Berkshelf file to be =1.2.0. Still getting an error though.
[2013-12-18 20:19:54 -0500] jstump: jtimberman: I even went so far as to nuke my ~/.berkshelf/cookbooks and *every* cookbook (all version) on the server.

[2013-12-18 20:47:17 -0500] Sauraus: What would cause an empty search for nodes or clients not return all client & nodes known to the chef server? And I've tried reindex already didn't solve the problem
[2013-12-18 20:48:28 -0500] juliancdunn: Sauraus: are you searching for Windows nodes?
[2013-12-18 20:48:33 -0500] Sauraus: linux

[2013-12-18 20:48:47 -0500] Sauraus: I can see them in the 'nodes' and 'client' tabs just fine
[2013-12-18 20:53:27 -0500] freerobby: I'm using the deploy_revision resource. I have symlinks({'log' => 'log', 'tmp' => 'tmp'}) as an attribute
[2013-12-18 20:53:44 -0500] freerobby: It puts the log symlink in the top level, but creates the tmp symlink inside the tmp directory
[2013-12-18 20:53:45 -0500] daw13: juliancdunn: Earlier you instructed me to do a node.save and manually issue a reboot on a Windows system.  Which works, thank you for that.  I was wondering if I could also signal the chef run to end successfully?

[2013-12-18 21:18:33 -0500] tomduffield: cpuguy83 - if its a custom plugin: http://docs.opscode.com/ohai.html#load-a-plugin
[2013-12-18 21:18:35 -0500] ranjib: check the ohai cookbook. it might have some batteries..  i know theres a ohai provider

[2013-12-18 21:25:55 -0500] juliancdunn: daw13: you might be able to "return" in a ruby_block
[2013-12-18 21:25:57 -0500] juliancdunn: not sure
[2013-12-18 21:27:40 -0500] someara: @cjs use search(:your_databag, 'what:ever') and iterate over the results
[2013-12-18 21:27:51 -0500] stevedomin: Blkdragon: sorry just saw your message. Yes this is exactly the problem
[2013-12-18 21:29:18 -0500] mondo: can I use some sort of conditional in my metadata.rb?  I want to be able to do a depends if cookbook::recipe1 but not if we're doing cookbook::recipe2
[2013-12-18 21:30:12 -0500] tomduffield: mondo: not really
[2013-12-18 21:30:57 -0500] someara: np.
[2013-12-18 21:31:06 -0500] someara: er, no
[2013-12-18 21:31:41 -0500] mondo: I'm probably going about this the wrong way.  I have a cookbook where I want the option to install a package from source or from an RPM.  If I do RPM I need the yum functions.  Is there another way to make the yum cookbook's functions available without using a depends statement in metadata.rb?
[2013-12-18 21:32:12 -0500] tomduffield: mondo: nope
[2013-12-18 21:32:29 -0500] mattsurabian: looking to optimize the time to live for a node any reason I shouldn't copy a precompiled binary of a dependency onto the box from a trusted location vs downloading the source from a trusted location and compiling at boot time
[2013-12-18 21:32:30 -0500] tomduffield: mondo: unless your cookbook depends on another cookbook that depends on yum ;)
[2013-12-18 21:32:58 -0500] tomduffield: mattsurabian: nope - I've done that before. just make sure to test :)
[2013-12-18 21:33:18 -0500] mattsurabian: definitely :-p thanks tomduffield
[2013-12-18 21:33:27 -0500] mondo: so if I have a cookbook that should work on debian system and a ubuntu system, I'm going to have to depends the yum cookbook and the apt cookbook? (or do without their added functionality)
[2013-12-18 21:33:49 -0500] mondo: sorry I should have said debian and rpm system
[2013-12-18 21:35:07 -0500] tomduffield: mondo: I believe so
[2013-12-18 21:37:28 -0500] tomduffield: mondo: if I remember correctly the metadata.rb is evaluated when the cookbook is uploaded and not when it is downloaded
[2013-12-18 21:40:46 -0500] cjs226: @someara sorry, I'm not needing to iterate over numerous data bag items, but over entries in a data bag item - data_bag_item("foo", "bar")['apps'].each
[2013-12-18 21:42:21 -0500] tomduffield: what is ['apps']? array? hash?
[2013-12-18 21:43:48 -0500] cjs226: @tomduffield a hash
[2013-12-18 21:44:26 -0500] tomduffield: and it only works when there is on item in the hash? that seems strange...
[2013-12-18 21:44:49 -0500] tomduffield: what happens if there is more than 1 item in the hash?
[2013-12-18 22:00:31 -0500] xapak: Hello.
[2013-12-18 22:03:26 -0500] tomduffield: xapak: hello - if you have a question, feel free to just ask your question
[2013-12-18 22:04:29 -0500] xapak: tomduffield, haha, yeah, sorry, I was trying something that just ocurred to me before asking. ;)
[2013-12-18 22:14:44 -0500] chris613: Can someone confirm that I've understood correctly so I know what to read? AFAICT The chef-server cookbook on Centos configures an upstart job that then uses runit to manage the services. Is that right?
[2013-12-18 22:16:17 -0500] cjs226: @tomduffield, i muffed my previous question.  given it's complexity i created a gist that describes this issue: https://gist.github.com/cjs226/8030825
[2013-12-18 22:17:11 -0500] tomduffield: cjs226: so in your example you have two completely different data types. the first is an array and the second is a string.
[2013-12-18 22:17:30 -0500] tomduffield: cjs226: you'll need to pick one and stick with it.
[2013-12-18 22:18:18 -0500] cjs226: @tomduffield,  eesh.  sorry for the stupid mistake
[2013-12-18 22:18:37 -0500] tomduffield: cjs226: no worries. It's Wednesday.
[2013-12-18 22:18:47 -0500] tomduffield: *its

[2013-12-18 22:56:20 -0500] patmaddox: I'm trying to install ruyb using chef-rbenv and ruby-build. When chef-client runs, I get the error "ruby_build cookbook is missing. Please add to the run_list"  but I don't understand because I've got include_recipe "ruby_build" and have ruby_build as a depends in metadata. ideas?
[2013-12-18 23:01:26 -0500] tomduffield: patmaddox: which recipe is throwing that error?
[2013-12-18 23:02:46 -0500] patmaddox: tomduffield: it happens at https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rbenv/blob/master/providers/ruby.rb#L45
[2013-12-18 23:03:17 -0500] patmaddox: ultimately, run_context.loaded_recipe?("ruby_build")  is returning false
[2013-12-18 23:03:36 -0500] patmaddox: but should that be the case when I have run_context.loaded_recipe?("ruby_build")  in my recipe?
[2013-12-18 23:05:05 -0500] tomduffield: what version of chef-client are you running?
[2013-12-18 23:05:29 -0500] patmaddox: 11.8.2
[2013-12-18 23:06:54 -0500] CaptChrisD: I am having troubles with the chef-client cookbook not starting the service during provisioning, but am not getting any errors. Does anyone have experience with this issue?
[2013-12-18 23:09:15 -0500] EnriqueCadalso: Hi. Is it ok to install chef-client, knife and some knife plugins in the same server where chef server is installed?
[2013-12-18 23:09:44 -0500] tomduffield: patmaddox: just to check - is the include_recipe before the rbenv recipe?
[2013-12-18 23:10:20 -0500] patmaddox: yep. include_recipe "ruby_build" followed by include_recipe "rbenv"
[2013-12-18 23:10:41 -0500] tomduffield: EnriqueCadalso: If you're careful it shouldnt be an issue.
[2013-12-18 23:12:41 -0500] patmaddox: it's weird because it says "loading cookbooks" and includes ruby_build in there, then says ruby_build cookbook is missing  https://gist.github.com/patmaddox/a24068fbf99269318149
[2013-12-18 23:13:59 -0500] tomduffield: patmaddox: what happens when you put your log into DEBUG?
[2013-12-18 23:16:06 -0500] patmaddox: tomduffield: can't say I know how to do that while provision from vagrant. I imagine it's just an option to chef-client but I don't know how to configure that in the vagrant file
[2013-12-18 23:17:13 -0500] patmaddox: I did add chef.add_recipe 'ruby_build' to my vagrant file, which adds it to the run_list. I thought including the recipe in my recipe would work too, guess not
[2013-12-18 23:17:48 -0500] tomduffield: patmaddox: its log_level in the config block
[2013-12-18 23:18:10 -0500] tomduffield: so chef.log_level = :DEBUG
[2013-12-18 23:18:39 -0500] chef-solo-vagran: Hi. I'm using Chef-solo via vagrant and hitting problems with some cookbooks. I documented one case here http://pastebin.com/LMAWvwHK. I'm wondering: Is it possible to change the version of Ruby that is used (by chef-solo when called via vagrant)?
[2013-12-18 23:19:06 -0500] EnriqueCadalso: tomduffield: Thanks.
[2013-12-18 23:20:10 -0500] patmaddox: tomduffield: thanks. gonna be a minute I destroyed the vm. will let you know...
[2013-12-18 23:20:22 -0500] tomduffield: so when you run ruby_block, chef uses the omnibus ruby (1.9.3) but when you use an execute command it'll use the system ruby
[2013-12-18 23:21:50 -0500] tomduffield: so if you want to use a specific version of ruby, use something like the ruby_build cookbook to install it on the node
[2013-12-18 23:25:59 -0500] chef-solo-vagran: Thanks tom. It sounds like the cookbook I'm using really is flawed then. Since it installs its own ruby and then fails to use it. It's neither the system ruby, nor the embedded chef one.
[2013-12-18 23:29:43 -0500] chef-solo-vagran: I know installing RVM to manage the system ruby causes problems. I stored my notes here in case they're useful to anyone else (paying it forward for the help) http://pastebin.com/pBytwmbj . So, I'm wondering if ruby_build (rbenv) will have the same problems with chef-solo that RVM does.
[2013-12-18 23:31:15 -0500] patmaddox: tomduffield: nothing useful that I see. it looks like it installs ruby_build fine https://gist.github.com/patmaddox/1684fc40499c084715b0
[2013-12-18 23:32:23 -0500] tomduffield: patmaddox: can i see the full log?
[2013-12-18 23:32:32 -0500] tomduffield: patmaddox: i was looking for something specific
[2013-12-18 23:34:47 -0500] patmaddox: tomduffield: enjoy https://gist.github.com/patmaddox/ac8a712b140f8734e533
[2013-12-18 23:35:29 -0500] cheflevelramen: chef-solo-vagran: I've had a lot of success using ruby_build and rbenv::system in my cookbooks and with vagrant
[2013-12-18 23:36:42 -0500] troybattey: hi.  when I run 'knife client list' on my workstation vm, I get an error "Your private key could not be loaded from /etc/chef/client.pem".  Any idea why is it not looking in my chef-repo/.chef folder?
[2013-12-18 23:36:43 -0500] cheflevelramen: chef-solo-vagran: There have been a few gotchas, but most resources allow you to specify which ruby or gem to use, so I just point them to the binary in rbenv/shems
[2013-12-18 23:37:10 -0500] troybattey: background:  I am setting up a workstation for a co-worker.  Mine works fine, but I am having a problem with his.
[2013-12-18 23:37:12 -0500] cheflevelramen: troybattey: are you in the chef-repo/ directory?
[2013-12-18 23:37:30 -0500] cheflevelramen: troybattey: otherwise you can symlink chef-repo/.chef to ~/.chef
[2013-12-18 23:37:31 -0500] troybattey: cheflevelramen: yes
[2013-12-18 23:38:13 -0500] cheflevelramen: troybattey: hmm, did you share configs and now have an ownership/permissions issue?
[2013-12-18 23:38:25 -0500] troybattey: oh maybe.  lmc
[2013-12-18 23:38:53 -0500] troybattey: cheflevelramen: no he copied/pasted text
[2013-12-18 23:39:05 -0500] troybattey: let me try a symlink
[2013-12-18 23:39:15 -0500] chef-solo-vagran: Thanks cheflevelramen.  Not to nit-pick, but you do mean you're testing with chef-solo, right?
[2013-12-18 23:40:03 -0500] patmaddox: tomduffield: and it's pretty weird because it sure looks like it successfully installs ruby_build before complaining that it's missing
[2013-12-18 23:40:05 -0500] tomduffield: patmaddox: this is weird. You want to submit an issue with ruby_build. someone there may know more
[2013-12-18 23:40:24 -0500] patmaddox: tomduffield: okay. thanks for the help
[2013-12-18 23:42:24 -0500] chef-solo-vagran: Thanks for the help. I think I understand enough now (about ruby_block) to understand why some things get installed in the system ruby and others don't, and how to deal with that (ruby_build). That tells me I should probably use ruby_build for system ruby mgmt and that there is a bug in the cookbook, but it probably runs fine for people who aren't using chef-solo.
[2013-12-18 23:44:21 -0500] troybattey: cheflevelramen:  i tried the symlink.  but it still looking for "client.pem" and it should be looking for "COWORKERNAME.pem" as specified in the knife.rb
[2013-12-18 23:44:49 -0500] patmaddox: tomduffield: I just added chef.add_recipe "ruby_build" and it gets it working. It's not what I want, but it's progress
[2013-12-18 23:47:33 -0500] tomduffield: patmaddox: so it works when you add it to the runlist
[2013-12-18 23:50:17 -0500] patmaddox: tomduffield: yes. not with include_recipe
