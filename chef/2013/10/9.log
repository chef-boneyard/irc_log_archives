[2013-10-09 07:29:16 -0400] oliver_: hi there, anyone have experience with the application / deploy resources? I'm having a hard time figure out how i'd can run more chef code before restart
[2013-10-09 07:29:37 -0400] oliver_: http://pastie.org/8388675  thats what my application block looks like, and below is something I've tried as well...
[2013-10-09 07:30:19 -0400] oliver_: and I based those two notifies at the bottom on the 2nd example code here: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_deploy.html
[2013-10-09 07:30:54 -0400] oliver_: but can't get em to run :(
[2013-10-09 07:38:18 -0400] fitzdsl_: Hello guys. I'm quite new to chef. I was wondering if it was possible when using knife to create databags, env etc to create the corresponding files in the data_bags, environment, etc directory ?
[2013-10-09 07:46:14 -0400] fitzdsl_: or do I need each time to create the environment and then to show -F JSON env_name > environment/env_name.json ?
[2013-10-09 08:02:55 -0400] Cope: fitzdsl_: you can create the files manually and upload them using nife
[2013-10-09 08:03:22 -0400] Cope: knife data bag from file mydatabag mydatabag.json
[2013-10-09 08:07:02 -0400] oliver_: for the record: i ended up just shelling out with backticks inside the before_restart block
[2013-10-09 08:07:20 -0400] fitzdsl_: Cope: the thing is I would like to have the advantage of knife creating all the json structure for me (like in create) but to have the file in order to be able versionning it easily
[2013-10-09 08:29:49 -0400] Cope: ok... so yeah, you can do knife data bag create, and knife databag show -F JSON
[2013-10-09 08:29:58 -0400] Cope: and put that in version control
[2013-10-09 08:30:02 -0400] Cope: if you want...
[2013-10-09 08:31:46 -0400] z1y: Hello. Can I use multiple :source with :remote_directory (http://docs.opscode.com/resource_remote_directory.html) ?
[2013-10-09 09:21:08 -0400] daharon: Hey guys, is there a way I can run a search like this:  x:(y|z)  ?
[2013-10-09 09:21:17 -0400] daharon: Basically a list of possible values for one attribute?
[2013-10-09 10:23:44 -0400] ocholetras: hi guys
[2013-10-09 10:24:25 -0400] ocholetras: anyone have noticed users cookbook clonin resources when using users_manage LWRP twice one for each group i need users to be added to?
[2013-10-09 10:24:33 -0400] ocholetras: hoy can i avoid that?
[2013-10-09 10:25:06 -0400] Afterglow: usually cloning happens when a resource of the same type and name is created as an existing one, ensure your resources don't have the same name
[2013-10-09 10:25:16 -0400] ocholetras: yea
[2013-10-09 10:25:26 -0400] ocholetras: but "user" resources are "generated" by the LWRP
[2013-10-09 10:25:30 -0400] ocholetras: i have no control over that
[2013-10-09 10:25:48 -0400] ocholetras: I simply have some groups
[2013-10-09 10:26:00 -0400] ocholetras: if i have a user on two groups, resource is clonned
[2013-10-09 10:26:35 -0400] ocholetras: looks like de users cookbook LWRP does not stack groups for only 1 user resource for each username.
[2013-10-09 10:26:50 -0400] ocholetras: i.e. If Admin is on db and sudoers
[2013-10-09 10:26:56 -0400] ocholetras: to manage that groups
[2013-10-09 10:27:51 -0400] ocholetras: i have to declare 2 resources:
[2013-10-09 10:27:51 -0400] ocholetras: users_manage "db" do
[2013-10-09 10:27:52 -0400] ocholetras:   whatever
[2013-10-09 10:27:52 -0400] ocholetras: end
[2013-10-09 10:27:52 -0400] ocholetras: users_manage "sudoers do
[2013-10-09 10:27:52 -0400] ocholetras:   whatever
[2013-10-09 10:27:53 -0400] ocholetras: end
[2013-10-09 10:28:36 -0400] ocholetras: So, there will be a resource: user[Admin] twice
[2013-10-09 10:28:43 -0400] ocholetras: one for each group
[2013-10-09 10:30:50 -0400] Afterglow: hmm ok sorry i've never used the users_manage stuff not sure
[2013-10-09 10:34:56 -0400] ocholetras: its basically the users cookbook
[2013-10-09 10:34:58 -0400] ocholetras: from opscode

[2013-10-09 10:42:48 -0400] wlll: Hey all. I'm hitting an issue with our chef server. We have a chef server on an internal network. I have a client on a remote server that is accessing the chef-server via port forwarding.
[2013-10-09 10:42:50 -0400] wlll: I've configured the client to use the local host/port that is then forwarded over SSH to the internal chef server. The client can connect, but is downloading cookbook files using the internal network hostname of the chef server, which cannot be accessed outside the network.
[2013-10-09 10:43:11 -0400] wlll: This used to work just fine on 10.x, current version: x-ops-api-info: flavor=osc;version=11.0.2;erchef=1.2.6
[2013-10-09 10:48:41 -0400] legal90: Hi, chefs! I have a question about data bags.  http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html#directory-structure
[2013-10-09 10:49:00 -0400] legal90: Here is directory structure described
[2013-10-09 10:50:55 -0400] legal90: But i can't understand how I can to access to content of such files like 'standard_packages.json, 'global_shell_settings.json' which placed in the root of 'data_bags' directory
[2013-10-09 10:51:18 -0400] ocholetras: you have to create those files
[2013-10-09 10:51:37 -0400] legal90: of course, i know it
[2013-10-09 10:51:43 -0400] ocholetras: then import to the server with kife data bag from file 'databagame'  'databagitem'
[2013-10-09 10:52:03 -0400] legal90: Is it a data bag? Or it is an item?
[2013-10-09 10:52:11 -0400] ocholetras: i mean you have to create directory/file structure by hand
[2013-10-09 10:52:23 -0400] ocholetras: data_bags/databag_bane/itemname.json
[2013-10-09 10:52:24 -0400] Afterglow: the example in that page is wholly confusing
[2013-10-09 10:52:41 -0400] ocholetras: for example
[2013-10-09 10:52:58 -0400] ocholetras: data_bag/users/adminsys.json
[2013-10-09 10:53:24 -0400] ocholetras: then you import like: knife data bag from file users ./data_bag/users/adminsys.json
[2013-10-09 10:53:28 -0400] ocholetras: users = name of the data bag
[2013-10-09 10:53:42 -0400] ocholetras: adminsys = item name
[2013-10-09 10:55:46 -0400] ocholetras: jtimberman: as far as u can please  have a look at what i have recently have written about users cookbook ^^
[2013-10-09 11:05:20 -0400] legal90: Thank you, guys. I've understood how to use bata bugs. I just want to know what do json files on the top level of 'data_bags' folder mean. Is it invalid info in the opscode document?
[2013-10-09 11:06:10 -0400] legal90: ./data_bags/global_shell_settings.json   - is it unusable?
[2013-10-09 11:06:22 -0400] ocholetras: umm
[2013-10-09 11:06:33 -0400] ocholetras: afaik json files goes inside subfolders on data_bag
[2013-10-09 11:06:36 -0400] Afterglow: personally I think its wrong but I wouldn't swear to it
[2013-10-09 11:06:38 -0400] ocholetras: data_bags folder
[2013-10-09 11:07:34 -0400] legal90: This 'issue' stills in old documenation too https://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef10/Data+Bags
[2013-10-09 11:08:10 -0400] legal90: Quote: "The "standard_packages" and "global_shell_settings" are things that might be under a "common" bag or whatever makes sense to you for grouping."
[2013-10-09 11:08:38 -0400] legal90: It stucks me )
[2013-10-09 11:08:55 -0400] Afterglow: its either wrong or very badly worded i'll create an issue for it
[2013-10-09 11:09:56 -0400] legal90: Ok, thanks
[2013-10-09 11:14:48 -0400] Afterglow: legal90: https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4604 fyi
[2013-10-09 11:16:15 -0400] legal90: Good. I'm watching it
[2013-10-09 11:55:41 -0400] wlll: So it looks like if chef-client hits the server presenting anything other than the configured hostname it gets redirected, is there any way of stopping that? It's causing problems with port-forwarding & running chef on external servers
[2013-10-09 12:42:49 -0400] ocholetras: anyone knows if ther is a time between you import a data baga
[2013-10-09 12:42:55 -0400] ocholetras: and server knows it is there?
[2013-10-09 12:43:23 -0400] ocholetras: i have launched chef-client o a node just secs after i have uploaded a new databag and nothing happens
[2013-10-09 12:43:28 -0400] ocholetras: after a while..
[2013-10-09 12:43:32 -0400] ocholetras: it detects the new data
[2013-10-09 12:43:33 -0400] ocholetras: O_o
[2013-10-09 12:52:05 -0400] legal90: New question: is it possible to encrypt data bag placed on local machine, not a chef-server? It looks like 'knife' works only with chef-server-based storage of data bags :(
[2013-10-09 12:52:18 -0400] fishGoM00: Can someone lend a clue with the filter override attributes for logstash?
[2013-10-09 12:52:35 -0400] fishGoM00: I assumed something like the following would update shipper.conf
[2013-10-09 12:52:37 -0400] fishGoM00:         "filters": [
[2013-10-09 12:52:37 -0400] fishGoM00:           {
[2013-10-09 12:52:38 -0400] fishGoM00:             "grok": {
[2013-10-09 12:52:38 -0400] fishGoM00:               "pattern": "%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}",
[2013-10-09 12:52:38 -0400] fishGoM00:               "type": "apache-access"
[2013-10-09 12:52:38 -0400] fishGoM00:             }
[2013-10-09 12:52:38 -0400] fishGoM00:           }
[2013-10-09 12:52:39 -0400] fishGoM00:         ],
[2013-10-09 12:52:52 -0400] fishGoM00: but it doesn't :/
[2013-10-09 12:56:47 -0400] legal90: chef-solo users: how do you make data bags encrypted?
[2013-10-09 13:03:41 -0400] ocholetras: legal90  http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html#encrypt-a-data-bag
[2013-10-09 13:03:48 -0400] ocholetras: have a look at the docs
[2013-10-09 13:03:48 -0400] ocholetras: ;)
[2013-10-09 13:04:04 -0400] ocholetras: chef-solo lacks of some functionality
[2013-10-09 13:04:15 -0400] ocholetras: yo cant do all you can with chef-server
[2013-10-09 13:05:41 -0400] legal90: ok, i get it. Really it is easier to create data bags using knife (on server) and then use these bags by chef-solo
[2013-10-09 13:06:42 -0400] legal90: (i'm using chef-solo because I'm working with Vagrant)
[2013-10-09 13:08:34 -0400] workmad3: ocholetras: from what I've heard, chef 11.6 allows chef-solo to do pretty much everything
[2013-10-09 13:08:39 -0400] workmad3: ocholetras: even searches of a form
[2013-10-09 13:09:09 -0400] ocholetras: that is great!
[2013-10-09 13:09:38 -0400] workmad3: I'm not confident on that btw... I've not looked @ or attempted it in any way
[2013-10-09 13:09:46 -0400] ocholetras: may be you can also encrypt data bags
[2013-10-09 13:09:48 -0400] workmad3: but I was informed in here recentlyish that it was possible :)
[2013-10-09 13:10:00 -0400] workmad3: yeah, you can use encrypted data bags in chef-solo, I believe
[2013-10-09 13:10:25 -0400] workmad3: seeing as encrypted data bags are just a wrapper around normal data bags, and you can use them fine
[2013-10-09 13:10:42 -0400] workmad3: you just need to get the secret there, and then go through the normal hoops for decrypting the data
[2013-10-09 13:10:42 -0400] ocholetras: and where the hell data bags are saved on chef solo?
[2013-10-09 13:10:43 -0400] ocholetras: O_o
[2013-10-09 13:10:58 -0400] ocholetras: on chef-server they are on the database
[2013-10-09 13:11:03 -0400] workmad3: ocholetras: in the data_bags_path directory (which looks like the directory structure in a chef-repo) ;)
[2013-10-09 13:11:12 -0400] ocholetras: okay
[2013-10-09 13:11:17 -0400] ocholetras: so chef-solo reads the dir
[2013-10-09 13:11:25 -0400] workmad3: yup, and loads in the json
[2013-10-09 13:11:28 -0400] ocholetras: you dont need to do de tedious "from file"
[2013-10-09 13:11:28 -0400] ocholetras: Xd
[2013-10-09 13:11:51 -0400] workmad3: you need to get the data bags to the node... but that's hardly strenuous :)
[2013-10-09 13:12:31 -0400] ocholetras: great news for testing scenarios!
[2013-10-09 13:12:44 -0400] workmad3: ocholetras: that's been true since 0.10.4
[2013-10-09 13:14:29 -0400] ocholetras: yea but now a little more  :P
[2013-10-09 13:15:39 -0400] workmad3: I think you can set the data_bags_path in vagrant too ;)
[2013-10-09 13:15:51 -0400] workmad3: which makes getting them there even less strenuous
[2013-10-09 13:27:55 -0400] ocholetras: anyone had used the users cookbook?
[2013-10-09 13:44:07 -0400] ocholetras: wowho

[2013-10-09 14:22:42 -0400] jameslegg: I assume because of: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/oh-hai
[2013-10-09 14:24:13 -0400] fishGoM00: Can someone lend a clue with the input/filter override attributes for logstash?
[2013-10-09 14:24:35 -0400] fishGoM00: Just need the syntax for the array I think
[2013-10-09 14:34:14 -0400] mmzyk: simonvc, jameslegg is right. Very early chef made use of memes. Some of it has stuck around.
[2013-10-09 14:34:45 -0400] stevedb: is there a way to use variables in an attribute file? i.e., default['software']['version'= ] 1.xx and then have the rest of the variables in the file reference it?

[2013-10-09 15:06:16 -0400] v-yarotsky: Hi all! Does anyone know if it's actually possible to notify a resource based on a command output without resorting to custom LWRP? My best guess is to use a ruby_block and try set updated_by_last_resource, but it uses #converge_by internally, which effectively prevents me from doing that trick. Any thoughts?
[2013-10-09 15:06:41 -0400] v-yarotsky: thanks in advance

[2013-10-09 15:31:42 -0400] jmartin: have a possible lead right now
[2013-10-09 15:31:51 -0400] fak3r: have an example of a cookbook installing a rpm/deb that's not in a repo? So an app we need in corp network, that need to install from a package
[2013-10-09 15:32:35 -0400] pabst^: So is there a way to tell chef-client to kill itself if there is already a chef-client running? Instead of queuing up?
[2013-10-09 15:36:28 -0400] jmartin: it seems ohai isnt reading out of the default custom plugins dir

[2013-10-09 16:03:36 -0400] fak3r: pabst^: are you on CentOS? I posted to the mailing list last week about it, leaving it to run on its own caused them to queue up 76 chef-client processes and cause OOM errors :(
[2013-10-09 16:12:00 -0400] benjohnson77: jmartin: I think I am having the exact some problem
[2013-10-09 16:13:55 -0400] jmartin: benjohnson77: i think its perhaps an issue with ordering
[2013-10-09 16:14:06 -0400] jmartin: because i just ran chef-client again....and now my attrs are showing up
[2013-10-09 16:14:34 -0400] benjohnson77: jmartin: I put ohai first in the run list.
[2013-10-09 16:15:04 -0400] jmartin: benjohnson77: right, as did i, but i think maybe we need an ohai reload in there somewhere
[2013-10-09 16:17:17 -0400] jmartin: im running another test atm
[2013-10-09 16:20:21 -0400] awayne: hello all
[2013-10-09 16:20:53 -0400] troyready: ohai!
[2013-10-09 16:21:05 -0400] gchristensen: ohai :(
[2013-10-09 16:21:20 -0400] jmartin: ohai
[2013-10-09 16:21:25 -0400] awayne: ping .... pong.
[2013-10-09 16:22:03 -0400] awayne: anyone else received 'Use RbConfig instead of obsolete and deprecated Config' ? i just installed a new chef server and windows node and it receives this during first boot run.
[2013-10-09 16:37:52 -0400] jmartin: jmickle: you wouldnt happen to be familiar with ohai plugins would you?
[2013-10-09 16:38:05 -0400] jmickle: not a lot whats up?
[2013-10-09 16:38:22 -0400] jmartin: seems the plugin im loading doesnt work until a second chef-client run?
[2013-10-09 16:38:31 -0400] jmartin: even though i am reloading ohai at the beginning
[2013-10-09 16:38:37 -0400] jmartin: or i believe that i am
[2013-10-09 16:39:22 -0400] gchristensen: jmartin: can you paste your ecipe?
[2013-10-09 16:39:37 -0400] jmartin: gchristensen: ja, got a gist, https://gist.github.com/hugespoon/fe2a6e28c4823e5cb92c
[2013-10-09 16:40:11 -0400] jmartin: that recipe is second in my node run_list after chef-client::config (to set the plugins dir)
[2013-10-09 16:42:47 -0400] jmickle: jmartin: i think the template definition should come before your ohai reload
[2013-10-09 16:43:18 -0400] jmickle: jmartin: move https://gist.github.com/hugespoon/fe2a6e28c4823e5cb92c#file-ohai_plugin-rb-L2-L5 to the bottom of the file
[2013-10-09 16:43:28 -0400] jmartin: ill give it a whirl
[2013-10-09 16:43:31 -0400] jmickle: I'm not sure it will do anything but I've seen some tricky stuff with services before
[2013-10-09 16:43:43 -0400] jmickle: and moving service definitions to the very end fixed it
[2013-10-09 16:44:18 -0400] jmickle: something related to the processing order of the restart
[2013-10-09 16:49:10 -0400] jmartin: jmickle: same deal it seems
[2013-10-09 16:49:59 -0400] jmickle: jmartin: is it actually processing the restart and template?
[2013-10-09 16:50:04 -0400] jmickle: try running with -VV
[2013-10-09 16:50:12 -0400] jmickle: and watching the output
[2013-10-09 16:50:13 -0400] jmartin: jmickle: yes, it does
[2013-10-09 16:50:28 -0400] jmartin: its on bootstrap im testing if that makes any difference?
[2013-10-09 16:51:26 -0400] jmartin: jmickle: it seems to actually null out the 'network' attrs the first time
[2013-10-09 16:51:31 -0400] jmartin: and the second run it fills everything back in
[2013-10-09 16:51:42 -0400] jmickle: yeah it seems like its not picking up data properly
[2013-10-09 16:51:53 -0400] jmickle: processing order?
[2013-10-09 16:54:13 -0400] jmickle: jmartin: really weird I'm not sure i have not hopped into the ohai plugins repo yet so i don't know much about the code base
[2013-10-09 16:54:20 -0400] jmartin: yeah, it might be because im setting the client config for the custom plugins on the same runs?
[2013-10-09 16:54:47 -0400] jmartin: i.e. using chef-client::config, then doing the custom plugin after that
[2013-10-09 16:54:54 -0400] jmartin: in the same run
[2013-10-09 16:55:33 -0400] jmickle: possible
[2013-10-09 16:55:44 -0400] jmickle: my plugins specialty right now is knife
[2013-10-09 16:55:45 -0400] jmickle: :-P
[2013-10-09 16:55:50 -0400] jmickle: so one of the other guys might be better than i would
[2013-10-09 16:55:53 -0400] jmickle: to tell you
[2013-10-09 16:57:09 -0400] jmartin: yeah, im doing a test run of just the chef-client::config then doing the ohai plugin after that
[2013-10-09 16:57:16 -0400] jmartin: in a second run
[2013-10-09 16:57:18 -0400] jmartin: see if it works
[2013-10-09 17:01:16 -0400] jmartin: hrm that didnt do it either
[2013-10-09 17:06:36 -0400] pigram86: anyone running chef on windows
[2013-10-09 17:07:15 -0400] pigram86: has anyone gotten the reboot handler to work on w2012
[2013-10-09 17:09:09 -0400] aslaen: Hello, anyone in here from opscode?  I have a managed chef account with an organization, but I just got an error "Organization not found"
[2013-10-09 17:13:43 -0400] cwj: aslaen: if you cant raise anyone on irc, i think emailing support@opscode.com is the most direct way to get help with hosted chef
[2013-10-09 17:13:45 -0400] cwj: fwiw
[2013-10-09 17:13:54 -0400] aslaen: ok great thank you!
[2013-10-09 17:19:48 -0400] rgsteele: Hm... can anybody else spot why this knife query results in "ERROR: ArgumentError: Type must be a string or a symbol!": knife search node 'recipes:snmp AND recipes:ohai'
[2013-10-09 17:20:37 -0400] rgsteele: Using a single query term (such as 'recipes:snmp') works perfectly fine, and the 'knife help search' documentation on the node from which I'm issuing the query says the AND operator is supported.
[2013-10-09 17:28:08 -0400] daveops: rgsteele: try a lowercase 'and'; i forget the exact issue but i've seen cases where one works and the other doesn't.
[2013-10-09 17:32:19 -0400] pigram86: can Chef handle multiple reboots within a single run?
[2013-10-09 17:32:51 -0400] gchristensen: pigram86: reboots of what? reboots of the popular television series Arrested Development? of the host machine? of the chef-client?
[2013-10-09 17:34:11 -0400] pigram86: I have a run that installs RDS-RD-Server and DesktopExperience on w2k8r2 through powershell and both need to reboot
[2013-10-09 17:35:31 -0400] gchristensen: pigram86: you mean with a notify statement?
[2013-10-09 17:36:27 -0400] pigram86: yes
[2013-10-09 17:36:50 -0400] gchristensen: you can, but you have to notify :immediately
[2013-10-09 17:37:32 -0400] pigram86: thanks. I will try that. I am really new to chef.
[2013-10-09 17:37:52 -0400] gchristensen: pigram86: http://docs.opscode.com/chef/resources.html#notifications-timers
[2013-10-09 17:40:27 -0400] pigram86: gchristensen: that will work with windows cookbook?
[2013-10-09 17:40:51 -0400] gchristensen: you'll have to find out :) I'm all thumbs when it comes to windows
[2013-10-09 17:41:06 -0400] pigram86: lol
[2013-10-09 17:41:59 -0400] sfalcon: daveops rgsteele: pretty sure AND is needed. The syntax example you gave works for me in knife hmm
[2013-10-09 17:42:56 -0400] jmartin: gchristensen: don't happen to have any further ideas about that ohai plugin thing or is what im seeing expected?
[2013-10-09 17:43:10 -0400] gchristensen: jmartin: unfortunately not, I don't seem to have that issue
[2013-10-09 17:43:20 -0400] gchristensen: though why-run and new ohai plugins can provide odd behaviour :)
[2013-10-09 17:44:05 -0400] jmartin: gchristensen: yeah, its entirely possible that its working correctly, im just not using it properly
[2013-10-09 17:46:16 -0400] daveops: sfalcon rgsteele: that knife command worked for me as well. weird.
[2013-10-09 17:52:21 -0400] rgsteele: daveops: I think it must be the version of knife on that particular machine
[2013-10-09 17:52:31 -0400] rgsteele: I tried it on another and it worked fine.
[2013-10-09 17:54:12 -0400] tevren: hi guys, im writing a knife plugin and i want to write tests that mock chef-search and node/client delete actions. i dont know how to get started though. any pointers?
[2013-10-09 17:57:28 -0400] wildahunden: has anybody worked with the community glassfish cookbook?
[2013-10-09 17:59:38 -0400] wildahunden: seems like this channel isn't very active today
[2013-10-09 18:12:30 -0400] douglaswth: (wildahunden): well, it wasn't while you were here which wasn't very long ;P
[2013-10-09 18:16:25 -0400] lbragstad: Hey all, quick question. I am using the Jenkins cookbook with Fedora to set up a jenkins slave but I'm getting a Error Resolving Cookbooks for Run List:. I used berks to upload the jenkins cookbook. Before I run jenkins::node I'm running yum::epel. Any ideas why I'm getting a run list error?
[2013-10-09 18:42:11 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: right the username client you created with knife configure -i should be an admin ... it's what you will use when running knife commands ... the client used by chef-client for a node's run typically should not be an admin client
[2013-10-09 18:42:35 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: do you have any other questions or are you all set now?
[2013-10-09 18:53:29 -0400] EricL: In the file resource, if I use the action :create_if_missing and I specify the content attribute, will the string specified in content overwrite the file if it's already there?
[2013-10-09 18:56:26 -0400] tevren: i don't think so as the file already exists
[2013-10-09 18:57:41 -0400] EricL: I didn't know if :create_if_missing acts similarly to a not_if in this case.
[2013-10-09 18:58:41 -0400] tevren: just checked docs: :create_if_missing Use to create a file only if the file does not already exist. (When the file exists, nothing happens.)
[2013-10-09 18:59:08 -0400] EricL: Right, I read that too.  Bu tI didn't know if the content still updates.
[2013-10-09 18:59:20 -0400] mattupstate: is there a defacto method of bootstrapping a node locally if you have the validator 'n such on the  machine?
[2013-10-09 19:00:23 -0400] tevren: @EricL it'll never reach the point where it decides whether or not to update content
[2013-10-09 19:00:45 -0400] EricL: tevren: Ok, thanks.

[2013-10-09 19:14:03 -0400] dkwilson: btw, figured out my problem with users cookbook. https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/users/commit/29b1b9a https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-3744 lead me to believe you could use the "manage" action ...
[2013-10-09 19:15:53 -0400] dkwilson: and since manage will " will do nothing if the user does not exist." (http://docs.opscode.com/resource_user.html) I expected to chef run to succeed and do nothing if I set action to "manage" in the user data bag item.
[2013-10-09 19:16:48 -0400] dkwilson: but that doesn't work ... since the users cookbook does several things other than just create/remove accounts
[2013-10-09 19:18:53 -0400] dkwilson: so, if the user doesn't exist on the node yet, you're using the users cookbook, and you have action of "manage" in the data bag item, chef-client barfs when it tries to create #home_dir/.ssh, etc.
[2013-10-09 19:21:01 -0400] dkwilson: instead, I'm not using "manage." instead, I just disable the account by modifying the data bag item like so: 1) remove any ssh-keys values 2) change shell value to /bin/true 3) modify the comment value to specify account disabled 4) add a bang to front of password value to lock it
[2013-10-09 19:21:16 -0400] dkwilson: anyone have another suggestion?
[2013-10-09 19:22:03 -0400] dkwilson: this is all 'cause we don't want to "remove" accounts, to avoid potential of re-using uidNumbers in future
[2013-10-09 19:23:05 -0400] joelteon: starting this week, I'm getting this when provisioning VMs. look familiar to anyone? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d36c3f518c98bfb4e1aa
[2013-10-09 19:28:43 -0400] lbragstad: Think I found the problem, looks like the jenkins cookbook has conflicting versions of the yum cookbook http://paste.openstack.org/show/48152/
[2013-10-09 19:37:31 -0400] jstallard: How can I exit out of an action early, in an lwrp? I tried return, but I'm getting "LocalJumpError: unexpected return"
[2013-10-09 19:43:55 -0400] jstallard: nm, the next keyword did the trick

[2013-10-09 20:42:39 -0400] azret: DAE have a problem using strings instead of symbols to define the root password for mysql using chef_solo and vagrant?
[2013-10-09 20:42:47 -0400] azret: for some odd reason it keeps passing a nil password
[2013-10-09 20:43:48 -0400] gazarsgo: are you using -h localhost or -h 127.0.0.1 ?
[2013-10-09 20:43:56 -0400] azret: localhost
[2013-10-09 20:44:40 -0400] azret:   connection {:host=>"localhost", :username=>"root", :password=>nil}
[2013-10-09 20:44:57 -0400] azret: but the password is set to node[:mysql][:server_root_password]

[2013-10-09 20:56:34 -0400] jmartin: sfalcon: wouldnt happen to be an ohai plugins guru as well would ya ? :D
[2013-10-09 20:56:35 -0400] dysinger: sfalcon: you guys are awesome thanks for your efforts. /cc sethvargo
[2013-10-09 20:57:26 -0400] sfalcon: dysinger: the fast turnaround was all sethvargo.
[2013-10-09 20:57:45 -0400] sfalcon: We'll rework the patch so to re-enable local search caching
[2013-10-09 20:57:59 -0400] sfalcon: jmartin: I'm not your best bet for ohai plugin details.
[2013-10-09 20:58:24 -0400] jmickle: sfalcon: you around?
[2013-10-09 20:58:29 -0400] jmickle: found a bug in chef thats causing a major blocker
[2013-10-09 20:59:33 -0400] sfalcon: jmickle: stepping into a mtg now. create a CHEF ticket?
[2013-10-09 20:59:49 -0400] jmickle: i can but i need some help tracing down where its at for the ticket
[2013-10-09 20:59:56 -0400] jmickle: environments are not being processed on latest version of knife
[2013-10-09 21:00:08 -0400] jmickle: the query for pattern matching doesn't pick up /environments
[2013-10-09 21:03:29 -0400] spicy: is there an easy way to assign a cloudwatch alarm on bootstrap of an instance using knife ec2?
[2013-10-09 21:04:34 -0400] gchristensen: spicy: may I recommend you instead use nagios or something similar?
[2013-10-09 21:05:14 -0400] spicy: gchristensen: not actually for doing monitoring per say, we want to shut down instances based on inactivity
[2013-10-09 21:05:20 -0400] gchristensen: oh interesting
[2013-10-09 21:06:25 -0400] azret: so anyone on the whole password=>nil thing with vagrant even though the attributes/default.rb file is set to indicate the server_root_password in the Vagrantfile using chef-solo
[2013-10-09 21:08:46 -0400] volker-: how can I make sure that 'apt-get update' runs before any 'package' command? I did an 'include_recipe "apt::default"' before the pkg command, but somehow that is still delayed
[2013-10-09 21:09:38 -0400] lionel__: azret: pretty sure that chef solo recommends using data bags to define the database credentials. https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql mentions it at the bottom of the read me file.
[2013-10-09 21:11:08 -0400] azret: lionel__, thats how i did it
[2013-10-09 21:12:07 -0400] azret: wtf
[2013-10-09 21:12:08 -0400] azret: now it worked

[2013-10-09 21:52:32 -0400] michaelglass: hi.  So I'm wrapping a recipe.  Do I modify attributes of the wrapped recipe in the wrapping recipe or in an associated attributes file?  Will default attributes in that attributes file take precedence over the wrapped (include_recipe'd) recipe's attributes?
[2013-10-09 21:53:35 -0400] michaelglass: do I put my changed attribute in wrapper/attributes/my_mysql.rb#{default or override} or wrapper/recipes/my_mysql.rb#{default or override} ?
[2013-10-09 22:34:48 -0400] stormerider: gchristensen: looks like i'll need to update my fork to match the new nagios version timsmith rolled out (5.0.0)

[2013-10-09 22:42:23 -0400] stormerider: that and still banging my head against getting escalations working, ugh. apparently the way i've done them before is not the way that the cookbook is designed for (using wildcards on hostgroup/service description to apply global warning / error escalations to all services)
[2013-10-09 22:43:39 -0400] timsmith: that functionality would be really handy
[2013-10-09 22:45:59 -0400] stormerider: so far i've found that i need to add "hostgroup_name service_description" to the conf section at the bottom of contacts.cfg.erb via rewind, but im not finding them firing on the right timing. if i sort it out i'll definitely kick it back upstream :)
[2013-10-09 23:10:14 -0400] freezey: it appears i have ohai not putting network info into the ui but when you run it manually it generated fine
[2013-10-09 23:16:11 -0400] stormerider: aha. so the other problem with escalations is that they're only definable as templates the way the contacts.cfg.erb is defined now.
[2013-10-09 23:20:49 -0400] joe_____: hi
[2013-10-09 23:22:10 -0400] joe_____: hi I've got NameError Cannot find a resource for registry_key on windows version 6.0.6002, is there somebody who can help im using chef-client 10.16.2
[2013-10-09 23:35:12 -0400] stormerider: timsmith1: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nagios/pull/207 :)
[2013-10-09 23:37:45 -0400] timsmith1: mark the ticket
[2013-10-09 23:37:47 -0400] timsmith1: we'll look at it
[2013-10-09 23:46:11 -0400] stormerider: did so, thanks.
[2013-10-09 23:47:12 -0400] stormerider: was actually simpler than i thought, all in the template, but i added a bit of info to the README to describe how to use it that way, too
[2013-10-09 23:52:20 -0400] joe_____: hi I've got NameError Cannot find a resource for registry_key on windows version 6.0.6002, is there somebody who can help im using chef-client 10.16.2
[2013-10-09 23:55:52 -0400] stormerider: sorry, haven't seen that on my windows boxes, joe_____, but i havent done too much with chef+windows yet
[2013-10-09 23:56:35 -0400] troyready: Not a helpful answer, but I'd try upgrading the client
[2013-10-09 23:56:51 -0400] troyready: And confirm that the issue persists (or doesn't)
[2013-10-09 23:56:55 -0400] joe_____: thanks stormerider, basically im inserting a key on registry
[2013-10-09 23:57:24 -0400] troyready: Wait, 'can't find a resource'?
[2013-10-09 23:57:39 -0400] joe_____: it seems that it does not recognized the resource registry_key
[2013-10-09 23:57:50 -0400] joe_____: am i missing something.
[2013-10-09 23:57:53 -0400] troyready: Sounds like the cookbook that's calling it is missing the 'depends registry' line?
[2013-10-09 23:58:14 -0400] troyready: Errrr, disregard that
[2013-10-09 23:58:17 -0400] troyready: That was crazy talk
[2013-10-09 23:58:22 -0400] joe_____: yeah I dont have that.
[2013-10-09 23:58:30 -0400] joe_____: i give it a try.
[2013-10-09 23:59:10 -0400] stormerider: i dont think registry is it's own cookbook, but perhaps "depends windows"?
[2013-10-09 23:59:37 -0400] troyready: joe_____, Don't try that, I was wrong
[2013-10-09 23:59:56 -0400] joe_____: i already have that on my metadata.rb, still having the error "depends windows"
