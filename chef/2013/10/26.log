[2013-10-26 00:49:31 -0400] andrewdeandrade: Anyone else here having problems with `knife ec2 server create` where is hangs randomly at some point when installing build-essential? It's pretty unpredictable. Sometimes it dies on build-essential, sometimes on some sub-part like flex.
[2013-10-26 00:59:16 -0400] andrewdeandrade: FWIW this is happening on two different roles when processing the specific recipes they don't have in common

[2013-10-26 02:24:04 -0400] stormerider: johncolombia: in general, people prefer if you link to something like https://gist.github.com/ instead of directly pasting to the channel, fyi
[2013-10-26 02:37:06 -0400] johncolombia: thanks a lot ;)
[2013-10-26 02:37:26 -0400] johncolombia: btw, thanks for your support again. Problem solved
[2013-10-26 07:36:34 -0400] mc_fail: hi guys, when i executing a "knife node show mynode" a i get a options list that contains a "Roles" attribute, but i can't get what it's attribute means, if i add some roles(for example via web-gui) knife node show shows "roles" in a a "Run Listt attribute"
[2013-10-26 07:36:39 -0400] mc_fail: why?
[2013-10-26 07:36:50 -0400] mc_fail: and what are "Roles" Means?
[2013-10-26 07:38:30 -0400] mc_fail: it looks like it's just attribute that collected from server, but how chef determinate it?
[2013-10-26 07:40:38 -0400] slicknick: mc_fail: when you create a node it should assigned a role
[2013-10-26 07:42:21 -0400] mc_fail: slicknick doe sit possible assign it manualy?
[2013-10-26 07:42:29 -0400] mc_fail: *does it
[2013-10-26 07:43:56 -0400] slicknick: not 100% sure assigning it a role is required, but im pretty sure one is ..
[2013-10-26 07:44:01 -0400] slicknick: why dont you just try it
[2013-10-26 07:44:25 -0400] slicknick: probably gets a 'default' value er something
[2013-10-26 07:45:30 -0400] mc_fail: slicknick i can't try becuase i just don't know how, it's my first chef expiritence)))
[2013-10-26 07:46:10 -0400] mc_fail: anyway thank you, i thought this parameter doesn't so important for management
[2013-10-26 07:46:30 -0400] slicknick: plenty of reading ahead of you i predict
[2013-10-26 07:49:12 -0400] slicknick: its importance to you depends on how much you want to get out of chef
[2013-10-26 07:49:57 -0400] slicknick: at least, thats what i think .. but im still figuring all this out myself
[2013-10-26 08:30:35 -0400] mc_fail: anyway thank you, i thought this parameter doesn't so important for management
[2013-10-26 08:44:26 -0400] Cope: ohai
[2013-10-26 08:45:12 -0400] stormerider: im pretty sure you can just assign recipes to a runlist if you want, you dont have to use roles
[2013-10-26 08:45:35 -0400] stormerider: they're just easy to conflate a recipe set together
[2013-10-26 08:47:53 -0400] slicknick: not sure what you mean by that easy conflate recipe together -- sounds kinda weird heh
[2013-10-26 08:51:10 -0400] slicknick: so a role doesnt have to be assigned? .. but is a recipe required?   -- surely this is doc'd somewhere
[2013-10-26 08:54:39 -0400] stormerider: you need something in your run list, or you're doing nothing.
[2013-10-26 08:54:49 -0400] stormerider: a run list can contain roles or recipes
[2013-10-26 08:55:25 -0400] stormerider: if you want to use roles, you can have a role include multiple roles/recipes so you can just assign one on the individual node
[2013-10-26 08:55:44 -0400] stormerider: or you can assign recipes directly to the node
[2013-10-26 08:58:12 -0400] Cope: slicknick: a run list is just a list of the recipes to run on your node
[2013-10-26 08:58:31 -0400] Cope: you can use roles as a container to group together machines of a similar sort
[2013-10-26 08:58:39 -0400] Cope: and optionally set the way they behave
[2013-10-26 08:58:46 -0400] stormerider: what Cope said
[2013-10-26 08:59:09 -0400] stormerider: sorry, on a conference call doing a load stress test with compuware
[2013-10-26 09:00:22 -0400] slicknick: ok ok, thanks for putting it in other words .. not let me try
[2013-10-26 09:01:22 -0400] slicknick: different way of saying it: the run list must contain a recipe, can contain a role, and can have both
[2013-10-26 09:01:30 -0400] slicknick: is there a diagram / picture that ive yet to run across? like boxes within boxes
[2013-10-26 09:01:58 -0400] stormerider: slicknick: well you can have a run list that contains just a role
[2013-10-26 09:02:19 -0400] stormerider: a run list should contain either one or more of roles and/or recipes
[2013-10-26 09:02:24 -0400] slicknick: i know its not difficult -- just need to immerse myself in all this on a more regular basis
[2013-10-26 09:02:32 -0400] stormerider: an empty run list is a no_op
[2013-10-26 09:03:00 -0400] slicknick: sorry, i forgot the OR in there after 'contain a recipe'
[2013-10-26 09:03:13 -0400] stormerider: *nod*
[2013-10-26 09:03:16 -0400] slicknick: coo, coo thanks
[2013-10-26 09:03:22 -0400] stormerider: just wanted to make sure you understood :)
[2013-10-26 09:03:31 -0400] slicknick: much appreciated
[2013-10-26 09:04:00 -0400] stormerider: the guide i found most handy was https://leanpub.com/chef-survival-guide, but the wiki / docs site is also pretty damn good
[2013-10-26 09:04:03 -0400] slicknick: its time for me to get squirrley with chef
[2013-10-26 09:04:39 -0400] slicknick: got jenkinss, git, couple CMS sites .. bout to get wild!
[2013-10-26 09:04:51 -0400] stormerider: as always feel free to ask more specific questions once you dive in, and if folks arent responding on irc, which happens sometimes when folks are busy and/or dont know the specific answer, take it to the mailing list
[2013-10-26 09:05:48 -0400] slicknick: right on. been a while since ive been an idler .. but just may be what i need ;)
[2013-10-26 09:06:26 -0400] slicknick: while i have your attention then ...
[2013-10-26 09:07:16 -0400] mc_fail: so, i installed a chef server, adeed a node,, installed coockbock from site, and ssigned recipe to node, so, how i can initiate recipe processing?
[2013-10-26 09:07:35 -0400] jbz: mc_fail: is the chef client running on the node?
[2013-10-26 09:07:54 -0400] jbz: The chef-client has to run.  Most folks either set it up as a service, or set up a cron job to run it.
[2013-10-26 09:07:59 -0400] mc_fail: jbz don't shure
[2013-10-26 09:08:09 -0400] mc_fail: *sure
[2013-10-26 09:08:14 -0400] jbz: If you just want to test things, you can run it manually - log in to the node as root, run chef-client
[2013-10-26 09:08:32 -0400] jbz: chef is entirely 'pull based' so the client must initiate all runs.
[2013-10-26 09:08:45 -0400] jbz: (client being the node to be managed)
[2013-10-26 09:09:17 -0400] slicknick: id like your opinion on managing a LAMP stack via chef.  currently we compile from source due to needed very specific versions for a myriad of reasons ..  i think i saw apache versions can be chosen, but what about things like php fpm with all the fast cgi modules, etc.   also have redis to think about
[2013-10-26 09:09:28 -0400] mc_fail: hmm, and for soma automation i need put it in cron or systenmd timer?
[2013-10-26 09:10:12 -0400] mc_fail: *some
[2013-10-26 09:10:49 -0400] slicknick: jbz: node and client are also things im having a bit of trouble digesting
[2013-10-26 09:10:51 -0400] stormerider: mc_fail: the chef-client cookbook will let you control the chef client via init, runit, or cron (possibly others, but those are the three i know of)
[2013-10-26 09:11:00 -0400] slicknick: not chocking thankfully, just cant quite stomach em
[2013-10-26 09:11:12 -0400] slicknick: s/cocking/choking
[2013-10-26 09:11:20 -0400] stormerider: or you can just run it manually when you want to push things out if you want
[2013-10-26 09:11:21 -0400] slicknick: heh!
[2013-10-26 09:11:33 -0400] stormerider: all up to how you want to do things
[2013-10-26 09:17:01 -0400] mc_fail: how does a chief-client contacting with a chief-server?
[2013-10-26 09:17:25 -0400] mc_fail: it connects to some special port?
[2013-10-26 09:17:32 -0400] slicknick: i bet you can find it here http://wiki.opscode.com
[2013-10-26 09:18:27 -0400] slicknick: or here http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_nodes.html#the-chef-client-run
[2013-10-26 09:19:38 -0400] mc_fail: mc_fail thank you
[2013-10-26 14:18:50 -0400] Guest32234: anyone successfully ran graphite cookbook?
[2013-10-26 15:02:06 -0400] glen: how can i make solr listen other than localhost?
[2013-10-26 15:09:44 -0400] Cope: glen: are you using a solr cookbook? have you read the README?
[2013-10-26 15:10:23 -0400] glen: Cope: no, not solr cookbook. solr for chef-server itself
[2013-10-26 15:15:35 -0400] Cope: glen: how did you install the chef server?
[2013-10-26 15:17:03 -0400] glen: Cope: built myself with omnisomething
[2013-10-26 15:17:40 -0400] glen: i found some jetty config, but can't find what do i change there, the forums, etc solutions do not work
[2013-10-26 15:17:57 -0400] glen: /opt/chef-server/embedded/service/chef-solr/jetty/etc/jetty.xml
[2013-10-26 15:18:05 -0400] Cope: glen: I'd recommend using the Opscode package; or the chef-solo method.
[2013-10-26 15:18:32 -0400] glen: whatt???
[2013-10-26 15:18:42 -0400] glen: how any of that fixes what address solr binds to?
[2013-10-26 15:18:57 -0400] glen: chef-solo doesn't even have solr
[2013-10-26 15:19:17 -0400] glen: and even i install opscode package, the same problem will came up: how do i change listen address!
[2013-10-26 15:19:34 -0400] Cope: glen: because, with the greatest of respect, if you don't know how to configure solr, you might be better off using a pre-packaged system, or one engineered by someone who knows what they are doing.
[2013-10-26 15:19:52 -0400] glen: i never said solr is not working!
[2013-10-26 15:20:06 -0400] glen: i want solr to be available on public port, not localhost
[2013-10-26 15:20:12 -0400] Cope: my apologies, I'm making the assumption that you are having issues with the way solr is interacting as part of your chef server setup.
[2013-10-26 15:20:47 -0400] Cope: glen: why do you want to expose solr publically?
[2013-10-26 15:20:50 -0400] glen: i tried such ones, none seemed to have effect:
[2013-10-26 15:20:51 -0400] glen:             <Set name="host"><SystemProperty name="jetty.host" default="0.0.0.0"/></Set>
[2013-10-26 15:20:54 -0400] glen:             <Set name="host"><Property name="jetty.host" default="0.0.0.0"/></Set>
[2013-10-26 15:20:57 -0400] glen:             <Set name="host">0.0.0.0</Set>
[2013-10-26 15:21:06 -0400] dmdeklerk: Good day cheffers, i've been reading up on using test-kitchen with a multi-vm setup. What would you currently advise to do this. Vagabond or the new Chef zero provisioner. Or something completely different.
[2013-10-26 15:21:29 -0400] glen: Cope: various reasons, want to access solr via other means than chef, also to setup replication elsewhere
[2013-10-26 15:21:59 -0400] Cope: dmdeklerk: depends what you're trying to do... I've not done much work on it recently, but will be adding stuff, but leibniz is designed for this sort of thing.
[2013-10-26 15:22:33 -0400] Cope: dmdeklerk: to be clear, test-kitchen is deisgned, explictly, to test individual cookbooks
[2013-10-26 15:22:50 -0400] glen: Cope: i've used solr via tomcat, but chef uses jetty, never used jetty really here
[2013-10-26 15:22:54 -0400] dmdeklerk: Cope: Yes I have just read that in a ticket on test-kitchen
[2013-10-26 15:23:09 -0400] Cope: dmdeklerk: so to test in multivm ways, ie perhaps to test a wrapper cookbook that sets up a db and a webserver
[2013-10-26 15:23:22 -0400] Cope: dmdeklerk: you need to orchestrate test-kitchen exterally
[2013-10-26 15:23:44 -0400] dmdeklerk: Cope: meaning minitest-handler and running vagrant up ?
[2013-10-26 15:24:04 -0400] Cope: dmdeklerk: i wouldn't consider minitest-handler to be related
[2013-10-26 15:24:18 -0400] Cope: but you could do that instead, with multivm vagrant
[2013-10-26 15:24:39 -0400] Cope: no what I mean is, and this is kinda the point of leibniz, is you can call TK externally to set up machines
[2013-10-26 15:24:43 -0400] Cope: and then run tests against them
[2013-10-26 15:24:54 -0400] Cope: http://leibniz.cc
[2013-10-26 15:25:03 -0400] dmdeklerk: Cope: I forked that yesterday
[2013-10-26 15:25:16 -0400] Cope: but needs more documentation and examples... but I'm on it
[2013-10-26 15:25:58 -0400] dmdeklerk: Cope: it was wondering, it looks stale. laste commit 5 months ago. is there no pickup? with the book and all
[2013-10-26 15:25:58 -0400] Cope: glen: sorry, I don't know much about jetty; and I've not poked inside the internals of open source chef.
[2013-10-26 15:26:30 -0400] Cope: dmdeklerk: it *is* stale; but I will be using it myself, and adding to it, actively.
[2013-10-26 15:26:53 -0400] Cope: it's stuff I will be looking at explicitly next week
[2013-10-26 15:27:19 -0400] dmdeklerk: Cope: it is a tiny library though, finished is finished, no changes needed :-)
[2013-10-26 15:27:43 -0400] dmdeklerk: thanks for your input anyways.
[2013-10-26 15:27:48 -0400] Cope: hehe; maybe! but if you forked it it must lack something, or have a bug :)
[2013-10-26 15:28:14 -0400] dmdeklerk: no bug, just wanted to use my pre-baked vagrant box
[2013-10-26 15:29:30 -0400] Cope: anyway - this orchestration of multiple machines and external testing is what I'm very interested in.
[2013-10-26 15:29:35 -0400] Cope: Be interested to see how you get on.
[2013-10-26 15:29:50 -0400] Cope: I've not used vagabond... could be worth a look.  It has good DNA.
[2013-10-26 15:30:49 -0400] dmdeklerk: I find it really hard (getting into TDI), just came to infrastructure building like a month ago. I do agree with you 100% that TDD is the way to go, in my rails work i cant live without
[2013-10-26 15:31:44 -0400] Cope: i kinda think we're nearly there
[2013-10-26 15:31:54 -0400] dmdeklerk: I could just build my stuff with chef, but i really really really want automated tests. Luckily theres your book.
[2013-10-26 15:31:56 -0400] Cope: we just need to think slightly differently
[2013-10-26 15:32:23 -0400] Cope: because people tend to view the testing of recipes adn cookbooks in the same way as testing the whole infra
[2013-10-26 15:32:24 -0400] dmdeklerk: Whats missing is the *easyness* of rails testing, there stuff just works
[2013-10-26 15:32:32 -0400] Cope: the laytter being a lot like monitoring
[2013-10-26 15:32:44 -0400] Cope: dmdeklerk: yeah, so how to make it easy... is the challenge
[2013-10-26 15:34:13 -0400] dmdeklerk: Cope: btw, did you notice the formatting of the code samples throughout the pdf version of TDI 2nd ed. its almost unreadable
[2013-10-26 17:33:31 -0400] Cope: dmdeklerk: that surprises me... wasn't picked up in QA; and no0one else has said so.  But.. raise errata and send a picture!
[2013-10-26 18:00:49 -0400] daneel: What to do if dependent cookbook failes due lack of some package? For example gmake. I tried to add recipe to run list before my original cookbook. But it seems it's ignored.
[2013-10-26 18:03:10 -0400] daneel: I got it working only if I leave helper cookbook that installs gmake. With second step I rollback the runlist to its original state.
[2013-10-26 18:06:23 -0400] Cope: daneel: I don't understand... if you add a recipe which installs gmake to your runlist ahead of something else, chef will apply it and install gmake.
[2013-10-26 18:06:39 -0400] Cope: in which way does Chef ignore it?
[2013-10-26 18:11:50 -0400] daneel: I launch chef second time after its failure with prependend new recipe but chef runs like its first time.
[2013-10-26 18:12:11 -0400] daneel: Should I clean some cache?
[2013-10-26 18:51:32 -0400] Cope: daneel: could you show the chef run, with debug?
[2013-10-26 19:05:46 -0400] daneel: I played with including recipies in my cookbook. And I found mysql::ruby recipe is unusual. It violates rules. Chef starts with it  ignoring any other recipies before it.
[2013-10-26 19:06:26 -0400] daneel: If I comment myql::ruby then all recipies are executed in sequencial order.
[2013-10-26 19:18:22 -0400] daneel: mysql::ruby is a special recipe. It doesn't have a file in chef-repo. There isn't its definition.
[2013-10-26 19:47:23 -0400] chip-: daneel: Are you using Berks of Librarian or some kind of dependency-magic resolver for you? That could cause cookbooks to be available for inclusion even though they're not in your repo
[2013-10-26 19:47:43 -0400] chip-: as to mysql::ruby happening early, probably the first recipe in your run_list is calling it via include_recipe
[2013-10-26 19:48:04 -0400] daneel: No I'm not.
[2013-10-26 19:48:50 -0400] daneel: I think problem with mysql::ruby itself. It uses RubyGem and C compiler.
[2013-10-26 19:50:14 -0400] chip-: mysql::ruby uses the chef_gem resource, which does indeed install a gem. http://docs.opscode.com/chef/resources.html#chef-gem
[2013-10-26 19:51:11 -0400] derebos: how can i be ensure some user is exists or not?
[2013-10-26 19:51:39 -0400] chip-: It installs build-essential and mysql-client, checks to see if you're installing mysql from percona, installs the client packages to build against, then installs the mysql gem.
[2013-10-26 19:51:50 -0400] chip-: derebos: http://docs.opscode.com/chef/resources.html#user
[2013-10-26 19:55:17 -0400] derebos: in postgresql there is a script createuser -s foobar, how can i do this in chef?
[2013-10-26 19:56:09 -0400] daneel: First of all I want to explain this magic mechanism - how can one recipe  get priority nontherless its position in run list.
[2013-10-26 19:58:28 -0400] chip-: daneel: Without seeing your code it's hard to say what's causing that to run first, but there's no magic mechanism by which one recipe can be boosted to the front of the run_list. Maybe something's running an early notification or there's an include_recipe?

[2013-10-26 20:31:37 -0400] chef004: hello
[2013-10-26 21:30:49 -0400] mveitas: any idea why I might get an error: Exception: NameError: uninitialized constant Shef  for the following: http://pastebin.com/LMgFtuX6
[2013-10-26 21:34:06 -0400] mc_fail: why whan i executing 'knife cookbook site install' it doesn't use cookbook_path from knife.rb?
[2013-10-26 21:35:04 -0400] mc_fail: *when
[2013-10-26 21:38:00 -0400] Cope: it does
[2013-10-26 21:38:02 -0400] Cope: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/cookbook_site_install.rb#L77-L78
[2013-10-26 21:47:24 -0400] mc_fail: Cope hmm, looks strange, but it new cookbooks installs to cookbook_path only if i specify -o option
[2013-10-26 21:48:06 -0400] mc_fail: by default it write a cookbook folder into current directory
[2013-10-26 21:53:15 -0400] mc_fail: i have a some servers, (for example one central server and 10 branch servers) i need create e ipsec-transport between central and branch server, to do it, i need create configuration files with the same tokens on both servers
[2013-10-26 21:53:26 -0400] mc_fail: so, how i can do it with chef?
[2013-10-26 21:53:46 -0400] Cope: can you give an example?
[2013-10-26 21:56:50 -0400] mc_fail: for example: srv0(central) srv1(branch), so on srv0 i must create config like nodeip=$noeip\n key=$key, and execute ifup srv1; on srv1 i must create config nodeip=$srv0_ip\n key=$key, and execute ifup srv0
[2013-10-26 21:57:35 -0400] mc_fail: the problem: how to say in recipe to do something on central server
[2013-10-26 21:58:09 -0400] mc_fail: and store $key somehere
[2013-10-26 21:58:20 -0400] mc_fail: *somewhere
[2013-10-26 21:58:27 -0400] mc_fail: (sorry for my terrible english)
[2013-10-26 21:59:09 -0400] jbz: mc_fail:  You could have the branch server create its key, bring up its interface and then save the key to an attribute.  That will save the key to the central server under the branch server's node record.  Then the central server can search nodes for those with non-nil key attributes, and when it finds them, use them to bring up its side.
[2013-10-26 21:59:46 -0400] jbz: The only iffy bit there is if they have to bring up the transports synchronously, that's a problem, and if you don't want the key readable by folks with access to the chef server, it's a problem.
[2013-10-26 22:06:55 -0400] mc_fail: jbz no, they don't have to pring up synchronously, but can i somehow set in recipe to send attributes to chef server before doing a ifup srv0, because for my configuration srv0 and chef server are the same machine, and after 'ifup srv0' branch server became unreachble until 'ifup srv1' on srv0
[2013-10-26 22:07:49 -0400] jbz: mc_fail Uh.  I would really, really recommend your chef server not live on a machine which does other stuff. Especially if you're going to be messing around with the networking on it.
[2013-10-26 22:08:19 -0400] jbz: Having said that, you can do a node.save from a recipe; that will cause the chef-client to immediately save state to the server without waiting for the completion of the run.  If the attribute is set before that, it will get saved to the server.
[2013-10-26 22:09:25 -0400] Liquid--: Could anyone provide guidance on how to get started with openstack-chef? I cloned the repo down and started up the vagrant box. Just not sure how multi-node setup works.
[2013-10-26 22:10:57 -0400] mc_fail: jbz it's just a management, i forced to create a ipsec-transport just for security
[2013-10-26 22:11:16 -0400] mc_fail: *a management server
[2013-10-26 22:18:30 -0400] mc_fail: jbz hmm, and how i can get a nodes and keys in a recipe?
[2013-10-26 22:19:23 -0400] jbz: mc_fail You can find the attributes for other nodes on the server using a node search: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_search.html
[2013-10-26 22:20:15 -0400] mc_fail: you're meaning i must create a two recipie: for branch(that will generate key, configs and sned it to chef) and for central server(that get a nodes and keys list and generate configs)
[2013-10-26 22:20:23 -0400] mc_fail: i'm right?
[2013-10-26 22:20:27 -0400] jbz: Yep.
[2013-10-26 22:20:31 -0400] mc_fail: ok
[2013-10-26 22:20:34 -0400] mc_fail: thank you)
[2013-10-26 22:20:38 -0400] jbz: Two recipes, probably in the same cookbook; call the appropriate one from the role.
[2013-10-26 22:20:45 -0400] jbz: You're welcome, hope it helps!
[2013-10-26 22:32:26 -0400] mc_fail: hmm, it looks like a best way to resolve my problem is using data bag for create something like "map" for ipsec
[2013-10-26 22:34:24 -0400] mc_fail: and make just one recipe for ipsec, that get someting like "map" for each host
[2013-10-26 22:36:02 -0400] jbz: That's better if you know the key beforehand; I suggested using attrib/search b/c if you generate the key during the chef run, it won't be available in the data bag.
[2013-10-26 22:39:41 -0400] mc_fail: jbz no, i mean i can use it just for assign a relationship between two hosts(like if i want a ipsec for srv0-srv1, srv0-srv2, srv0-srv3 and srv1-srv) and create just one recipe that will create a new configuration files based on this "ipsec relationship map"
[2013-10-26 22:39:56 -0400] jbz: mc_fail: Ah, I see, sorry.  Indeed, yes.
