[2013-10-13 01:23:17 -0400] josephholsten: is anyone else stupid enough to want Chef::REST to support a backend that can make requests in parallel?
[2013-10-13 01:23:47 -0400] josephholsten:  because it's killing me in chef-rundeck
[2013-10-13 01:36:41 -0400] gchristensen: josephholsten: that seems like an actually smart requirement
[2013-10-13 01:37:44 -0400] josephholsten: yes, but Chef::HTTP is like it's own stack of http handlers. I bet it'll map to faraday somewhat alright, but keeping backwards compatibility will be a /nightmare/
[2013-10-13 01:38:20 -0400] gchristensen: ouch
[2013-10-13 01:41:23 -0400] josephholsten: also I wish someone would http://mike.daless.io/prez/nokogiri-goruco-2013/nokogiri-history-and-future.html -ify typhoeus with libcurl because I hate having to require libcurl from outside
[2013-10-13 01:41:41 -0400] josephholsten: or curb or patron
[2013-10-13 01:45:04 -0400] josephholsten: anyway, let's see how much partial_search improves things, then I can get really crazy
[2013-10-13 01:55:47 -0400] gchristensen: josephholsten: dependencies are hard :)
[2013-10-13 04:07:53 -0400] pcn: ohai
[2013-10-13 04:08:09 -0400] pcn: Does anyone have any guidance on how to set node attributes so that when they're passed into a cookbook they are used?
[2013-10-13 04:08:18 -0400] pcn: Sorry passed into a template
[2013-10-13 04:10:18 -0400] pcn: It seems that even if I derefernce ndoe["thing"]["thats"]["nested"] in the template, I come up with nada
[2013-10-13 04:39:53 -0400] chip-: pcn: Should just work. <%= node[is][a][string] %> should return the string.
[2013-10-13 04:39:54 -0400] chip-: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_templates.html
[2013-10-13 04:40:39 -0400] chip-: <%= is evaluate & print, <% is evaluate. %> is close, -%> is close-no-linebreak.
[2013-10-13 05:02:53 -0400] pcn: chip- I'm finding that node is working, but it's bothering me that I can't pass those in as variables
[2013-10-13 15:11:18 -0400] gyre007: is there any way to delete Organization from Hosted Chef ?
[2013-10-13 15:49:32 -0400] dopry_: any one here familiar with setting up omnibus installer?
[2013-10-13 15:50:38 -0400] dopry_: I've create a project and I'm attempting to get a build going for compass.
[2013-10-13 16:56:38 -0400] gyre007: anyone here knows why wouldn't my attributes in WRAPPER cookbook be overriding the ones in Library cookbook ?
[2013-10-13 16:56:39 -0400] gyre007: https://gist.github.com/milosgajdos83/6964496
[2013-10-13 16:56:49 -0400] gyre007: I'm not sure what Im doing wrong
[2013-10-13 16:56:51 -0400] gyre007: this is Chef 11
[2013-10-13 16:57:27 -0400] gyre007: I must be missing something
[2013-10-13 16:58:23 -0400] gyre007: this is working fine on Chef 10
[2013-10-13 16:58:27 -0400] gyre007: mm
[2013-10-13 17:03:22 -0400] gyre007: Ah...this is actually some HOSTED CHEF craziness
[2013-10-13 17:03:46 -0400] gyre007: how do I make hosted chef to pick up latest cookbooks on some nodes ?
[2013-10-13 17:03:51 -0400] gyre007: uhh...
[2013-10-13 17:25:32 -0400] gyre007: Chef debug shows that the attribute DOES GET overridden ? https://gist.github.com/milosgajdos83/6964496
[2013-10-13 17:59:14 -0400] gyre007: http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2013-08/msg00218.html
[2013-10-13 18:03:31 -0400] benlangfeld: Good afternoon gents. I'm looking for some help with test-kitchen. I'm seeing what looks like some sort of timeout when running `kitchen converge` ([2013-10-13T17:49:25+00:00] FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::ChildConvergeError: Chef run process terminated by signal 9 (KILL)). Is this the best place to ask?
[2013-10-13 18:19:25 -0400] benlangfeld: Looks like it was a memory allocation issue and giving the VM more memory seems to have helped :)
[2013-10-13 18:42:43 -0400] gyre007: this hosted chef could not be any more different from self-hosted one...ah
[2013-10-13 18:46:18 -0400] gyre007: how do I tell Hosted Chef which cookbook version the node should be using ?
[2013-10-13 18:46:26 -0400] gyre007: i can't figure that out...
[2013-10-13 19:02:18 -0400] 17SADFNJW: does anyone here use sssd_ldap ? have a question if so
[2013-10-13 22:36:55 -0400] wharle: is there a command i can run to figure out where a recipe is being required from? I uploaded all of my cookbooks myself and when i do a find through them, i cannot find where 'metachef' is required, but when i chef-client i keep seeing "The following cookbooks are required by the client but don't exist on the server: * metachef"
[2013-10-13 22:38:22 -0400] adnichols: wharle it could be in the metadata.rb for a cookbook  - not necessarily in the recipe you are using
[2013-10-13 22:39:04 -0400] adnichols: wharle and I'm not aware of a way to search for this on the server - typically if you are using something like berkshelf it'll take care of satisfying those dependencies and putting any necessary cookbooks on the server
[2013-10-13 22:39:49 -0400] adnichols: There will be cases where you'll even see cookbooks for platforms you don't use - just the way it works
[2013-10-13 22:40:35 -0400] wharle: yeah, i would just put metachef on, but they arent centos platform compatible
[2013-10-13 22:49:01 -0400] adnichols: that doesn't matter - it'll be necessary
[2013-10-13 23:07:18 -0400] willejs: is there any alternative to the remote_file resource? id prefer it used multiple http connections to speed up downloads, particularly from S3
[2013-10-13 23:12:29 -0400] jmickle: anyone know how to get chef-client to pick up ec2 attributes?
[2013-10-13 23:16:39 -0400] willejs: yeah
[2013-10-13 23:16:49 -0400] willejs: theres a section in your chef client.rb file
[2013-10-13 23:16:51 -0400] willejs: that enables it
[2013-10-13 23:16:55 -0400] willejs: oh wait no...
[2013-10-13 23:17:02 -0400] willejs: its in the ohai folder i think
[2013-10-13 23:18:46 -0400] jmickle: willejs: i had to restore a server from ami and i tried to run chef to the new chef server
[2013-10-13 23:18:56 -0400] jmickle: but its not picking up node[:ec2][:local_ipv4]
[2013-10-13 23:18:56 -0400] willejs: in /etc/chef/ohai/ec2/json
[2013-10-13 23:18:57 -0400] jmickle: for some reason
[2013-10-13 23:19:13 -0400] willejs: in /etc/chef/ohai/ec2.json
[2013-10-13 23:19:24 -0400] willejs: it should have an empty hash/dict {}
[2013-10-13 23:19:35 -0400] willejs: ohai should run when you run chef?
[2013-10-13 23:19:43 -0400] jmickle: yeah except its not running
[2013-10-13 23:19:44 -0400] jmickle: thats the problem
[2013-10-13 23:19:55 -0400] willejs: is there that hint on disk?
[2013-10-13 23:20:10 -0400] jmickle: nope
[2013-10-13 23:21:05 -0400] willejs: put that file on there and rerun
[2013-10-13 23:21:08 -0400] willejs: it will find them...
[2013-10-13 23:21:33 -0400] willejs: shit sorry /etc/chef/ohai/hints/ec2.json
[2013-10-13 23:21:46 -0400] jmickle: ahhh
[2013-10-13 23:21:47 -0400] jmickle: that worked
[2013-10-13 23:21:49 -0400] jmickle: thank you
[2013-10-13 23:21:54 -0400] willejs: kabam!
[2013-10-13 23:21:58 -0400] jmickle: why does that do that?
[2013-10-13 23:22:04 -0400] willejs: tuts cool, thats caught me too before...
[2013-10-13 23:22:13 -0400] jmickle: or could you point me in some docs on how that works?
[2013-10-13 23:22:18 -0400] jmickle: to some *
[2013-10-13 23:22:22 -0400] willejs: just to tell chef its an ec2 instance and to look for metadata
[2013-10-13 23:22:26 -0400] jmickle: is that ohai thing? or chef client itself
[2013-10-13 23:22:29 -0400] jmickle: oh got it
[2013-10-13 23:22:36 -0400] jmickle: so it needs that hint to know what type of server it is
[2013-10-13 23:22:44 -0400] willejs: yep, its an ohai thing
[2013-10-13 23:22:47 -0400] jmickle: ahhhh
[2013-10-13 23:22:50 -0400] jmickle: thank you so much
[2013-10-13 23:23:11 -0400] jmickle: ohai needs some better docs
[2013-10-13 23:23:59 -0400] willejs: yeah it does, i want to write a plugin for it, but alas, very little docs
[2013-10-13 23:24:11 -0400] willejs: theres a food fight show on it, but the guys blog no longer exists lol
[2013-10-13 23:24:30 -0400] joonas: did they not repost it?
[2013-10-13 23:24:36 -0400] joonas: I thought they were going to :/
[2013-10-13 23:25:07 -0400] willejs: no :(
[2013-10-13 23:25:18 -0400] jmickle: ah
[2013-10-13 23:25:19 -0400] willejs: the internet truly is broken ;)
[2013-10-13 23:25:26 -0400] jmickle: yeah ohai seems like the dark vudu of chef lately
[2013-10-13 23:25:33 -0400] jmickle: its getting more important as chef 11 gets stronger
[2013-10-13 23:25:41 -0400] jmickle: but its documentation is getting less reliable
[2013-10-13 23:25:51 -0400] jmickle: we should put in a request to opscode about that
[2013-10-13 23:26:19 -0400] jmickle: they are probably just busy and haven't had time to keep up
[2013-10-13 23:26:20 -0400] jmickle: happens
[2013-10-13 23:40:24 -0400] gyre007: is this place dead today ?
[2013-10-13 23:41:28 -0400] gyre007: I have a wrapper cookbook for papertrail which has 2 recipes.... default and app https://gist.github.com/milosgajdos83/6968592
[2013-10-13 23:41:44 -0400] gyre007: however when I have both of these recipes in my runlist
[2013-10-13 23:42:09 -0400] gyre007: the second one NEVER overrides the watch_files attributes
[2013-10-13 23:42:13 -0400] gyre007: anyone idea why ?
[2013-10-13 23:42:19 -0400] gyre007: Im clueless
[2013-10-13 23:42:54 -0400] gyre007: IF I dont load both of them ie. remove the default one from runlist and just keep the app one...all is well
