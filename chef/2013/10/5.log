[2013-10-05 00:08:09 -0400] doomviking: barn: like you would any shell command from within vim?
[2013-10-05 00:08:24 -0400] doomviking: :!foodcritic /path/to/cookbook
[2013-10-05 00:09:28 -0400] doomviking: give up too easily :)
[2013-10-05 00:09:59 -0400] barn: hmmm
[2013-10-05 00:10:08 -0400] barn: that's true, I'd prefer syntastic to run it for me
[2013-10-05 00:10:20 -0400] barn: but then I lose ruby syntax checking...
[2013-10-05 01:46:28 -0400] michael_mbp: hi all
[2013-10-05 01:46:55 -0400] michael_mbp: any tips on using ohai when writing cookbooks? Also is there much use for chef-shell ?
[2013-10-05 01:51:43 -0400] coderanger: michael_mbp: You don't generally use ohai directly
[2013-10-05 01:51:49 -0400] coderanger: its run for you automatically
[2013-10-05 01:52:02 -0400] coderanger: and chef-shell is useful to some people for debugging recipes
[2013-10-05 01:52:16 -0400] coderanger: (I've never been a huge fan personally)
[2013-10-05 01:52:22 -0400] michael_mbp: ah
[2013-10-05 03:11:49 -0400] michael_mbp: btw I noticed cookbooks tend to be their own git repos
[2013-10-05 03:12:00 -0400] michael_mbp: so how do you 'load' them into your kitchen?
[2013-10-05 03:12:08 -0400] michael_mbp: (for local testing for example) ?
[2013-10-05 03:12:35 -0400] michael_mbp: i.e. a relative path in the berksfile?
[2013-10-05 03:28:36 -0400] coderanger: michael_mbp: cookbook 'foo', path: '../foo'
[2013-10-05 04:03:20 -0400] michael_mbp: aha!
[2013-10-05 04:08:53 -0400] michael_mbp: btw do you know of any decent resources on writing wrapper cookbooks?
[2013-10-05 04:09:05 -0400] coderanger: Not really, but there isn't much to it
[2013-10-05 04:09:15 -0400] michael_mbp: ok one sec
[2013-10-05 04:09:19 -0400] michael_mbp: https://github.com/bsodmike/deployment_kitchen
[2013-10-05 04:09:22 -0400] coderanger: Mostly just setting some node attrs, maybe using chef-rewind is needed
[2013-10-05 04:09:46 -0400] michael_mbp: that's my kitchen for now and I've got a cookbook setup locally elsewhere, which I will link in my berksfile
[2013-10-05 04:10:19 -0400] michael_mbp: so I can include_recipe for that entire run list (for now)
[2013-10-05 04:11:13 -0400] coderanger: Not sure what you mean
[2013-10-05 04:12:58 -0400] michael_mbp: I want to essentially configure all the recipes via a cookbook
[2013-10-05 04:13:15 -0400] michael_mbp: https://github.com/teohm/appbox-cookbook/blob/master/metadata.rb  << I can set them as dependencies in my 'base_server' cookbook like that
[2013-10-05 04:13:45 -0400] coderanger: Ahh, you are talking about a role-ish cookbook
[2013-10-05 04:13:46 -0400] michael_mbp: then I just do https://github.com/teohm/appbox-cookbook/blob/master/recipes/default.rb as a default recipe
[2013-10-05 04:13:50 -0400] coderanger: not just a straight wrapper
[2013-10-05 04:13:52 -0400] michael_mbp: pretty much!
[2013-10-05 04:14:00 -0400] michael_mbp: ooh what's a straight wrapper :D
[2013-10-05 04:14:09 -0400] michael_mbp: I've not seen a good example (yet)
[2013-10-05 04:14:15 -0400] coderanger: wrapping a single cookbook, like mysql -> mycompany-mysql
[2013-10-05 04:14:17 -0400] michael_mbp: I'm guessing one that overrides stuff?
[2013-10-05 04:14:28 -0400] michael_mbp: got any examples?
[2013-10-05 04:14:31 -0400] coderanger: to change defaults, setup specific policies like backups or firewall rules, etc
[2013-10-05 04:14:55 -0400] michael_mbp: are all the changes made via a recipe in the wrapper?
[2013-10-05 04:14:57 -0400] coderanger: https://github.com/python/psf-chef/tree/master/cookbooks/psf-postgresql
[2013-10-05 04:15:02 -0400] coderanger: Thats a terrible example
[2013-10-05 04:15:04 -0400] coderanger: but the best I have
[2013-10-05 04:15:46 -0400] michael_mbp: ah
[2013-10-05 04:16:39 -0400] coderanger: That one doesn't really override anything from the underlying postgresql cookbook
[2013-10-05 04:16:47 -0400] coderanger: its just some PSF specific stuffs
[2013-10-05 04:17:46 -0400] michael_mbp: yeah would be interesting to see one that does overriding
[2013-10-05 04:18:03 -0400] michael_mbp: I'd assume it uses the same DSL provided by the postgresql cookbook
[2013-10-05 04:19:21 -0400] michael_mbp: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/postgresql/blob/master/recipes/server.rb#L53:L58
[2013-10-05 04:19:39 -0400] michael_mbp: like you could redefine that in the default straight wrapper recipe, yeah?
[2013-10-05 04:21:15 -0400] coderanger: No, but you can change resources via chef-rewind
[2013-10-05 04:23:13 -0400] michael_mbp: ah
[2013-10-05 04:25:17 -0400] michael_mbp: https://github.com/bsodmike/deployment_kitchen/blob/master/nodes/vagrant.json if I do node[:postgrestsql][:password][:postgres] = "foo" in my cookbook's attributes file that'll get set yeah?
[2013-10-05 04:28:40 -0400] michael_mbp: ?
[2013-10-05 04:30:27 -0400] michael_mbp: oh there's node.override
[2013-10-05 04:38:41 -0400] coderanger: Yeah, node.override['postgresql']['whatever'] = 'foobar'
[2013-10-05 04:50:32 -0400] michael_mbp: hmm I did not expect that
[2013-10-05 04:50:39 -0400] michael_mbp: https://github.com/bsodmike/deployment_kitchen/blob/master/nodes/vagrant.json
[2013-10-05 04:51:05 -0400] michael_mbp: I thought I could remove that file and my base_server cookbook would set them all on the run_list via 'include_recipe' ?
[2013-10-05 04:53:17 -0400] michael_mbp: I guess it cannot be avoided, every node needs a run_list via JSON?
[2013-10-05 04:58:29 -0400] michael_mbp: it's also node.set[...]
[2013-10-05 04:58:40 -0400] michael_mbp: no need for override for role cookbooks it seems
[2013-10-05 05:04:49 -0400] michael_mbp: HA got it!
[2013-10-05 05:04:54 -0400] michael_mbp: gah.... silly mistake :D
[2013-10-05 05:05:05 -0400] michael_mbp: I just had to set the run_list to recipe[base_server] :D
[2013-10-05 05:25:40 -0400] michael_mbp: there we go https://github.com/bsodmike/deployment_kitchen/commit/fb9f7b9edf325f52716374de6cf06531ca6b7273
[2013-10-05 06:05:29 -0400] michael_mbp: anyone about?
[2013-10-05 06:07:00 -0400] michael_mbp: doing some transparent wrapping for a storagebox https://github.com/bsodmike/deployment_kitchen/commit/fb9f7b9edf325f52716374de6cf06531ca6b7273
[2013-10-05 06:42:20 -0400] kim____: confused here
[2013-10-05 06:42:27 -0400] kim____: how are you
[2013-10-05 06:42:59 -0400] kim____: I have a quesiton on overriding attributes
[2013-10-05 06:43:14 -0400] kim____: I can't get it to work using the opscode nginx cookbok
[2013-10-05 06:43:26 -0400] kim____: can someone help me?
[2013-10-05 06:46:33 -0400] kim____: HELP
[2013-10-05 06:46:45 -0400] n1ko: hard to help without knowing more
[2013-10-05 06:46:59 -0400] n1ko: where are you overriding them, with what syntax, what values
[2013-10-05 07:03:13 -0400] michael_mbp: lol
[2013-10-05 07:03:26 -0400] michael_mbp: I've got build-essential done and mysql install says no 'make' hmm
[2013-10-05 07:14:54 -0400] michael_mbp: n1ko: any ideas?
[2013-10-05 07:15:01 -0400] michael_mbp: make is just not being installed
[2013-10-05 07:19:22 -0400] michael_mbp: I might have to ensure a proper ruby install is there first hmm.
[2013-10-05 07:51:12 -0400] michael_mbp: anyone?
[2013-10-05 08:52:44 -0400] michael_mbp: hmm
[2013-10-05 10:16:29 -0400] michael_mbp: helllooo anyone?
[2013-10-05 11:03:19 -0400] a_ro: hi there
[2013-10-05 11:53:13 -0400] michael_mbp: OMG... can't believe...
[2013-10-05 11:53:15 -0400] michael_mbp: hey a_ro
[2013-10-05 11:53:20 -0400] michael_mbp: glad you're here
[2013-10-05 11:53:29 -0400] michael_mbp: a_ro: https://github.com/RiotGames/berkshelf/pull/304#issuecomment-25747009
[2013-10-05 11:53:36 -0400] michael_mbp: I've been STRANGLING myself all day with this
[2013-10-05 12:27:30 -0400] michael_mbp: a_ro: still here?
[2013-10-05 13:29:43 -0400] a_ro: sry i dont use berkshelf...librarian-chef instead...
[2013-10-05 13:37:24 -0400] michael_mbp: a_ro: does that support nested cheffiles?
[2013-10-05 13:37:42 -0400] michael_mbp: teukka: are you around mate?
[2013-10-05 13:38:27 -0400] a_ro: don't know...I tend to keep things simple...
[2013-10-05 13:42:04 -0400] michael_mbp: well I wasn't doing anything overly complicated
[2013-10-05 13:43:45 -0400] a_ro: nested cheffiles sounds complicated ;-)
[2013-10-05 13:49:36 -0400] michael_mbp: a_ro: see https://github.com/RiotGames/berkshelf/pull/304#issuecomment-25747009
[2013-10-05 13:49:45 -0400] michael_mbp: instead of berkfiles, consider cheffiles
[2013-10-05 13:49:50 -0400] michael_mbp: I wonder if that would work.
[2013-10-05 14:19:34 -0400] zenloop: In a recipe can I get a list of json keys - for example I want to know all of the disks on a machine from node["filesystem"].  In a recipe how do I get a list of the next level of keys which are the device names?
[2013-10-05 14:24:14 -0400] jbz: zenloop: does this work:
[2013-10-05 14:24:28 -0400] jbz: list=node['filesystem'].keys
[2013-10-05 14:44:07 -0400] zenloop: jbz: just tried in irb and with json object and it works fine.  will try it in recipe. Thanks!
[2013-10-05 14:44:14 -0400] jbz: yw!
[2013-10-05 15:14:57 -0400] teukka: michael_mbp: hi! what's up? too much log to read...
[2013-10-05 15:42:42 -0400] michael_mbp: hey all
[2013-10-05 15:43:01 -0400] michael_mbp: teukka: I spent the whole day struggling with this
[2013-10-05 15:43:22 -0400] michael_mbp: and that link I sent you to gave me the answer, essentially with Berkfiles, there are 2 issues.
[2013-10-05 15:44:09 -0400] michael_mbp: say you have your main chef_kitchen, and you specify a cookbook right? now within your cookbook (it's a wrapper essentially) you also specify another Berksfile
[2013-10-05 15:44:20 -0400] michael_mbp: and that refers to a cookbook you're trying to wrap.
[2013-10-05 15:45:35 -0400] michael_mbp: now if the cookbook we want to wrap over, is hosted by opscode, Berksfiles use that is the main 'reference' point.
[2013-10-05 15:46:38 -0400] michael_mbp: even if I try to load the wrap-target in the wrapper cookbook by specifying the wrapped cookbook's path to say a Github - Berkshelf ignores it.
[2013-10-05 15:47:15 -0400] michael_mbp: and to make matters worse, you'll most likely have the wrapper 'depends ' on the wrapped cookbook - so Berkshelf goes and downloads it from opscode, instead of github!
[2013-10-05 15:47:40 -0400] michael_mbp: teukka: so for now, I'm not trying to 'nest berksfiles'.
[2013-10-05 15:49:05 -0400] teukka: michael_mbp: I think the official answer is to run your own indexing server: https://github.com/RiotGames/berkshelf-api
[2013-10-05 15:49:33 -0400] michael_mbp: ha yes, that's the solution it seems
[2013-10-05 15:49:35 -0400] teukka: michael_mbp: but there is no documentation for it =)
[2013-10-05 15:50:10 -0400] teukka: sorry, have to look after the kids now..
[2013-10-05 15:50:20 -0400] michael_mbp: no prob
[2013-10-05 15:50:25 -0400] michael_mbp: I'll catch you later :)
[2013-10-05 15:52:48 -0400] michael_mbp: hey workmad3
[2013-10-05 15:52:53 -0400] michael_mbp: saw your tweet
[2013-10-05 15:54:22 -0400] michael_mbp: he's something interesting you could try, but it's only work for a custom cookbook; make sure you have an opscode hosted cookbook as a dependency on your custom one; then in your top-level berksfile, point it to a fork of that cookbook on github.  Berkshelf will say it's grabbing it from git plus it'll install the opscode one instead.
[2013-10-05 15:54:29 -0400] michael_mbp: workmad3: ^^
[2013-10-05 15:54:42 -0400] workmad3: michael_mbp: I do that, with the rvm cookbook
[2013-10-05 15:54:54 -0400] workmad3: michael_mbp: where I use the fnichols one, not the one from opscode community
[2013-10-05 15:54:59 -0400] michael_mbp: ...and it works for you?
[2013-10-05 15:55:03 -0400] workmad3: yup
[2013-10-05 15:55:20 -0400] workmad3: could be because I'm specifying a version that can't be found through opscode though ;)
[2013-10-05 15:55:22 -0400] michael_mbp: I've been pulling my hairout over this all day.
[2013-10-05 15:55:27 -0400] michael_mbp: aha possibly!
[2013-10-05 15:55:37 -0400] michael_mbp: OOOHHH!!
[2013-10-05 15:55:57 -0400] michael_mbp: well there's a side-problem to this since I'm chef-soloing.
[2013-10-05 15:56:24 -0400] workmad3: btw, I'd suggest to be very strict in your versioning in any wrapper cookbooks you write
[2013-10-05 15:56:42 -0400] michael_mbp: IF someone publishes cookbooks with the names of custom ones I'm using (although I'm not sure about the version check) there may be a case where it'll default to opscode.
[2013-10-05 15:57:05 -0400] michael_mbp: well for the github scenario
[2013-10-05 15:57:10 -0400] michael_mbp: I could have bumped the version on my fork
[2013-10-05 15:57:21 -0400] michael_mbp: that way it *should* fail on opscode.
[2013-10-05 15:57:24 -0400] workmad3: put your name as a prefix on anything that's specific to your infrastructure
[2013-10-05 15:57:37 -0400] michael_mbp: but that's only the wrapper?
[2013-10-05 15:57:43 -0400] workmad3: that'll avoid potential conflicts
[2013-10-05 15:57:54 -0400] michael_mbp: what about the wrapped-cookbook?
[2013-10-05 15:57:59 -0400] workmad3: yeah, for the fork on github you'll want to adjust the version
[2013-10-05 15:58:14 -0400] michael_mbp: i.e. the wrapped dependency still has the opscode name
[2013-10-05 15:58:24 -0400] workmad3: dunno if chef will accept a 4-part version, may be worth trying that
[2013-10-05 15:58:36 -0400] workmad3: so your version becomes x.y.z.1
[2013-10-05 15:58:50 -0400] michael_mbp: oh I'm intrigued about the name as prefix thing
[2013-10-05 15:59:14 -0400] michael_mbp: I tried calling the wrap-subject 'databox_fork' and point to github
[2013-10-05 15:59:24 -0400] michael_mbp: BUT depends 'databox' resolves to opscode
[2013-10-05 16:00:00 -0400] michael_mbp: so it's really the version trick on depends that would save me I think; they really should introduce a namespacing option.
[2013-10-05 16:00:10 -0400] workmad3: michael_mbp: yes, but 'depends "databox", "x.y.z.1" '
[2013-10-05 16:00:26 -0400] workmad3: ;)
[2013-10-05 16:00:28 -0400] michael_mbp: workmad3: will try that :)
[2013-10-05 16:00:39 -0400] michael_mbp: namespaced cookbooks and it's solved tbh.
[2013-10-05 16:00:47 -0400] workmad3: I've never tried berkshelf with it resolving the same cookbook with the same version and it being available through two different places
[2013-10-05 16:00:50 -0400] michael_mbp: org::cookbook ?
[2013-10-05 16:00:59 -0400] workmad3: org_cookbook
[2013-10-05 16:01:14 -0400] michael_mbp: got it
[2013-10-05 16:01:43 -0400] michael_mbp: yeah I tried to get fancy right off the bat
[2013-10-05 16:01:57 -0400] workmad3: michael_mbp: if you have a chance though, you could see if the same dependency issue happens with librarian-chef ;)
[2013-10-05 16:01:58 -0400] michael_mbp: oh thoughts on separation, it is worth keeping app/web server separate?
[2013-10-05 16:02:10 -0400] michael_mbp: workmad3: I tried, I couldn't get it to work
[2013-10-05 16:02:30 -0400] michael_mbp: it just complained saying it couldn't see the wrapper
[2013-10-05 16:02:46 -0400] workmad3: you pointed your Cheffile to github?
[2013-10-05 16:02:50 -0400] workmad3: for that cookbook
[2013-10-05 16:02:55 -0400] michael_mbp: yeah
[2013-10-05 16:03:08 -0400] workmad3: hmm, weird
[2013-10-05 16:03:42 -0400] michael_mbp: thing with berks is it's more designed to work with a chef-server
[2013-10-05 16:03:53 -0400] michael_mbp: plus there's teukka's point
[2013-10-05 16:04:11 -0400] workmad3: hmm, I'd say berkshelf is more suitable for chef-solo personally, while librarian-chef is more for a chef server ;)
[2013-10-05 16:04:36 -0400] michael_mbp: ah.
[2013-10-05 16:04:41 -0400] workmad3: especially with berkshelf's integration with vagrant
[2013-10-05 16:04:44 -0400] michael_mbp: well for now, I have a trick to get the 'nesting' to work
[2013-10-05 16:04:55 -0400] michael_mbp: yeah I'm loving it
[2013-10-05 16:05:07 -0400] michael_mbp: I just cooked a droplet, haha amazing.
[2013-10-05 16:05:24 -0400] michael_mbp: from vm to production in well minutes.
[2013-10-05 16:05:30 -0400] workmad3: and for app/web separation... I'd suggest having separate cookbooks, but I wouldn't worry too much about them being coupled if you're running them together
[2013-10-05 16:05:35 -0400] michael_mbp: have you seen wercker?
[2013-10-05 16:05:45 -0400] workmad3: yeah, I was running with vagrant-aws and berkshelf :)
[2013-10-05 16:06:16 -0400] workmad3: I saw you link to it, not looked at it in any depth yet
[2013-10-05 16:06:17 -0400] michael_mbp: would be interesting to see what options are out there for automated 'chef-building'
[2013-10-05 16:06:58 -0400] michael_mbp: I'm semi-fuzzy on how it works.
[2013-10-05 16:07:00 -0400] workmad3: it's getting there
[2013-10-05 16:07:08 -0400] michael_mbp: since they deploy to heroku etc.
[2013-10-05 16:07:22 -0400] workmad3: but there's not enough really good-quality reusable library 'blocks' yet for chef
[2013-10-05 16:07:26 -0400] workmad3: but that's slowly changing
[2013-10-05 16:07:43 -0400] michael_mbp: so from what I've understood, you can use chef to custom build your wercker box; but the steps are just for your app running within that box
[2013-10-05 16:07:55 -0400] michael_mbp: I don't know if you can deploy that box 'config' to your production though!
[2013-10-05 16:08:07 -0400] workmad3: there's also the docker style that's coming along too
[2013-10-05 16:08:36 -0400] workmad3: making use of union file systems essentially, so you can have a base ubuntu build and then your custom stuff is just a layer
[2013-10-05 16:08:44 -0400] michael_mbp: ah!
[2013-10-05 16:09:12 -0400] workmad3: and rather than trying to migrate a box from one state to another, you just bring up a new box
[2013-10-05 16:09:29 -0400] michael_mbp: that sounds much better no?
[2013-10-05 16:10:02 -0400] workmad3: not sure how that will work with data migrations yet, but I guess you can do some fancy stuff with union file systems there too :) so your data goes on a different layer
[2013-10-05 16:10:12 -0400] workmad3: possibly
[2013-10-05 16:10:24 -0400] workmad3: I'm not familiar enough with it all to know all the implications tbh
[2013-10-05 16:10:34 -0400] michael_mbp: I've easily destroyed my vagrant vm about 50 times today
[2013-10-05 16:11:26 -0400] michael_mbp: ultimately I made my own storagebox based on databox; whilst fixing all his bugs
[2013-10-05 16:11:39 -0400] workmad3: I can see it being a bit more annoying incrementally developing your box's state
[2013-10-05 16:12:14 -0400] michael_mbp: I can see lot of non-rubyists trying to toy with chef.  he's doing `if Hash.new[:key]` rather than testing .any?
[2013-10-05 16:12:23 -0400] michael_mbp: so his app/databoxes install all options.
[2013-10-05 16:12:30 -0400] michael_mbp: I just wrote on his blog.
[2013-10-05 16:13:20 -0400] michael_mbp: workmad3: yeah, I also noticed some strangeness from chef; like I had late stage errors say on installing postgresql (like I'd typed note for node); after fixing a vagrant provision just ignores it though!
[2013-10-05 16:13:55 -0400] michael_mbp: I'm not sure if the main chef-omnibus thing is a bit more sensitive to issues like that.  So I've restored to destroy and up'ing from scratch
[2013-10-05 16:15:26 -0400] michael_mbp: https://github.com/bsodmike/deployment_kitchen that's where I'm at for the moment on the main kitchen.  I'll be working on it for a while to say the least.
[2013-10-05 16:15:40 -0400] michael_mbp: all the cookbooks are stored on bitbucket, bit more secure.
[2013-10-05 16:15:54 -0400] michael_mbp: do blog on your encrypted databag experience pls :)
[2013-10-05 16:17:44 -0400] renchap: j/win 75
[2013-10-05 16:17:55 -0400] workmad3: yeah, still figuring stuff out on that front
[2013-10-05 16:18:35 -0400] workmad3: currently, I'm creating a per-environment databag that I push the name of in through the environment.rb file
[2013-10-05 16:18:52 -0400] michael_mbp: cheers on the chefspec tip; it's incredbile how they've applied Ruby/TDD to the whole devops sphere.  just incredible.
[2013-10-05 16:19:02 -0400] michael_mbp: Bundler as well. haha
[2013-10-05 16:19:16 -0400] michael_mbp: ah
[2013-10-05 16:19:18 -0400] workmad3: and then each item gets a separate secret... when I bootstrap a node, I then push the secrets for that environment to the node
[2013-10-05 16:19:20 -0400] dbodner:  /join #collins
[2013-10-05 16:19:36 -0400] michael_mbp: nice
[2013-10-05 16:20:03 -0400] workmad3: I'm also using git-crypt to store the secrets in my git repo
[2013-10-05 16:20:15 -0400] michael_mbp: :D
[2013-10-05 16:22:07 -0400] michael_mbp: ah it's a file-by-file encryption
[2013-10-05 16:22:09 -0400] michael_mbp: makes sense.
[2013-10-05 16:33:03 -0400] ughani: hey guysa quick questioni dont know what iam doing wrong..when i try to create a user with the user resourcethe client is calling usermod instead of useradd
[2013-10-05 16:33:37 -0400] ughani: even when i specify "action :create" .. can someone please help me understadn what iam doing wrong?
[2013-10-05 16:42:45 -0400] ughani: https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3429 <- this exactly the same issue i see when that bug is closed as fixed
[2013-10-05 16:43:03 -0400] ughani: and im on version chef-11.6.0-1
[2013-10-05 16:43:47 -0400] renchap: win 61
[2013-10-05 16:43:50 -0400] renchap: grmbl
[2013-10-05 20:18:58 -0400] savant: hi everyone
[2013-10-05 20:19:06 -0400] savant: I'm creating a custom ruby library
[2013-10-05 20:19:23 -0400] savant: all it should do is process node information and return hosts/instances that match something
[2013-10-05 20:19:28 -0400] savant: a poor mans chef-server
[2013-10-05 20:20:19 -0400] savant: here is the library: https://gist.github.com/josegonzalez/27ed651eaa5ef380cd0f
[2013-10-05 20:20:41 -0400] savant: unfortunately, i get the following error: undefined local variable or method `node' for Shefgeek:Class
[2013-10-05 20:20:57 -0400] savant: is there a way to globably access the `node` variable ?
[2013-10-05 20:39:38 -0400] coderanger: savant: No, you need to pass it in
[2013-10-05 20:39:46 -0400] coderanger: savant: Or pass in the run_context
[2013-10-05 20:40:26 -0400] savant: is there an example somewhere of that?
[2013-10-05 20:42:05 -0400] savant: i think i'll just pass in the node
[2013-10-05 20:42:13 -0400] savant: doesnt look like there is a good way to do this.
[2013-10-05 20:42:33 -0400] coderanger: Given that I'm not sure what you are trying to do, its hard to say
[2013-10-05 20:42:48 -0400] coderanger: If you just want to save node data up to an external system, use a handler not a library
[2013-10-05 20:43:44 -0400] savant: https://gist.github.com/josegonzalez/27ed651eaa5ef380cd0f
[2013-10-05 20:43:47 -0400] savant: i updated the example
[2013-10-05 20:44:17 -0400] savant: we have a configure_rabbitmq_instances.rb where we pull out instances and set them as node data
[2013-10-05 20:45:46 -0400] coderanger: If you want to initialize the attrs based on some external service, you can do that in an attributes file
[2013-10-05 20:51:53 -0400] savant: i dont think I can do that, due to how we setup our chef infra
[2013-10-05 20:51:56 -0400] savant: hacks on hacks on hacks.
[2013-10-05 21:02:29 -0400] savant: thanks for your input though!
[2013-10-05 21:02:39 -0400] savant: i'm going to try and figure out how to fix my situation
[2013-10-05 22:29:00 -0400] purpleleaf: I'm writing a cookbook where recipes share some common code.  Cookbook::server will include_recipe cookbook::default and cookbook::client will do the same.  I'm try to stop the recipe from running on unsupported platforms. If I "return" in the common code, cheff keeps running.  What's the DRY way to do this?
