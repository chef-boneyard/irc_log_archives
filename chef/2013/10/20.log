[2013-10-20 02:11:18 -0400] strictlyb: have a question if someone would not mind helping me
[2013-10-20 02:11:20 -0400] strictlyb: jif anyone using the users cookbook from opscode?
[2013-10-20 09:55:57 -0400] glen: hi, how do i load remove .json file and use result in a template?
[2013-10-20 09:56:01 -0400] glen: remote*
[2013-10-20 10:19:24 -0400] dmdeklerk: Did you know you could make a report handler make a Nabaztag Rabbits ear flap!
[2013-10-20 13:06:37 -0400] glen: i'm trying to write chef plugin
[2013-10-20 13:07:21 -0400] glen: so i write 'require plugin hostname', but when i print 'fqdn' syumbol. it's empty
[2013-10-20 13:07:25 -0400] glen: what i do wrong?
[2013-10-20 13:08:15 -0400] admin0: hi all .. how do i migrate chef-server/data from one system to another ?
[2013-10-20 13:08:50 -0400] admin0: is a full backup/restore of /opt/chef-server enough ?
[2013-10-20 13:09:15 -0400] admin0: and /etc/chef-server
[2013-10-20 13:11:33 -0400] glen: and can i read attributes of a node in ohai?
[2013-10-20 13:18:12 -0400] glen: also, seems if ohai cookbook reloads plugins, require fqdn -> fqdn is empty
[2013-10-20 13:59:04 -0400] daos: admin0: checking out knife-backup (gem)
[2013-10-20 13:59:20 -0400] daos: oh you mean the actual server files
[2013-10-20 13:59:25 -0400] daos: not the chef data
[2013-10-20 13:59:27 -0400] daos: nm
[2013-10-20 13:59:57 -0400] admin0: i have one chef-server, which will be closed down, and i want to move everything to another one
[2013-10-20 14:00:59 -0400] daos: in terms of configs i'm not so sure but if it were chef11 i'd probably do a clean install with the omnibus installer and then cp the chef-config.rb file and do a `chef-server-ctl reconfigure`
[2013-10-20 14:01:12 -0400] daos: and then migrate all the data with knife-backup
[2013-10-20 14:01:25 -0400] daos: this article might be useful: http://www.ducea.com/2013/03/05/howto-migrate-to-chef-11/
[2013-10-20 14:03:00 -0400] ortho_stice: I'd like to get more verbose log output from OSC erchef.  I'm looking over /var/opt/chef-server/erchef/etc/app.config , hoping to make a setting change to enable debug-level logging.  It's not obvious, and googling has been fruitless so far.  Any advice?
[2013-10-20 14:03:54 -0400] admin0: thank you daos
[2013-10-20 14:05:14 -0400] daos: np\

[2013-10-20 15:38:28 -0400] Joel: trying to use the tomcat recipe from opscode, and bumping into this, thoughts? http://pastebin.com/Uq2xyz49
[2013-10-20 15:43:45 -0400] strictlyb: does anyone here use the users cookbook from opscode cummunity?
[2013-10-20 15:47:25 -0400] jbz: joel:  Are you using the Opscode TOmcat cookbook? I don't see a recipe named 'package' in that one: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/tomcat
[2013-10-20 15:47:53 -0400] Joel: jbz: ahh f me.
[2013-10-20 15:48:01 -0400] jbz: Joel: ?
[2013-10-20 15:48:23 -0400] jbz: strictlyb: I have used it in the past, what's up?
[2013-10-20 15:48:26 -0400] Joel: jbz: nope, I wasnt. thanks.
[2013-10-20 15:48:36 -0400] jbz: Joel:  Oh, no worry...:-)
[2013-10-20 15:49:19 -0400] strictlyb: actually nm got it, thanks
[2013-10-20 15:56:55 -0400] Joel: jbz: using all opscode recipes tomcat is now bombing out not finding keytool, it's looking for a default-java dir which doesn't exist :\
[2013-10-20 15:57:33 -0400] Joel: ahh, looks like I can specify node["tomcat"]["keytool"]
[2013-10-20 17:21:31 -0400] daos: what's the best way to update a chef node to start looking at a new chef server (new FQDN) for updates
[2013-10-20 17:21:50 -0400] daos: i edited /etc/chef/client.rb but it reverted after the first chef-client run
[2013-10-20 17:35:30 -0400] jtgiri_: daos: maybe there is a recipe which is rewriting client.rb ?
[2013-10-20 17:38:42 -0400] daos: yeah
[2013-10-20 17:38:43 -0400] daos: could be
[2013-10-20 18:35:10 -0400] Joel: what stupid thing am I doing when specifying the location of this template? http://pastebin.com/qHteDzCM
[2013-10-20 18:35:37 -0400] Joel: have the following in my recpie: template "sa-webapp"
[2013-10-20 18:36:07 -0400] Joel: missing the .erb it seems.
[2013-10-20 18:40:17 -0400] Majost_: Does anyone know what caused java_ark to break?
[2013-10-20 19:05:01 -0400] Cope: Majost_: y'know a bit more information about the breakage would be very helpful at this stage.
[2013-10-20 19:05:40 -0400] Cope: unless it's so jaw-droppingly obvious and universally known, and I am the sole ignoramus, of course :)
[2013-10-20 19:05:50 -0400] Majost_: heh
[2013-10-20 19:06:00 -0400] Cope: but in that case I'd still benefit from being put in the picture, so to speak
[2013-10-20 19:06:05 -0400] Majost_: I am digging into it right now
[2013-10-20 19:13:23 -0400] Majost_: 2013-10-20_18:57:41.14751 [2013-10-20T14:57:41-04:00] FATAL:  set alternative failed
[2013-10-20 19:14:11 -0400] Majost_: In a nutshell, it looks like the refactoring of the alternatives stuff may have introduced a regression...
[2013-10-20 19:27:26 -0400] Majost_: I think the topic needs to be updated.. it says Chef Client 11.6.0 -- and I think it should be 11.6.2
[2013-10-20 19:46:50 -0400] wishlistmaster: why hasn't anyone actually releasd a production level structured chef repo?
[2013-10-20 19:47:17 -0400] chip-: Can you expand on that/
[2013-10-20 19:47:19 -0400] chip-: ?
[2013-10-20 19:49:11 -0400] wishlistmaster: A chef-repo structure that actually shows a very good layout... like how it'll look like in large networks
[2013-10-20 19:49:43 -0400] wishlistmaster: I noticed that every release/announcement out there are always hanging
[2013-10-20 19:50:38 -0400] chip-: I think because there's no one true way, or it would be a done thing.
[2013-10-20 19:51:30 -0400] chip-: Some orgs want to get infra the hell out of the way of their devs and keep everything segregated; others want devs to be doing as much infra work as possible to support and operationalize their own apps
[2013-10-20 19:51:41 -0400] wishlistmaster: yep. no one true way. But it seems nobody just go contribute on building anything that's mostly *chef-repo* level
[2013-10-20 19:52:01 -0400] wishlistmaster: Even test-kitchen tutorials were focused only on a cookbook
[2013-10-20 19:52:37 -0400] wishlistmaster: haha yeah, I feel that infra-app concern
[2013-10-20 19:52:39 -0400] chip-: That's because TK is for testing cookbook.
[2013-10-20 19:53:23 -0400] wishlistmaster: why call it TK? Analogy is somewhat wrong... "put a kitchen inside a cookbook to test it"
[2013-10-20 19:54:06 -0400] wishlistmaster: that's what one of what I meant "hanging announcement/tutorial"
[2013-10-20 19:55:25 -0400] chip-: *cookbooks
[2013-10-20 19:56:15 -0400] wishlistmaster: chip-, any good chef-repo you know about? been looking a lot of samples that's not limitted to only a single app. Or something which utilizes roles, looking for good and common practice..
[2013-10-20 19:56:51 -0400] chip-: I think there's a couple of things frustrating your search.
[2013-10-20 19:57:07 -0400] chip-: First is the berkshelf pattern of putting every cookbook into its own repo. I think this is *probably* a good thing.
[2013-10-20 19:57:10 -0400] chip-: ymmv.
[2013-10-20 19:57:28 -0400] chip-: Second is that a lot of people aren't using roles & environments heavily right now, though some are.
[2013-10-20 19:57:40 -0400] chip-: These are holy wars I don't really want to step into :)
[2013-10-20 19:58:00 -0400] chip-: To answer the question you're actually asking: Check out etsy's repos, and check out the solowizard.com site by pivotal, and the repo that backs it.
[2013-10-20 19:58:22 -0400] chip-: Solowizard has some good and not-so-good patterns; etsy's stuff is usually stellar.
[2013-10-20 19:59:14 -0400] wishlistmaster: yep... a lot of tools that *looks easy* were only just misleading the PoV for the newcomers
[2013-10-20 19:59:45 -0400] wishlistmaster: yay! I'll look into them
[2013-10-20 20:02:26 -0400] wishlistmaster: Just like this knife-solo thing. How I wish there was a big note in opscode's frontpage that beginners should be aware to not confuse themeselves :D
[2013-10-20 20:05:13 -0400] midnitekiller: ls
[2013-10-20 20:08:45 -0400] Joel: can you create a new user in the db using the database cookbook?
[2013-10-20 20:09:18 -0400] Joel: yup, sill me.
[2013-10-20 20:16:03 -0400] midnitekiller: any good resource out there for DEV in Windows... just like sprout?
[2013-10-20 20:21:26 -0400] quatrix_: Hi, how do I override python's prefix_dir from a wrapper recipe? it only works when overriding from a role/enviornment.
[2013-10-20 20:22:33 -0400] Majost_: quatrix, http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4234
[2013-10-20 20:22:57 -0400] Majost_: It's closed out... but the how-to for working around this issue is described in there
[2013-10-20 20:24:36 -0400] Majost_: it also reasonably explains why and also the plans going forward with Chef.
[2013-10-20 20:25:36 -0400] quatrix_: Majost_: thanks! too bad I didn't ask two hours ago :)
[2013-10-20 20:25:42 -0400] Majost_: heh
[2013-10-20 20:25:43 -0400] Majost_: np
[2013-10-20 20:26:16 -0400] Majost_: midnitekiller, there were a few talks at Chef conf 2013 which were recorded
[2013-10-20 20:27:14 -0400] Majost_: They are worth sitting down and watching -- but they don't get into many best practices nor highlight too many specific anti-patterns.
[2013-10-20 20:27:25 -0400] midnitekiller: Majost, I'll be it out then..
[2013-10-20 20:28:06 -0400] Majost_: One thing I can suggest, which is far underutilized is the use of 'File.node' for constructing paths, as it makes cross-platform cookbooks a little bit easier to deal with.
[2013-10-20 20:31:13 -0400] wishlistmaster: can you run/include a role from a recipe?
[2013-10-20 20:33:45 -0400] wishlistmaster: Majost_, what is that about File.node?
[2013-10-20 20:34:31 -0400] Majost_: sorry.
[2013-10-20 20:34:33 -0400] wishlistmaster: got a ref?
[2013-10-20 20:34:39 -0400] Majost_: I meant to say File.join
[2013-10-20 20:34:40 -0400] Majost_: hah
[2013-10-20 20:36:20 -0400] Majost_: wishlistmaster, http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_attributes.html#attribute-precedence
[2013-10-20 20:36:45 -0400] Majost_: no -- you can include recipes in roles -- I don't see how you load a role from a recipe
[2013-10-20 20:37:14 -0400] Majost_: you can use search to identify things which have the role associated to them
[2013-10-20 20:37:19 -0400] Majost_: but not include
[2013-10-20 20:37:55 -0400] wishlistmaster: yep, just wondering about it. here trying to blackbox everything into roles
[2013-10-20 20:38:25 -0400] Majost_: yeah, roles and wrapper cookbooks tend to conflict -- at least at the moment
[2013-10-20 20:38:49 -0400] Majost_: Chef 12 may allow one to version roles such that they can work better with wrapper cookbooks
[2013-10-20 20:39:30 -0400] Majost_: thats my two cents at least
[2013-10-20 20:39:36 -0400] Majost_: someone else will probably disagree
[2013-10-20 20:39:37 -0400] Majost_: heh
[2013-10-20 20:40:04 -0400] wishlistmaster: were there tools already that generates cookbook attributes to json? something like a base *cookbook -> role* generator
[2013-10-20 20:41:16 -0400] wishlistmaster: nah. I'll take any disagreement. trying to combine every idea in here :D
[2013-10-20 20:42:12 -0400] wishlistmaster: I'm just new with this chef thing. Its sad that it's so good at first glance... yet most guides were discontinued halfway
[2013-10-20 20:44:59 -0400] bastilian: where can i find the "Starter Kit"?
[2013-10-20 20:45:10 -0400] wishlistmaster: Is there?
[2013-10-20 20:45:39 -0400] bastilian: it says so here: https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/chef-repo/
[2013-10-20 20:47:39 -0400] wishlistmaster: anybody here got time? I've got a lot of questions with chef.
[2013-10-20 20:47:53 -0400] wishlistmaster: just hoping someone's interested to be bombarded with a lot of questions :D
[2013-10-20 20:52:11 -0400] wishlistmaster: bastilian, https://github.com/opscode/chef-repo  this?
[2013-10-20 20:52:36 -0400] bastilian: wishlistmaster: thanks got it already. :)
[2013-10-20 20:53:44 -0400] chip-: If you sign up for Hosted Chef free trial here, then the first link is a "starter kit," a .zip file with your keys and an empty repo to help you get started: https://getchef.opscode.com/signup
[2013-10-20 20:54:20 -0400] wishlistmaster: oh, my bad about that
[2013-10-20 20:57:33 -0400] wishlistmaster: as for chef-repo management [combining knife solo, chef-client, berksfile]. Was it preferred to commit everything that's inside /cookbooks/ which berks populate to... is that still a thing?
[2013-10-20 21:00:58 -0400] Majost_: wishlistmaster, I think is something which converts it to json -- but I am not familiar enough with the chef code to say where it is, I might be able to look later -- but if you want to dig around the chef repo is at https://github.com/opscode/chef
[2013-10-20 21:01:22 -0400] Majost_: ah
[2013-10-20 21:01:23 -0400] Majost_: I see
[2013-10-20 21:01:35 -0400] Majost_: yeah, I have moved away from the single chef-repo thing
[2013-10-20 21:01:59 -0400] Majost_: The berkshelf workflow is designed around having very modular code
[2013-10-20 21:02:16 -0400] Majost_: and it makes a lot more sense to me
[2013-10-20 21:05:55 -0400] wishlistmaster: yep. and it's still confusing. Thru "cookbook", could confuse a lot of new comers like me. "init a cookbook, open it, put a bunch of cookbooks inside your cookbook, then treat it as a kitchen to test"
[2013-10-20 21:06:13 -0400] wishlistmaster: here hoping the analogies were taken to consider :D
[2013-10-20 21:21:17 -0400] sacoetzee: hey all
[2013-10-20 21:21:39 -0400] sacoetzee: real quick one here, I have a chef script that installs the splunkstorm forwarder creds automatically. Splunk reports back as installed successfully, but nothing happened.
[2013-10-20 21:21:56 -0400] sacoetzee: Chef logs in debug mode also say successful
[2013-10-20 21:22:33 -0400] sacoetzee: using the bash resource to git er done.
[2013-10-20 21:26:56 -0400] Dantevios: Oh wow chef also has an IRC channel interesting, in all seriousness my company is looking at Puppet vs Chef right now to pick for a solution. Anyone have an opinion as to why Chef is better than Puppet?
[2013-10-20 21:27:55 -0400] wishlistmaster: irc is the new black
[2013-10-20 21:28:16 -0400] countdigi: is that to spin on Paul Mooney? :-)
[2013-10-20 21:28:32 -0400] Dantevios: hey my putty window is black
[2013-10-20 21:28:37 -0400] Dantevios: :O revelation
[2013-10-20 21:29:22 -0400] Majost_: Dantevios, I can't say why one is better vs the other.... However, I can say the community is very good and Opscode is very willing to accept fixes to cookbooks and chef itself.
[2013-10-20 21:29:37 -0400] Majost_: For me, this makes for a good ecosystem to build on
[2013-10-20 21:29:45 -0400] chip-: Dantevios: Are you a developer?
[2013-10-20 21:30:32 -0400] Majost_: Dantevios, and sorry for not answering the question. I hate it when people do that crap to me. hehe
[2013-10-20 21:30:45 -0400] Dantevios: Yes I am a dev
[2013-10-20 21:31:08 -0400] chip-: Puppet made a handy page listing all the features they're adding to their language in 2014. It also serves as a nice reference for "all the features Puppet's parser doesn't have have that Chef has had since day 1": http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/3/reference/lang_experimental_3_2.html
[2013-10-20 21:31:21 -0400] Dantevios: no problem Majost_ you did answer the question :)
[2013-10-20 21:32:40 -0400] daos: :|
[2013-10-20 21:32:41 -0400] daos: lol
[2013-10-20 21:33:00 -0400] Dantevios: Thank chip- that is very useful! You know I heard someone refer to Chef as a fork of Puppet, then I read on someones blog that Chef doesn't offer any new features that Puppet already had and they accused Chef or reinventing the wheel... and I was like... How can that be? There must be something that Chef is doing that Puppet doesn't do.
[2013-10-20 21:33:09 -0400] Dantevios: Devs don't rewrite the wheel for nothing you know? :)
[2013-10-20 21:34:05 -0400] daimonic: they are quite different
[2013-10-20 21:34:45 -0400] Majost_: Dantevios, I know one thing is for sure
[2013-10-20 21:34:53 -0400] Majost_: Chef is default fail-fast
[2013-10-20 21:36:05 -0400] Majost_: you can tell Chef to ignore errors, but the difference being you have to trap and handle them
[2013-10-20 21:36:40 -0400] Majost_: in that sense, you have to trap and handle them in puppet -- but for reason of failing opposed to handling really
[2013-10-20 21:41:47 -0400] Cope: Dantevios: try them both :) I will say that as one who has used both extensively for many years, the Chef community is the massive plus point.
[2013-10-20 21:42:18 -0400] Cope: friendly, knowledgable, happy to help
[2013-10-20 21:43:35 -0400] Cope: there are architectural and philosophical differences which can be argued over, but they're both capable tools; but I would say that the Chef community is the best tech community I have ever encountered in my professional and geek life.
[2013-10-20 21:44:31 -0400] Dantevios: It cetainly seems vibrant Cope thank you :)
[2013-10-20 21:49:16 -0400] Cope: Dantevios: the thing is, anyone doing anything interesting in tech now, either as a developer, an architctect, or an ops person
[2013-10-20 21:49:21 -0400] Cope: anyone in that space is using chef
[2013-10-20 21:49:41 -0400] Cope: so it means you have a truly wide and deep pool of resource to dip into
[2013-10-20 21:49:52 -0400] Cope: on pretty much anything you need to know about as a professional
[2013-10-20 21:50:23 -0400] Cope: and as a giving and friendly community, if one person doesn't know they probably know someone who does, and can introduce you
[2013-10-20 21:51:11 -0400] Cope: so it's much much more than just whether you agree with the chef approach to config management (as it happens I do), but it's the people around you working with the toolset
[2013-10-20 21:58:43 -0400] crombar: Trying to get started with chef, need some advice. I want to use knife-solo to setup ec2 instances. Dev is done via Berkshelf and Vagrant. How would I setup oracle java for the vagrant box using opscode/java cookbook? Do I need to create a wrapper cookbook to override the defaults and add it to the runlist or is there an easier way? Probably create a node config for the vagrant box and specify the attributes there?
[2013-10-20 22:11:30 -0400] Cope: crombar: if you already use berkshelf, I would create a wrapper cookbook which represents the purpose for which you're building infra, and include the java cookbook, and set the attributes in a recipe in the wrapper cookbook with node.set
[2013-10-20 22:16:12 -0400] crombar: Cope: Thanks. I will give it a try that way then. Do I need to add every cookbook to the vagrant runlist then?
[2013-10-20 22:18:11 -0400] Cope: when working with vagrant, berkself will handle that
[2013-10-20 22:18:38 -0400] Cope: i haven't used knife-solo, so i don't know how that functions; perhaps someone else can explain.
[2013-10-20 22:18:51 -0400] Cope: bedtime for me :) o/
[2013-10-20 22:19:29 -0400] crombar: k, probably I should just give it a try then.
[2013-10-20 22:19:31 -0400] Cope: crombar: in case that's not clear: in your wrapper cookbook, just include_recipe java and ensure java is an explicit dependency in your metadata.rb
[2013-10-20 22:19:38 -0400] Cope: berkshelf will solve the deps for you
[2013-10-20 22:19:57 -0400] Cope: recursively
[2013-10-20 22:20:54 -0400] Cope: nn
[2013-10-20 22:21:16 -0400] crombar: Cope: that makes sense. I am just wondering how I would tell vagrant that it should run that cookbook. In case of a node I think I would at that to the node config using knife-solo. But there is no node config when using berkshelf and vagrant. But I guess that is knife-solo specific
[2013-10-20 23:00:11 -0400] daos: have you guys experienced a 403 HTTP Error when attempting to create a file from a template during a bootstrap?
[2013-10-20 23:00:17 -0400] daos: first time i've seen that
[2013-10-20 23:03:23 -0400] daos: looks like it was a fluke--reran the bootstrap and it worked w/o complaint
[2013-10-20 23:03:26 -0400] daos: sorry for the noise
