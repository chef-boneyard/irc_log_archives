[2013-10-06 00:23:30 -0400] manfred: any time I use knife bootstrap on a server in the rackspace cloud, something is seeing it as a rackspace device and decides to set the fqdn to ${ip//./-}.static.cloud-ips.com while rackspace no longer hosts the domains for static.cloud-ips.com to point to the ip addresses anymore, making it so that knife ssh 'role:apache' doesn't work because it is tring to use the fqdn instead of just using the ip address.  I
[2013-10-06 00:23:32 -0400] manfred: see several bugs from a while ago to get it added from back when rackspace hosted the *.static.cloud-ips.com -> ip addrs, but i haven't been able to find anything to revert it or work around the issue besides knife node edit every time you bootstrap
[2013-10-06 00:24:05 -0400] manfred: https://community.rackspace.com/general/f/34/t/623
[2013-10-06 00:25:57 -0400] manfred: hrm, guess i could use -a
[2013-10-06 01:55:47 -0400] michael_mbp: anyone still around?
[2013-10-06 01:57:09 -0400] manfred: i am still waiting to see if anyone has an answer for my earlier query
[2013-10-06 01:58:05 -0400] michael_mbp: ah
[2013-10-06 01:58:41 -0400] manfred: otherwise, no idea if anyone else is around
[2013-10-06 01:59:05 -0400] michael_mbp: tried asking rackspace support?
[2013-10-06 02:01:07 -0400] manfred: i work at rackspace, i have been asking around there for a week, and it turns out no  one uses knife bootstrap except me heh
[2013-10-06 02:01:18 -0400] michael_mbp: oh wow :)
[2013-10-06 02:01:23 -0400] michael_mbp: hehe....
[2013-10-06 02:01:32 -0400] manfred: well i haven't found anyone else that uses it yet
[2013-10-06 02:01:42 -0400] manfred: probably going to send something to the devops list on monday
[2013-10-06 02:01:59 -0400] michael_mbp: yeah that sounds like something internal is causing that.
[2013-10-06 02:02:33 -0400] michael_mbp: or altnernatively (for now) just script the knife node edit in sequence if you can.
[2013-10-06 02:02:48 -0400] michael_mbp: *alternatively... not had coffee yet!
[2013-10-06 02:02:54 -0400] manfred: nah, right now I am probably just going to use -a to choose an atribute
[2013-10-06 02:02:58 -0400] manfred: instead of fqdn
[2013-10-06 02:03:07 -0400] michael_mbp: Are you using Berkshelf by any chance?
[2013-10-06 02:03:41 -0400] manfred: nope
[2013-10-06 02:03:45 -0400] michael_mbp: I'm trying to shed some light on https://gist.github.com/bsodmike/6848415
[2013-10-06 02:03:47 -0400] michael_mbp: ah.
[2013-10-06 02:03:58 -0400] michael_mbp: it's like librarian-chef.
[2013-10-06 02:04:11 -0400] manfred: yeah i know what it is, i have looked at it a little
[2013-10-06 02:04:16 -0400] manfred: but not enough to be able to help at all
[2013-10-06 02:04:22 -0400] manfred: it is awesome when using it with vagrant
[2013-10-06 02:04:25 -0400] michael_mbp: np :)
[2013-10-06 02:04:28 -0400] michael_mbp: yeah!

[2013-10-06 02:04:49 -0400] michael_mbp: I did a test deploy to a droplet on digitalocean, was blown away :D
[2013-10-06 03:14:42 -0400] 17SADFNJW: hey all,
[2013-10-06 03:14:43 -0400] 17SADFNJW: is anyone here using ldap auth with chef gui?
[2013-10-06 03:14:44 -0400] 17SADFNJW: and can talk with me for a moment?
[2013-10-06 03:25:40 -0400] 17SADFNJW: anyone ?
[2013-10-06 03:39:13 -0400] lpb: you dont have to ask if you can ask the question just ask it :)
[2013-10-06 10:33:46 -0400] dmdeklerk: I'm looking for a tutorial or an (open source) application that uses the application_ruby cookbook with a mysql database. Where the database runs on a separate server.
[2013-10-06 11:11:03 -0400] michael_mbp: couldn't you set that up?
[2013-10-06 11:11:17 -0400] michael_mbp: make your own cookbook, or a wrapper over the databases cookbook
[2013-10-06 11:11:48 -0400] michael_mbp: you'll need to configure mysql accordingly though (i.e. allow external access, since it's normally connected to a local socket).
[2013-10-06 11:12:28 -0400] michael_mbp: and you have to update your rails app's database YAML with the DB server info; which you can pass through your main kitchen.
[2013-10-06 11:15:16 -0400] Megadeth: When trying to do "knife upload /" to upgrade from ChefServer 10 to 11, on Windows - I'm getting this error: "ERROR: NotImplementedError: symlink() function is unimplemented on this machine", Clues?
[2013-10-06 11:15:31 -0400] Megadeth: Is Windows even supported for this operation?
[2013-10-06 11:17:31 -0400] Megadeth: ?
[2013-10-06 11:28:14 -0400] dmdeklerk: michael_mbp: what does " which you can pass through your main kitchen" mean?
[2013-10-06 11:28:33 -0400] michael_mbp: so you have your top-level chef-repo right?
[2013-10-06 11:28:42 -0400] michael_mbp: you can make it with knife-solo
[2013-10-06 11:29:06 -0400] michael_mbp: and you list/link up whatever cookbooks you make in there
[2013-10-06 11:29:13 -0400] dmdeklerk: I've chosen to work with chef_solo and vagrant, not even sure if that is the right choice?
[2013-10-06 11:29:15 -0400] michael_mbp: then you can pass all your settings via the attributes
[2013-10-06 11:29:25 -0400] michael_mbp: dmdeklerk: that's fine, same here
[2013-10-06 11:29:39 -0400] yawn: is this an ok channel to ask opsworks related questions?
[2013-10-06 11:29:59 -0400] michael_mbp: yawn: nice handle :p
[2013-10-06 11:30:08 -0400] michael_mbp: probably, rather quiet in here though :(
[2013-10-06 11:31:55 -0400] yawn: i'm currently in the process of porting a non-trivial stack to opsworks - it works pretty flawless in vagrant but I get all kinds of strange errors on opsworks (currently it's "unable to locate the init.d script". anyone has any best practices to share on how to debug in the opsworks environment?
[2013-10-06 11:32:41 -0400] dmdeklerk: the thing with chef is that there are so many ways of doing things. chef-solo, chef-server, then theres knife, knife-solo and chef-solo-search. test-kitchen etc.. then there is the application_ruby cookbook (which I think I should use) which is sometimes used only with data_bags and sometimes without data_bags. Which make me think I need data_bag search but is/is'nt in chef-solo. I realy whish there was a book out or anything.
[2013-10-06 11:33:41 -0400] dmdeklerk: </rant>
[2013-10-06 11:33:42 -0400] michael_mbp: well you go to start somewhere
[2013-10-06 11:33:54 -0400] michael_mbp: so I went with knife-solo, vagrant and berkshelf
[2013-10-06 11:34:05 -0400] michael_mbp: so far so good, am writing a HOWTO in the process
[2013-10-06 11:34:29 -0400] dmdeklerk: a howto? need some peer review ;)
[2013-10-06 11:35:43 -0400] michael_mbp: https://github.com/bsodmike/deployment_kitchen
[2013-10-06 11:35:48 -0400] michael_mbp: that's the crude list of it
[2013-10-06 11:36:08 -0400] dmdeklerk: Thank you will check that out immediately
[2013-10-06 11:36:38 -0400] dmdeklerk: btw I really wish this would come out http://www.amazon.com/Chef-Definitive-Guide-Stephen-Nelson-Smith/dp/1449327443
[2013-10-06 11:36:53 -0400] michael_mbp: ah
[2013-10-06 11:37:01 -0400] dmdeklerk: but its cancelled/delayed or something
[2013-10-06 11:38:39 -0400] Megadeth: Anyone regarding the symlink not implemented issue?
[2013-10-06 11:40:16 -0400] michael_mbp: no idea
[2013-10-06 14:55:38 -0400] alunduil: Is it possible to print the attributes after merge in chef-solo to see what value an attribute takes?
[2013-10-06 16:43:47 -0400] s2r2: alunduil: you could try running chef-shell in solo mode (I think this exists...) and examine node[:whatever] there
[2013-10-06 17:06:38 -0400] alunduil: s2r2, good call.  Thanks!
