[2013-04-25 15:44:11 -0400] agoddard: ohai
[2013-04-25 15:44:18 -0400] justincampbell: \o/
[2013-04-25 15:44:23 -0400] zts: HI TEAM
[2013-04-25 15:44:25 -0400] UForgotten: watching on the live stream from sunny florida, wish I could be there
[2013-04-25 15:44:32 -0400] ericReeves: #hugops
[2013-04-25 15:45:13 -0400] UForgotten: anyone know what the KDURA in the logo means?
[2013-04-25 15:50:56 -0400] juliancdunn: UForgotten: the what?
[2013-04-25 15:51:15 -0400] UForgotten: look at the new opscode logo on the shirt and screen. It says 'KDURA' in morse code.
[2013-04-25 15:51:35 -0400] juliancdunn: UForgotten: haha... I'm told it doesn't mean anything
[2013-04-25 15:51:42 -0400] UForgotten: that's quite lame.
[2013-04-25 15:51:50 -0400] UForgotten: imho.. ;)
[2013-04-25 15:52:12 -0400] UForgotten: they manged to embed 'Opscode code can' in the animation... not sure why they blew it on the logo
[2013-04-25 15:52:45 -0400] holoway: whats up irc
[2013-04-25 15:53:09 -0400] jtimberman: Howdy!
[2013-04-25 15:54:40 -0400] UForgotten: I also thought it was interesting they played "that s#!t cray" uncensored.
[2013-04-25 15:55:04 -0400] holoway: UForgotten: yeah, probably should've had the radio edit in there :)
[2013-04-25 15:55:25 -0400] holoway: easy thing to miss
[2013-04-25 15:55:27 -0400] agoddard: juliancdunn: no way, I got the inside story, it does mean something.. "Kanban Dev Utility Racked Applications" it's the new hotness
[2013-04-25 15:58:18 -0400] agoddard: maybe reverse morse backronym it, the codenames for chef 12,13,14,15 - Kilo,Delta,Uniform,Romeo,Alpha? hmm might not wanna call it alpha.. ok, my idea sucks. :/
[2013-04-25 16:02:58 -0400] KarlHungus: \o/
[2013-04-25 16:05:33 -0400] juliancdunn: agoddard: lol
[2013-04-25 16:12:57 -0400] pcn: ohai chefs
[2013-04-25 16:13:14 -0400] pcn: Can anyone point me to the wifi password location for the conf?  My phone is warm
[2013-04-25 16:14:25 -0400] agoddard: SanFrancisco
[2013-04-25 16:14:35 -0400] agoddard: pcn: ^
[2013-04-25 16:17:15 -0400] pcn: Thanks
[2013-04-25 16:17:30 -0400] pcn: Thanks!
[2013-04-25 16:20:20 -0400] zts: New dashboard looks pretty nice
[2013-04-25 16:21:21 -0400] eherot: Am I supposed to know the password to the ChefConfAttendee wireless network?
[2013-04-25 16:21:40 -0400] zts: eherot: it is "SanFrancisco" (but not sure where it's written down, I asked someone)
[2013-04-25 16:21:57 -0400] eherot: zts: ok I feel less dumb now :-)
[2013-04-25 16:39:57 -0400] pcn: zts: dashboard is very cool.  I want to be able to get logs from failed runs etc. from knife.
[2013-04-25 16:42:36 -0400] zts: pcn: ditto, I'm planning to implement something of that nature with mcollective later this year
[2013-04-25 16:43:04 -0400] zts: but cool to see it appearing in Private Chef :)
[2013-04-25 16:45:15 -0400] zts: I like where this talk is going...
[2013-04-25 16:45:35 -0400] pcn: Yeah, super intereting teaser for what I hope it is
[2013-04-25 16:45:53 -0400] zts: https://github.com/zts/chef-cookbook-managed_directory # little hack that I did exploring this in the past
[2013-04-25 16:50:16 -0400] pcn: Less whizbang than I hoped, but the lesson learned: it's possible to fix technical problems with process and selective exposure
[2013-04-25 16:51:38 -0400] zts: yeah, comes under the heading of designing for extension and re-use.  That does need to get talked about more
[2013-04-25 17:12:31 -0400] holoway: pcn: you'll be able to get that data from the API
[2013-04-25 17:12:42 -0400] holoway: that's the only way we roll
[2013-04-25 17:13:41 -0400] holoway: the report primitives (the API level stuff) will be open source for sure once it's ready
[2013-04-25 17:14:10 -0400] holoway: same with he pushy stuff you saw
[2013-04-25 17:15:05 -0400] zts: holoway: oh cool, I'd been assuming that'd be a value add in OPC/OHC
[2013-04-25 17:23:05 -0400] newgoliath: Thats what Boeing does.
[2013-04-25 17:24:06 -0400] holoway: zts: there is value add there (the graphs, easy display, etc)
[2013-04-25 17:24:37 -0400] newgoliath: Push?
[2013-04-25 17:24:43 -0400] hikeit: hey there quiet room anyone know if any of that breakfast is still hiding on a cart somewhere?
[2013-04-25 17:25:58 -0400] zts: holoway: That's cool - I wasn't upset with the understanding I did have, and the reality is even better :)
[2013-04-25 17:31:18 -0400] holoway: zts: if it's a primitive, we'l open source it - we'll likely do it after we build something on top of it first (reporting, push jobs, etc)
[2013-04-25 17:35:11 -0400] zts: holoway: that's eminently sensible (better the committing to an API, then discovering that 'mistakes were made').  I'd gently suggest that there's room for improvement in how reporting/push were announced though, to be fair, it doesn't appear to be hurting :)
[2013-04-25 17:37:00 -0400] holoway: well, we're not perfect - but we are transparently imperfect :)
[2013-04-25 17:37:35 -0400] zts: And that is why we <3 you
[2013-04-25 17:56:08 -0400] Majost__: Does anyone know the wifi password?
[2013-04-25 17:56:19 -0400] whack: SanFrancisco
[2013-04-25 17:56:21 -0400] hikeit: SanFrancisco
[2013-04-25 17:56:27 -0400] hikeit: damn, beat me to it!
[2013-04-25 17:57:27 -0400] Majost__: Did they change it during the talks??
[2013-04-25 17:57:37 -0400] Majost__: And then back?
[2013-04-25 17:58:01 -0400] hikeit: been working for me since yesterday
[2013-04-25 17:58:34 -0400] Majost_: huh

[2013-04-25 18:03:24 -0400] hikeit: it is the best the best the best
[2013-04-25 18:35:16 -0400] Majost_: I wonder if their turbines use zigbee. heh
[2013-04-25 18:40:38 -0400] UForgotten: nice, lots of hams in the audience lol
[2013-04-25 18:41:03 -0400] UForgotten: the geek trifecta for me is linux, ham radio, and anime.

[2013-04-25 18:46:54 -0400] hikeit: a clip of knight rider would've been better
[2013-04-25 18:50:34 -0400] eherot: They just used it 'cause it's NBC ;-)
[2013-04-25 20:41:09 -0400] UForgotten: Missing out by not being there, no live streams of breakout sessions :(
[2013-04-25 20:43:08 -0400] ssd7: UForgotten: they are being video taped, so I believe they should be up later.
[2013-04-25 20:43:26 -0400] ssd7: I'm guessing there is no tape involved actually :)
[2013-04-25 20:44:19 -0400] ssd7: hemulen: Hrmm, there is one in mine...
[2013-04-25 20:44:36 -0400] UForgotten: yes, hoping some are getting posted later
[2013-04-25 20:51:19 -0400] ortho_stice: word is (from the speaker briefing) that breakout videos should be on youtube "in a few days"
[2013-04-25 22:05:34 -0400] ssd7: f
[2013-04-25 22:05:38 -0400] ssd7: oops :)
[2013-04-25 22:43:18 -0400] pcn: There's a camera in the back of B+C
[2013-04-25 22:58:44 -0400] zts: no camera in Regency, but I've seen them in the other rooms I've visited
[2013-04-25 23:22:21 -0400] rberger: Who's planning on going to the Saturday Chef Hackday and what are some of the things people plan to hack on?
[2013-04-25 23:48:02 -0400] ssd7: juliancdunn: +1
[2013-04-25 23:48:30 -0400] ssd7: juliancdunn: I think I'm out by then.  Anyone interested in an evening hack session tonight or tomorrow
[2013-04-25 23:55:42 -0400] Majost_: To the Ospcode presenter of the Azure talk: THANK YOU * 1000
[2013-04-25 23:57:09 -0400] Majost_: The winrm_setup.bat will make my life a LOT easier now.
