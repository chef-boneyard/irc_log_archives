[2013-04-27 06:16:40 -0400] ericReeves: And it's over  :(
[2013-04-27 06:16:47 -0400] ericReeves: I haz a sad.
[2013-04-27 09:39:02 -0400] zts: accidentally late night.  Hack day is going to hurt..
[2013-04-27 17:36:50 -0400] KarlHungus: hack day?
[2013-04-27 17:37:15 -0400] justincampbell: plane day
[2013-04-27 17:38:04 -0400] walbenzi: hack day!
[2013-04-27 17:38:24 -0400] ZsoL1: sick day :(
[2013-04-27 17:38:31 -0400] KarlHungus: walbenzi: is it on right now? can someone relay info to here or #chef-hacking ?
[2013-04-27 17:38:59 -0400] walbenzi: I can relay what is happening.
[2013-04-27 17:39:30 -0400] KarlHungus: ^5. petecheslock: ping
[2013-04-27 17:39:36 -0400] walbenzi: Ben Rockwood officially asked the dumbest question of the day "Is there any underwear on the floor around you?
[2013-04-27 17:40:03 -0400] walbenzi: So no more prefacing questions with "this is a dumb question."
[2013-04-27 17:40:22 -0400] walbenzi: We are going over the features of Joyent's offerings and smartOS
[2013-04-27 17:40:31 -0400] walbenzi: Do people here want a summary?
[2013-04-27 17:40:35 -0400] KarlHungus: ahh. want. but not in the cards at my current gig =)
[2013-04-27 17:40:57 -0400] KarlHungus: walbenzi: thats ok. i'm familiar with joyent :P
[2013-04-27 17:40:59 -0400] ZsoL1: i'm interested in the hack projects ;p
[2013-04-27 17:41:11 -0400] walbenzi: When we get there, I will post those.
[2013-04-27 17:41:14 -0400] KarlHungus: yah. is there a github repo for the hack topics?
[2013-04-27 17:41:36 -0400] KarlHungus: aha! you west coast people must have had a fun night =)
[2013-04-27 17:42:12 -0400] walbenzi: headaches all around ;)
[2013-04-27 18:31:02 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - yo - what's
[2013-04-27 18:31:23 -0400] petecheslock: *up
[2013-04-27 18:36:15 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - let me know if you're around - maybe we can open up a google hangout - we're just starting the hackday now
[2013-04-27 18:58:43 -0400] KarlHungus: petecheslock: hey. here
[2013-04-27 18:58:57 -0400] KarlHungus: is there a repo up that you're working from?
[2013-04-27 18:59:24 -0400] petecheslock: yea - we just setup a freebsd-int branch in the main omnibus-ruby repo - let me get you the link
[2013-04-27 18:59:33 -0400] petecheslock: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-ruby/tree/freebsd-int
[2013-04-27 18:59:48 -0400] KarlHungus: cool, forking now
[2013-04-27 19:00:04 -0400] petecheslock: has 2 of the 3 commits you did before merged in as PR's.  The 3rd commit (cookbooks stuff) - i moved over to the omnibus cookbook here.  https://github.com/petecheslock/omnibus/compare/freebsd
[2013-04-27 19:01:08 -0400] petecheslock: the omnibus-software repo I rebased and forked in my github - all your stuff + some minor cleanup rebased on master - https://github.com/petecheslock/omnibus-software/tree/freebsd
[2013-04-27 19:01:35 -0400] petecheslock: the "biggest" change is really to omnibus-chef - the vagrant file is totally different.  but I have an idea there.
[2013-04-27 19:02:31 -0400] petecheslock: the hardest thing that I can't figure out (and could use some help) is the bento freebsd base box build stuff - moving from zfs to ufs(?) - so that we can try to build an 8.1 box and see if omnibus builds there and works on 8.x
[2013-04-27 19:02:54 -0400] KarlHungus: ahh, ok. i can definitely help there =)
[2013-04-27 19:03:12 -0400] KarlHungus: what os target 8.1? on ufs, not zfs?
[2013-04-27 19:03:41 -0400] KarlHungus: i have to dig up some ufs notes, but it won't be too much work at all
[2013-04-27 19:04:22 -0400] petecheslock: i tried doing a bento taking your 8.3/9.1 code and change the ISO to do an 8.2 or 8.1 - but the issue I got i had sent you before.
[2013-04-27 19:04:52 -0400] petecheslock: in the meantime i'm working with schisamo to get the omnibus side testing on the original 9.1 boxes just so we can work out the vagrant file updates
[2013-04-27 19:05:29 -0400] KarlHungus: got it. 8.3 was a big change to v28 zfs
[2013-04-27 19:05:43 -0400] KarlHungus: do you need boxes?
[2013-04-27 19:05:48 -0400] KarlHungus: i have ones built
[2013-04-27 19:06:07 -0400] KarlHungus: let me push them somewhere you can download
[2013-04-27 19:06:29 -0400] petecheslock: i've got 8.3 and 9.1 boxes already
[2013-04-27 19:06:36 -0400] petecheslock: ones I built from your bento code before
[2013-04-27 19:06:44 -0400] KarlHungus: ok, cool
[2013-04-27 19:37:42 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - had you gotten those freebsd boxes to mount nfs with vagrant 1.2?
[2013-04-27 19:41:31 -0400] miah: sup nerds
[2013-04-27 19:49:35 -0400] KarlHungus: havent tried vagrant 1.2
[2013-04-27 19:49:42 -0400] KarlHungus: will update to that now
[2013-04-27 19:51:18 -0400] KarlHungus: dmg, right? not gem?
[2013-04-27 19:51:40 -0400] justincampbell: (_)
[2013-04-27 20:01:33 -0400] miah: no more vagrant gems :(
[2013-04-27 20:03:23 -0400] BryanWB: how much memory overhead does chef-zero have?
[2013-04-27 20:04:55 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - yea - no gems - but the new omnibus-chef project won't need it
[2013-04-27 20:05:34 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - when you get the dmg -you'll have to hack this back in place - https://github.com/jssjr/vagrant/commit/5cbc3d205a96f59067d2507d2a5b9ef974fc0923
[2013-04-27 20:06:01 -0400] KarlHungus: petecheslock: yep. almost done with that merge
[2013-04-27 20:06:33 -0400] KarlHungus: should be able to run it in a couple minutes. we have vagrant1.1 in play at work, so i expect nfs to work
[2013-04-27 20:07:27 -0400] petecheslock: yea - looks like after that patch it works - https://gist.github.com/petecheslock/de92931001615d274e96
[2013-04-27 20:10:19 -0400] KarlHungus: oh. interesting. if that requires a manual patch in vagrant then i'm going to refactor around it
[2013-04-27 20:12:23 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - yea - now just dealing with the shell provisioner - check out the vagrant file in the master branch of omnibus-chef - i'm just hacking that now to add in basic freebsd 9.1 from my old box
[2013-04-27 20:25:09 -0400] KarlHungus: petecheslock: did you hit this:
[2013-04-27 20:25:09 -0400] KarlHungus: Vagrant attempted to execute the capability 'mount_virtualbox_shared_folder'
[2013-04-27 20:25:09 -0400] KarlHungus: on the detect guest OS 'freebsd', but the guest doesn't
[2013-04-27 20:25:27 -0400] petecheslock: oh - yea - let me push my dirty hacks
[2013-04-27 20:25:40 -0400] ssd7: BryanWB: Unsure, working on a hack day project re chef-zero?
[2013-04-27 20:26:51 -0400] KarlHungus: ahh. i see
[2013-04-27 20:26:57 -0400] KarlHungus: missed a :nfs => true
[2013-04-27 20:27:23 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - yea - i did this:  https://gist.github.com/petecheslock/9be76033732bde4ebf25
[2013-04-27 20:28:03 -0400] KarlHungus: i see why you need the -alldirs hack now ;)
[2013-04-27 20:28:23 -0400] KarlHungus:   config.vm.synced_folder File.dirname(__FILE__), "/vagrant", :nfs => use_nfs, id: "vagrant-root"
[2013-04-27 20:28:36 -0400] KarlHungus: that might avoid it. i'll know in a sec
[2013-04-27 20:34:40 -0400] petecheslock: so far - i'm at the point where the vagrant shell provisioner fails on this now - like  sudo isn't actually being run.    https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/master/plugins/provisioners/shell/provisioner.rb#L17
[2013-04-27 20:34:40 -0400] petecheslock: in vagrant debug it shows that it didn't run with sudo - perm denied.  run it manually with sudo - good to go
[2013-04-27 20:34:41 -0400] BryanWB: ssd7, not atm, but reading how chris roberts already put support for it into vagabond https://github.com/chrisroberts/vagabond/tree/develop
[2013-04-27 20:45:42 -0400] ssd7: BryanWB: So, I'm pretty convinced something like chef-zero is the right way to go.  If the resource footprint is too big right now, I imagine we could fix that
[2013-04-27 20:46:29 -0400] BryanWB: ssd7, i agree it's the way to go, was just curious if i need to spin up an aws instance when i run it or if it will fit in ram on my laptop along w/ 3 cassandra nodes :)
[2013-04-27 20:50:45 -0400] jtimberman: KarlHungus: make sure to use 1.2.1 not 1.2.0
[2013-04-27 20:50:54 -0400] KarlHungus: 1.2.2 is what i have
[2013-04-27 20:50:57 -0400] KarlHungus: should i downgrade?
[2013-04-27 20:51:25 -0400] jtimberman: oh
[2013-04-27 20:51:30 -0400] jtimberman: i didn't know there was a 1.2.2 :)
[2013-04-27 20:51:33 -0400] jtimberman: Use that.
[2013-04-27 20:51:53 -0400] KarlHungus: neither did i until pete asked me to check on vagrant 1.2. i didnt know there was a 1.2!
[2013-04-27 20:57:34 -0400] KarlHungus: petecheslock: weird. i'm hitting the chown thing too
[2013-04-27 20:57:44 -0400] KarlHungus: but i can run it fine when i ssh in
[2013-04-27 20:58:23 -0400] petecheslock: yea- exactly
[2013-04-27 20:58:33 -0400] petecheslock: if you run in debug - seems like vagrant isn't running the sudo
[2013-04-27 20:58:39 -0400] petecheslock: or are you doing non-sudo
[2013-04-27 20:58:43 -0400] petecheslock: then that's weird
[2013-04-27 20:58:43 -0400] KarlHungus: i dont have to use sudo
[2013-04-27 20:59:02 -0400] KarlHungus: maybe it isn't mounted yet? something sneakier?
[2013-04-27 20:59:31 -0400] petecheslock: add VAGRANT_LOG=debug and see if you see anything there
[2013-04-27 21:01:58 -0400] petecheslock: ohhh
[2013-04-27 21:02:21 -0400] petecheslock: when it runs it non-sudo it's fine - for some odd reason (hfs?) when it runs as sudo it gives  chown: /tmp/vagrant-chef-1/chef-solo-1/cookbooks/yum: Operation not permitted (for example)
[2013-04-27 21:02:58 -0400] petecheslock: let me hack out that sudo part and see
[2013-04-27 21:09:29 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - yea - something is fucked and I don't know what.  https://gist.github.com/petecheslock/6214f449e05e8a7b3a0f
[2013-04-27 21:09:40 -0400] petecheslock: probably something vagrant related that isn't playing nice with freebsd
[2013-04-27 21:16:13 -0400] KarlHungus: chown("templates",1001,-1)                       ERR#1 'Operation not permitted'
[2013-04-27 21:16:19 -0400] KarlHungus: WAT
[2013-04-27 21:16:22 -0400] KarlHungus: thats fucked up
[2013-04-27 21:16:50 -0400] KarlHungus: ahh. nm. -1 is the placeholder
[2013-04-27 21:17:02 -0400] petecheslock: i'm monkey patching the chef solo provisioner now
[2013-04-27 21:17:07 -0400] KarlHungus: mappall is set, so you should need anything else
[2013-04-27 21:17:08 -0400] petecheslock: to disable using sudo
[2013-04-27 21:17:15 -0400] petecheslock: -alldirs
[2013-04-27 21:17:18 -0400] petecheslock: or maybe not
[2013-04-27 21:17:24 -0400] petecheslock: let me remove that and see if it works without
[2013-04-27 21:18:11 -0400] KarlHungus: well https://github.com/jssjr/omnibus-chef/blob/freebsd/Vagrantfile#L142-L145 gets around the alldirs issue
[2013-04-27 21:18:58 -0400] KarlHungus: https://gist.github.com/jssjr/c22080b5efbd57cd477c for the exports
[2013-04-27 21:21:10 -0400] petecheslock: oh - interesting - i'll pull that in my local
[2013-04-27 21:35:30 -0400] KarlHungus: bah. i'm diving far too deep trying to fix this
[2013-04-27 21:41:10 -0400] petecheslock: the sudo thing?  yea - it's crazy - i don't know why bsd doesn't like that.  going to hack around it and see if i can at least get chef to run
[2013-04-27 21:43:20 -0400] petecheslock: need to somehow hack this plugins/provisioners/chef/provisioner/base.rb - to get it to not run as sudo (or figure out why when it runs as sudo it fails)
[2013-04-27 21:47:23 -0400] KarlHungus: meh. what line is it?
[2013-04-27 21:47:33 -0400] KarlHungus: what about just doing 'chown -Rf' ;)
[2013-04-27 21:51:15 -0400] KarlHungus: yay. that works
[2013-04-27 21:57:11 -0400] petecheslock: oh - for real?
[2013-04-27 21:57:46 -0400] KarlHungus: running the provision now. yeah. it works by just ignoring any failures. so it "works"
[2013-04-27 21:57:58 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - same command comm.sudo("chown -Rf blah blah?
[2013-04-27 21:58:15 -0400] KarlHungus: yeah
[2013-04-27 22:00:46 -0400] KarlHungus: https://gist.github.com/jssjr/6b9d95a5dc1164deab7e
[2013-04-27 22:00:48 -0400] KarlHungus: closer :P
[2013-04-27 22:01:08 -0400] petecheslock: yea - i might have already patched that one
[2013-04-27 22:01:12 -0400] petecheslock: the shell provisioner
[2013-04-27 22:01:21 -0400] petecheslock: but if you're that far you can probably run the project manually
[2013-04-27 22:01:33 -0400] KarlHungus: yeah
[2013-04-27 22:02:00 -0400] petecheslock: guessing it's failing on the removing of the dpkg/rpm
[2013-04-27 22:02:02 -0400] KarlHungus: this might actually require the alldirs patch
[2013-04-27 22:02:12 -0400] KarlHungus: yep. i added an elif around it
[2013-04-27 22:02:25 -0400] petecheslock: no idea if this will work
[2013-04-27 22:02:25 -0400] petecheslock: https://gist.github.com/petecheslock/37c1b96a5d8f988d2c20#file-a-rb-L101-L110
[2013-04-27 22:02:28 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - yea same thing
[2013-04-27 22:20:17 -0400] KarlHungus: ahh. haha. i need to install git if i'm going to pull repos from github through bundler
[2013-04-27 22:21:40 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - do this:  https://gist.github.com/petecheslock/9756cb098b3974f1e48a
[2013-04-27 22:21:54 -0400] petecheslock: my fork of the omnibus cookbook that will run to setup the build env.
[2013-04-27 22:22:04 -0400] petecheslock: just your stuff from the omnibus-ruby project
[2013-04-27 22:22:15 -0400] KarlHungus: but i dont have git yet ;)
[2013-04-27 22:23:24 -0400] KarlHungus: i added another provisioner to install git
[2013-04-27 22:27:53 -0400] benr: cuddletech.com/tmp/chef-11.4.0-177-g451b7fb_0.smartos.5.11.sh
[2013-04-27 22:28:03 -0400] benr: smartos omnibus. w00t.
[2013-04-27 22:28:07 -0400] KarlHungus: ^5
[2013-04-27 22:28:29 -0400] petecheslock: benr - woot!
[2013-04-27 22:28:51 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - i'm at the compile stage - feeling good (crossing fingers)
[2013-04-27 22:28:53 -0400] KarlHungus: petecheslock: wow
[2013-04-27 22:28:54 -0400] KarlHungus: git merge-base freebsd pete/freebsd
[2013-04-27 22:28:56 -0400] KarlHungus: nothing.
[2013-04-27 22:28:59 -0400] petecheslock: it's your old build code, so i'm almost positive it will work
[2013-04-27 22:29:11 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - which projec?
[2013-04-27 22:29:22 -0400] KarlHungus: thats omnibus, not omnibus-ruby
[2013-04-27 22:29:39 -0400] petecheslock: that's odd - should be there.  https://github.com/petecheslock/omnibus/tree/freebsd
[2013-04-27 22:29:40 -0400] KarlHungus: ahh. its changed!
[2013-04-27 22:29:54 -0400] petecheslock: yea - all cookbooks moved out of omnibus-ruby
[2013-04-27 22:29:59 -0400] petecheslock: community cookbooks
[2013-04-27 22:30:10 -0400] KarlHungus: lol, i put my head down for 2 weeks =)
[2013-04-27 22:30:42 -0400] petecheslock: heh - yea - this is all the very new stuff that schisamo just did the talk on at chef-conf
[2013-04-27 22:30:53 -0400] petecheslock: it's much simpler/cleaner
[2013-04-27 22:31:28 -0400] KarlHungus: so i dont need omnibus-software any longer?
[2013-04-27 22:32:12 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - nope you'll need that
[2013-04-27 22:32:26 -0400] KarlHungus: my fork? jssjr/omnibus-software@freebsd ?
[2013-04-27 22:33:04 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - yea - i'm using your same fork with a minor cleanup
[2013-04-27 22:33:14 -0400] KarlHungus: ok. then this run should build =)
[2013-04-27 22:33:22 -0400] KarlHungus: you're compiling still?
[2013-04-27 22:33:23 -0400] petecheslock: https://github.com/petecheslock/omnibus-software/commits/freebsd
[2013-04-27 22:33:33 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - yea - still compiling - but it's all the same code at this point
[2013-04-27 22:33:35 -0400] petecheslock: so should be
[2013-04-27 22:33:37 -0400] petecheslock: *build
[2013-04-27 22:33:43 -0400] petecheslock: it's the earlier stuff that i'm past now
[2013-04-27 22:36:56 -0400] petecheslock: KarlHungus - i did find some typos - maybe from a bad merge  - https://github.com/petecheslock/omnibus-software/commit/c9c81de52e1cd53cc6e50644c08f0b86087178d7  wasn't sure on line 52
