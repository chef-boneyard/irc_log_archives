[2013-04-26 00:09:51 -0400] UForgotten: gin and juice? seriously?
[2013-04-26 00:10:13 -0400] zts: should've played the Gourds version instead
[2013-04-26 00:10:15 -0400] UForgotten: the tech crew on this has certainly had a zero-fracks-given attitude
[2013-04-26 00:10:31 -0400] eherot: UForgotten: I choose to hand it to them for that.
[2013-04-26 00:10:49 -0400] UForgotten: agreed, much respect
[2013-04-26 00:11:40 -0400] zts: rberger: I'll be there, trying to remember what I was going to hack on.  Things that spring to mind are converting the chef-ssl gem to a knife plugin, and maybe creating an LWRP for installing perl modules using cpanm
[2013-04-26 00:13:23 -0400] UForgotten: try small
[2013-04-26 00:13:38 -0400] eherot: Siri on stage.  Brave soul.
[2013-04-26 00:13:52 -0400] UForgotten: srsly, could have seen that train wreck coming
[2013-04-26 00:14:04 -0400] eherot: Audience participation time!
[2013-04-26 00:16:42 -0400] UForgotten: riot: the anti-ea.  trololol
[2013-04-26 00:21:51 -0400] hikeit: http://www.amazon.com/Adesso-Berk-Shelf-Floor-Lamp/dp/B001WAKJIK
[2013-04-26 00:23:15 -0400] eherot: hikeit: ermahgerd berk self.
[2013-04-26 00:24:51 -0400] UForgotten: yo dawg, I heard you like chef, so we'll chef your chef so you can chef while you chef
[2013-04-26 00:26:34 -0400] hikeit: :%s/hackday/cookoff/g
[2013-04-26 00:30:52 -0400] zts: I don't remember that picture being on the cover of Design Patterns
[2013-04-26 00:31:58 -0400] eherot: zts: first edition ;-)
[2013-04-26 00:35:31 -0400] zts: hm!
[2013-04-26 00:38:57 -0400] ortho_stice: So wait, do people seriously not use roles because they are hard to distribute?
[2013-04-26 00:39:20 -0400] zts: a lot of people in the chef community seem to be down on roles
[2013-04-26 00:39:25 -0400] ortho_stice: huh
[2013-04-26 00:39:32 -0400] hikeit: we use 'em all over the place
[2013-04-26 00:39:38 -0400] hikeit: :)
[2013-04-26 00:39:38 -0400] ortho_stice: as do we
[2013-04-26 00:40:25 -0400] ortho_stice: (with glue to distribute them, and naming conventions to clarify their facets, and keeping them under git to provide versioning)
[2013-04-26 00:40:36 -0400] UForgotten: TMTOWTDI kills me on a daily basis
[2013-04-26 00:40:44 -0400] UForgotten: you could have one cookbook to do everything, or cookbooks for each app
[2013-04-26 00:40:59 -0400] UForgotten: so many dimensions to design
[2013-04-26 00:41:35 -0400] UForgotten: roles are great for running specific recipes from multiple cookbooks into one thing i.e. "web server"
[2013-04-26 00:41:41 -0400] UForgotten: not sure why people hate on roles.
[2013-04-26 00:45:03 -0400] eherot: sounds like Riot is using cookbooks a bit like roles.
[2013-04-26 00:45:10 -0400] eherot: default cookbooks that is
[2013-04-26 00:45:25 -0400] eherot: default *recipes*
[2013-04-26 00:47:42 -0400] UForgotten: not sure what kind of vm he's running in vagrant but ours take bloody forever to bring up.
[2013-04-26 00:47:59 -0400] UForgotten: and there's still serious problems with shared drives in virtualbox.
[2013-04-26 00:51:16 -0400] ortho_stice: only if you write!
[2013-04-26 00:51:42 -0400] ortho_stice: who needs to write data anyway?
[2013-04-26 00:52:28 -0400] eherot: writing data is dead
[2013-04-26 00:52:36 -0400] ortho_stice: it's not WEBSCALE
[2013-04-26 00:54:55 -0400] UForgotten: dance, puppets.... oh shi- can't say puppet at a chef conference trolol
[2013-04-26 01:01:04 -0400] Majost_: FATAL: Mixlib::ShellOut::ShellCommandFailed: execute[Install chef-client service using winsw] (chef-client::service line 254) had an error: Mixlib::ShellOut::ShellCommandFailed: Expected process to exit with [0], but received '-2146232576'
[2013-04-26 01:01:13 -0400] Majost_: Anyone seen that one before?
[2013-04-26 01:01:14 -0400] Majost_: heh
[2013-04-26 01:03:19 -0400] Majost_: nm
[2013-04-26 01:03:30 -0400] Majost_: pebkac
[2013-04-26 03:08:54 -0400] jfoy: is there an evening hack session under way?
[2013-04-26 14:40:37 -0400] ssd7: Morning ChefConf!
[2013-04-26 14:40:46 -0400] ZsoL: \o/
[2013-04-26 14:51:08 -0400] rep0st: ohai chefconf
[2013-04-26 14:51:40 -0400] rep0st: juliancdunn: <3 the antipatterns talk. makes me feel good i'm going in the right direction
[2013-04-26 14:54:14 -0400] zts: morning!
[2013-04-26 15:17:02 -0400] UForgotten: ohai-o.
[2013-04-26 16:01:32 -0400] Majost_: does anyone know what ohai detects for node['kernel']['machine'] on 32 bit Windows variants
[2013-04-26 16:06:42 -0400] ssd7: Will there by any remote participation set up for the hack day tomorrow?  Would love to join from afar (have to fly out tonight)
[2013-04-26 16:17:37 -0400] hikeit: anyone know if adam's keynote is being broadcast?
[2013-04-26 16:50:58 -0400] agoddard: wifi :|
[2013-04-26 16:51:31 -0400] juliancdunn: rep0st: thanks for coming!
[2013-04-26 16:51:51 -0400] juliancdunn: yeah, WiFi fail... I'm on my 3G brick
[2013-04-26 16:53:25 -0400] hikeit: -> tether
[2013-04-26 17:04:25 -0400] ericReeves: CycleComputing has a way of making my work feel completely unimportant.
[2013-04-26 17:04:37 -0400] hikeit: certainly feeling a lot smaller
[2013-04-26 17:06:32 -0400] eherot: I'm thinking there's a Douglas Adams quote that would be appropriate here.
[2013-04-26 17:17:14 -0400] KarlHungus: bah. guess i can't see this one on the feed?
[2013-04-26 17:17:40 -0400] jwitrick: prob not. they wont let the ppl there take pics at all
[2013-04-26 17:17:55 -0400] KarlHungus: well, someone at least tell me who's speaking when they come on
[2013-04-26 17:17:57 -0400] KarlHungus: =)
[2013-04-26 17:19:36 -0400] UForgotten: that's very disappointing
[2013-04-26 17:19:40 -0400] UForgotten: the one talk I reaaaally wanted to hear....
[2013-04-26 17:19:46 -0400] jcampbell: currently still watching a disney ad
[2013-04-26 17:19:49 -0400] UForgotten: yes. the feed is off
[2013-04-26 17:20:22 -0400] KarlHungus: who is the speaker?
[2013-04-26 17:21:06 -0400] UForgotten: disney
[2013-04-26 17:21:21 -0400] juliancdunn: Chris Putonen, Brian Scott and Steve Wagner from Disney
[2013-04-26 17:21:23 -0400] KarlHungus: lol, who though?
[2013-04-26 17:21:24 -0400] KarlHungus: ahh
[2013-04-26 17:21:25 -0400] KarlHungus: sweet
[2013-04-26 17:21:33 -0400] UForgotten: Really wanted to soo this :(
[2013-04-26 17:21:37 -0400] KarlHungus: a pox on them for the blackout
[2013-04-26 17:21:38 -0400] UForgotten: see rather.
[2013-04-26 17:24:13 -0400] juliancdunn: Chris is talking a lot about silos within silos
[2013-04-26 17:24:52 -0400] juliancdunn: maybe that's the kind of dirty laundry Disney doesn't want on the Intertubes
[2013-04-26 17:25:07 -0400] UForgotten: I very much wanted to hear about these silos and how they learned to connect them. Or not.  Updates are much appreciated :)
[2013-04-26 17:26:26 -0400] juliancdunn: he's leading up to that
[2013-04-26 17:26:37 -0400] juliancdunn: also just talked about devs going rogue and swiping corp credit cards at Amazon, etc.
[2013-04-26 17:28:44 -0400] UForgotten: Well, how else are they supposed to get their jobs done if it takes a week to get a VM provisioned?
[2013-04-26 17:28:59 -0400] UForgotten: disney is not alone in that procedural paralysis.
[2013-04-26 17:29:08 -0400] juliancdunn: exactly
[2013-04-26 17:31:06 -0400] pcn: Interesting note is that the budget for the project was muchly spent on training
[2013-04-26 17:31:48 -0400] Majost__: Just a thought... the nat table for the wifi might be full
[2013-04-26 17:32:18 -0400] UForgotten: pcn: as well it should be... this stuff is not easy to grow organically
[2013-04-26 17:34:28 -0400] pcn: Yes
[2013-04-26 17:34:51 -0400] pcn: But it is something that is better done in large organizations in my experience, because they have scale to get the training they want.
[2013-04-26 17:35:30 -0400] jcampbell: depends my org is nice and big, and still fails to put money into this sort of training
[2013-04-26 17:36:25 -0400] UForgotten: Lots of companies do not see the value in growing IT resources.  Those are the ones who haven't realized it's value in the organization.
[2013-04-26 17:36:30 -0400] juliancdunn: summary slide: they have 200 ops & dev cooks, hundreds of product app cookbooks, 4000 nodes, a few custom plugins, and a cookbook testing framework
[2013-04-26 17:36:52 -0400] UForgotten: None of which they'll submit back to the community though?
[2013-04-26 17:37:22 -0400] Majost__: He might be counting community cookbooks
[2013-04-26 17:37:40 -0400] eherot: then again they're hardly alone among big companies for thinking this is some super secret thing.
[2013-04-26 17:37:45 -0400] juliancdunn: otoh, one of the Disney guys (Jon Morrow) is now my counterpart on Opscode's consulting team
[2013-04-26 17:38:02 -0400] juliancdunn: so some ideas might leak out :)
[2013-04-26 17:39:07 -0400] jcampbell: he did say something about "releasing" an os update cookbook, unsure if he means releasing to community or releasing internally at disney
[2013-04-26 17:39:08 -0400] UForgotten: They will not succeed if they continue to let talented engineers leave.
[2013-04-26 17:39:12 -0400] Majost__: All the disney guys go to the LA chef meetup... if your in LA I'm surr they will give you what they can...
[2013-04-26 17:39:28 -0400] Majost__: s/surr/shure/
[2013-04-26 17:42:06 -0400] jcampbell: wifi working again? lack of 4g is going to kill my battery...
[2013-04-26 17:43:57 -0400] pcn: yes, it's better now
[2013-04-26 17:44:40 -0400] Majost__: Yay
[2013-04-26 17:46:15 -0400] miah: its up and down but seems to be 'working' now =)
[2013-04-26 17:49:33 -0400] eherot: my 4G tethering seems to be working :-P
[2013-04-26 17:50:23 -0400] eherot: I think I figured out why I can't take pictures of this talk
[2013-04-26 17:50:23 -0400] eherot: lots of licensed content :-P
[2013-04-26 17:51:07 -0400] pcn: Internet got crappy fast.  Lack of ephemeral ports on the nat?  UDP is fine, tcp seems to be ugly
[2013-04-26 17:51:08 -0400] eherot: Disney never changes
[2013-04-26 17:53:14 -0400] pcn: I suspect even those pretty letter transitions are somehow disney IP
[2013-04-26 17:53:40 -0400] UForgotten: They probably have some pretty spiffy slide templates.
[2013-04-26 17:54:41 -0400] pcn: Now they're starting to talk bout what they're doing
[2013-04-26 17:54:46 -0400] pcn: disney.com automated
[2013-04-26 17:54:49 -0400] pcn: go.com
[2013-04-26 17:55:02 -0400] juliancdunn: looking forward to hearing about their custom LWRPs
[2013-04-26 17:55:05 -0400] pcn: disney infinity spoonful.com and disneycareers.com - chef attached to those
[2013-04-26 17:55:21 -0400] juliancdunn: someone I was talking to last night pronounced LWRP "lerp" ... haha
[2013-04-26 17:55:26 -0400] pcn: juliancdunn: yeah, looking forward to see what they're up to there
[2013-04-26 17:55:56 -0400] pcn: "plugins and extensions": they added a knife plugin to interface with their ca servicedesk
[2013-04-26 17:55:58 -0400] juliancdunn: wrote a custom knife plugin to interact with CA Service Desk!
[2013-04-26 17:56:00 -0400] juliancdunn: ouch
[2013-04-26 17:56:03 -0400] pcn: julian all yours
[2013-04-26 17:56:10 -0400] juliancdunn: no go ahead pcn
[2013-04-26 17:56:30 -0400] pcn: OK, we can split this
[2013-04-26 17:56:56 -0400] juliancdunn: yep
[2013-04-26 17:56:57 -0400] pcn: ohai network_location: reads a config of vlans and descriptions and names to find a node via hoai
[2013-04-26 17:57:55 -0400] pcn: And they're using that to give chef info to determine where the box is.  Example of that is updating the motd with run info including location, state of last run, etc.
[2013-04-26 17:58:19 -0400] pcn: They've created an f5_node resource to manage their f5s
[2013-04-26 17:58:52 -0400] eherot: (gratuitous lovely Tron graphics)
[2013-04-26 17:59:21 -0400] juliancdunn: all of this seems very intertwined with their own proprietary libraries though... you can see it's all under a TWDC namespace
[2013-04-26 17:59:54 -0400] pcn: they have a nexus resource to get a build artifact and deploy it to the container
[2013-04-26 18:00:00 -0400] eherot: deploying via chef, eh?
[2013-04-26 18:00:23 -0400] hikeit: looks like it was all written with no intention of releasing back to community
[2013-04-26 18:00:50 -0400] UForgotten: I figured as much :)
[2013-04-26 18:01:09 -0400] pcn: They have a zipp provider for themselves to deal with compressed archives
[2013-04-26 18:01:58 -0400] pcn: They have a patching process that gets desired patch info via databags where they define the patches that would be applied to satisfy convergence
[2013-04-26 18:02:14 -0400] pcn: And seems to have the ability to remove things they have blacklisted
[2013-04-26 18:02:27 -0400] pcn: compilers are the example
[2013-04-26 18:02:35 -0400] pcn: And it does reporting, too.
[2013-04-26 18:02:55 -0400] juliancdunn: Oh my, some crazy Mixlib Shellout stuff to handle the patch reporting
[2013-04-26 18:02:59 -0400] pcn: Now they're going to talk about their testing framework
[2013-04-26 18:03:25 -0400] pcn: Iron man clip for testing.
[2013-04-26 18:03:56 -0400] pcn: Now they're pulling out ratituille
[2013-04-26 18:04:20 -0400] pcn: They seem to be calling it Remy - something like test-kitchet
[2013-04-26 18:04:23 -0400] pcn: kitchen
[2013-04-26 18:04:32 -0400] pcn: But they're not relesing it apparently
[2013-04-26 18:05:23 -0400] eherot: Disney's relationship with the OSS community is a curious one indeed.
[2013-04-26 18:06:39 -0400] juliancdunn: pretty common amongst large enterprises though
[2013-04-26 18:07:05 -0400] eherot: juliancdunn: Disney is a special case.
[2013-04-26 18:07:26 -0400] eherot: given their central role in the eroding of public domain rights.
[2013-04-26 18:07:38 -0400] juliancdunn: eherot: oh, I see what you're getting at
[2013-04-26 18:08:15 -0400] pcn: So they're using chef repo -> jenkins, etc.
[2013-04-26 18:08:19 -0400] eherot: (While of course simultaneously building almost their entire empire on stories lifted from the public domainactually an interesting parallel to their use of Chef and RedHat ;-))
[2013-04-26 18:08:21 -0400] pcn: They're doing CI on commit
[2013-04-26 18:08:43 -0400] hikeit: i miss checkin tests...
[2013-04-26 18:08:47 -0400] pcn: They're describing the tests they use - parsing, foodcritic, yard-chef, and whatever unit tests may be in use
[2013-04-26 18:09:31 -0400] pcn: They may update yard-chef to pull docs from more than metadata.rb
[2013-04-26 18:09:50 -0400] pcn: They find that unit tests don't really work unless the ruby code is hairy, they focus on functional tests
[2013-04-26 18:11:00 -0400] pcn: They wrote a knife exec script, but would use ridley for this part of their test-builder-thing and use spiceweasel (but I'm not describing this well)
[2013-04-26 18:11:28 -0400] pcn: Ah, they create an empty chef server and then upload the necessary things so that it's clean
[2013-04-26 18:12:47 -0400] pcn: They test windows VMs using vagrant, vagrant-windows, and minitest-chef-handler
[2013-04-26 18:12:55 -0400] pcn: But the test cycle to do this was 4-5 hours
[2013-04-26 18:13:31 -0400] pcn: And moved to knife-openstack and openstack, and that became a 15 minute timeframe on their private cloud
[2013-04-26 18:14:07 -0400] pcn: They could save some time by containerizing their deployments and then use the container instead of re-launching a vm, but it's not a huge pain point
[2013-04-26 20:14:17 -0400] Majost_: Is there any Windows chef people in the unconference room?
[2013-04-26 20:21:52 -0400] ortho_stice: 219
[2013-04-26 20:34:49 -0400] thom: grrmph, i get almost working wifi besides the fact that rubygems won't talk to bundler
[2013-04-26 20:34:59 -0400] thom: which is impeding my testkitchen pull request :(
[2013-04-26 21:13:53 -0400] agoddard: "I don't always PXE boot in a loop all day long, but most times I PXE boot, that's what happens"
[2013-04-26 21:19:55 -0400] thehar: heh
[2013-04-26 21:34:32 -0400] eherot1: agoddard: most annoying part about that standard.
[2013-04-26 23:27:10 -0400] zts: oh no!  our glorious adventure is almost at an end
[2013-04-26 23:27:29 -0400] jcampbell: noooo!
[2013-04-26 23:29:21 -0400] eherot1: (meetups!)
[2013-04-26 23:30:16 -0400] zts: any of you folks going to the hack day tomorrow?
