[2013-04-05 04:02:54 -0400] vaskas: hi guys, question here: if I use the set['name'] in multiple cookbooks, which one takes precedence?
[2013-04-05 14:16:20 -0400] sanguisdex: when I install a mysql server iva the cookbook how do I get the root password?
[2013-04-05 14:21:59 -0400] Politoed: you can set it in your node.json, i think
[2013-04-05 14:22:12 -0400] Politoed: node['mysql']['server_root_password'] - Set the server's root password
[2013-04-05 14:22:22 -0400] Politoed: (never used this, just trying to help)
[2013-04-05 14:24:41 -0400] sanguisdex: Politoed: thanks
[2013-04-05 14:29:16 -0400] sanguisdex: Politoed: I don't even know how to use a node.json :)
[2013-04-05 14:29:59 -0400] Politoed: are you using chef solo or chef server?
[2013-04-05 14:31:07 -0400] Politoed: as far as I understand, the node.json contains the configuration regarding to the machine being set up, like passwords, keys, and roles
[2013-04-05 14:31:45 -0400] Politoed: when I was using vagrant, I could specify the json in the vagrantfile
[2013-04-05 14:32:09 -0400] Politoed: im using knife solo now, and you can specify the node.json when i run knife solo cook
[2013-04-05 14:32:09 -0400] sanguisdex: Politoed: I am using server for now
[2013-04-05 14:34:44 -0400] Politoed: no clue then \:
[2013-04-05 14:37:33 -0400] sanguisdex: thanks :0
[2013-04-05 14:37:36 -0400] sanguisdex: :)
[2013-04-05 14:42:20 -0400] Peter______: Hello, is there anyone who could help me to understand using cookbook
[2013-04-05 14:42:31 -0400] Peter______: i.e https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/jenkins
[2013-04-05 14:42:40 -0400] Peter______: beware that i am a noob
[2013-04-05 18:52:01 -0400] gaffo: so I'm using vagrant and chef solo. I'm trying to run this recipe: https://gist.github.com/gaffo/5321674 but a bunch of stuff isn't installing. the output is there as well. I'm not seeing any packages installing either. I'm coming from puppet so I may be doing some things incorrectly.
