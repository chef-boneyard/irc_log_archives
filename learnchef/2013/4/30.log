[2013-04-30 01:32:58 -0400] markxnelson: hello chef people.  I have set up open source chef on a server and a node, I have the webui working, and I can see my node, client, etc. in the webui and in knife list... I have created a simple recipe - just to install a single package (this is my first time using chef) - and I added it to a run_list and a role to my node, and I am trying to deploy it on the node... but when I run chef_client on the node, it is telling me:  FATAL: Net::HTTPServerExce
[2013-04-30 01:32:58 -0400] markxnelson: ption: 405 "Method Not Allowed" - would anyone be able to give me a hint of what to look for to fix this?
[2013-04-30 01:33:10 -0400] markxnelson: i asked on #chef - but not sure if that is the right channel, or this is....
[2013-04-30 01:33:12 -0400] markxnelson: sorry
[2013-04-30 15:37:58 -0400] FrenchDuke: Hi, I am just learning Chef and have installed Chef server on an Virtual Box Lucid32 box from vagrant. Everything seems to be setup correctly but I cannot access the web ui at all.
[2013-04-30 15:44:27 -0400] FrenchDuke: I have run "chef-server-ctl test" and everythng seems to be setup correctly but accessing the IP address or FQDN through a browser returns nothing. What am I missing?
[2013-04-30 15:45:08 -0400] FrenchDuke: I can SSH onto the VirtualBox using the IPaddress so the box seems to be running correctly and visible on the network.
[2013-04-30 16:07:02 -0400] UForgotten: FrenchDuke: I believe you would have to open/forward a port for it to be accessible outside of the vagrant box itself. 
[2013-04-30 16:10:04 -0400] FrenchDuke: Thanks. I read that the port used to be 4000 but it doesn't have to be that anymore. Is this documented anywhere so I can use it as a reference?
[2013-04-30 16:21:15 -0400] UForgotten: http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/ports.html
[2013-04-30 16:31:01 -0400] FrenchDuke: Thanks
[2013-04-30 21:59:01 -0400] cbelsole: hey
[2013-04-30 21:59:27 -0400] cbelsole: can someone confirm that chef does not use bootstrap templates anymore?
[2013-04-30 22:11:39 -0400] cbelsole: nm
[2013-04-30 22:11:54 -0400] cbelsole: http://docs.opscode.com/knife_bootstrap.html
[2013-04-30 22:11:59 -0400] cbelsole: read the doc
[2013-04-30 22:12:01 -0400] cbelsole: :)
[2013-04-30 22:14:42 -0400] KevinT: hi
[2013-04-30 22:14:53 -0400] KevinT: can someone shed some light on this?
[2013-04-30 22:14:57 -0400] KevinT: WARN: Failed to read the private key /etc/chef/client.pem: #<Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - /etc/chef/client.pem>
[2013-04-30 22:25:32 -0400] cbelsole: do you have a pem file?
[2013-04-30 22:26:01 -0400] cbelsole: @kevinT
[2013-04-30 22:26:05 -0400] KevinT: I don't think so, I was using Chef Solo
[2013-04-30 22:26:24 -0400] cbelsole: lol. I hit that issue
[2013-04-30 22:26:38 -0400] cbelsole: touch /etc/chef/client.pem 
[2013-04-30 22:26:40 -0400] KevinT: its failing on the jboss recipe
[2013-04-30 22:26:41 -0400] KevinT: ok
[2013-04-30 22:27:51 -0400] KevinT: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9882074/how-do-i-create-user-account-by-chef-solo
[2013-04-30 22:28:12 -0400] KevinT: I guess I could try this
[2013-04-30 22:28:14 -0400] KevinT: https://github.com/edelight/chef-solo-search
[2013-04-30 22:33:50 -0400] UForgotten: KevinT: I had that same error today with chef-solo for no good reason.  upgrading to 10.22.0 fixed it somehow. 
[2013-04-30 22:34:04 -0400] KevinT: huh
[2013-04-30 22:34:10 -0400] UForgotten: was strange that it happened today 
[2013-04-30 22:34:33 -0400] UForgotten: two of my dev's reported it.  I didn't have the problem.
[2013-04-30 22:34:36 -0400] KevinT: Im using vagrant right now
[2013-04-30 22:47:37 -0400] targs: i'm still new to chef, but I'm trying to run a recipe on an aws instance that is in a security group with no public DNS. 
[2013-04-30 22:47:56 -0400] targs: the ohai ipaddress attribute is set to an aws internal ip
[2013-04-30 22:48:59 -0400] targs: anyone got any ideas how i can use "knife ssh ..." to run remote "sudo chef-client" command?
[2013-04-30 23:12:05 -0400] KevinT: UForgotten: I had to use https://github.com/edelight/chef-solo-search with databags
[2013-04-30 23:12:08 -0400] KevinT: looks like it might be working now
[2013-04-30 23:12:10 -0400] KevinT: strange
[2013-04-30 23:41:25 -0400] UForgotten: KevinT: yeah, same here.
[2013-04-30 23:41:44 -0400] UForgotten: the one thing I wish worked consistently in vagrant is local nfs shared folders. 
[2013-04-30 23:42:00 -0400] KevinT: I just found this
[2013-04-30 23:42:01 -0400] KevinT: http://www.vagrantup.com/vmware
[2013-04-30 23:42:06 -0400] KevinT: seriously considering it
[2013-04-30 23:43:58 -0400] UForgotten: thats expensive if you have to pay for vmware separately.
[2013-04-30 23:55:54 -0400] KevinT: yeah
[2013-04-30 23:56:10 -0400] KevinT: I already have Fusion
[2013-04-30 23:56:11 -0400] KevinT: and I like it
