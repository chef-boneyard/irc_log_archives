[2013-04-01 16:17:30 -0400] dillyjay: : i'm trying to use this: https://github.com/priestjim/chef-php in provisioning of a vm running ubuntu 12.04. when i try to build php from source, i get configure: error: Cannot find imap library (libc-client.a). Please check your c-client installation.
[2013-04-01 16:17:58 -0400] dillyjay: i have located the libc-client.a and made symlinks for it in /lib and /lib64 and /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
[2013-04-01 16:18:18 -0400] dillyjay: : essentially, everywhere that it might look for that file. anyone have any clues that might point me in the right direction?
[2013-04-01 16:47:09 -0400] ranjibd: anyone looked at http://www.packtpub.com/chef-starter/book
[2013-04-01 16:47:34 -0400] ranjibd: looks like chef 10 server based 
[2013-04-01 19:30:38 -0400] lazyPower: So - i have a node that executed the wordpress default recipe - created the wpdatabase, and now on every subsequent run its failing out on it cant find the database. Is this a deficiency in my runlist or in the cookbook?
