[2013-04-26 23:49:45 -0400] Tearan: Has anyone had any expeariance with the librarian gem? I've just installed it, and and trying to do a 'librarian init' gives me back a 'command not found'. I cant figure out why it doesn't seem to be installed. The path looks right I've installed and ininstalled.. and. Yeh.. I give up. Has anyone run into brokenness with this gem?
