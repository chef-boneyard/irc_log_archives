[2013-04-15 01:47:53 -0400] alxism: hi there
[2013-04-15 01:48:58 -0400] alxism: I created an ec2 instance with a standard ubuntu image.
[2013-04-15 01:48:59 -0400] alxism: but `knife bootstrap` is failing with: "dpkg: error: requested operation requires superuser privilege"
[2013-04-15 01:49:21 -0400] alxism: the standard ubuntu user is a sudoer
[2013-04-15 01:49:54 -0400] alxism: how come the install script is not using sudo? what am i missing?
[2013-04-15 01:58:12 -0400] Horthgard: I am a noob, but I assume you have to use `sudo knife bootstrap`
[2013-04-15 03:15:32 -0400] paul___: Hi everyone!
[2013-04-15 03:15:48 -0400] paul___: running through the tutorial, but wasn't able to 'converge'
[2013-04-15 03:15:51 -0400] paul___: knife bootstrap localhost \
[2013-04-15 03:16:01 -0400] paul___: this last bit doesn't seem to work
[2013-04-15 03:42:25 -0400] alxism: @Horthgard `knife sudo ` did the trick
[2013-04-15 17:00:04 -0400] roRisc: Hi everyone,
[2013-04-15 17:00:17 -0400] roRisc: how can I chown recursively a directory with chef?
[2013-04-15 17:04:02 -0400] thehar: with the directory resource: recursive true?
[2013-04-15 17:47:28 -0400] Silex: hi people , there is somebody may help me with chef-server hostname and IP configuration ?
[2013-04-15 17:48:11 -0400] behemphi: sorry, I am a very happy Hosted Chef user :-)
[2013-04-15 17:48:28 -0400] Silex: )
[2013-04-15 17:49:18 -0400] Silex: I wanna be too , but server-chef user)
[2013-04-15 20:17:35 -0400] rep0st: how can i say in recipe. "If this node has this role then do this"
[2013-04-15 20:31:26 -0400] behemphi: if node.role == "foo"
[2013-04-15 20:31:32 -0400] behemphi:   # do stuff
[2013-04-15 20:31:33 -0400] behemphi: end
[2013-04-15 20:33:45 -0400] behemphi: sec I think I have that wrong
[2013-04-15 20:34:05 -0400] behemphi: role is plural
[2013-04-15 20:34:10 -0400] behemphi: and returns an array
[2013-04-15 20:34:16 -0400] behemphi: b/c there can be more than one role for a node
[2013-04-15 20:34:21 -0400] behemphi: so you will have to iterate
[2013-04-15 20:34:24 -0400] rep0st: ahhh
[2013-04-15 20:34:28 -0400] rep0st: i missing the iteration part
[2013-04-15 20:34:29 -0400] rep0st: =(
[2013-04-15 20:34:33 -0400] behemphi: node.roles.each |n|
[2013-04-15 20:34:40 -0400] behemphi: if n == "foo"
[2013-04-15 20:34:42 -0400] behemphi: #do stuff
[2013-04-15 20:34:43 -0400] behemphi: end
[2013-04-15 20:34:44 -0400] behemphi: end
[2013-04-15 20:34:47 -0400] rep0st: gotcha
[2013-04-15 20:35:13 -0400] behemphi: do you know about "shef"
[2013-04-15 20:35:14 -0400] behemphi: ?
[2013-04-15 20:35:19 -0400] rep0st: mmm
[2013-04-15 20:35:21 -0400] rep0st: i do 
[2013-04-15 20:35:27 -0400] rep0st: but i  haven't spent much time with it
[2013-04-15 20:35:34 -0400] behemphi: that is where I go to fiddle with stuff like that
[2013-04-15 20:35:34 -0400] rep0st: i'm assuming that's the first step forward
[2013-04-15 20:35:38 -0400] rep0st: gotcha
[2013-04-15 20:35:42 -0400] behemphi: like irb
[2013-04-15 20:36:01 -0400] behemphi: a place for me to hack a bit (more than I already am) and see what I need to do b/f I put it in a recipe 
[2013-04-15 20:39:47 -0400] rep0st: i will have to get in on that. Because that's exactly what i was looking for 
[2013-04-15 20:39:49 -0400] rep0st: thank you behmphi
[2013-04-15 20:54:08 -0400] nathenharvey: rep0st:  try this, too
[2013-04-15 20:54:19 -0400] nathenharvey: if node.roles.include? "foo"
[2013-04-15 20:54:22 -0400] nathenharvey:   do something
[2013-04-15 20:54:23 -0400] nathenharvey: end
[2013-04-15 20:55:11 -0400] nathenharvey: but I'd still wonder a bit about the use case.  should your recipe really know / care what role the node has?
[2013-04-15 20:56:02 -0400] maplebed: nathenharvey: I've used the 'if node has role foo' stuff to conditionally include monitoring
[2013-04-15 20:56:30 -0400] maplebed: i.e. if the node has ganglia installed, the mongo cookbook will install ganglia-specific monitoring stuff, but if it doesn't, it'll just carry on.
[2013-04-15 20:56:40 -0400] maplebed: maybe not the best way to do that kind of thing, but it seems to work.
[2013-04-15 20:57:02 -0400] nathenharvey: +1 for making it work :)
[2013-04-15 20:58:20 -0400] rep0st: nathenharvey: we split out our datacenter locations using roles. So depending on the role they get a different host file entry
[2013-04-15 20:58:29 -0400] rep0st: nathenharvey: i <3 roles ;D
[2013-04-15 20:58:51 -0400] nathenharvey: Refactoring after you encounter a problem instead of trying to pre-optimize is always good
[2013-04-15 20:59:14 -0400] nathenharvey: rep0st:  I 1F26247D-FDF5-4622-9179-4F12CAC8A85C-37565-000142B520849224 roles, too
[2013-04-15 20:59:32 -0400] nathenharvey: ha!  failed IRC post.  I love roles, too
[2013-04-15 20:59:58 -0400] rep0st: nathenharvey: i will try your suggestion though. I thought i tried that and i wasn't getting what i expected. 
[2013-04-15 21:00:25 -0400] maplebed: rep0st: one more bit on the test: if roles.include?('foo') ... should work as well.
[2013-04-15 21:00:29 -0400] behemphi: +1 for the .includes() construct
[2013-04-15 21:00:51 -0400] rep0st: nathenharvey: although i must admit. I'm trying to avoid inputting data in roles. It's more of an alias to a run_list for my companies use case
[2013-04-15 21:01:14 -0400] nathenharvey: I would think data center locality would be found in an Environment or as a tag on the node
[2013-04-15 21:01:31 -0400] maplebed: +1 dc location as attribute.
[2013-04-15 21:01:48 -0400] maplebed: (double points if generated by ohai.)
[2013-04-15 21:02:02 -0400] nathenharvey: yeah, or an attribute of the node
[2013-04-15 21:02:02 -0400] rep0st: nathenharvey: we're using chef_environment for dev/pre-prod/prod it's a wonderful way of locking down settings and making sure they always get those settings no matter what. 
[2013-04-15 21:02:16 -0400] behemphi: sadly I have yet used tags
[2013-04-15 21:02:24 -0400] behemphi: I need to find a nail for that hammer!
[2013-04-15 21:02:33 -0400] behemphi: I think I fear there unstructured nature
[2013-04-15 21:02:50 -0400] nathenharvey: also, if you're running your own chef servers, you should probably have one per data center else you risk crossing failure domains
[2013-04-15 21:03:51 -0400] rep0st: nathenharvey: we had an internal debate about that. Thing is the data_bags ( and other shared information) need to be levereged across both DCs. I dislike doing things twice, whether in a script or not. 
[2013-04-15 21:04:42 -0400] nathenharvey: but if data center A goes down and all your nodes in data center B are dependent on the chef server in data center A to remain in compliance with your policy...
[2013-04-15 21:07:01 -0400] nathenharvey: rep0st:  maybe we need a Food Fight Show to take that internal debate public and check in on the community at large
[2013-04-15 21:11:13 -0400] rep0st: nathenharvey: hah. possible. i am still very new to the whole chef scene. I am going to chef-conf though to open my eyes a bit. My argument was that searchable attributes across both datacenters is a huge factor in why we chose chef. To make them mutually exclusives would have put us at a disadvantage. 
[2013-04-15 21:17:10 -0400] behemphi: I don't have the multi-DC problem.  Is replication and failover an option?
[2013-04-15 21:17:20 -0400] behemphi: DC A has the master, DC B has the slave
[2013-04-15 21:17:46 -0400] behemphi: or master-master replication if using MySQL as the backend (not sure if PG does this sort of thing)
[2013-04-15 21:18:17 -0400] nathenharvey: I gotta run but definitely a good conversation to continue next week at chefconf! see you there!
[2013-04-15 21:18:29 -0400] behemphi: Yep see you there
[2013-04-15 21:18:38 -0400] rep0st: nathenharvey: see yea there
[2013-04-15 21:19:41 -0400] rep0st: behemphi: currently we're using knife-essentials gem in order to do `knife download /` and they rsyncing/tarring the whole thing over to a cold chef-server that when trouble arises we'll do a `knife upload /` our chef runs are on 3 hour intervals at the moment. 
[2013-04-15 21:20:59 -0400] behemphi: I am not familiar with knife download.  That said, seems to me that chef-server should provide for HA
[2013-04-15 21:21:19 -0400] behemphi: and the techs is is built upon do (mysql, pg, s3)
[2013-04-15 21:21:40 -0400] behemphi: so it follows there should be a topology to get a smooth failover in event of a DC loss
[2013-04-15 21:22:13 -0400] behemphi: neat problem to think through as @nathenharvey says.  See you at ChefConf!
[2013-04-15 21:29:29 -0400] rep0st: behemphi: see ya there man. 
[2013-04-15 23:14:18 -0400] alxism: is '-' legal in cookbook name?
[2013-04-15 23:14:47 -0400] alxism: can I create a cookbook org-web? or should I use orgweb?
[2013-04-15 23:14:54 -0400] alxism: what is the best practice?
