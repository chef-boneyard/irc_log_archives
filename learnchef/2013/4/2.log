[2013-04-02 14:19:34 -0400] TipiT: How can I find out the Chef-server version which hosted opscode is using at the moment? I can't find it from the docs.
[2013-04-02 21:01:04 -0400] jexmex: can I ask about an error I am getting here?
[2013-04-02 22:14:10 -0400] TipiT: why not?
[2013-04-02 22:14:25 -0400] TipiT: jexmex: why not?
[2013-04-02 22:26:27 -0400] robinbowes: Mmm, what does "Open up the chef-repo in your favorite editor." mean?
[2013-04-02 22:26:41 -0400] robinbowes: chef-repo is a directory. Or am I missing something?
[2013-04-02 22:28:42 -0400] vincentmac: I'm having trouble with an Upstart service in a recipe.  I have an upstart script to run a node.js app which works fine on the first deploy.  When I rerun the recipe (to re-deploy from a private git repo) I get an error on for whatever action is being set on the upstart service.  Any pointers? I've been going through the docs but still can't get it to work: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_service.html
[2013-04-02 22:29:30 -0400] vincentmac: The error: NoMethodError: undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass
[2013-04-02 23:48:00 -0400] robinbowes: So, I'm running through the learnchef stuff
[2013-04-02 23:48:21 -0400] robinbowes: Installed everything, created a VM, am bootstrapping it
[2013-04-02 23:49:42 -0400] robinbowes: First question: I get prompted for the passphrase for my shared key. How can I either prevent that, or skip it without having to enter the password?
[2013-04-02 23:50:17 -0400] robinbowes: 2nd question is not really a question: bootstrap failed due to local dpkg cache being out of datye
[2013-04-02 23:50:33 -0400] robinbowes: Have to login and apt-get update before the cookbook would work
[2013-04-02 23:52:16 -0400] vincentmac: there's a vagrant tutorial somewhere on the opscode site that may help
[2013-04-02 23:52:37 -0400] vincentmac: i'm trying to see if i can find it for you
[2013-04-02 23:52:39 -0400] robinbowes: k, will look for it
[2013-04-02 23:53:30 -0400] vincentmac: this series is pretty good too: http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/12/06/learning-chef-part-1/
