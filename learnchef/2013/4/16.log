[2013-04-16 00:12:00 -0400] maplebed: alxism: I use underscores but I see other cookbooks with hyphens.
[2013-04-16 03:12:51 -0400] alxism: @maplebed I went for underscore as it is a legal character in ruby symbols. it is more convenient if your attributes match your cookbook name
[2013-04-16 04:25:43 -0400] sl3x: hi, how can I say chef-server use IP address on eth0 instead localhost?
[2013-04-16 09:00:21 -0400] Silex: chef-server should bind webUI on 8000 port to localhost?
[2013-04-16 09:15:28 -0400] Silex: or I can change 127.0.0.1 on any other IP ?
[2013-04-16 11:21:43 -0400] bigbigbang: hi ! i am currently testing chef for an integratin in my company , i'm using the open-source version . After installing the chef-server on a SLES, and the client on my local machine (ubuntu 12.04), i just want to test with a basic recipe ( magic shell or whatever) --> bootstrap ? but i'm a bit confusing with ssh (why is there sometime a client.rb with client.pem in some tuto i have found ?)
[2013-04-16 12:32:59 -0400] Silex: bigbigbang what IP address uses webUI  ? (8000 and 9462 ports)
[2013-04-16 15:52:43 -0400] simplesi: hello all
[2013-04-16 15:52:55 -0400] simplesi: can anyone give me a hand with some chefspec code?
[2013-04-16 15:53:06 -0400] simplesi: I'm having a nightmare mocking out a search
[2013-04-16 18:03:59 -0400] basic`: i have a databag object i need to reference in a template, how do i do this?  In my recipe i have a variable, creds['password'] available, but i dont know how to reference this in my erb template that needs to use it?
[2013-04-16 18:06:57 -0400] sethvargo: @basic`you would need to use the data_bag_item and then pass it in as a variable to the source
[2013-04-16 18:07:28 -0400] basic`: sethvargo: i followed this example: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags_encrypt.html#example
[2013-04-16 18:07:59 -0400] basic`: i think i'm stuck at the "pass it in as a variable to the source" part
[2013-04-16 18:08:20 -0400] sethvargo: template  do
[2013-04-16 18:08:28 -0400] sethvargo:   variables(:foo => bar)
[2013-04-16 18:08:28 -0400] sethvargo: end
[2013-04-16 18:08:36 -0400] basic`: ah okay
[2013-04-16 18:08:46 -0400] sethvargo: and that becomes @foo in the template
[2013-04-16 18:08:51 -0400] basic`: ok
[2013-04-16 18:09:13 -0400] basic`: is it possible to use the databag in attributes and pass it in that way?
[2013-04-16 18:10:23 -0400] sethvargo: what do you mean?
[2013-04-16 18:10:46 -0400] basic`: like 'Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load' in attributes/default.rb ?
[2013-04-16 18:15:22 -0400] behemphi: Hey basic here is a snippet from an old cookbook
[2013-04-16 18:15:22 -0400] behemphi: https://gist.github.com/behemphi/5398194
[2013-04-16 18:16:24 -0400] basic`: thanks guys
[2013-04-16 18:20:51 -0400] basic`: perfect, it works
[2013-04-16 18:49:26 -0400] droy: hi guys, i'm about to start using a config management solution for our deployments, and am wondering if the diff between chef and puppet is really just a personal preference for syntax, etc, since they really do the same thing?  
[2013-04-16 18:49:30 -0400] droy: ruby vs json, etc
[2013-04-16 18:50:07 -0400] behemphi: a great question droy
[2013-04-16 18:50:24 -0400] behemphi: I do not work for opscode
[2013-04-16 18:50:31 -0400] behemphi: I chose chef b/c
[2013-04-16 18:50:55 -0400] behemphi: I can learn ruby while learning chef and have the power of ruby to solve sticky problems
[2013-04-16 18:51:16 -0400] behemphi: (puppet, by contrast, is written in ruby but the DSL is pretty rigid)
[2013-04-16 18:51:51 -0400] droy: ok
[2013-04-16 18:51:59 -0400] behemphi: In using hosted chef or a chef-server (i.e. not using chef-solo) I can search my topology and manipulate say all of my db servers
[2013-04-16 18:52:02 -0400] behemphi: or web servers
[2013-04-16 18:52:07 -0400] behemphi: b/c I have defined roles for them
[2013-04-16 18:52:16 -0400] droy: it's a nice split between the 2 for large companies like pineterest, etc
[2013-04-16 18:52:25 -0400] droy: but i figured that really didn't say much about the platforms
[2013-04-16 18:52:26 -0400] droy: in itself
[2013-04-16 18:52:37 -0400] behemphi: At Austin Devops we just had BazaarVoice talk about Puppet
[2013-04-16 18:53:01 -0400] behemphi: As I understand it puppet has problems scaling past about 500 machines if you are not masterless
[2013-04-16 18:53:16 -0400] behemphi: chef claims not to have that issue, though I cannot say from personal experience 
[2013-04-16 18:53:23 -0400] droy: we won't deploy near that!
[2013-04-16 18:53:23 -0400] behemphi: Check out this though for backup
[2013-04-16 18:53:24 -0400] droy: :)
[2013-04-16 18:53:31 -0400] droy: but we do need something scalable
[2013-04-16 18:54:45 -0400] behemphi: phooey I cannot find the article/slides
[2013-04-16 18:54:53 -0400] behemphi: Cyclic used Chef and amazon
[2013-04-16 18:54:54 -0400] droy: that's ok, thank tho
[2013-04-16 18:55:03 -0400] behemphi: Maybe Seth or Nathan can point you to it
[2013-04-16 18:55:09 -0400] droy: there are lots of articles out there
[2013-04-16 18:55:17 -0400] droy: but i wanted some real person feedback
[2013-04-16 18:55:18 -0400] behemphi: THe chef community is stunningly awesome
[2013-04-16 18:55:29 -0400] droy: i guess chefcon / puppetconf would be good to attend sometime
[2013-04-16 18:55:34 -0400] behemphi: be that at chef conf, in IRC or supporting things like Austin Devops
[2013-04-16 18:55:42 -0400] droy: cool
[2013-04-16 18:55:45 -0400] droy: that's great to know
[2013-04-16 18:56:21 -0400] behemphi: that said, i hope you will compare.  The thing I walked away from the BazaarVoice talk with is that it is the right tool for the right job.  I chose chef and I am thrilled with that choice 2 years later.
[2013-04-16 18:56:25 -0400] droy: we will use CloufFormation to provision the "hardware" then Chef or similar to configure the machines and hopefully deploy our custom app environment
[2013-04-16 18:56:53 -0400] behemphi: Amazon just adopted Chef
[2013-04-16 18:57:06 -0400] behemphi: I am at Rackpsace myself so I don't know alot about it
[2013-04-16 18:57:07 -0400] droy: yes, opsworks is on my radar
[2013-04-16 18:57:19 -0400] droy: but not until they support VPC
[2013-04-16 18:58:29 -0400] behemphi: Here is that article
[2013-04-16 18:58:29 -0400] behemphi: http://www.opscode.com/blog/2013/02/04/cycle-computing-puts-chef-11-through-its-paces-w10k-aws-servers/
[2013-04-16 18:58:33 -0400] behemphi: or one of them
[2013-04-16 19:00:07 -0400] droy: ah that's great, thank you behemphi
[2013-04-16 19:02:02 -0400] droy: hopefully any solution is better than essentially one-use shell scripts
[2013-04-16 19:39:59 -0400] droy: behemphi: do you use hosted chef at opscode?  If so, how easily can you switch to open source chef server if you decide to save costs, manage yourself?  
[2013-04-16 19:47:09 -0400] behemphi: droy I do use hosted chef
[2013-04-16 19:47:20 -0400] behemphi: we are right around 160 nodes
[2013-04-16 19:47:37 -0400] behemphi: I am slightly annoyed that they have teired rather than per minute pricing
[2013-04-16 19:47:44 -0400] behemphi: (a bit of  a religion with me)
[2013-04-16 19:48:06 -0400] behemphi: as for migrating out I will have to defer to @nathenharvey or @sethvargo
[2013-04-16 19:48:17 -0400] behemphi: I believe you can do this with knife-download
[2013-04-16 19:48:24 -0400] behemphi: but that is the extent of my knowledge
[2013-04-16 19:49:34 -0400] sethvargo: @behemphi just jumping in, whats up?
[2013-04-16 19:50:12 -0400] behemphi: hey seth please see droy migration question above
[2013-04-16 19:50:25 -0400] behemphi: completely outside my experience there
[2013-04-16 19:50:51 -0400] behemphi: droy seth is an opscode guy and a really awesome one (seth we met at Chef Community Summit last Oct)
[2013-04-16 19:51:05 -0400] sethvargo: @behemphi im not seeing a question about migration. I see a diff b/w chef and puppet q...
[2013-04-16 19:51:23 -0400] behemphi: Here you go Seth:
[2013-04-16 19:51:24 -0400] behemphi: behemphi: do you use hosted chef at opscode? If so, how easily can you switch to open source chef server if you decide to save costs, manage yourself? 
[2013-04-16 19:51:38 -0400] sethvargo: thanks!
[2013-04-16 19:51:40 -0400] behemphi: mysteries of IRC lol
[2013-04-16 19:52:03 -0400] droy: hi sethvargo
[2013-04-16 19:52:13 -0400] droy: i'm evaluating my options for chef server
[2013-04-16 19:52:18 -0400] sethvargo: So you can move from hosted/private chef to open source chef, but the move is somewhat difficult. for one, you'll need to regenerate all your keys and re-register all your nodes.
[2013-04-16 19:52:28 -0400] droy: ok
[2013-04-16 19:52:44 -0400] sethvargo: You also lose features, like partial search and organizations
[2013-04-16 19:52:52 -0400] sethvargo: and you'll lose any existing cookbook artifact versions
[2013-04-16 19:53:28 -0400] droy: ok so better to stick to one method from the start
[2013-04-16 19:54:03 -0400] sethvargo: you can migrate between hosted and private chef
[2013-04-16 19:54:17 -0400] sethvargo: it's still somewhat of a hassle, but less than going to open source
[2013-04-16 19:54:32 -0400] behemphi: @Droy another possible consideration is that as a hosted chef cusotmer you get support.  that has been super helpful on a couple of occasions
[2013-04-16 19:54:55 -0400] droy: that's true
[2013-04-16 19:55:12 -0400] sethvargo: droy: there are a ton of advantages of using hosted/private chef over open source Chef. Support. SLA. Updates. New Features. Etc
[2013-04-16 19:56:22 -0400] droy: ok, i have to put something together for approval so I have to mindful of pricing.  free, do it yourself is not always cheaper
[2013-04-16 19:57:04 -0400] behemphi: That is _very_ true and a big reason for Hosted with us
[2013-04-16 19:57:17 -0400] behemphi: I am one guy and I can focus on our needs rather than maintaining a chef server
[2013-04-16 19:57:37 -0400] behemphi: I suspect I will get to 250 to 300 nodes b/f I need help.  
[2013-04-16 19:57:59 -0400] behemphi: not having to do stuff like manage Zabbix and Chef server puts many hours in my week
[2013-04-16 19:58:17 -0400] behemphi: Indeed looking at Splunk Storm right now :-)
[2013-04-16 19:58:25 -0400] droy: nice!
[2013-04-16 19:58:31 -0400] sethvargo: @droy you also get 5 free nodes with hosted chef
[2013-04-16 19:58:37 -0400] behemphi: and a community splunk storm cookbook!  http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/splunkstorm
[2013-04-16 19:59:44 -0400] droy: i'll likely try the free plan for now, while i get used to the workflow
[2013-04-16 20:00:03 -0400] droy: a self managed chef server might be too much at the start
[2013-04-16 20:00:20 -0400] droy: i'm still at the tutorial stage :)
[2013-04-16 20:07:48 -0400] behemphi: I got alot of help from the community when I got started.  So I hang around in here to pay the debt
