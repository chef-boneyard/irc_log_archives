[2013-04-25 16:34:05 -0400] dillyjay: are all attribute files in a cookbook loaded in all recipes in the same cookbook?
[2013-04-25 16:35:59 -0400] dillyjay: e.g. if i have 'mycookbook/attributes/default.rb' and 'mycookbook/attributes/another.rb' do i have access to the attributes defined in 'mycookbook/attributes/another.rb' within 'mycookbook/recipes/default.rb' via 'node["mycookbook"]["another"]["attr"]' ?
