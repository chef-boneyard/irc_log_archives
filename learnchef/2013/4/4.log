[2013-04-04 00:10:41 -0400] sanguisdex: can some one point me to a good LEMP role?
[2013-04-04 00:19:53 -0400] nanashiRei: Hi, i'm having trouble bootstrapping a node. It says this, no matter what i do with permissions: 
[2013-04-04 00:20:11 -0400] nanashiRei: * There may already be a client named "app-brick.david.node.hacked.jp"
[2013-04-04 00:20:11 -0400] nanashiRei: * Your validation client (scalr-validator) may have misconfigured authorization permissions.
[2013-04-04 00:21:02 -0400] nanashiRei: 1. There is no such client, 2. scalr-validator should have all rights needed.
[2013-04-04 00:38:35 -0400] sanguisdex: I keep getting this error when trying to boot strap"FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::Package: package[build-essential] (build-essential::default line 51) had an error: Chef::Exceptions::Package: No version specified, and no candidate version available for build-essential" don't know what to do
[2013-04-04 01:59:04 -0400] basic`: i need help getting my mail handler chef handler to only be an exception handler with chef-client
[2013-04-04 13:07:12 -0400] sanguisdex: woot LEMP stack deployed!
[2013-04-04 14:06:30 -0400] sanguisdex: how do I export my role to be included in my role dir within the roles dir?
[2013-04-04 14:08:57 -0400] rep0st1: for i in `knife role list`; do knife role show $i -F json > $i.json
[2013-04-04 14:09:00 -0400] rep0st1: ;done
[2013-04-04 14:09:49 -0400] rep0st1: someara once said in a workshop i attended with him. There's no special sauce to chef. 
[2013-04-04 14:16:14 -0400] sanguisdex: rep0st1: that was to me?
[2013-04-04 14:17:08 -0400] rep0st1: sanguisdex: yes sorry
[2013-04-04 14:17:24 -0400] sanguisdex: rep0st1: no worries I got it
[2013-04-04 17:30:35 -0400] sanguisdex: would I make a custom cookbook if I wanted to make a template for /etc/adduser.conf?
[2013-04-04 18:12:52 -0400] sanguisdex: is there a cookbook for general system settings on ubuntu?
[2013-04-04 18:17:01 -0400] mattray: sanguisdex: like what sort of settings?
[2013-04-04 18:17:41 -0400] mattray: there is an Ubuntu cookbook: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/ubuntu
[2013-04-04 18:18:05 -0400] sanguisdex: mattray: I want to edit /etc/adduser.conf to make all new users use zsh and and populate the /etc/skel somewhat
[2013-04-04 18:19:03 -0400] mattray: hmm it doesn't have that functionality, but perhaps a "adduser" cookbook might be more focused?
[2013-04-04 18:19:16 -0400] rep0st1: adduser.conf seems to be a conf file specific to ubuntu
[2013-04-04 18:21:06 -0400] rep0st1: well bite my tongue i'm wrong ..seems like it's on debian too..dur
[2013-04-04 18:21:38 -0400] mattray: yeah, so a new adduser cookbook could manage the /etc/adduser.conf and the /etc/skel as appropriate
[2013-04-04 18:21:49 -0400] mattray: and support debian and ubuntu :)
[2013-04-04 18:24:41 -0400] sanguisdex: neat thanks beyond that this work list http://pastebin.com/VwLYZcYR is failing with this error "package[mysql-client] (mysql::client line 46) had an error: Chef::Exceptions::Package: No version specified" where I lean to debug this?
