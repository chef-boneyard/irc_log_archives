[2013-04-03 00:15:57 -0400] maplebed: robinbowes: for the first question - if I understand right, I think using an ssh agent will solve your problem.
[2013-04-03 00:17:00 -0400] robinbowes: I have an ssh agent
[2013-04-03 00:17:09 -0400] robinbowes: Am on OSX
[2013-04-03 00:18:19 -0400] maplebed: and the key's loaded?  in that case nevermind; I got nothin.
[2013-04-03 00:18:35 -0400] robinbowes: The issue is that there is no key on the vagrant box
[2013-04-03 00:18:55 -0400] robinbowes: ie. it shouldn't be prompting me for the password to that key
[2013-04-03 17:34:28 -0400] sanguisdex: gettting a "FATAL: SocketError: Error connecting to https://api.opscode.com/organizations/knectar/clients - getaddrinfo: Temporary failure in name resolution" error, where should I start trouble shooting?
[2013-04-03 17:34:58 -0400] sanguisdex: should I just delete my .chef dir and start over with pem files?
[2013-04-03 19:07:16 -0400] afarentino: Hi I just ran thru the instrutions on the learning chef website to converge my first node using hosted chef.  It looks like the provisioning step which uses knife got thru applying the aliases recipe but failed to install apahce2
[2013-04-03 19:07:52 -0400] afarentino: Not sure how to get apache up and running using the cookbook... Can you provide a little help? and thanks!
[2013-04-03 19:14:24 -0400] afarentino: Instead of using the official docs I'm going to go back and try and use Learnig Chef series of screencasts that @nathenharvey put together on his blog here in Dec 2012....
[2013-04-03 19:14:32 -0400] afarentino: http://www.nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/12/06/learning-chef-part-1
[2013-04-03 19:30:43 -0400] nathenharvey: afarentino:  did you just email us, too?  I think you need to add apt to the beginning of your run list.  Your apt repo might be out of date.  adding apt to the runlist should fix that
[2013-04-03 19:33:06 -0400] afarentino: Thanks nathan I'll give that a try.  I don't think I emailed opscode but we will see...
[2013-04-03 19:34:21 -0400] nathenharvey: OK.  I think someone else did with the same problem :)
[2013-04-03 19:34:31 -0400] nathenharvey: you can grab the apt cookbook off the community site.  same way you 'knife cookbook site install'ed cookbooks earlier
[2013-04-03 19:34:52 -0400] nathenharvey: the default recipe will run 'apt-get update' which should sync up your repos and be able to find apache
[2013-04-03 19:35:07 -0400] nathenharvey: you could also just log in to the vagrant instance and run 'sudo apt-get update' but that's lame ;)
[2013-04-03 19:35:19 -0400] afarentino: got it... 
[2013-04-03 19:35:41 -0400] afarentino: any reason why the learning chef site isn't using your original blog series?
[2013-04-03 19:36:15 -0400] afarentino: I go back to it for more detail... but I guess ur team is deciding to trim down the official guides....
[2013-04-03 19:36:45 -0400] nathenharvey: lmk how that goes
[2013-04-03 19:36:46 -0400] nathenharvey: my original was the "experiment" to see if something like this might work.  learnchef.com is a bit more distilled
[2013-04-03 19:36:53 -0400] nathenharvey: would love to hear more feedback on your experience with both.  I'm nharvey at opscode.com
[2013-04-03 19:50:42 -0400] afarentino: Thanks Nathen!  Your suggestion worked... now to just get the learning chef docs updated...
[2013-04-03 19:50:48 -0400] afarentino: and no one else will hit that problem
[2013-04-03 19:55:44 -0400] nathenharvey: or update the base boxes :)
[2013-04-03 19:55:59 -0400] nathenharvey: but, yes, updating the docs would be the better approach
[2013-04-03 20:01:40 -0400] nathenharvey: afarentino:  which solution did you use?  add apt to the run list or login and manually run apt-get update?
[2013-04-03 20:12:06 -0400] afarentino: add apt to the runl ist
[2013-04-03 20:12:48 -0400] afarentino: that worked and is the correct thing todo to get knife bootstrap
[2013-04-03 20:12:57 -0400] afarentino: working as shown in the guide without error
[2013-04-03 20:16:26 -0400] afarentino: Actually I'm close... I made it to the following verification step: https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/converge/
[2013-04-03 20:17:19 -0400] afarentino: Apache is running  i see in started in the ps command but the curl localhost command doesn't return/fetch the default apache web page
[2013-04-03 20:19:08 -0400] nathenharvey: afarentino: I think the issue there is related to a change in the apache cookbook
[2013-04-03 20:19:19 -0400] nathenharvey: afarentino: just a sec
[2013-04-03 20:20:54 -0400] nathenharvey: yes, the apache2 cookbook now sets the node's apache.default_site_enabled attribute to false
[2013-04-03 20:21:06 -0400] nathenharvey: so, you won't actually see the default site
[2013-04-03 20:21:09 -0400] afarentino: got it...
[2013-04-03 20:21:16 -0400] afarentino: i see a 404 page returned...
[2013-04-03 20:22:56 -0400] nathenharvey: yes, that makes sense
[2013-04-03 20:23:08 -0400] nathenharvey: more updates required to the site 
[2013-04-03 20:23:59 -0400] nathenharvey: on you're vagrant instance if you go to the sites directory, you'll likely see no files listed in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
[2013-04-03 21:02:27 -0400] sanguisdex: ok so I just created a new node on rackspace and the bootstrapping failed how do I adjust my role and then restart the bootstrapping?
[2013-04-03 21:02:51 -0400] sanguisdex: errr I already updated the node
[2013-04-03 21:03:05 -0400] sanguisdex: s/node/role/
[2013-04-03 21:09:35 -0400] nathenharvey: sanguisdex:  re-bootstrap?   just re-run the knife bootstrap command
[2013-04-03 21:09:38 -0400] nathenharvey: where did it fail?
[2013-04-03 21:24:29 -0400] sanguisdex: nathenharvey: unfortunately my terminal closed so I can't paste the error, I ma tempted to delete and re create the machine
[2013-04-03 21:45:58 -0400] sanguisdex: how do I find out what settings my chef-cleint is using?
[2013-04-03 21:52:24 -0400] sanguisdex: or how do I reapply the role settings after they broke while laoding cookbooks?
[2013-04-03 22:33:45 -0400] nathenharvey: delete + recreate is always a good option
