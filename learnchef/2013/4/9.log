[2013-04-09 00:22:09 -0400] csaunders: I posted this in the chef channel, but this might be a crazy newbie question so maybe this is a more appropriate channel
[2013-04-09 00:22:10 -0400] csaunders: hey, I'm having an issue trying to use the users cookbook.  Mainly, I have a users/deploy.json data bag and when I try to use it the node complains that it can't find the bag (404)
[2013-04-09 00:22:17 -0400] csaunders: I moved my code from the default.rb in the users cookbook into my own, and now it appears that the recipe runs but is a no-op since my deploy user wasn't created
[2013-04-09 01:24:04 -0400] csaunders: hello?
[2013-04-09 06:08:42 -0400] peter_:  question: for example you have installed jenkins using cookbook, do you actually need to do another configuration? (i,e setup git plugin or setup maven)?
[2013-04-09 12:58:56 -0400] sanguisdex: where can I man-up on the syntax of adding attributes setting to my role?
[2013-04-09 17:43:52 -0400] dfrey_: anyone know how to debug chef-client?
[2013-04-09 17:48:24 -0400] thehar: chef-client -l debug ?
[2013-04-09 18:55:55 -0400] behemphi: I love Chef ....
[2013-04-09 18:55:58 -0400] behemphi: Just sayin'
[2013-04-09 18:59:43 -0400] csaunders: it's interesting
[2013-04-09 18:59:55 -0400] csaunders: I'm still super new, so I'm quite lost :P
[2013-04-09 19:07:32 -0400] behemphi: well fire a question csaunders lemme see if I can help you out
[2013-04-09 19:07:52 -0400] csaunders: haha, I think most of my problems were last night :P
[2013-04-09 19:08:00 -0400] csaunders: figuring out how exactly the users package works
[2013-04-09 19:08:11 -0400] csaunders: For some reason I found the psql cookbook easier to use :P
[2013-04-09 19:08:48 -0400] csaunders: Once I'm back in front of that VM I'll surely be around with more questions :P
[2013-04-09 19:09:16 -0400] csaunders: What is the best time to be around? Channel was pretty quiet last night (around 8pm Eastern)
[2013-04-09 19:09:31 -0400] csaunders: When*
[2013-04-09 19:13:12 -0400] behemphi: Opscode is in Seattle so I woudl say about 8pm is the latest most of those guys/gals would be around
[2013-04-09 19:16:21 -0400] csaunders: most of those guys are out by 5/6 on the west coast I guess? That's cool
[2013-04-09 19:16:52 -0400] csaunders: the #chef channel is helpful too, though I get the feeling this one is more for those new to the platform :P
[2013-04-09 20:03:18 -0400] mynt: where does chef_gem get its gemfiles that it installs?
[2013-04-09 20:04:07 -0400] behemphi: same place as the gem provider
[2013-04-09 20:04:36 -0400] mynt: and where is that?
[2013-04-09 20:05:42 -0400] mynt: I'm trying to distribute a chef handler gem but i'm not really sure where i should put my gem file
[2013-04-09 20:06:15 -0400] mynt: and by distribute i mean distribute it across my chef nodes
[2013-04-09 20:09:27 -0400] mynt: nvm i think i found what i need
[2013-04-09 20:10:31 -0400] behemphi: sorry mynt got distracted
[2013-04-09 20:10:55 -0400] behemphi: I believe the answer is http://rubygems.org/
[2013-04-09 20:11:45 -0400] behemphi: but I am not sure i that is what you are asking
[2013-04-09 20:12:25 -0400] mynt: yeah... so i'm trying to do this: https://github.com/jtimberman/chef-handler-growl/blob/master/README.md#method-2
[2013-04-09 20:12:51 -0400] mynt: i've added the recipe
[2013-04-09 20:13:03 -0400] mynt: and i've cloned the chef-handler-growl repo
[2013-04-09 20:13:11 -0400] mynt: but i'm not sure what to do with the chef-handler-growl rep
[2013-04-09 20:13:17 -0400] mynt: repo*
[2013-04-09 20:13:33 -0400] mynt: i tried putting it inside the chef_handler cookbook
[2013-04-09 20:13:45 -0400] mynt: but that didn't work
[2013-04-09 20:14:23 -0400] behemphi: I ran into a similar problme when trying to get some of the testing gems installed.  Have yet to circle back.  
[2013-04-09 20:14:24 -0400] mynt: I have no idea how chef_gem "chef-handler-growl" installs the repo i cloned
[2013-04-09 20:14:36 -0400] behemphi: May I suggest asking in #chef
[2013-04-09 20:14:43 -0400] mynt: oki
[2013-04-09 20:14:47 -0400] mynt: thanks
[2013-04-09 20:41:24 -0400] mynt: figured it out
[2013-04-09 20:41:45 -0400] mynt: ended up building the gem and pushing it to rubygems.org
