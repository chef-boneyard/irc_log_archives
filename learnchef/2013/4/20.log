[2013-04-20 07:08:30 -0400] pnorman: I'm following https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/chef-repo/ and it's telling me to "Open up the chef-repo in your favorite editor". chef-repo is a directory, so I'm not sure what it's telling me to open.
[2013-04-20 18:53:15 -0400] dillyjay: having some strange behavior with chef-solo as a vagrant provisioner. my php build failed this morning after working fine yesterday. after five tries of 'vagrant provision' it suddenly worked. and the failure points were inconsistent each of the first four. a couple times i got an 'tar: Unexpected EOF in archive' early in the process. a couple times there were drivers missing. what would cause the inconsistent behavior?
