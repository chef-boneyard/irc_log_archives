[2013-04-29 01:33:42 -0400] rmar52: hi all...using Vagrant to try to make a Rails development VM and having some trouble using Chef Solo to provision it with rvm.  I'm using the fnichols' cookbook from git, but it's saying it can't find rvm.  Anyone run into this before?
[2013-04-29 13:05:45 -0400] atyz: Hi all. I'm new to working with chef-server and chef. I'm trying to setup chef server and as a result i found this http://www.opscode.com/blog/2013/03/11/chef-11-server-up-and-running/. However after installing it I'm unable to find the chef-server webui. Am i missing something? I'm installing it on an ec2 instance, however i have all the ports opened up, i can't seem to figure out what i'm missing
[2013-04-29 16:59:44 -0400] cbelsole: hey
[2013-04-29 17:00:38 -0400] cbelsole: Is there a way to have globally accessible methods from a chef run?
[2013-04-29 17:01:27 -0400] cbelsole: such that I want to define a method in one cookbook and use it in another without including that cookbook
[2013-04-29 17:03:00 -0400] cbelsole: for example I want to define a global method DoesItFeelGoodToEatCake? and use it on another cookbook in the same run without including that cookbook
[2013-04-29 17:05:19 -0400] mattray: cbelsole: you can create libraries in a cookbook that would be globally accessible, and make them a dependency of the other cookbook without listing it in your runlist
[2013-04-29 17:05:56 -0400] mattray: def DoesItFeelGoodToEatCake? return true end
[2013-04-29 17:26:55 -0400] cbelsole: thanks
[2013-04-29 18:02:14 -0400] behemphi_: @cbelsole Seth Vargo gave a great talk on your question at ChefConf
[2013-04-29 18:02:15 -0400] behemphi_: https://speakerdeck.com/sethvargo/cookbook-refactoring-and-extracting-logic-into-rubygems
[2013-04-29 18:02:22 -0400] behemphi_: that is the speaker deck
[2013-04-29 19:44:05 -0400] behemphi_: I am trying to uninstall chef 10.16 from my osx workstation but cannot find it.  There is no /opt/chef directory for omnibus and there is no gem (gem list --local)
[2013-04-29 19:44:12 -0400] behemphi_: how can i get rid of it?
[2013-04-29 19:55:25 -0400] UForgotten: how did you install it? did you type `which chef-solo` ? 
[2013-04-29 19:55:44 -0400] UForgotten: without the ` 's
[2013-04-29 19:57:13 -0400] behemphi_: I am not using chef solo @UForgotten and I don't remember as it was  quite some time ago
[2013-04-29 19:57:31 -0400] UForgotten: if you are not using it, then why do you need to uninstall it? 
[2013-04-29 19:57:35 -0400] behemphi_: I suspect my troubles have to do with having rvm and rbenv going at same time
[2013-04-29 19:57:40 -0400] behemphi_: and I am cleaning up now
[2013-04-29 19:57:54 -0400] behemphi_: I am going through the learnchef tutorial
[2013-04-29 19:57:59 -0400] behemphi_: and it is getting in the way
[2013-04-29 19:58:01 -0400] UForgotten: if you use which you can see where your shell is finding the executable
[2013-04-29 19:58:06 -0400] behemphi_: though that might be rvm vs rbenv
[2013-04-29 19:58:32 -0400] UForgotten: you should stick with just one, each could be fighting you with different paths, gemsets, etc
[2013-04-29 19:58:47 -0400] behemphi_: y, it wasn't that was the trouble!  Very strange I thought, so I checked /opt nad it was empty.  But first I am gonna clean up around rvm a bit and move to rbenv
[2013-04-29 19:59:02 -0400] behemphi_: I agree completely, thx!
[2013-04-29 20:47:46 -0400] behemphi_: OK, so I have rvm ripped out (yay) and I can issue knife node list and see my nodes.
[2013-04-29 20:47:58 -0400] behemphi_: but when I run knife bootstrap I get this:
[2013-04-29 20:49:03 -0400] behemphi_: The error looks like this: /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/optparse.rb
[2013-04-29 20:49:10 -0400] behemphi_: and says invalid option -E
[2013-04-29 20:49:24 -0400] behemphi_: what is troubling is that it appears to be using ruby 1.8
[2013-04-29 20:49:36 -0400] behemphi_: but when I type ruby -v I get 
[2013-04-29 20:49:47 -0400] behemphi_: ruby 1.9.3p385 
[2013-04-29 20:50:14 -0400] behemphi_: I did to rbenv rehash, so I am pretty sure the "shim" as I understand it is in place
[2013-04-29 20:51:20 -0400] behemphi_: doh!  I just realized that the error is from the vagrant VM, not my workstation
[2013-04-29 20:51:23 -0400] behemphi_: <-- blushing
