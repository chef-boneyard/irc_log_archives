[2013-10-18 11:58:36 -0400] r: hi
[2013-10-18 11:59:18 -0400] Guest91433: hi again
[2013-10-18 11:59:40 -0400] Guest91433: do you know where I can find resources on cookbooks updating ?
[2013-10-18 12:00:01 -0400] Guest91433: I downloaded some cookboks from the community websites
[2013-10-18 12:00:10 -0400] Guest91433: thoses cookboks have been updated since
[2013-10-18 12:00:26 -0400] Guest91433: I don't remember how I can update the versions of those cookbocks on my servers
[2013-10-18 12:08:33 -0400] perryofpeek: @Guest91433 there are a couple of ways 
[2013-10-18 12:08:54 -0400] perryofpeek: simplest way is to knife cookbook upload <name of cookbook>
[2013-10-18 12:10:02 -0400] perryofpeek: there are a couple of better ways IMOH  1. is to use either berkshelf or librarian-chef , to download the cookbooks and write a script to "for each cookbook : knife upload  etc..."
[2013-10-18 12:10:22 -0400] perryofpeek: that way , you just run a script to update your server 
[2013-10-18 12:10:49 -0400] perryofpeek: this you can them put into a CI build , and then it's just a click of a button. 
[2013-10-18 12:12:52 -0400] Guest91433: thanks
[2013-10-18 12:13:16 -0400] Guest91433: but I have to update the cookbook on my machine first ?
[2013-10-18 12:16:39 -0400] perryofpeek: on the machine you are going to run the knife command yes 
[2013-10-18 12:17:17 -0400] perryofpeek: you might need the -o "path to cookbooks folder" switch too 
[2013-10-18 12:17:34 -0400] perryofpeek: then knife will basically copy that folder upto the chef server (more or less) 
[2013-10-18 12:34:20 -0400] Guest91433: actually, I already uploaded the version 0.5.1 of one of my cookbook
[2013-10-18 12:34:23 -0400] Guest91433: on my server
[2013-10-18 12:34:45 -0400] Guest91433: I try to knife cookbook download MyCookBook
[2013-10-18 12:34:59 -0400] Guest91433: although it's already present in my cookbook folder
[2013-10-18 12:35:07 -0400] Guest91433: it doesn't seem to be updated
[2013-10-18 13:58:14 -0400] dji: Morning.  Hoping someone can point me in the right direction.  I am using the opscode recipe for nginx, and have it up and running with passenger.  I am trying to sort out how to install my own nginx.conf.  Do I create my own recipe and just copy the file into place?  Do I clone the recipe and add my conf in there?  What's the best practice for something like this?
[2013-10-18 14:00:37 -0400] s2r2: chef-rewind the nginx template[.../nginx.conf] resource from your wrapper cookbook
[2013-10-18 14:00:54 -0400] s2r2: https://github.com/bryanwb/chef-rewind
[2013-10-18 14:01:24 -0400] dji: cheers
[2013-10-18 14:01:27 -0400] s2r2: but are you sure your requirements aren't met by the nginx cookbook?  I suppose it's quite popular...
[2013-10-18 14:02:52 -0400] dji: it's the various hosts I am trying to configure.  It's a vagrant dev box
[2013-10-18 14:15:24 -0400] dji: Thinking this is more what I am looking for, http://serverfault.com/questions/499263/vagrant-chef-nginx-cookbook-extend
[2013-10-18 14:21:07 -0400] s2r2: oh, good.
[2013-10-18 21:44:21 -0400] toddiuszho: When I login to https://preview.opscode.com/, I get a header, foot, and a gray sidebar. But the sidebar and main white area have NO CONTENT. I have tried in Chrome, IE 10, and Firefox.
[2013-10-18 22:16:47 -0400] jamesc: toddiuszho: what is your username on preview ?
