[2013-10-05 01:34:26 -0400] loknar28: I have been looking for a straight forward step by step guid to get up and running with a basic chef server and workstation to deploy a couple of nodes as a proof of concept and so far much of the information in the quick start guides and other resources has seemed somewhat disjointed. Is their a blog or other guid that someone could link me that might cover what im looking for?

[2013-10-05 22:38:47 -0400] purpleleaf: I'm writing a cookbook where recipes share some common code.  Cookbook::server will include_recipe cookbook::default and cookbook::client will do the same.  I'm trying to stop the recipe from running on unsupported platforms. If I "return" in the common code, the ::server or ::client recipe keeps running.  What's the DRY way to do this?  / Where do I put the platform check so I only do it once?
