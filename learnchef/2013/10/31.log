[2013-10-31 09:28:31 -0400] zytta: Hi. I am looking for a good example on how to use the deploy resource directly from a folder on disk. I am downloading our pre-built system directly from S3. 
[2013-10-31 20:25:56 -0400] fedegl_: Hi, i would like to install a different version of oracle java that comes with the java recipe
[2013-10-31 20:26:20 -0400] fedegl_: And so, I have updated the url and checksum
[2013-10-31 20:27:09 -0400] fedegl_: but it's still installing the one specified in the recipe
[2013-10-31 20:27:48 -0400] fedegl_: These are the default attributes: 
[2013-10-31 20:27:51 -0400] fedegl_: default_attributes(   java: {     oracle: {       "accept_oracle_download_terms" => true     },     install_flavor: "oracle",     jdk_version: "7",     jdk: {"7" => {"x86_64" => {       "url" => "http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/7u45-b18/jdk-7u45-linux-x64.tar.gz",       "checksum" => "e3b0c44298fc"     }}}   } )
[2013-10-31 20:32:03 -0400] tomduffield: fedegl_ where are you specifying the overrides?
[2013-10-31 20:32:27 -0400] fedegl_: on the role
[2013-10-31 20:39:56 -0400] tomduffield: is the above code from your role? are you using the Ruby DSL?
[2013-10-31 20:40:06 -0400] tomduffield: fedegl_ ^^^
[2013-10-31 20:40:12 -0400] fedegl_: yes, is from the role
[2013-10-31 20:40:19 -0400] fedegl_: and yes I am using the ruby dsl
[2013-10-31 20:40:22 -0400] tomduffield: okay
[2013-10-31 20:40:30 -0400] tomduffield: key: value is the syntax for JSON
[2013-10-31 20:40:41 -0400] tomduffield: key => value is the syntax for Ruby
[2013-10-31 20:40:47 -0400] tomduffield: so it should look more like this:
[2013-10-31 20:41:02 -0400] CPS: i want to have a 'geography' attribute on each of my nodes. what's the best way to define this?
[2013-10-31 20:41:07 -0400] fedegl_: key: value is also the syntax un ruby 1.9
[2013-10-31 20:41:08 -0400] tomduffield: "java" => { "oracle" => { "accept_oracle_download_terms": => true
[2013-10-31 20:42:10 -0400] tomduffield: fedegl_ really? i've never head that. where did you hear that?
[2013-10-31 20:43:23 -0400] fedegl_: I am ruby dev, I use it all the time
[2013-10-31 20:44:38 -0400] tomduffield: fedegl_ Its not that I dont believe you, its just that I wanted to read more about it :)
[2013-10-31 20:48:13 -0400] fedegl_: http://breakthebit.org/post/8453341914/ruby-1-9-and-the-new-hash-syntax
[2013-10-31 20:49:16 -0400] tomduffield: huh, thats cool fedegl_. thanks
[2013-10-31 20:49:37 -0400] tomduffield: as for what is going on with your code...
[2013-10-31 20:54:24 -0400] tomduffield: fedegl_ not quite sure what is happening. While it should be supported the only thing I can recommend based on what you gave me is to humor me and try the => syntax
[2013-10-31 20:54:45 -0400] tomduffield: you could also try debugging with chef-shell or pry
[2013-10-31 20:54:58 -0400] fedegl_: ok, I will thanks.
[2013-10-31 20:55:03 -0400] fedegl_: how can I debug it?
[2013-10-31 20:55:21 -0400] tomduffield: chef-shell is an IRB for Chef runs
[2013-10-31 20:56:07 -0400] tomduffield: should be able to walk through loading cookbooks + roles and see what is happening to your attributes
[2013-10-31 21:25:13 -0400] fedegl_: tomduffield_ I have changed the hash syntax and it now seems that the recipe is unable to download the oracle tar file
[2013-10-31 21:25:47 -0400] tomduffield: hmm...that sounds like a more expected error. any particular error you are getting?
[2013-10-31 21:39:59 -0400] fedegl_: and forbidden error
[2013-10-31 21:40:18 -0400] fedegl_: which would kind of make sense since you need to accept terms and conditions
[2013-10-31 21:40:35 -0400] fedegl_: but the java cookbook is supposed to handle that
[2013-10-31 21:43:06 -0400] tomduffield: i think your role attributes might be off
[2013-10-31 21:43:08 -0400] tomduffield: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/java/blob/master/attributes/default.rb
[2013-10-31 21:43:29 -0400] tomduffield: node['java']['accept_license_agreement']
[2013-10-31 21:43:44 -0400] tomduffield: make sure that is set to true as well I think
[2013-10-31 21:48:03 -0400] tomduffield: but to be honest i'm not sure what is going on without looking at your code and running tests
