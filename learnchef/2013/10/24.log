[2013-10-24 11:17:58 -0400] quatrix: Hi, is there a way to reinstall a recipe that thinks there's nothing to udpate?
[2013-10-24 11:18:51 -0400] quatrix: I've tried installing the 'tmux' cookbook, which failed compling libevent, but when i rerun the cookbook it says 'up to date' even though tmux nor libevent installed.
[2013-10-24 13:52:22 -0400] joe_k: as far as I know, recipes always run their rules
[2013-10-24 13:52:37 -0400] joe_k: i guess you could put conditional logic in them but I don't
[2013-10-24 14:28:40 -0400] joe_k: ruby is a fucking mess
[2013-10-24 14:28:46 -0400] joe_k: its not suitable for a professional product
[2013-10-24 14:29:02 -0400] joe_k: i can't believe they can't get arg parsing right, and I bet no one cares
[2013-10-24 14:30:36 -0400] joe_k: as long as rails runs, right?
[2013-10-24 14:36:07 -0400] CPS: mmzyk: found a workaround for the space in path issue for windows. using "C:\progra~1" seems to work if you're trying to get to program files
[2013-10-24 14:37:22 -0400] joe_k: saying that "works" is setting the bar for "work" pretty low
[2013-10-24 14:37:46 -0400] joe_k: what if the filesystem path is ~2 because anothe file shares the prefix?
[2013-10-24 14:37:48 -0400] CPS: eh, it's open source
[2013-10-24 14:41:55 -0400] mmzyk: Well, we do aim for a higher bar than that.
[2013-10-24 14:43:24 -0400] mmzyk: quatrix The question is why does the recipe think there is nothing to update.
[2013-10-24 14:43:33 -0400] CPS: and joe_k progra~2 is program files (x86) so that could actually be useful
[2013-10-24 14:43:35 -0400] mmzyk: For some reason Chef is seeing all the code as in place already.
[2013-10-24 14:44:07 -0400] mmzyk: joe_k Yeah, ruby is a mess on windows. Chef was obviously not born on windows.
[2013-10-24 14:45:36 -0400] joe_k: i know. i just need to invest in something that will make things easier and not harder
[2013-10-24 14:45:36 -0400] gclark85: Can anyone recommend a guide on setting up chef to control a vsphere environment rather than amazon?
[2013-10-24 14:46:37 -0400] mmzyk: joe_k Right. My continued apologies for all the trouble. It's certainly got us talking internally about the corners of windows support we've clearly not gotten right yet.
[2013-10-24 14:46:56 -0400] mmzyk: glcark85 I don't know of any, but you might have more luck asking that question in #chef.
[2013-10-24 14:47:16 -0400] joe_k: its making me thing i need to make a career choice away from windows
[2013-10-24 14:47:19 -0400] joe_k: think
[2013-10-24 14:47:55 -0400] gclark85: thanks mmzyk, I have still not been able to get my windows box to install the cookbooks properly
[2013-10-24 14:47:57 -0400] mmzyk: Yeah, I don't know of a windows cm alternative. Chef and Puppet are the only two that currently support it, as far as I know.
[2013-10-24 14:48:57 -0400] mmzyk: well damn gclark85. Can you just blow the chef-repo away and try it all again? I'm not sure what went wrong with the errors you mentioned yesterday.
[2013-10-24 14:49:21 -0400] gclark85: Yup I tried that and I got some new interesting messages that I can't repost cause I'm not at home
[2013-10-24 14:49:41 -0400] gclark85: basically I got the extraction all working ok by being in the correct directory
[2013-10-24 14:49:43 -0400] mmzyk: huh, okay. Any more detail you can give then that?
[2013-10-24 14:50:05 -0400] gclark85: so when I do the cookbook install commands, it would do aliases and I believe magic_shell ok
[2013-10-24 14:50:21 -0400] gclark85: but then on apt and apache2 it singled out some files that it said something about not being able to understand or something like that
[2013-10-24 14:50:42 -0400] gclark85: so the VM comes up and everything but there is no apache2 or apt
[2013-10-24 14:51:00 -0400] mmzyk: . sigh, and those worked yesterday.
[2013-10-24 14:51:04 -0400] mmzyk: What type of vm is it?
[2013-10-24 14:51:18 -0400] gclark85: it's the one that magically downloads using vagrant
[2013-10-24 14:51:24 -0400] gclark85: I think ubuntu 10.04
[2013-10-24 14:51:26 -0400] mmzyk: okay.
[2013-10-24 14:51:27 -0400] gclark85: maybe 12.04
[2013-10-24 14:52:03 -0400] mmzyk: yeah, that's fine, I just wanted to make sure it was linux based and not windows. I know you're on windows, but I'm trying to keep each one straight.
[2013-10-24 14:52:35 -0400] gclark85: yup, just following the learning chef for windows guide verbatum
[2013-10-24 14:53:37 -0400] gclark85: so my thinking is I can stand up an ubuntu vm, use that as my workstation, then do this all again in linux
[2013-10-24 14:54:16 -0400] gclark85: but then the question is how do I point vagrant (I assume thats what I would use) to install the vm into my vsphere cluster rather than onto virtualbox
[2013-10-24 14:55:02 -0400] mmzyk: yeah, I'm going to get a windows vm and go through that guide myself to try and sort some of this mess out. My apologies to everyone.
[2013-10-24 14:56:52 -0400] mmzyk: gclark85 It's doable, but that gets into getting vagrants port forwarding setup properly, I believe. That is ideally not the route you would have to go. I'd much rather get your workstation setup, although joe_k might say that's not the best idea.
[2013-10-24 14:59:27 -0400] joe_k: gclark85: you'd likely need to install the knife-vsphere plugin
[2013-10-24 14:59:47 -0400] joe_k: gclark85: set your vsphere creds/etc in the .chef/knife.rb
[2013-10-24 15:00:00 -0400] joe_k: oh wait. vagrant
[2013-10-24 15:00:06 -0400] joe_k: not knife provisioning. 
[2013-10-24 15:00:08 -0400] joe_k: dunno. 
[2013-10-24 15:00:32 -0400] joe_k: i almost got vagrant working with windows, but its another "hip" ruby tool so didn't work
[2013-10-24 15:00:44 -0400] joe_k: expects things that just aren't on windows (rsync)
[2013-10-24 15:01:49 -0400] gclark85: mmzyk I'm happy to connect again once I get home today.  I'll be home at lunch time EST so I'll send you the error messages, what was the github thing for pasting anon code?
[2013-10-24 15:01:56 -0400] joe_k: gist
[2013-10-24 15:02:00 -0400] gclark85: thanks
[2013-10-24 15:02:25 -0400] mmzyk: yeah, that's it: gist.github.com
[2013-10-24 15:02:36 -0400] mmzyk: If for some reason I'm not around, you can also email me at mm@opscode.com
[2013-10-24 15:03:02 -0400] gclark85: joe_k I don't necessarily have to use vagrant, I don't know what it is really, just a newb
[2013-10-24 15:03:31 -0400] gclark85: but I would like to toy around with that too since our environment is ultimately vsphere
[2013-10-24 15:04:11 -0400] mmzyk: vagrant is a vm management tool basically. http://www.vagrantup.com
[2013-10-24 15:04:51 -0400] gclark85: So basically if I already have vsphere, some linux servers, and a windows host...I really just need the knife plugin for vmware and get the windows host working and I can start cooking the linux vms
[2013-10-24 15:04:56 -0400] gclark85: sans vagrant
[2013-10-24 15:05:01 -0400] mmzyk: Not likely something you're going to use day to day if you're using vsphere (and not required for chef) but we use it in the starter guide to try and help ensure everyone has the same starter environment.
[2013-10-24 15:05:13 -0400] mmzyk: glcark85 yes.
[2013-10-24 15:05:13 -0400] joe_k: yeah basically the idea is you write a "Vagrantfile" that describes the machine you need
[2013-10-24 15:05:15 -0400] gclark85: Makes sense
[2013-10-24 15:05:23 -0400] joe_k: then "vagrant up" to auto-provision it
[2013-10-24 15:06:19 -0400] gclark85: I'll be in the webinar today so hopefully I get some more light on it
[2013-10-24 15:06:23 -0400] gclark85: I'll ask a few questions
[2013-10-24 15:06:29 -0400] joe_k: kind of like describing your dependencies for a software project
[2013-10-24 15:06:37 -0400] joe_k: you can describe what kind of test machine you need to run tests
[2013-10-24 15:06:49 -0400] joe_k: or what kind of environment you need to compile/build
[2013-10-24 15:06:51 -0400] gclark85: I'm a sys admin guy so my software abilities are not super strong
[2013-10-24 15:07:26 -0400] mmzyk: Ask away. We'll help as best we can.
[2013-10-24 15:07:36 -0400] gclark85: Basically I am trying to tie chef into our nagios server so I can automate the services and checks
[2013-10-24 15:07:56 -0400] joe_k: so do you want chef to configure your machines with nagios?
[2013-10-24 15:08:14 -0400] gclark85: I don't know enough yet to know what i want it to do!
[2013-10-24 15:08:15 -0400] gclark85: lol
[2013-10-24 15:08:19 -0400] gclark85: so we are a windows shop
[2013-10-24 15:08:37 -0400] gclark85: but I have ubuntu 12.04 with nagios for monitoring
[2013-10-24 15:08:51 -0400] gclark85: I manually update all the configs using notepad++ with new IPs, plugins, etc
[2013-10-24 15:08:57 -0400] joe_k: chef is good at configuring machines.  it can also provision them (knife-vsphere and knife-ec2, etc) and then bootstrap them with a configuration
[2013-10-24 15:09:57 -0400] joe_k: I THINK configurations are supposed to be able to refer to e.g. other machines IPs, but I have never seen an example of it
[2013-10-24 15:10:01 -0400] joe_k: "search" or something
[2013-10-24 15:10:12 -0400] gclark85: yea thats what I have been reading
[2013-10-24 15:10:31 -0400] mmzyk: Yes, that can be done joe_k, using search, so long as there is a chef server somewhere.
[2013-10-24 15:10:40 -0400] mmzyk: chef-solo doesn't support search.
[2013-10-24 15:10:52 -0400] gclark85: ok so I can't just put chef on the nagios server
[2013-10-24 15:10:57 -0400] gclark85: I'll need a separate
[2013-10-24 15:11:01 -0400] gclark85: vm
[2013-10-24 15:11:57 -0400] mmzyk: that's probably the best way to configure it, although you could put it on the nagios server if you really wanted to. I don't think I'd recommend that though.
[2013-10-24 15:12:15 -0400] gclark85: thats no problem, ubuntu servers are a dime a dozen :P
[2013-10-24 15:12:33 -0400] mmzyk: I would recommend it that way, as it's a cleaner separation of concerns.
[2013-10-24 15:12:42 -0400] gclark85: Definitely
[2013-10-24 17:53:15 -0400] gclark85: mmzyk you around?
[2013-10-24 17:53:47 -0400] mmzyk: yup.
[2013-10-24 17:54:21 -0400] gclark85: Ok going to gist some stuff
[2013-10-24 17:55:50 -0400] mmzyk: sounds good.
[2013-10-24 17:56:05 -0400] gclark85: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7141998
[2013-10-24 17:56:14 -0400] gclark85: so that is my work from page two on the quickstart
[2013-10-24 17:56:23 -0400] gclark85: basically starting with magic_shell and on
[2013-10-24 17:56:49 -0400] gclark85: see the initial failure of the knife cookbook site install magic_shell
[2013-10-24 17:57:02 -0400] gclark85: then I change directories to cookbooks, rerun the tar -zxvf manually and it works ok
[2013-10-24 17:57:14 -0400] gclark85: but the knife cookbook upload --all doesn't work
[2013-10-24 17:57:17 -0400] gclark85: weird error
[2013-10-24 17:58:58 -0400] gclark85: and then here is uploading each cookbook individually
[2013-10-24 17:59:00 -0400] gclark85: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7142047
[2013-10-24 17:59:19 -0400] gclark85: aliases works and magic_shell works but apt and apache2 fail on the same error
[2013-10-24 18:00:44 -0400] gclark85: headed back to work, catch up later
[2013-10-24 18:00:45 -0400] mmzyk: okay, let me look something up that I saw the other day that might explain/solve this.
[2013-10-24 18:00:57 -0400] gclark85: ok I'll  leave this on so It'll come through
[2013-10-24 18:02:22 -0400] mmzyk: glclark85 I think you're running into a recently discovered bug that a fix hasn't been issued for.
[2013-10-24 18:02:43 -0400] mmzyk: Here's the message we just prepped for the quick start guide but hasn't been put up:
[2013-10-24 18:02:44 -0400] mmzyk: [WARN] The Windows .msi installer for Chef 11.6.2 does not include the "erubis" gem. If you are having trouble running this on a Windows workstation, try "gem install erubis". This will be fixed in future versions.
[2013-10-24 20:37:37 -0400] CPS: gclark85: i saw you said you do a lot of manual config file editing. chef has directives called templates you can use to programmatically fill in stuff
[2013-10-24 20:37:52 -0400] CPS: i'm using that for our configs, great if the same value appears multiple places
[2013-10-24 20:38:51 -0400] gclark85: that might be what I'm looking for, basically we have lets say 30 servers that need the exact same monitoring, then some clusters that will need like exchange monitoring, sharepoint, webserver, etc, then switches all need the same monitoring, etc
[2013-10-24 20:40:13 -0400] mmzyk: cool.
[2013-10-24 20:41:41 -0400] gclark85: so what you sent me definitely got by what the issue was with the upload
[2013-10-24 20:41:50 -0400] gclark85: but I'm still stuck on the convergence
[2013-10-24 20:43:59 -0400] gclark85: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7144630
[2013-10-24 20:44:43 -0400] CPS: probably something in client.rb is wrong
[2013-10-24 20:45:08 -0400] CPS: looks like it validated the user exists but doesn't have rights
[2013-10-24 20:45:44 -0400] gclark85: you mean knife.rb?
[2013-10-24 20:45:56 -0400] CPS: nope
[2013-10-24 20:46:02 -0400] gclark85: wheres client.rb
[2013-10-24 20:46:11 -0400] CPS: client.rb in C:\chef on windows
[2013-10-24 20:46:47 -0400] CPS: specifies the user and validation file to use to talk to the server
[2013-10-24 20:48:53 -0400] gclark85: so lets say I don't have that folder
[2013-10-24 20:49:46 -0400] CPS: is chef installed?
[2013-10-24 20:50:53 -0400] gclark85: doing a repair just to se
[2013-10-24 20:50:55 -0400] gclark85: see
[2013-10-24 20:50:58 -0400] gclark85: there is a c:\opscode
[2013-10-24 20:51:18 -0400] gclark85: but no client.rb in it
[2013-10-24 20:51:21 -0400] CPS: it's not in there
[2013-10-24 20:51:31 -0400] gclark85: no wonder I'm having so many problems :S
[2013-10-24 20:51:44 -0400] CPS: i'm still new at this, i'm not sure where the directory comes from
[2013-10-24 20:52:26 -0400] mmzyk: It would be installed when chef is installed on the system.
[2013-10-24 20:52:26 -0400] gclark85: ok well I must have screwed something up cause a repair put that folder back, although there is nothing in it
[2013-10-24 20:52:31 -0400] CPS: basically c:\chef houses the file that tells chef-client how to do what it does and contains validation pems 
[2013-10-24 20:52:36 -0400] gclark85: I guess I'll start all over
[2013-10-24 20:53:01 -0400] gclark85: but my pem files are in the chef-repo folder
[2013-10-24 20:53:55 -0400] mmzyk: So, I missed it - are we on your workstation or the vm, gclark85?
[2013-10-24 20:54:28 -0400] gclark85: workstation, windows 7
[2013-10-24 20:54:30 -0400] CPS: chef-repo has folders for config, cookbooks, etc?
[2013-10-24 20:55:08 -0400] gclark85: ya chef-repo is the quick start download from opscode, it has all that plus the pem files in .chef
[2013-10-24 20:55:41 -0400] CPS: yeah mmzyk i've got pems in C:\chef-repo\.chef and C:\chef 
[2013-10-24 20:55:48 -0400] CPS: what is the purpose of those directories exactly?
[2013-10-24 20:56:05 -0400] mmzyk: So did you also run the chef-client msi on your machine gclark85?
[2013-10-24 20:56:21 -0400] mmzyk: CPS let's see, what pems do you have in each dir?
[2013-10-24 20:56:46 -0400] mmzyk: It's all about signing the requests to the server, but the pems serve different purposes.
[2013-10-24 20:56:48 -0400] gclark85: I'm starting all over, ignore me for the while
[2013-10-24 20:56:48 -0400] CPS: C:\chef\validation.pem is referenced in client.rb
[2013-10-24 20:57:38 -0400] CPS: c:\chef-repo\.chef\username.pem and chef-validator.pem, of those username is referenced in knife.rb
[2013-10-24 20:57:55 -0400] mmzyk: gclark85 If I'm not around, feel free to email me at mm@opscode.com and I'll try to help you out when I have a moment.
[2013-10-24 20:58:14 -0400] CPS: knife.rb has validation_client_name 'chef-validator' but the validation key is 'C:\chef\chef-validator'
[2013-10-24 20:58:17 -0400] gclark85: k
[2013-10-24 21:01:08 -0400] mmzyk: CPS yeah, the username one is used for your signing. The validator one is a one time use key that used to get the box initially setup and talking to the server.
[2013-10-24 21:02:08 -0400] mmzyk: CPS These docs explain it all: http://docs.opscode.com/chef/auth.html
[2013-10-24 21:03:32 -0400] gclark85: well I did it good now
[2013-10-24 21:03:38 -0400] gclark85: I broke the opscode website!
[2013-10-24 21:03:39 -0400] gclark85: lolz
[2013-10-24 21:06:03 -0400] gclark85: oh nevermind I'm crazy
[2013-10-24 21:09:47 -0400] mmzyk: gclark85 no worries, pretty sure we're all crazy.
[2013-10-24 21:13:11 -0400] gclark85: for what it's worth, the knife cookbook upload --all works fine if you have chef installed properly :D
[2013-10-24 21:21:36 -0400] gclark85: YAY I GOT IT WORKING
[2013-10-24 22:31:11 -0400] gclark85: can anyone tell me how to set my knife.rb to connect to aws?  I get a message "you did not provide a valide aws access key id but it looks correct
[2013-10-24 22:38:54 -0400] enigmabomb: Hello. I'm having a hard time installing Chef with Mavericks. I get this message: No builds for platform: 10.9
[2013-10-24 22:39:05 -0400] enigmabomb: When will there be a Mavericks Chef?
[2013-10-24 22:40:41 -0400] enigmabomb:  Or can I over ride this and just take my chances?
[2013-10-24 23:02:35 -0400] GeoffC_: anyone on that can help with knife.rb and EC2
