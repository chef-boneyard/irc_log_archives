[2013-10-07 13:44:11 -0400] cps: I set up a chef server. I can ping it successfully from another box, and when I put the IP into the address bar it successfully resolves to https://fqdn, but it is unable to establish a connection
[2013-10-07 13:44:29 -0400] cps: is there something i need to do to allow other computers to connect to the web thing?
[2013-10-07 16:32:06 -0400] CPS: i set up chef server and can reach the web interface locally. when i attempt to connect from another box the url successfully resolves to https://fqdn, but it is unable to establish a connection
[2013-10-07 16:32:19 -0400] CPS: is there anything i need to do on either the server or other box to be able to connect?
[2013-10-07 17:08:46 -0400] PeNNyWiSe182__: try http .. I had the same issue
[2013-10-07 17:30:35 -0400] geggam_: perhaps iptables is blocking the ports ? 
[2013-10-07 18:33:26 -0400] CPS: PeNNyWiS_: i start with http://ip, it resolves to https://fqdn, but fails to connect
[2013-10-07 18:33:41 -0400] CPS: geggam_: this is going from a windows machine to ubuntu chef server
[2013-10-07 18:34:00 -0400] CPS: both machines are on the same network
[2013-10-07 18:36:07 -0400] geggam_: so ... iptables run on the ubuntu linux .. i would check to see if they are allowing connections to port 443 
[2013-10-07 18:38:26 -0400] CPS: is that disabled by default? i haven't touched the iptables on this box
[2013-10-07 18:41:56 -0400] geggam_: dunno... running a server on linux should imply you understand those basics
[2013-10-07 18:43:07 -0400] geggam_: run /sbin/iptables -L 
[2013-10-07 18:43:16 -0400] geggam_: and look to see if the ports are open  / closed
[2013-10-07 18:44:18 -0400] CPS: doesn't list https
[2013-10-07 18:44:23 -0400] CPS: only tcp and udp
[2013-10-07 18:44:29 -0400] geggam_: hunh ? 
[2013-10-07 18:44:44 -0400] geggam_: pastebin the output
[2013-10-07 18:48:06 -0400] CPS: http://pastebin.com/ftBKjUWc
[2013-10-07 18:49:02 -0400] geggam_: only thing you have accepting connections is dns with both tcp and udp
[2013-10-07 18:49:10 -0400] geggam_: you need to open http and https
[2013-10-07 18:51:05 -0400] CPS: sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
[2013-10-07 18:51:15 -0400] CPS: did that for 80 and 443, still can't connect
[2013-10-07 18:51:48 -0400] geggam_: does windows have telnet ? 
[2013-10-07 18:52:35 -0400] geggam_: can u run ... on the linux machine ... curl localhost:443 
[2013-10-07 18:52:39 -0400] geggam_: can u run ... on the linux machine ... curl localhost:80
[2013-10-07 18:54:11 -0400] CPS: 80 gives me a 301. 443 a 400
[2013-10-07 18:54:47 -0400] geggam_: do you have another machine.... linux... on that same network  ?
[2013-10-07 18:55:00 -0400] geggam_: i have no idea how to use windows ... silly isnt it ? 
[2013-10-07 18:55:02 -0400] CPS: i have putty on windows, telnet to ip on 443 gives  a network error
[2013-10-07 18:56:26 -0400] CPS: windows doesn't have curl or any useful command line network tool i'm aware of, i have no other linux box
[2013-10-07 18:57:25 -0400] CPS: can't even specify a port on ping
[2013-10-07 18:57:26 -0400] geggam_: http://curl.haxx.se/download.html 
[2013-10-07 18:57:31 -0400] geggam_: windows curl
[2013-10-07 18:58:16 -0400] bean: CPS: 400 means "bad request" usually
[2013-10-07 18:58:20 -0400] geggam_: i havent used windows in 10ish years... i have an XP box at home i used for my cctv viewer but other than that i avoid windows and mac products
[2013-10-07 18:58:37 -0400] geggam_: yeah bean... service is listening so he just needs to figure out why windows isnt gettign there
[2013-10-07 18:58:51 -0400] bean: looks like he's getting there to me. 
[2013-10-07 18:58:56 -0400] bean: 400 means something went wrong on the server.
[2013-10-07 18:59:01 -0400] bean: likely
[2013-10-07 18:59:06 -0400] geggam_: that would be from the localhost linux machine ... 
[2013-10-07 18:59:15 -0400] bean: ah
[2013-10-07 18:59:34 -0400] geggam_: curl command with no credentials to a chef server will give an error
[2013-10-07 18:59:39 -0400] bean: yep
[2013-10-07 18:59:47 -0400] geggam_: like a 400 :)
[2013-10-07 19:00:15 -0400] CPS: curl from windows gives 400
[2013-10-07 19:00:25 -0400] CPS: on 443
[2013-10-07 19:00:53 -0400] CPS: 80 fails to connect, no such server
[2013-10-07 19:01:08 -0400] bean: is it possible that it's not listening on 80?
[2013-10-07 19:01:15 -0400] bean: or is only listening on localhost?
[2013-10-07 19:01:33 -0400] CPS: sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
[2013-10-07 19:01:42 -0400] CPS: i ran that, that should open up 80 right?
[2013-10-07 19:01:51 -0400] bean: not if its just listening on 127.0.0.1
[2013-10-07 19:02:00 -0400] bean: check the output of "netstat -lpn"
[2013-10-07 19:02:57 -0400] CPS: all of the listens are either localhost or no IP
[2013-10-07 19:03:09 -0400] geggam_: *  ? 
[2013-10-07 19:03:24 -0400] bean: right, but what about port 80.
[2013-10-07 19:03:30 -0400] bean: is its localhost or no ip
[2013-10-07 19:03:42 -0400] CPS: tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -             
[2013-10-07 19:03:49 -0400] bean: k, so its listening on all ips
[2013-10-07 19:04:03 -0400] CPS: 443 is the same
[2013-10-07 19:04:39 -0400] bean: right
[2013-10-07 19:04:44 -0400] bean: so then theres something else in the way
[2013-10-07 19:05:30 -0400] CPS: i'm on my work's network but the machines are plugged in right next to each other
[2013-10-07 19:05:48 -0400] bean: k
[2013-10-07 19:06:02 -0400] bean: so even with curl it couldn't connect
[2013-10-07 19:06:02 -0400] bean: ?
[2013-10-07 19:06:19 -0400] geggam_: work ?... do you have a network team ? 
[2013-10-07 19:06:24 -0400] CPS: curl on 443 gave a 400
[2013-10-07 19:06:33 -0400] CPS: but it got a response
[2013-10-07 19:22:28 -0400] bean: CPS: so, a browser still fails?
[2013-10-07 19:22:32 -0400] bean: what browser...
[2013-10-07 20:38:47 -0400] CPS: bean: yeah, firefox fails
[2013-10-07 20:39:01 -0400] bean: can't say im a fan of that browser.
[2013-10-07 20:40:04 -0400] CPS: gets farther than chrome
[2013-10-07 20:40:17 -0400] CPS: firefox can at least resolve the domain name
[2013-10-07 20:43:24 -0400] CPS: neither does IE
[2013-10-07 21:32:06 -0400] bean: sounds like your windows server is using the wrong DNS servers, CPS
