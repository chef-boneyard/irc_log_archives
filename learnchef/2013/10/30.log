[2013-10-30 00:12:49 -0400] quack_up: hey friends.  anybody have experience using the chef-client cookbook? i have a base role with chef-client::config, chef-client::service, and chef-client::init_service (in that order)... but when i bootstrap machines iwth that role, they don't end up with the service running
[2013-10-30 00:13:11 -0400] quack_up: i have to manually "service chef-client start"
[2013-10-30 00:13:29 -0400] quack_up: which is a bummer.  i thought this would mean magic running chef-client service.
