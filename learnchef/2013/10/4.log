[2013-10-04 07:50:32 -0400] dhina: Hi all , I am new to chef , i want to know some information ?
[2013-10-04 07:50:50 -0400] dhina: 1. is it a opensource or free software ?
[2013-10-04 13:49:46 -0400] cps: I'm following this guide: http://www.linuxguy.in/how-to-install-and-configure-open-source-chef-server-11/ I'm on step 7 to set up a workstation. This is another computer, not the server I set up, correct?
[2013-10-04 14:28:58 -0400] thesolonius: cps: I'd think so.  That's configuring chef-client to talk to your newly minted chef-server
[2013-10-04 14:29:09 -0400] thesolonius: you could run client and server on the same box, if you wanted
[2013-10-04 17:55:55 -0400] joe_k: can anyone help me understand how to get the chef tools onto a windows machine?
[2013-10-04 17:56:08 -0400] joe_k: http://docs.opscode.com/install_workstation.html says "Microsoft Windows machines are supported, but they are not described as part of the current install documentation"
[2013-10-04 17:56:13 -0400] joe_k: well doesnt that mean they aren't supported?
[2013-10-04 17:56:17 -0400] joe_k: as in, there is no support provided?
[2013-10-04 17:56:21 -0400] joe_k: supported != "exists"
[2013-10-04 17:57:10 -0400] joe_k: http://www.opscode.com/solutions/windows/#built-in-windows-support click "get chef" -> leads to form that feeds their sales pipeline, not a download
[2013-10-04 18:03:24 -0400] joe_k: is chef-client the agent? or the admin workstation?
[2013-10-04 18:04:21 -0400] tomduffield: chef-client is the agent that runs on your node
[2013-10-04 18:04:38 -0400] joe_k: node = managed machine?
[2013-10-04 18:04:48 -0400] tomduffield: correct
[2013-10-04 18:05:13 -0400] joe_k: so what is to be installed for an admin workstation?
[2013-10-04 18:05:35 -0400] josephholsten: joe_k: we use the knife-windows plugin to bootstrap windows nodes
[2013-10-04 18:05:52 -0400] tomduffield: you want to use knife to manage your chef server
[2013-10-04 18:06:02 -0400] tomduffield: aka your nodes, cookbook, databags, etc
[2013-10-04 18:06:12 -0400] josephholsten: as for installing chef tooling, it should just be able to use the chef gem in whatever ruby install you prefer
[2013-10-04 18:06:12 -0400] joe_k: the knife-windows plugin is a plugin to what?
[2013-10-04 18:06:16 -0400] joe_k: what do I need to install to run it
[2013-10-04 18:06:49 -0400] tomduffield: joe_k: have you been following along here: https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/workstation-setup/
[2013-10-04 18:06:54 -0400] josephholsten: `knife-windows` is a gem which augments the `chef` gem's `knife` command.
[2013-10-04 18:07:01 -0400] joe_k: josephholsten: how do you get remote access to the windows machines? do you have to log in by hand first and "fix them" before they can be automated?
[2013-10-04 18:07:04 -0400] josephholsten: do you have ruby installed?
[2013-10-04 18:07:59 -0400] joe_k: should have it installed
[2013-10-04 18:08:08 -0400] josephholsten: joe_k: probably. we've found rackspace's default windows images work fine out of the box.
[2013-10-04 18:08:14 -0400] joe_k: so chef is not a program that exists other than a ruby gem?
[2013-10-04 18:08:29 -0400] joe_k: josephholsten: work fine, modulo the hand-tweaking you mean?
[2013-10-04 18:08:39 -0400] josephholsten: joe_k: it definitely is more complicated that that, sorry
[2013-10-04 18:08:43 -0400] joe_k: i am eager to find one I dont have to hand-tweak to either install SSH or turn on WinRM
[2013-10-04 18:09:02 -0400] josephholsten: you do need at least either ssh or winrm.
[2013-10-04 18:09:07 -0400] joe_k: because its the "getting the windows machine up" part that I am trying to automate
[2013-10-04 18:09:12 -0400] joe_k: not "keep a running machine running"
[2013-10-04 18:12:11 -0400] josephholsten: when I ran my own virtualization, I created a base image with winrm turned on. it worked well.
[2013-10-04 18:17:13 -0400] cps: Creating initial API user... ERROR: Network Error: Error connecting <server>
[2013-10-04 18:17:21 -0400] cps: when running knife configure --initial
[2013-10-04 18:17:33 -0400] cps: the server IP responds to a ping but knife config fails
[2013-10-04 18:17:39 -0400] cps: any ideas?
[2013-10-04 18:22:24 -0400] cps: the server is an ubuntu box i set up
[2013-10-04 18:39:38 -0400] cps: my server is rejecting http requests
[2013-10-04 18:39:51 -0400] cps: but the ip successfully resolves to the fqdn
[2013-10-04 18:40:04 -0400] cps: and goes from http to https
[2013-10-04 18:40:14 -0400] cps: why might this be?
[2013-10-04 19:03:17 -0400] cps: domain issues, problem solved
[2013-10-04 19:30:58 -0400] solr_app_help: hi, i'm getting an error when i run chef-client with solr_app
[2013-10-04 19:31:16 -0400] solr_app_help: resource java_webapp is not defined
[2013-10-04 19:31:31 -0400] solr_app_help: has anyone seen this behavior before?
