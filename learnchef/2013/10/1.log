[2013-10-01 05:27:23 -0400] Ron__: Hello.  Typically, does the version of chef-client and chef have to match?
[2013-10-01 05:29:11 -0400] mmzyk: normally, yes. although 10.x client will work with Chef server 11.
[2013-10-01 05:29:25 -0400] mmzyk: although there are some features that don't work.
[2013-10-01 05:31:07 -0400] Ron__: Thanks.  I am attempting to do the Vagrant example, but seem to be running into trouble and I thought it might be related to the version.
[2013-10-01 05:31:39 -0400] Ron__: vagrant@vagrant:~$ chef-client /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mixlib-log-1.4.1/lib/mixlib/log.rb:97:in `level=': Log level must be one of :debug, :info, :warn, :error, or :fatal (ArgumentError)
[2013-10-01 05:32:21 -0400] Ron__: Any thoughts?  The only thing I found online was someone stating the newer version of chef uses :auto which might be messing things up, but its unclear to me.
[2013-10-01 05:33:48 -0400] mmzyk: well, what version of things are you running?
[2013-10-01 05:34:01 -0400] Ron__: chef-client -v Chef: 10.18.2
[2013-10-01 05:34:58 -0400] mmzyk: What step are you at in the example? I assume off of learn chef?
[2013-10-01 05:35:23 -0400] Ron__: Correct.
[2013-10-01 05:36:09 -0400] mmzyk: What step are you at in the example?
[2013-10-01 05:36:47 -0400] Ron__: bootstrap
[2013-10-01 05:36:50 -0400] mmzyk: And do you have any more output than the simple line you posted?
[2013-10-01 05:37:34 -0400] Ron__: Yeah, here is the full output of knife.  The above was the first line from running chef-client directly on the vargrant box.
[2013-10-01 05:37:35 -0400] Ron__: knife bootstrap localhost --ssh-user vagrant --ssh-password vagrant --ssh-port 2222 --run-list "recipe[apt],recipe[aliases],recipe[apache2]" --sudo Bootstrapping Chef on localhost localhost /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mixlib-log-1.4.1/lib/mixlib/log.rb:97:in `level=' localhost : Log level must be one of :debug, :info, :warn, :error, or :fatal (ArgumentError) localhost from /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/
[2013-10-01 05:37:52 -0400] Ron__: hum, is there a way to paste more than one line?
[2013-10-01 05:38:12 -0400] Ron__: knife bootstrap localhost --ssh-user vagrant --ssh-password vagrant --ssh-port 2222 --run-list "recipe[apt],recipe[aliases],recipe[apache2]" --sudo
[2013-10-01 05:38:17 -0400] Ron__: Bootstrapping Chef on localhost
[2013-10-01 05:38:22 -0400] Ron__: localhost /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mixlib-log-1.4.1/lib/mixlib/log.rb:97:in `level='
[2013-10-01 05:38:26 -0400] Ron__: localhost : Log level must be one of :debug, :info, :warn, :error, or :fatal (ArgumentError)
[2013-10-01 05:38:31 -0400] Ron__: localhost from /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/chef-10.18.2/lib/chef/application.rb:119:in `configure_logging'
[2013-10-01 05:38:32 -0400] mmzyk: You could put it in a  github gist or in paste bin and post the link here.
[2013-10-01 05:38:40 -0400] mmzyk: that generally makes things easier to read.
[2013-10-01 05:38:40 -0400] Ron__: localhost from /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/chef-10.18.2/lib/chef/application/client.rb:239:in `configure_logging'
[2013-10-01 05:38:44 -0400] Ron__: oh good idea
[2013-10-01 05:39:31 -0400] Ron__: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6774293
[2013-10-01 05:39:36 -0400] Ron__: totally forgot about doing that :)
[2013-10-01 05:41:26 -0400] Ron__: If it matters, I was unable to use "Starter Kit" as I can't find a link to it in the docs.  There is a link when you first sign up, but once you surf off that page I haven't been able to find it again.  So I downloaded 'chef-repo' from github and also made a new Vagrant machine per the docs (but not the same as the Vagrantfile in the Starter Kit I believe)
[2013-10-01 05:42:06 -0400] mmzyk: ah, okay. Yeah, that probably matters. :)
[2013-10-01 05:44:42 -0400] mmzyk: If you do a knife client list, what output do you get?
[2013-10-01 05:45:22 -0400] Ron__: knife client list real_estate-validator
[2013-10-01 05:45:42 -0400] mmzyk: So a knife client list works?
[2013-10-01 05:45:45 -0400] Ron__: yes
[2013-10-01 05:45:59 -0400] Ron__: everything 'feels' right except chef-client fails due to logging level.
[2013-10-01 05:47:42 -0400] mmzyk: yup. I don't know where that is off the top of my head, so I'm looking.
[2013-10-01 05:47:58 -0400] Ron__: you mean the bootstrap in the docs?
[2013-10-01 05:48:15 -0400] mmzyk: no, I'm looking at chef-repo and chef client to see what's going on.
[2013-10-01 05:48:25 -0400] Ron__: ok
[2013-10-01 05:49:03 -0400] Ron__: https://github.com/opscode/chef-repo
[2013-10-01 05:49:11 -0400] Ron__: and I did the following for Vagrant
[2013-10-01 05:50:51 -0400] Ron__: https://learnchef.opscode.com/screencasts/launch-a-virtual-machine/
[2013-10-01 05:54:07 -0400] mmzyk: So early on you installed chef-client on your system right? 
[2013-10-01 05:54:22 -0400] mmzyk: as a gem, I assume?
[2013-10-01 05:55:30 -0400] mmzyk: I think you just need to change the log level in your chef config, which is likely in your home dir.
[2013-10-01 05:55:40 -0400] mmzyk: Look for a .chef (note the dot) folder there.
[2013-10-01 05:56:34 -0400] mmzyk: In there you should find a knife.rb file - open that up with a text editor and see what the log level is set to. If it's auto, change it to info and see if that fixes your problem. I suspect the googling you did lead you to the correct answer.
[2013-10-01 05:57:02 -0400] mmzyk: Not sure why you have a 10.8 client, but my guess is that your log level for that client version is off.
[2013-10-01 05:57:17 -0400] mmzyk: And it has nothing to do with the server version.
[2013-10-01 05:57:53 -0400] Ron__: ok, given it a go
[2013-10-01 05:58:17 -0400] Ron__: The log level is currently :info
[2013-10-01 05:58:30 -0400] Ron__: The error shows its empty though?
[2013-10-01 05:58:58 -0400] mmzyk: When you ran chef-client before, where you in the chef-repo did?
[2013-10-01 05:59:06 -0400] mmzyk: s/did/dir
[2013-10-01 05:59:25 -0400] Ron__: No, I ran chef-client in the vagrant box
[2013-10-01 05:59:31 -0400] Ron__: in=on
[2013-10-01 05:59:49 -0400] Ron__: the gist message is when I was in the chef-repo and ran the normal bootstrap command
[2013-10-01 05:59:54 -0400] Ron__: both gave the same error
[2013-10-01 06:00:08 -0400] Ron__: that `level='
[2013-10-01 06:00:36 -0400] mmzyk: ah, okay. Yeah, I think it's the config on the vagrant box that is misconfigered then
[2013-10-01 06:01:25 -0400] Ron__: Doesn't all the config (except cookbooks) come prebuilt from opscode?
[2013-10-01 06:01:29 -0400] mmzyk: ssh onto the vagrant box and check in the vagrant user's home for the .chef folder there. My guess is that is where the bad config is.
[2013-10-01 06:01:34 -0400] Ron__: ok
[2013-10-01 06:02:02 -0400] mmzyk: It should, yes, but I'm not sure what was in the starter kit that you missed.
[2013-10-01 06:02:39 -0400] Ron__: There is no ~/.chef on the vagrant box, there is this though /etc/chef/client.rb
[2013-10-01 06:02:44 -0400] Ron__: its log_level is :auto
[2013-10-01 06:03:31 -0400] mmzyk: good catch - flip that to :info and try again.
[2013-10-01 06:04:04 -0400] mmzyk: I'm still confused on how you got 10.8 when I would have expected it to put 11 on the box, but we'll work w/ what you have.
[2013-10-01 06:06:21 -0400] Ron__: I can change the file via sudo, but when I run bootstrap or chef-client it changes it back to :auto
[2013-10-01 06:06:27 -0400] Ron__: and fails with same error again
[2013-10-01 06:07:49 -0400] mmzyk: try running chef-client giving it the -l log option and a value of info and see what it does.
[2013-10-01 06:07:59 -0400] Ron__: ok, one sec
[2013-10-01 06:09:36 -0400] Ron__: I tried it twice, first time without sudo, second with
[2013-10-01 06:09:36 -0400] Ron__: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6774463
[2013-10-01 06:11:35 -0400] mmzyk: So for some reason the bootstrapping didn't get your keys in place, which I suppose makes sense if it failed to run successfully.
[2013-10-01 06:11:57 -0400] Ron__: yeah, whats odd is there on the vagrant box but owned as root
[2013-10-01 06:12:00 -0400] mmzyk: See the yellow box on this page: https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/converge/ for how to delete the keys that are in place and start over.
[2013-10-01 06:12:02 -0400] Ron__: not the vagrant user
[2013-10-01 06:12:18 -0400] Ron__: reading
[2013-10-01 06:14:32 -0400] Ron__: ok, ran the two commands, now do the bootstrap again?
[2013-10-01 06:14:53 -0400] mmzyk: yup.
[2013-10-01 06:15:16 -0400] Ron__: same issue again
[2013-10-01 06:16:26 -0400] mmzyk: when you told me the chef-client version earlier, was that on the vagrant machine?
[2013-10-01 06:16:36 -0400] Ron__: correct
[2013-10-01 06:16:48 -0400] mmzyk: what version of chef-client is running local on your machine that is running knife?
[2013-10-01 06:17:01 -0400] Ron__: Chef: 11.6.0
[2013-10-01 06:18:35 -0400] mmzyk: when you run the bootstrap command, try adding the --bootstrap-version option and set it to 10.8.
[2013-10-01 06:20:28 -0400] Ron__: I did 10.18.2, same error
[2013-10-01 06:22:32 -0400] mmzyk: just for the heck of it, back out the changes again but tell it to use a bootstrap-version of 11.
[2013-10-01 06:24:40 -0400] Ron__: when you say back out, do you mean run the knife client delete and knife node delete?
[2013-10-01 06:25:29 -0400] mmzyk: node is probably fine, but yeah, wiping client off of the vagrant vm.
[2013-10-01 06:27:39 -0400] Ron__: ok, same issue though
[2013-10-01 06:28:34 -0400] Ron__: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6774562
[2013-10-01 06:31:08 -0400] Ron__: I think I know why its 10.18.2 :)
[2013-10-01 06:31:22 -0400] Ron__: When I was going through the website, the link for the Vagrant box is.....
[2013-10-01 06:31:35 -0400] Ron__: config.vm.box_url = "https://opscode-vm-bento.s3.amazonaws.com/vagrant/opscode_ubuntu-12.04_chef-10.18.2.box"
[2013-10-01 06:34:16 -0400] mmzyk: well, that would likely explain that.
[2013-10-01 06:35:25 -0400] mmzyk: I honestly am not sure what is happening and I'm obviously not sure how to fix it. Getting a system w/ chef 11 on it would be the best thing I can tell you to do at this point.
[2013-10-01 06:36:31 -0400] Ron__: Cool.  Thanks for the help though.  I don't know much about Chef, but learning more every day.  
[2013-10-01 06:36:49 -0400] Ron__: Do you think the example is foobar'd no the site?
[2013-10-01 06:38:08 -0400] mmzyk: No, it works. I think missing the start kit is likely what screwed us up. That said, that screencast w/ the example might not be perfectly in sync.
[2013-10-01 06:38:48 -0400] mmzyk: I'll ask tomorrow (er, later today at this point) if the start kit can be downloaded after signup. If should be possible.
[2013-10-01 06:41:16 -0400] mmzyk: I've got to head out, but hopefully you figure this out Ron_ sorry for all the troubles this is causing.
[2013-10-01 06:42:49 -0400] Ron__: Cool.  I looked around, but couldn't find it.  I remember seeing the link right after sign up, and it is mentioned in part  1 of the tutorial but you can't click on the link.  I will try to find another VM tomorrow and try again.  Thanks again for your help.
[2013-10-01 18:20:52 -0400] UForgotten: yeap
