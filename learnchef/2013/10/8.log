[2013-10-08 12:40:29 -0400] czomber: Hi
[2013-10-08 12:40:48 -0400] czomber: I have a problem with running chef
[2013-10-08 12:41:29 -0400] czomber: I've followed screencast of Nathen Harvey
[2013-10-08 12:41:38 -0400] czomber: about using chef
[2013-10-08 12:42:25 -0400] czomber: and when I enabled chef as provisioner in vagrant file and call vagrant provision
[2013-10-08 12:42:29 -0400] czomber: nothing happens
[2013-10-08 12:43:01 -0400] czomber: there is only strange info in red from chef
[2013-10-08 12:43:08 -0400] czomber: "No error message "
[2013-10-08 12:44:33 -0400] czomber: is there anyone to know how to fix this
[2013-10-08 12:44:48 -0400] czomber: where can I search for some log info or somethig ?
[2013-10-08 17:48:05 -0400] Mukluc: Hello I have a question about getting a "return value" from a LWRP. I have defined a LWRP which contacts a WEB API to download a file, and I would like to to somehow "return" the full path the file was downloaded to. How would I go about doing this? Thanks!
[2013-10-08 17:48:22 -0400] Mukluc: I've tried setting an attribute from within the LWRP but it is not accessible from the calling recipe.
[2013-10-08 18:16:44 -0400] CPS: i'm trying to bootstrap my windows client to my chef server on centos
[2013-10-08 18:17:36 -0400] CPS: when i run knife bootstrap windows winrm [fqdn] -x user -P password i get ERROR: Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - /etc/chef/validation.pem
[2013-10-08 18:18:09 -0400] CPS: the server's /etc/chef/ directory is empty
[2013-10-08 18:18:37 -0400] CPS: the client has that file at C:\chef\
[2013-10-08 18:18:45 -0400] CPS: how do I tell it where to find it?
[2013-10-08 18:30:23 -0400] CPS: do i need chef client and chef server both installed on the server machine?
[2013-10-08 19:52:29 -0400] mmzyk: CPS you can tell knife which private key to use with the -k or --key command. http://docs.opscode.com/knife_common_options.html
[2013-10-08 19:53:02 -0400] mmzyk: also, since you're working on a windows machine, this docs page that lays out all the windows specific options might come in handy http://docs.opscode.com/windows.html
[2013-10-08 19:55:35 -0400] mmzyk: Mukluc I'm not sure how to do what you're asking. Is the location of the file for some reason change over time? It seems to me like you would have it download to a fixed location and then use the notify directive to fire off another part of the recipe or use the test directive to test if the file was downloaded successfully in the resource that needs it.
[2013-10-08 19:55:52 -0400] mmzyk: You might be able to do what you want, but I'm not an expert on lwrps.
[2013-10-08 19:57:16 -0400] mmzyk: Might be a good question to ask in #chef, Mukluc.
[2013-10-08 20:07:14 -0400] tom[]: is it conventional to keep chef repos under /root ?
[2013-10-08 20:13:05 -0400] mmzyk: @tom[] What do you mean repos? The install location of the server, the client, where cookbooks are kept?
[2013-10-08 20:13:29 -0400] tom[]: mmzyk: where cookbooks are kept
[2013-10-08 20:13:37 -0400] mmzyk: The chef omnibus packaging install the chef code for the client or server into it's own directories, like /etc/chef
[2013-10-08 20:13:39 -0400] mmzyk: ah
[2013-10-08 20:13:59 -0400] mmzyk: No, not normally. You can specify where you want the cookbooks on your system kept.
[2013-10-08 20:15:09 -0400] tom[]: ok
[2013-10-08 20:15:33 -0400] tom[]: i think this tutorial http://gettingstartedwithchef.com/first-steps-with-chef.html just assumes it all happens under /root. which is not what i would normally do
[2013-10-08 20:17:06 -0400] mmzyk: right, most people don't do that. :)
[2013-10-08 20:17:20 -0400] mmzyk: See the options here for knife: http://docs.opscode.com/config_rb_knife.html
[2013-10-08 20:17:29 -0400] mmzyk: Specifically the cookbook_path config.
[2013-10-08 20:19:10 -0400] mmzyk: I have not specifically looked at that tutorial, by the way, so I'm not aware of what it is saying.
[2013-10-08 20:20:30 -0400] tom[]: mmzyk: understood. does #lernchef have a typical recommendation for a complete beginner?
[2013-10-08 20:21:02 -0400] mmzyk: Ah, yeah, in that tutorial tom[] you can see partway down where he modify the cookbook_path setting in knife - so you can just modify your paths to be what you want and that tutorial should still work.
[2013-10-08 20:21:40 -0400] mmzyk: That is the intent of this site https://learnchef.opscode.com/ tom[].
[2013-10-08 20:21:40 -0400] tom[]: there are paths in the chef-solo config file that needed changing too
[2013-10-08 20:22:07 -0400] mmzyk: ah, didn't know you were using chef-solo. sorry about that. Update those too then. ;)
[2013-10-08 20:22:50 -0400] mmzyk: oh, I see now, the tutorial is using chef-solo. I typically work with the server and clients, so I'm not as familiar with chef-solo.
[2013-10-08 23:11:52 -0400] atomicwombat: Would a basic Berkshelf question be out of scope here? Everyone in #berkshelf seems to be AFK.
