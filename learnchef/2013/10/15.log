[2013-10-15 07:55:07 -0400] Marcia: Hi I've try the quick start of the chef, but couldn't execute the step3 "Converge the Node "
[2013-10-15 07:55:33 -0400] Marcia: $ vagrant up --no-color /data/Git/chef-repo/Vagrantfile:8:in `<top (required)>': undefined method `configure' for Vagrant:Module (NoMethodError) from /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/vagrant/config/loader.rb:115:in `load' from /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/vagrant/config/loader.rb:115:in `block in procs_for_source' from /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/vagrant/config.rb:41:in `block in capture_configures' from <internal:prelude>:10:in `synchro
[2013-10-15 07:56:00 -0400] Marcia: anyone could help me?
[2013-10-15 08:04:06 -0400] quatrix_: Marcia: have you looked here - https://github.com/wafflesfm/batter/issues/1 ?
[2013-10-15 08:04:40 -0400] Marcia: thanks , let me check
[2013-10-15 08:10:37 -0400] erno_: I'm looking cookbook for behat / bdd stuff, can anyone point one?
[2013-10-15 14:52:19 -0400] PhillStorage: Getting 401 Authorization Required when running chef-server-ctl test on RHEL 6.2 server with LDAP authentication
[2013-10-15 14:53:02 -0400] scarolan: PhillStorage: Try posting in #chef, you might get a better response there.
[2013-10-15 16:47:41 -0400] CPS: my workstation had chef client installed independently of my server and is using github for its git repo. how do i change it to use my chef server?
[2013-10-15 16:48:45 -0400] bean__: I'd probably re-bootstrap it to use the server
[2013-10-15 16:52:18 -0400] CPS: actually it seems my server doesn't have git on it
[2013-10-15 16:52:23 -0400] CPS: i figured that would have come with chef
[2013-10-15 16:58:07 -0400] bean__: oh, you want to move the repo.
[2013-10-15 16:58:52 -0400] CPS: i've got a local repo on my workstation that's trying to talk to github
[2013-10-15 16:59:09 -0400] CPS: i want it to talk to my server, but git isn't installed/configured on my server
[2013-10-15 17:14:23 -0400] mmzyk: CPS that sounds like a git issue, not a chef issue. Chef does nothing by default with git, although we recommend you use it (or one of the source code control tools) for storing cookbooks.
[2013-10-15 17:15:45 -0400] mmzyk: CPS I'm not sure what you mean by your chef-client is using github and not your server as it's repo. What command are you executing that the confusion is coming in?
[2013-10-15 17:22:42 -0400] CPS: it is a git issue, yes
[2013-10-15 17:22:55 -0400] CPS: my git config file points to github
[2013-10-15 17:23:10 -0400] CPS: i just need to configure git on the server and push everything i have into it
[2013-10-15 17:23:43 -0400] CPS: i'm wrangling with credentials now, as the client uses windows domain and the server uses kerberos
[2013-10-15 17:27:42 -0400] mmzyk: At this point you've left my area of knowledge, but I wish you the best. :)
[2013-10-15 17:31:46 -0400] bean__: yeah, CPS, this isn't really a chef thing. I recommend setting up a real git server with a webui, etc, like gitlab.
[2013-10-15 17:33:40 -0400] CPS: fair enough
[2013-10-15 17:38:21 -0400] CPS: chef question: I want a script to install a program and one to uninstall it. Would the best way be to have two cookbooks, or one cookbook with two separate recipes?
[2013-10-15 17:39:17 -0400] mmzyk: I think that's a style choice.
[2013-10-15 17:39:41 -0400] CPS: well if i do one cookbook, how do i specify which recipe to run?
[2013-10-15 17:40:07 -0400] mmzyk: It would be based on the run list for that node.
[2013-10-15 17:40:11 -0400] mmzyk: cookbook::recipe_name
[2013-10-15 17:40:30 -0400] mmzyk: When you just say cookbook that is the same as saying cookbook::default
[2013-10-15 17:40:46 -0400] mmzyk: so if you want a specific recipe to run you use the more specific context
[2013-10-15 17:50:08 -0400] CPS: knife node run_list add [cookbook_name]::install.rb is giving me an error
[2013-10-15 17:50:12 -0400] CPS: tried also without .rb
[2013-10-15 17:50:19 -0400] mmzyk: random aside: nice nick, bean_. Just realized where it comes from.
[2013-10-15 17:51:28 -0400] CPS: ah, didn't specify node name
[2013-10-15 17:53:03 -0400] mmzyk: cool. Here are the docs, if you need them: http://docs.opscode.com/knife_node.html#run-list-add
[2013-10-15 17:55:07 -0400] CPS: weird, adds to the runlist fine, but i get recipe not found exception when i run chef-client
[2013-10-15 17:55:26 -0400] mmzyk: did you upload the cookbook to the chef server?
[2013-10-15 17:55:55 -0400] mmzyk: do you have something pinned to the old version of the cookbook that needs updating to find the new version?
[2013-10-15 17:56:05 -0400] mmzyk: those are the 2 possibilities that spring to mind.
[2013-10-15 17:56:49 -0400] CPS: i  know what it might be
[2013-10-15 17:57:02 -0400] CPS: i renamed default to uninstall and made a new file called install.rb
[2013-10-15 17:57:36 -0400] mmzyk: ah, I think default might still need to be present, even if it does nothing.
[2013-10-15 17:57:46 -0400] mmzyk: Not actually certain on that, but might be the case.
[2013-10-15 18:00:10 -0400] CPS: touched an empty default.rb and uploaded, no dice
[2013-10-15 18:04:44 -0400] mmzyk: And by uploaded, you mean uploaded to the chef-server, not just git, correct?
[2013-10-15 18:04:50 -0400] CPS: correct
[2013-10-15 18:04:59 -0400] CPS: i'm putting git on the backburner for now
[2013-10-15 18:05:05 -0400] CPS: knife cookbook upload -a
[2013-10-15 18:05:51 -0400] mmzyk: did you upload the metadata in the cookbook to bump the version? It might be that the server thinks it already has the right cookbook b/c it isn't seeing you updated it, maybe?
[2013-10-15 18:06:28 -0400] mmzyk: I don't actually think it works that way, I think it is supposed to overwrite the existing cookbook, but it's hard to debug from a far.
[2013-10-15 18:07:36 -0400] CPS: when i first ran it it pulled down the uninstall.rb but not install.rb into the cache
[2013-10-15 18:08:33 -0400] scarolan: mmzyk: that is correct, the default behavior is to overwrite, even without a version bump
[2013-10-15 18:08:59 -0400] CPS: but it isn't pulling everything in the recipe directory
[2013-10-15 18:09:07 -0400] CPS: the server UI shows the install script
[2013-10-15 18:10:01 -0400] mmzyk: scarolan Ideas on what might be happening here?
[2013-10-15 18:10:04 -0400] scarolan: CPS: what's "knife node show" output
[2013-10-15 18:10:14 -0400] scarolan: knife node show [nodename]
[2013-10-15 18:10:24 -0400] scarolan: also, what is in your "recipes" subdirectory in the cookbook
[2013-10-15 18:10:48 -0400] CPS: recipes contains uninstall.rb, install.rb, and default.rb
[2013-10-15 18:11:15 -0400] CPS: that command shows the node information with recipe[cookbook_name::install.rb] in the run list
[2013-10-15 18:12:00 -0400] scarolan: ok, so when you run chef-client on your target node, what's the output
[2013-10-15 18:13:28 -0400] CPS: normal debug info, then RecipeNotFound exception, could not find recipe install.rb for cookbook
[2013-10-15 18:14:29 -0400] scarolan: and what does "knife cookbook show [cookbookname]" give?
[2013-10-15 18:14:42 -0400] CPS: i figured out what it was
[2013-10-15 18:14:47 -0400] scarolan: CPS: Oh, duh, i just spotted it too
[2013-10-15 18:14:48 -0400] scarolan: .rb
[2013-10-15 18:14:50 -0400] CPS: the recipe is called "install"
[2013-10-15 18:14:53 -0400] scarolan: yep
[2013-10-15 18:14:54 -0400] CPS: not install.rb
[2013-10-15 18:14:54 -0400] scarolan: u got it
[2013-10-15 18:15:03 -0400] scarolan: always the little things
[2013-10-15 18:26:38 -0400] CPS: does the directory resource create directory paths if they don't exist on linux?
[2013-10-15 18:26:53 -0400] CPS: on windows it craps out if each item in the path isn't there
[2013-10-15 18:33:26 -0400] mmzyk: CPS you need to add the recursive option.
[2013-10-15 18:33:34 -0400] mmzyk: http://docs.opscode.com/chef/resources.html#directory
[2013-10-15 18:33:47 -0400] mmzyk: by default it doesn't create directory paths if they don't exist.
[2013-10-15 18:34:34 -0400] CPS: just 'recursive' on its own line?
[2013-10-15 18:36:45 -0400] mmzyk: See docs, CPS, but it will look just like owner, etc. 
[2013-10-15 18:36:53 -0400] mmzyk: recursive true
[2013-10-15 18:36:56 -0400] mmzyk: on it's own line
[2013-10-15 18:37:20 -0400] mmzyk: might be recursive :true, not sure the exact syntax
[2013-10-15 18:40:53 -0400] CPS: just true
[2013-10-15 19:18:41 -0400] CPS: in the remote_file directive, what is the difference between path and source? I'm trying to copy a file from a NAS to a local directory
[2013-10-15 19:30:36 -0400] mparadise: @CPS 'path' indicates the destination path - if not specified it will default to the resource name itself 
[2013-10-15 19:31:23 -0400] mparadise: CPS: source is the http/ftp/file protocol source, such as file://nfs/mount/file/location
[2013-10-15 19:31:24 -0400] CPS: so destination path
[2013-10-15 19:31:32 -0400] mparadise: Yep
[2013-10-15 19:32:24 -0400] CPS: what's the protocol name for windows shares? the string is \\servername\C$\stuff
[2013-10-15 19:36:58 -0400] mparadise: CPS I just took a quick look and at first glance I would say it wouldn't support direct access of a cifs/samba server like that - you may need to mount it on the box first, then perform the copy using file://mounted/path 
[2013-10-15 19:38:01 -0400] CPS: i think you misunderstand, i'm copying a file from a windows share to a windows box, i just don't know the chef way to do that
[2013-10-15 19:38:20 -0400] CPS: the recipe will run on a windows box
[2013-10-15 19:40:58 -0400] mmzyk: CPS I don't know the answer to that question  does this potentially help? http://docs.opscode.com/windows.html#relative-paths
[2013-10-15 19:41:03 -0400] mparadise: Ah! ok in that case ' source "\\servername\c$\stuff" ' should work finee, as long as the admin user running chef has access.  
[2013-10-15 19:41:27 -0400] mparadise: (For some reason I'd assumed you meant running chef on a *nix box) 
[2013-10-15 19:43:03 -0400] mparadise: Or possibly  source "\\\\servername\\c$\\stuff" to escape the backslashes   
[2013-10-15 19:44:05 -0400] mparadise: Checking what I can though, 1 sec
[2013-10-15 19:52:36 -0400] CPS: parent directory does not exist
[2013-10-15 19:52:42 -0400] CPS: but it does exist
[2013-10-15 19:57:49 -0400] mparadise: If my one functional windows vm ever finishes waking up... 
[2013-10-15 20:01:07 -0400] CPS: yeah it's not liking anything i pass in for path, saying it doesn't exist
[2013-10-15 20:07:17 -0400] mparadise: Awkward to try, but what about "file://\\\\servername\\c$\\blah" ? 
[2013-10-15 20:09:46 -0400] mparadise: Ah, interesting - reading up a bit while my vm tries not to fall over - but this is also worth trying: "file://servername/c$/blah" 
[2013-10-15 20:15:53 -0400] CPS: it's not complaining about the server variable
[2013-10-15 20:15:58 -0400] CPS: i'm giving it a local path
[2013-10-15 20:16:03 -0400] CPS: it's saying it doesn't exist
[2013-10-15 20:18:34 -0400] mparadise: Can you post the resource you've declared up to pastebin, or github gist? (Or an edited version fo it)  
[2013-10-15 20:33:31 -0400] CPS: mparadise: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6998228
[2013-10-15 20:34:23 -0400] CPS: (recipe) had an error: Chef::Exceptions::EnclosingDirectoryDoesNotExist: Parent directory "C:/Users/username does not exist.
[2013-10-15 20:34:28 -0400] CPS: is the output
[2013-10-15 20:36:43 -0400] joe_k: any idea how long I should be waiting for a bootstrap of windows on azure?
[2013-10-15 20:36:57 -0400] joe_k: its been over 45 minutes
[2013-10-15 20:37:17 -0400] joe_k: or has anyone successfully done it?
[2013-10-15 20:44:03 -0400] joe_k: anybody out there?
[2013-10-15 20:44:20 -0400] mmzyk: joe_k probably a better question for the #chef room. It's likely someone has tried it there.
[2013-10-15 20:54:12 -0400] mparadise: CPS how are you resolving user name? Is it part of the path string as in the paste, or are you pulling it in in another way? 
[2013-10-15 21:55:32 -0400] catbacon: I'm looking into writing roles and I see syntax like this:  'recipe[mysql::client]',
[2013-10-15 21:55:39 -0400] catbacon: is mysql the cookbook and client the recipe?
[2013-10-15 22:14:56 -0400] binamov: catbacon are we talking about http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/mysql ?
[2013-10-15 22:15:11 -0400] catbacon: i don't really care what cookbook it is
[2013-10-15 22:15:18 -0400] catbacon: i'm just trying to understand the syntax
[2013-10-15 22:16:03 -0400] binamov: catbacon ok, cookbook = recipes + files + templates + resources + providers...
[2013-10-15 22:16:55 -0400] catbacon: i'm writing a role and put 'recipe[X::Y]' in the runlist
[2013-10-15 22:17:12 -0400] catbacon: i'm assuming the notation is such that X is a cookbook and Y is a recipe belonging to that cookbook
[2013-10-15 22:17:17 -0400] binamov: yeah  'recipe[cookbook::recipe]'
[2013-10-15 22:17:22 -0400] catbacon: perfect, thanks
[2013-10-15 22:17:42 -0400] binamov: and if it's default recipe then omit ::recipe altogether
[2013-10-15 22:17:51 -0400] catbacon: ah, nice
