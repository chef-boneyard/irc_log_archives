[2013-10-17 08:57:03 -0400] mediaarte: hi
[2013-10-17 08:57:09 -0400] mediaarte: anybody lives here?
[2013-10-17 08:57:32 -0400] Heis__: yes =p
[2013-10-17 08:58:19 -0400] mediaarte: :-)
[2013-10-17 08:58:29 -0400] mediaarte: that's good
[2013-10-17 08:58:49 -0400] Heis__: in a couple of hours there should be a lot more people around
[2013-10-17 08:59:06 -0400] Heis__: most chefs are at US
[2013-10-17 08:59:59 -0400] mediaarte: can we ask here about chef installation and integration?
[2013-10-17 09:00:11 -0400] Heis__: i think so
[2013-10-17 09:00:30 -0400] Heis__: but im just getting started with chef
[2013-10-17 09:00:44 -0400] Heis__: but maybe anyone else can answer
[2013-10-17 09:01:11 -0400] mediaarte: ok... thanks for info
[2013-10-17 09:04:05 -0400] Heis__: no problem
[2013-10-17 09:04:39 -0400] mediaarte: this channel is to learn chef
[2013-10-17 09:04:48 -0400] mediaarte: but what is going on with #chef channel
[2013-10-17 09:04:49 -0400] mediaarte: ?
[2013-10-17 09:06:45 -0400] Heis__: dont know
[2013-10-17 12:18:36 -0400] scarolan: Hey early birds...I'm guessing you are somewhere across the pond in Europe perhaps?  #learnchef is for newbies, #chef is for asking more intermediate/advanced questions
[2013-10-17 16:44:50 -0400] joe_k: can someone tell me where the params listed in https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-cookbook#attribute-parameters
[2013-10-17 16:44:55 -0400] joe_k: are supposed to be specified or how?
[2013-10-17 16:45:33 -0400] joe_k: i am not sure if "attribute parameters" means I need to set an attribute, or indeed how to do that if I needed to
[2013-10-17 16:45:35 -0400] joe_k: or if those are just supposed to be ruby dsl words
[2013-10-17 17:33:55 -0400] CPS: how do i get the return code of a command executed by an execute block?
[2013-10-17 17:34:57 -0400] CPS: joe_k: if they're like normal resources each parameter/attribute is listed on its own line separated by a space
[2013-10-17 17:35:07 -0400] CPS: in their example      source "cygwin" is an attribute/value pair
[2013-10-17 17:38:06 -0400] joe_k: aha
[2013-10-17 17:38:08 -0400] joe_k: ok
[2013-10-17 17:39:26 -0400] CPS: you can do normal ruby stuff there too, so puts variable will print out your variables if you need to debug
[2013-10-17 18:06:05 -0400] mmzyk: CPS not sure what you're trying to do, with with the return option you can specify what the return value needs to be to be considered a success.
[2013-10-17 18:06:22 -0400] mmzyk: If you're trying to do something more complicated than that you want a ruby block or other more execute block.
[2013-10-17 18:06:25 -0400] mmzyk: http://docs.opscode.com/chef/resources.html#execute
[2013-10-17 18:08:02 -0400] mmzyk: I didn't know a chocolately lwrp existed. that's good to know.
[2013-10-17 18:17:08 -0400] CPS: mmzyk: i'd like to log success/fail of a process executed based on its return code
[2013-10-17 18:17:17 -0400] CPS: i don't necessarily want to raise an exception
[2013-10-17 18:18:44 -0400] mmzyk: erm. That's probably done in a ruby block that triggers the process in question, but I'm sure you know my response to by now to questions like this when I'm not certain of the answer: ask in #chef. :) (Might want to mention you're on windows, so a bash resource isn't going to work)
[2013-10-17 18:19:50 -0400] CPS: ok
[2013-10-17 19:04:42 -0400] CPS: you mmzyk, found a typo http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_templates.html
[2013-10-17 19:05:01 -0400] CPS: A statement is delimited by <% and -%>. For example:
[2013-10-17 19:05:09 -0400] CPS: -%>
[2013-10-17 19:15:54 -0400] CPS: what does this notation mean? node[:monit][:server]
[2013-10-17 19:37:28 -0400] pmoney95: After signing up for enterprise Chef, I downloaded the starter kit. It has no extension and is 15KB. The Quick Start says to extract it to my home directory, but I'm uncertain about how to proceed.
[2013-10-17 19:39:23 -0400] pmoney95: Scratch that. I was able to right click and select 7zip -> open archive -> *
[2013-10-17 19:39:35 -0400] pmoney95: I was confused by the lack of extension.
[2013-10-17 20:04:18 -0400] mmzyk: CPS that's not actually a typo - that's valid ERB tempting. The dash means don't introduce any whitespace.
[2013-10-17 20:53:56 -0400] CPS: mmzyk: yeah ok
[2013-10-17 20:54:12 -0400] CPS: the examples and the explanation on that page don't line up though
[2013-10-17 20:54:27 -0400] CPS: a brief ERB primer might be good
[2013-10-17 20:54:42 -0400] mmzyk: gotcha. I'll pass that along.
