[2013-10-20 10:22:32 -0400] chakatz: How can I set the value of an attribute based on the return code of an Execute or Script resource?
[2013-10-20 18:33:43 -0400] eggsy84: hi all - I'm trying to understand the way in which to override cookbook attributes and what is best practice? For example the java cookbook allows you the install_flavor of Java (https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/java/blob/master/attributes/default.rb) 
[2013-10-20 18:38:07 -0400] eggsy84: the github README seems to suggest it should be performed in your role default attributes?
[2013-10-20 18:58:27 -0400] airtonix: << ruby & chef noob (probably won't change). but i found a really nice tutorial for local development with chef and vagrant with everything(almost) spelt out for idiots like me : http://syntaxi.net/vagrant-and-chef/part-1/
[2013-10-20 18:58:54 -0400] airtonix: one thing: that page talks about : vagrant-hostname. I can't find any mention of this anywhere 
[2013-10-20 18:59:54 -0400] airtonix: i worked out that: echo "33.33.33.60 chef-server" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts got me past that hurdle.
[2013-10-20 19:23:10 -0400] quatrix: hi, i'm creating a site CB for python, it should compile from source to some prefix_dir
[2013-10-20 19:24:31 -0400] quatrix: in the custom CB/attributes/default.rb i've added default['python']['install_method'] = 'source'
[2013-10-20 19:24:52 -0400] quatrix: problem is, the 'prefix_dir' attribute doesn't have an effect
[2013-10-20 19:26:05 -0400] quatrix: it only works if i override it in something higher like a role
