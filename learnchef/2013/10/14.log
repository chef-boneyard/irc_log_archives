[2013-10-14 12:31:46 -0400] bottom_feeder: ize just learning chef. I am aware of berkshelf, dont understand it yet. w/o any other tool (just base open chef), how does one maintain two versions of a cookbook in parallel?
[2013-10-14 14:14:14 -0400] Bersek: hello everyone, started to read about chef 
[2013-10-14 14:14:21 -0400] Bersek: something that is not clear for me
[2013-10-14 14:14:27 -0400] Bersek: about the server management console
[2013-10-14 14:15:19 -0400] Bersek: is there any API so that i can develop my own features on top of chef
[2013-10-14 14:15:30 -0400] Bersek: or can i develop my own management console?
[2013-10-14 14:23:03 -0400] mparadise: Bersek: chef client (and the management console) is built atop Chef's REST API.  There is more information on that here: http://docs.opscode.com/api_chef_server.html
[2013-10-14 14:24:11 -0400] Bersek: Thank you very much!
[2013-10-14 14:26:24 -0400] Bersek: this is just the information i was looking for, tks
[2013-10-14 14:44:13 -0400] vitothemosquito: Anyone using open chef?
[2013-10-14 14:44:57 -0400] vitothemosquito: How do you set which version of a cookbook/recipe in the run list for a node?
[2013-10-14 18:05:25 -0400] teshian: I am installing riak-cs and when I create an account using a rest API it creates an account and returns a username and password, how can I capture the username and password and store as an attribute
[2013-10-14 18:05:57 -0400] teshian: so I can use them in templates for things that use them
[2013-10-14 18:08:03 -0400] mparadise: teshian might be a good fit for data bags: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html
[2013-10-14 18:15:04 -0400] teshian: So I can set a databag value from with in a recipe and have it be used in other places? I am thinking like the ohai, where it reads a value from the machine then stores it on the chef server 
[2013-10-14 18:17:16 -0400] sfalcon: teshian: I think you may just want to set node attributes in your recipe from the resource that creates the riak-cs account.
[2013-10-14 18:17:18 -0400] sfalcon: http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_attributes.html
[2013-10-14 18:17:39 -0400] sfalcon: You can use a Ruby code block resource to make API calls to riak-cs to create the account
[2013-10-14 18:18:02 -0400] sfalcon: If the account is *already* created, it would likely make sense to store those details in a data bag item.
[2013-10-14 18:18:21 -0400] sfalcon: And it is also possible, though somewhat less common pattern, to write data bag items from a recipe.
[2013-10-14 18:19:30 -0400] teshian: I am buliding the machine from scratch so the software will be installed by chef, then the account is created, then I need to configure other components
[2013-10-14 18:21:05 -0400] teshian: I looked at http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_attributes.html and nothing jumped out at me for setting a node value in a recipe
[2013-10-14 20:58:56 -0400] quatrix_: heya, is it normal for chef client to reinstall the entire recipe even when no changes were uploaded to the server?
[2013-10-14 21:01:41 -0400] bean__: usually things are written to be idempotent, quatrix_ 
[2013-10-14 21:04:54 -0400] quatrix_: bean__: yeah, i just expected that chef client checks if there were changes to attributes/roles/recpies, and then reinstalls.
[2013-10-14 21:06:57 -0400] bean__: "reinstall" i think you mean re-runs
[2013-10-14 21:07:09 -0400] bean__: is it just 1 specific CB doing this?
[2013-10-14 21:08:49 -0400] quatrix_: i only have one node so far, and i bootstrapped it with a role, the role 'inherites' from another role, and togather both roles have ~30cbs.
[2013-10-14 21:09:42 -0400] quatrix_: and this role is re running all the time and runs all cbs in it.
[2013-10-14 21:11:46 -0400] bean__: and this is using chef-server?
[2013-10-14 21:11:51 -0400] bean__: or solo?
[2013-10-14 21:11:53 -0400] quatrix_: yep
[2013-10-14 21:11:56 -0400] quatrix_: server
[2013-10-14 21:12:31 -0400] bean__: odd. It should only run the recipes that it needs to, each run
[2013-10-14 21:12:43 -0400] bean__: can you pastebin or gist some of the log output?
[2013-10-14 21:15:10 -0400] quatrix_: what do you mean by 'needs to'? it's running all recepies in the run_list
[2013-10-14 21:16:24 -0400] quatrix_: here's the /var/log/chef/client.log - http://pastebin.com/DbdhVDXw
[2013-10-14 21:18:13 -0400] quatrix_: this log is filled with likes like that over and over.
[2013-10-14 21:18:38 -0400] bean__: oh, are these all custom written cookbooks?
[2013-10-14 21:20:34 -0400] bean__: quatrix_: 
[2013-10-14 21:20:40 -0400] quatrix_: i don't think so, i think it's a statsd cookbook
[2013-10-14 21:21:05 -0400] quatrix_: which installs apache2 and python stuff, and maybe some other custom cookbook which installs cpan stuff
[2013-10-14 21:21:40 -0400] bean__: alrighty, I doubt its actually running. It's probably just outputting that when checking if it /needs to/ run
[2013-10-14 21:22:17 -0400] bean__: you could try running "sudo chef-client --why-run" and it should tell you why its running things, if it is.
[2013-10-14 21:22:49 -0400] quatrix_: ok, sec
[2013-10-14 21:23:30 -0400] quatrix_: it said eventually: "Chef Client finished, 11 resources would have been updated"
[2013-10-14 21:24:27 -0400] quatrix_: oh, ok, it's mostly custom cookbooks
[2013-10-14 21:24:56 -0400] quatrix_: and that statsd cb
[2013-10-14 21:25:12 -0400] bean__: yep, those custom cookbooks are likely missing idempotency checks somewhere along the way.
[2013-10-14 21:26:51 -0400] quatrix_: what about things like that: "Would install package python_pip[git+http://my_git_server/foo.git] version latest"
[2013-10-14 21:27:05 -0400] quatrix_: doesn't python_pip knows it's already installed? 
[2013-10-14 21:27:17 -0400] quatrix_: or is it because it's from git? 
[2013-10-14 21:31:02 -0400] bean__: yep
[2013-10-14 21:31:03 -0400] bean__: well
[2013-10-14 21:31:19 -0400] bean__: its cause its looking for the latest, quatrix_ 
[2013-10-14 21:33:42 -0400] quatrix_: ok, so i need to move it outside of git, cool.
[2013-10-14 21:34:12 -0400] quatrix_: hmm, what about this network configurting recipe: http://pastebin.com/qApPN1hr shouldn't it know it's already configured and it didn't change?
[2013-10-14 21:44:15 -0400] bean__: quatrix_: not necessarily outside of git, you likely need to just tell it to pull a certain revision
[2013-10-14 21:44:24 -0400] bean__: that, I don't know quatrix_ 
[2013-10-14 21:44:50 -0400] bean__: what cookbook ist hat even, quatrix_ 
[2013-10-14 21:45:44 -0400] quatrix_: it's a custom cookbook i wrote that configures eth1 according to the ip of eth0
[2013-10-14 21:46:11 -0400] bean__: so you likely dont have any sort of check in there to see if its already configured.
[2013-10-14 21:46:33 -0400] catbacon: howdy
[2013-10-14 21:46:38 -0400] quatrix_: i assume the 'ifconfig' resource does that
[2013-10-14 21:46:44 -0400] quatrix_: assumed*
[2013-10-14 21:47:29 -0400] catbacon: i'm running through the quickstart guide and getting an error on bootstrapping the node with knife
[2013-10-14 21:47:31 -0400] catbacon: https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/converge/
[2013-10-14 21:47:40 -0400] catbacon: step 1 under bootstrap the node
[2013-10-14 21:47:55 -0400] catbacon: I get " Bootstrapping Chef on localhost
[2013-10-14 21:47:56 -0400] catbacon: ERROR: Network Error: Connection refused - connect(2)
[2013-10-14 21:47:56 -0400] catbacon: Check your knife configuration and network settings"
[2013-10-14 21:48:11 -0400] bean__: quatrix_: did you write the ifconfig resource? 
[2013-10-14 21:48:26 -0400] quatrix_: nope
[2013-10-14 21:48:27 -0400] bean__: catbacon: that likely means that an SSH server isn't listening on the IP you're trying to bootstrap
[2013-10-14 21:48:40 -0400] bean__: quatrix_: then what cookbook is it from?
[2013-10-14 21:48:48 -0400] quatrix_: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_ifconfig.html
[2013-10-14 21:48:55 -0400] bean__: ah damn
[2013-10-14 21:49:11 -0400] catbacon: ah okay thanks bean__ 
[2013-10-14 21:50:19 -0400] catbacon: oh yeah, cool
[2013-10-14 21:50:24 -0400] catbacon: it's looking better :D
[2013-10-14 21:52:03 -0400] bean__: quatrix_: hmm, what OS are you on
[2013-10-14 21:52:14 -0400] quatrix_: centos 6
[2013-10-14 21:53:28 -0400] bean__: quatrix_: does why-runs ay why it's running?
[2013-10-14 21:54:57 -0400] quatrix_: it says:   * ifconfig[111.222.333.444] action add
[2013-10-14 21:55:01 -0400] quatrix_:     - Would generate configuration file : /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
[2013-10-14 21:55:25 -0400] quatrix_: heh, 333.443
[2013-10-14 21:56:03 -0400] quatrix_: (i replaced my ip with nonsense, it's not really writing that 'ip')
[2013-10-14 21:56:08 -0400] bean__: right.
[2013-10-14 21:56:11 -0400] catbacon: I'm on OS X, there's no vagrant user
[2013-10-14 21:56:27 -0400] bean__: catbacon: you're supposed to make a vagrant box, not install it to osx XD
[2013-10-14 21:56:31 -0400] bean__: unless that's your goal
[2013-10-14 21:56:36 -0400] catbacon: no...
[2013-10-14 21:57:01 -0400] catbacon: i want a vagrant box just got confused
[2013-10-14 21:57:06 -0400] bean__: catbacon: so, "vagrant up"
[2013-10-14 21:57:11 -0400] bean__: then bootstrap,
[2013-10-14 21:57:17 -0400] bean__: the vagrant user lives in the vagrant box.
[2013-10-14 21:57:29 -0400] catbacon: yeah i did vagrant up
[2013-10-14 21:57:36 -0400] catbacon: i'm failing on the bootstrap command still
[2013-10-14 21:57:41 -0400] bean__: quatrix_: it might not actually be running, it might be running if your /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1 was hand edited.
[2013-10-14 21:58:15 -0400] catbacon: let me start over on this page...
[2013-10-14 21:58:56 -0400] quatrix_: bean__: but after the first run, it shouldn't be running again, and it seems like it ran many times already.
[2013-10-14 21:59:22 -0400] bean__: right, unless something else is modifying it, or maybe its not running. Why-run could be lying
[2013-10-14 21:59:23 -0400] bean__: :)
[2013-10-14 21:59:47 -0400] catbacon: nm, just having an amateur hour over here
[2013-10-14 22:00:08 -0400] quatrix_: catbacon: hehe
[2013-10-14 22:03:13 -0400] catbacon: so i already use chef at my company, i'm just running through the quickstart to learn how to use it better
[2013-10-14 22:03:24 -0400] catbacon: so there is a file ~/.chef/knife.rb
[2013-10-14 22:03:44 -0400] catbacon: could this be conflicting with the knife instance i'm using in the quickstart tutorial in ~/chef-repo/
[2013-10-14 22:04:16 -0400] quatrix_: i think the ~/chef-repo/.chef/ takes presidence 
[2013-10-14 22:04:24 -0400] catbacon: ok cool
[2013-10-14 22:05:46 -0400] quatrix_: precedence*
[2013-10-14 22:17:44 -0400] catbacon: okay i converged it
[2013-10-14 22:17:45 -0400] catbacon: besides hamhanding the command, one problem was I took the '\' as a suggestion
[2013-10-14 22:17:48 -0400] catbacon: i thought that was just a formatting nicety to make things look prettier
[2013-10-14 22:17:57 -0400] catbacon: but it worked correctly when i copied / pasted
[2013-10-14 22:22:28 -0400] quatrix_: catbacon: what did you think would make things look prettier?
[2013-10-14 22:22:46 -0400] catbacon: i just did everything in one line
[2013-10-14 22:22:51 -0400] catbacon: omitting the \
[2013-10-14 22:23:23 -0400] catbacon: it didn't converge correctly
[2013-10-14 22:23:42 -0400] quatrix_: ohhh
[2013-10-14 22:23:56 -0400] isafarnik: the back ticks need to followed by a newline if you copy pasta them
[2013-10-14 22:24:41 -0400] isafarnik: "\" is shorthand for "this is the end of the line, but not the end of the command" that many *nix terminals understand.
[2013-10-14 22:24:57 -0400] catbacon: right
[2013-10-14 22:25:22 -0400] catbacon: just curious why the following didn't work
[2013-10-14 22:25:28 -0400] catbacon: knife bootstrap localhost --ssh-user vagrant -ssh-password vagrant -ssh-port 2222 --run-list "recipe[apt],recipe[aliases],recipe[apache2]" --sudo
[2013-10-14 22:25:53 -0400] isafarnik: --ssh-* both need 2 dashes
[2013-10-14 22:26:26 -0400] catbacon: welp
[2013-10-14 22:26:29 -0400] catbacon: hamhands today
[2013-10-14 22:26:56 -0400] catbacon: thanks for bearing with my newb questions :)
[2013-10-14 22:27:04 -0400] catbacon: i swear i've used linux before :)
[2013-10-14 22:27:26 -0400] quatrix_: hehe
[2013-10-14 22:27:27 -0400] quatrix_: :)
[2013-10-14 22:27:58 -0400] isafarnik: No worries :3
[2013-10-14 22:32:15 -0400] quatrix_: say i have different nginx setups for different roles. (different applications), should create seperate cookbooks for each role that include nginx and override attributes? 
[2013-10-14 22:32:37 -0400] quatrix_: or i need to just override the attrs in the role file?
[2013-10-14 23:27:22 -0400] clakeb: so I just wrote a cookbook and deployed on vagrant (ubuntu 13.04) and ec2 (same os) and on ec2 I'm getting an error but the run did succeed.

[2013-10-14 23:47:06 -0400] clakeb: isafarnik: do I need to run another argument when bootstrapping or creating the node?
[2013-10-14 23:47:12 -0400] clakeb: to prevent that
[2013-10-14 23:49:51 -0400] isafarnik: Unsure. Usually there something going on where you've re-downloaded or regenerated some keys since the last time it worked.
