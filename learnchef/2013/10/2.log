[2013-10-02 01:20:32 -0400] hura: Is it possible to use an encrypted data bag with hosted chef?
[2013-10-02 05:41:48 -0400] Ron__: Hello.
[2013-10-02 05:42:21 -0400] Ron__: Could someone explain the difference between bento boxes and the vagrant installer in the learnchef docs?
[2013-10-02 05:42:25 -0400] Ron__: https://github.com/opscode/bento
[2013-10-02 05:42:37 -0400] Ron__: versus

[2013-10-02 13:31:56 -0400] mccullod: Hello!  I have a question about the best way to install Chef so we can setup the postgres database on a separate server.
[2013-10-02 16:17:53 -0400] voteblake: Hey folks - I'm quite new and having an issue with package installation on CentOS machines when converging resources
[2013-10-02 16:18:07 -0400] voteblake: I'm getting the error "Repository Error: Cannot retrieve repository metadata (repomd.xml) for repository: extras."
[2013-10-02 16:18:53 -0400] voteblake: I added recipes yum and yum::repo to my run list and defined a yum http proxy in my environment's override attributes
[2013-10-02 16:19:07 -0400] voteblake: Any ideas on where to look next?
[2013-10-02 16:26:55 -0400] voteblake: I think it has to do with the yum proxy attribute, but moving that to the role default attributes doesn't seem to help either
[2013-10-02 16:31:46 -0400] voteblake: ha got it, needed to have yum::yum in the run list as yum::default doesn't maintain the /etc/yum.conf file
[2013-10-02 18:32:55 -0400] jboren: Greetings, I'm running thru my first Chef install via the doc at http://docs.opscode.com/install_workstation.html
[2013-10-02 18:33:14 -0400] jboren: I'm running into some questions regarding  "knife configure --initial"
[2013-10-02 18:33:36 -0400] jboren: I get the first couple of qestions, where the config file goes, the URL of the server...
[2013-10-02 18:34:20 -0400] jboren: But the next one is enter a name for the new user:   Who and what is this user, is it a chef user, what is it going to be used for??
[2013-10-02 18:34:43 -0400] isafarnik: Salutations! That setting is for the name of the user on the chef server.
[2013-10-02 18:35:08 -0400] jboren: Next, enter the existing admin name:  is this the machine admin user, chef admin user,  I'm confused.
[2013-10-02 18:35:11 -0400] isafarnik: You'd use it to log into the chef server's web interface/authentication
[2013-10-02 18:35:20 -0400] isafarnik: Chef admin
[2013-10-02 18:35:38 -0400] jboren: Ahhh, thank you a ton.  
[2013-10-02 18:36:02 -0400] jboren: I have this ocd thing where I can't proceed unless I know what i'm doing.. :)
[2013-10-02 18:36:33 -0400] isafarnik: If that's ocd, then so am I.
[2013-10-02 18:36:33 -0400] jboren: Thanks for the help, much appreciated.
[2013-10-02 18:37:39 -0400] isafarnik: np
[2013-10-02 22:22:40 -0400] bjorn248: Hey folks, strange question. I'm getting a compile error because in the same recipe I reference a file that the very same recipe is supposed to generate, but because it doesn't exist yet, it complains. However, if the recipe is run, it will exist.
[2013-10-02 22:22:56 -0400] bjorn248: Only problem is that the recipe never runs.
[2013-10-02 22:27:45 -0400] bjorn248: if anyone could help that'd be greatly appreciated :)
[2013-10-02 23:37:27 -0400] mindlace: ug, why doesn't knife download environments work in 11.6? i'm not using chef-solo :P
