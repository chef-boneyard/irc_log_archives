[2013-10-21 03:45:09 -0400] airtonix: sigh, none of the chef nginx cookbooks work
[2013-10-21 03:45:31 -0400] airtonix: i was hoping i wasn't going to have to touch ruby
[2013-10-21 13:25:05 -0400] Josh_: I've written a recipe to install a package. Now I would like to create some symbolic links to the package just installed.
[2013-10-21 13:25:16 -0400] Josh_: Only the package directory contains the version number.
[2013-10-21 13:25:41 -0400] Josh_: Is there a way I can capture the version number from the package resource to generate my links?
[2013-10-21 13:25:56 -0400] Josh_: (other solutions are welcome...)
[2013-10-21 13:27:57 -0400] Josh_: I've tried calling `yum list my-package | grep "my-package" | cut -c 41-55`.strip and a slightly different version that uses yum info instead (yes I know I've tied this to Fedora-based Linux).
[2013-10-21 13:28:47 -0400] Josh_: But when I try to get the version from yum it only works on the second run of chef-client. The first run returns nothing and my links are broken.
[2013-10-21 14:48:27 -0400] vt102: Anybody familiar with the nagios cookbook?  My apache2 install from nagios::server cookbook  is dying with "STDERR: Warning: DocumentRoot [/usr/share/nagios3/htdocs] does not exist"
[2013-10-21 14:48:42 -0400] vt102: nagios::server recipe
[2013-10-21 14:53:05 -0400] vt102: It's from the http starting-- the nagios3.conf file is there, but obviously the directory hasn't been created yet.
[2013-10-21 16:18:09 -0400] binamov: vt102 figured it out?
[2013-10-21 18:39:41 -0400] droy: hi all, i have a question about running a Java jar during a chef run
[2013-10-21 18:39:49 -0400] droy: i've seen examples using bash 'run_jar'
[2013-10-21 18:40:53 -0400] droy: is this the only way?
[2013-10-21 18:41:16 -0400] droy: and I don't see it block until the jar is done running
[2013-10-21 18:41:59 -0400] isafarnik: You've got a few options
[2013-10-21 18:42:24 -0400] isafarnik: There's also the execute resource which you could use with "java -jar ..."
[2013-10-21 18:42:49 -0400] isafarnik: Poke around in https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks to see how they start jars there
[2013-10-21 18:44:03 -0400] isafarnik: Depends if you intend your jar to run as a service or not as well.
[2013-10-21 18:44:12 -0400] isafarnik: droy: ^
[2013-10-21 18:44:33 -0400] droy: isafarnik: it's not a service, just a one-time run 
[2013-10-21 18:45:03 -0400] droy: isafarnik: thanks for the tips
[2013-10-21 18:45:19 -0400] isafarnik: np
[2013-10-21 18:53:01 -0400] vt102: binamov: Yes, it was me-- company's websense blocked SourceForge, so instead of a tarball to install, it had a warning page.
[2013-10-21 18:53:59 -0400] vt102: Caught it once because it was pretty clear from the error message.  This time, not so clear, but finally thought to check and saw it.
[2013-10-21 18:55:14 -0400] isafarnik: vt102: I think you missed..
[2013-10-21 19:02:34 -0400] airtonix: https://dpaste.de/t9XH#L4,5,6,7,8,9 << how do i make this work without repeating the highlighted lines in each of the vagrant definitions ?
[2013-10-21 19:03:05 -0400] airtonix: i really wish chef let me use python instead of ruby to write this stuff
[2013-10-21 19:14:12 -0400] airtonix: i guess not being a fan of ruby is a bad thing around here
[2013-10-21 19:18:08 -0400] sfalcon: airtonix: you don't have to love the Ruby to use Chef. But it's true that if you fight using Ruby at all, you'll have a rough start.
[2013-10-21 19:18:46 -0400] isafarnik: airtonix: You may have more luck in #chef though
[2013-10-21 19:56:02 -0400] joe_k: im not a fan of ruby. fortunately I dont have to use much of it
[2013-10-21 20:29:55 -0400] joe_k: i think ansible is python?
