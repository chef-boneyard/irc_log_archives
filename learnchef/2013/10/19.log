[2013-10-19 16:39:09 -0400] sscarduzio: Hi gents, can you please tell me if Chef is the right tool for my needs? I need to deploy around 20 EC2 servers which are identical workers consuming from a queue. I need a practical way to deploy new code to all of them on a daily basis. 
[2013-10-19 16:42:17 -0400] sscarduzio: I followed the tutorials and converged my first node on vagrant. I also made my basic cookbook and stuff. But something I didn't get is that if I "upload" a change in a cookbook, will my converged nodes automatically realize the difference that and react accordingly?
[2013-10-19 16:45:11 -0400] sscarduzio: Another idea was to (gradually) destroy all the EC2 workers and create fresh ones with the new code (a bit like Netflix does). Anyhow, I really need to automate this stuff!
[2013-10-19 23:41:11 -0400] Guest19530: Hi guys... I have an easy question
[2013-10-19 23:41:15 -0400] Guest19530: I want to do something like 
[2013-10-19 23:41:16 -0400] Guest19530: only_if do           File.exists?("/home/#{params[:name]}/.ssh") && !params[:public_key].nil?          end
[2013-10-19 23:41:40 -0400] Guest19530: but it doesn't like "&& !params[:public_key].nil?"
[2013-10-19 23:41:54 -0400] Guest19530: does anyone know how to add another condition here?
