[2013-10-28 04:08:06 -0400] brucelee: hey guys
[2013-10-28 04:08:17 -0400] brucelee: i have some code that i was hoping one of you could go through with me
[2013-10-28 04:08:19 -0400] brucelee: its very short
[2013-10-28 04:08:33 -0400] brucelee: http://www.fpaste.org/49836/93239013/
[2013-10-28 05:25:20 -0400] Cope: brucelee: hi there
[2013-10-28 05:30:58 -0400] brucelee: Cope: hey
[2013-10-28 05:31:08 -0400] brucelee: Cope: hows the chef learning going
[2013-10-28 15:52:35 -0400] UTF-8: include_recipe "recipe_name" do   path "/source/file" end
[2013-10-28 15:52:49 -0400] UTF-8: is that valid sytax
[2013-10-28 15:53:18 -0400] UTF-8: I take it that the include_recipe runs the default recipe, but how do I pass attributes?
[2013-10-28 15:54:20 -0400] tomduffield: which attributes are you looking to pass in?
[2013-10-28 15:54:57 -0400] tomduffield: include_recipe is intended to "force" a recipe to run
[2013-10-28 15:55:03 -0400] UTF-8: path
[2013-10-28 15:55:05 -0400] tomduffield: at a specific point in your chef-run
[2013-10-28 15:55:12 -0400] tomduffield: path to what?
[2013-10-28 15:56:12 -0400] UTF-8: a source file, I gues in general how do I use a recipe and provide parameters? I make want to use the recipe more than once
[2013-10-28 15:56:33 -0400] tomduffield: chef will run a recipe only once
[2013-10-28 15:56:38 -0400] tomduffield: the first time it is called
[2013-10-28 15:56:40 -0400] UTF-8: sorry for the broken english, its my first language
[2013-10-28 15:57:40 -0400] tomduffield: you can't use include_recipe to use a recipe multiple times
[2013-10-28 15:57:48 -0400] UTF-8: ok
[2013-10-28 15:57:54 -0400] tomduffield: the recipe will only run the first time it is called
[2013-10-28 15:58:22 -0400] tomduffield: depending on what you are doing you may want to try writing/using an LWRP or adding additional logic to the recipe
[2013-10-28 15:58:39 -0400] tomduffield: what recipe are you trying to run more than one time, maybe I can help you identify which option is best for you
[2013-10-28 15:59:18 -0400] UTF-8: a recipe that another developer produced and I want to pass parms to it
[2013-10-28 15:59:46 -0400] tomduffield: okay. you can't pass parameters to a recipe like you pass parameters to other chef resources.
[2013-10-28 15:59:47 -0400] UTF-8: another in-house guy, not out of opscode repo
[2013-10-28 16:00:25 -0400] tomduffield: what does this recipe do?
[2013-10-28 16:22:46 -0400] joe_k: when i read http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_attributes.html i am having trouble understand in what contexts these ruby expressions called "attributes" can be used
[2013-10-28 16:23:23 -0400] joe_k: i would really like to see more about how these names in the ruby namespace get set, where they are valid, what startup code might set them or if they come from loading files, etc
[2013-10-28 16:24:05 -0400] joe_k: are they always in scope in any ruby code every loaded anywhere in chef?
[2013-10-28 16:24:12 -0400] joe_k: s/every/ever
[2013-10-28 16:25:03 -0400] tomduffield: so node attributes are available in any chef recipe, template or LWRP
[2013-10-28 16:25:16 -0400] tomduffield: they are available elsewhere as well through other means
[2013-10-28 16:28:13 -0400] joe_k: is there a reason the names in http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_attributes.html#attribute-types are code-formatted?
[2013-10-28 16:28:31 -0400] joe_k: am I able to type those somewhere (its not clear if they're also supposed to be names in the namespace)
[2013-10-28 16:29:17 -0400] joe_k: so "default" is like "node" ?
[2013-10-28 16:29:28 -0400] joe_k: but "node" isnt an attribute type?
[2013-10-28 16:29:31 -0400] tomduffield: basically think of each of those as a hash object that all get merged together into the node object
[2013-10-28 16:30:06 -0400] tomduffield: the node object being yet another Hash
[2013-10-28 16:30:11 -0400] joe_k: so "node" is the name i'm supposed to reference all attributes from when reading them?
[2013-10-28 16:30:15 -0400] tomduffield: yes
[2013-10-28 16:33:19 -0400] joe_k: i have a software project that I'd like to write integration tests for
[2013-10-28 16:33:30 -0400] joe_k: and it would be great if the tests were in a directory in the project directory
[2013-10-28 16:33:47 -0400] joe_k: i am having trouble understanding which parts I should break into cookbooks, chef-repo, etc and put where
[2013-10-28 16:34:01 -0400] joe_k: i want to run a test script that brings stuff up with chef then runs the test on the provisioned machine
[2013-10-28 16:34:29 -0400] joe_k: is it normal to check a whole "chef-repo" into another project so you have the metadata needed to run tests?
[2013-10-28 16:34:35 -0400] joe_k: or do people use chef this way
[2013-10-28 16:35:27 -0400] joe_k: i put some things into a cookbook, so is the normal pattern to have a completely separate repo for the cookbook, and then a "chef-repo" in the project folder?
[2013-10-28 16:35:43 -0400] joe_k: and use berkshef to pull in the cookbook?
[2013-10-28 16:35:59 -0400] joe_k: in that case I am wondering about attributes for stuff I hardcoded, like database password, and where to properly set and read them
[2013-10-28 16:36:18 -0400] joe_k: and then where does our build process set that attribute so it's not part of the repo
[2013-10-28 16:36:28 -0400] joe_k: any hints appreciated
[2013-10-28 16:38:30 -0400] tomduffield: that is a long list
[2013-10-28 16:38:52 -0400] tomduffield: and something that isn't easy to cover of IRC
[2013-10-28 16:40:10 -0400] tomduffield: have you gone through fundamentals training?
[2013-10-28 16:44:57 -0400] joe_k: i did an opscode course about a year ago but it was focused on linux so never got to use any of it.  Picking up chef again to try to improve our testing situation. I've been playing with it for probably a month and am to the point where i'm booting a windows machine over ec2 and provisioning it
[2013-10-28 16:45:14 -0400] joe_k: so i am interested in knowing how people organize their projects before I just make up some way
[2013-10-28 16:46:42 -0400] UTF-8: Does a LWRP imply idempotence? Chef advertises itself as idempotent, but if relies on other code to acheive this, it seem hard to make that statement.
[2013-10-28 16:47:02 -0400] joe_k: yeah its really hard to make that statement esp. with things like windows/chocolatey
[2013-10-28 16:47:22 -0400] joe_k: chocolatey will just record a package as installed, even if it failed, and there's no clear way how to get it to rerun the install
[2013-10-28 16:47:27 -0400] joe_k: because it just bails saying "already installed"
[2013-10-28 16:47:28 -0400] UTF-8: I am in the same place joe
[2013-10-28 16:47:58 -0400] UTF-8: from reading I am being lead in the direction of Berkshelf
[2013-10-28 16:48:25 -0400] vt102: I deleted a host and tried to recreate it with the same name, including "knife node delete <foo>"-- but when bootstrapping the new one, I get an Authorization Error, "There may already be a client named "<foo>""
[2013-10-28 16:48:35 -0400] vt102: What should I do in addition to knife node delete?
[2013-10-28 16:48:56 -0400] tomduffield: vt102: knife client delete <foo>
[2013-10-28 16:49:25 -0400] tomduffield: Only chef resources provide built-in idempotence
[2013-10-28 16:49:26 -0400] vt102: tomduffield:  Thanks!!!  (I should have known that...)
[2013-10-28 16:49:40 -0400] tomduffield: LWRPs will need to provide their own idempotence
[2013-10-28 16:50:15 -0400] tomduffield: best practice for organizing your code is that chef data (roles, environments, data bags) should be in a source controlled repo and each cookbook should have its own repo
[2013-10-28 16:50:36 -0400] tomduffield: if you are using test-kitchen (or most testing frameworks) the test code would be kept with the cookbook it is meant to be testing
[2013-10-28 16:51:11 -0400] tomduffield: in terms of chocolatey, thats a limitation of chocolatey :/
[2013-10-28 16:51:33 -0400] UTF-8: tomdeffield: So I could use berkshelf with a single git repo and multiple chef-repos within?
[2013-10-28 16:51:42 -0400] tomduffield: eh
[2013-10-28 16:52:15 -0400] tomduffield: chef-repos (databags, environments, roles) coincide with Chef organizations
[2013-10-28 16:53:11 -0400] UTF-8: does berkshelf have any hard dependencies on git?
[2013-10-28 16:53:16 -0400] tomduffield: none at all
[2013-10-28 16:53:26 -0400] tomduffield: berkshelf is a tool used to resolve cookbook dependencies
[2013-10-28 16:53:30 -0400] UTF-8: unlike cookbook site
[2013-10-28 16:54:23 -0400] tomduffield: berkshelf and cookbook site both solve the problem of upstream changes
[2013-10-28 16:54:31 -0400] tomduffield: one uses git, the other uses a different method
[2013-10-28 16:54:39 -0400] tomduffield: cookbook site uses git I should say
[2013-10-28 16:55:22 -0400] tomduffield: i'm going to run through a quick anecdote to describe how I would approach testing
[2013-10-28 16:55:56 -0400] tomduffield: first off, are you looking to test an application or are you looking to test the chef code?
[2013-10-28 16:56:42 -0400] joe_k: a
[2013-10-28 16:56:50 -0400] joe_k: an app
[2013-10-28 16:56:55 -0400] tomduffield: so lets say you have a software app called 'widget'
[2013-10-28 16:57:23 -0400] tomduffield: you probably have a cookbook called 'widget' as well to install all the necessary bits and pieces. we'll call this widget-cb
[2013-10-28 16:58:05 -0400] tomduffield: create a git repo for widget-cb, use Berkshelf to manage dependencies on other cookbooks that widget-cb depends on
[2013-10-28 16:58:50 -0400] tomduffield: if you are using tools like test-kitchen to test your widget app, then those tests can be kept with your widget-cb code
[2013-10-28 16:59:25 -0400] tomduffield: does that make sense?
[2013-10-28 17:00:40 -0400] UTF-8: Is the version of a cookbook tied to the version of widget? 
[2013-10-28 17:00:49 -0400] tomduffield: that is up to you
[2013-10-28 17:00:52 -0400] UTF-8: so cookbook for widget 10.1
[2013-10-28 17:01:01 -0400] UTF-8: what is common practive
[2013-10-28 17:01:06 -0400] tomduffield: separate
[2013-10-28 17:01:06 -0400] UTF-8: practice
[2013-10-28 17:01:18 -0400] tomduffield: they have different development cycles
[2013-10-28 17:01:21 -0400] UTF-8: both on thier on version path
[2013-10-28 17:01:23 -0400] UTF-8: k
[2013-10-28 17:02:10 -0400] tomduffield: that being said
[2013-10-28 17:02:27 -0400] tomduffield: tools like test-kitchen are going to focus more on testing Chef code rather than software
[2013-10-28 17:02:29 -0400] UTF-8: so why not have a single git repository with multiple shef-repos underneath?
[2013-10-28 17:02:50 -0400] tomduffield: when you say chef-repo, do you mean cookbooks?
[2013-10-28 17:03:32 -0400] tomduffield: chef-repo is most commonly associated with the organization-specific data like environments, roles and data bags
[2013-10-28 17:03:50 -0400] UTF-8: so my understanding is you need a cookbooks dir for each cookbook because its dependencies my by different 
[2013-10-28 17:04:38 -0400] UTF-8: so widgetX would need a chef-repo and widgetY would need another?
[2013-10-28 17:04:39 -0400] tomduffield: right, you typically store all the bits of a cookbook in a cookbooks directory
[2013-10-28 17:04:49 -0400] tomduffield: not necessarily
[2013-10-28 17:05:01 -0400] tomduffield: chef-repo = organization
[2013-10-28 17:05:16 -0400] UTF-8: ok
[2013-10-28 17:05:34 -0400] tomduffield: an organization typically maps (in a business) to a business unit or the company itself
[2013-10-28 17:05:50 -0400] tomduffield: organizations are silos that can not talk to one another
[2013-10-28 17:05:50 -0400] UTF-8: I was thinking product
[2013-10-28 17:06:04 -0400] tomduffield: product more closely equals cookbook
[2013-10-28 17:06:25 -0400] tomduffield: and each cookbook should have its own git repo (best practice)
[2013-10-28 17:07:15 -0400] tomduffield: you can see what Nordstrom's does here: https://github.com/Nordstrom
[2013-10-28 17:07:43 -0400] tomduffield: they have separate repos for both their software apps and their Chef cookbooks
[2013-10-28 17:08:10 -0400] UTF-8: How about this scenario: A company has three SAAS offerings, 1 is legacy and relies on old version of many components (libs, etc). 
[2013-10-28 17:16:13 -0400] tomduffield: okay
[2013-10-28 17:17:03 -0400] tomduffield: i would say each SAAS offering would have its own cookbook
[2013-10-28 17:17:17 -0400] tomduffield: no reason all three offerings couldn't be in the same organization
[2013-10-28 17:18:14 -0400] tomduffield: and you can use Berkshelf in each offering's cookbook to manage cookbook dependencies
[2013-10-28 17:39:01 -0400] joe_k: also the cookbooks can have multiple named recipes
[2013-10-28 17:39:32 -0400] joe_k: eg "yourcompany[default]" installs the newest version, "yourcompany[legacy]" installs the old
[2013-10-28 17:40:48 -0400] tomduffield: right. I would avoid have a yourcompany cookbook
[2013-10-28 17:40:52 -0400] tomduffield: though
[2013-10-28 17:41:06 -0400] tomduffield: cookbook = product is okay
[2013-10-28 17:41:15 -0400] tomduffield: cookbook = company is bad practice
[2013-10-28 17:42:11 -0400] tomduffield: you could have widgetX::latest and widgetX::legacy
[2013-10-28 17:53:45 -0400] joe_k: so in a cookbook recipe file, i just set attributes anywhere in the file?
[2013-10-28 17:53:53 -0400] joe_k: or do cookbooks have a place for default attributes?
[2013-10-28 17:54:42 -0400] tomduffield: so if you used `knife cookbook create` to create your cookbook directory, there should be an attributes folder
[2013-10-28 17:54:54 -0400] tomduffield: in there you can create a `default.rb` file and put your default attributes in there
[2013-10-28 17:55:09 -0400] joe_k: ttp://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_directory.html says "To configure cookbook-specific copyright, email, and license data, add the following to the knife.rb file in the chef-repo:"
[2013-10-28 17:55:15 -0400] joe_k: but the chef-repo isn't part of the cookbook, is it?
[2013-10-28 17:55:31 -0400] joe_k: does default.rb only correspond to running recipes/default.rb ?
[2013-10-28 17:55:36 -0400] tomduffield: no
[2013-10-28 17:55:57 -0400] tomduffield: attributes/default.rb will be loaded everytime someone refers to the cookbook
[2013-10-28 17:56:05 -0400] tomduffield: and the chef-repo is not part of a cookbook
[2013-10-28 17:56:25 -0400] joe_k: afaik knife.rb is in .chef/
[2013-10-28 17:56:34 -0400] joe_k: why would i configure cookbook metadata there?
[2013-10-28 17:56:56 -0400] joe_k: btw
[2013-10-28 17:57:03 -0400] joe_k: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_directory.html "About the /csookbooks Directory"
[2013-10-28 17:57:59 -0400] tomduffield: you are setting default values that would be put into the cookbook metadata
[2013-10-28 17:58:18 -0400] tomduffield: when you create a new cookbook, it will looking into the knife.rb file to pull out your default email, etc
[2013-10-28 17:58:57 -0400] tomduffield: and the /cookbooks directory is an older way of doing things
[2013-10-28 17:59:05 -0400] tomduffield: we're currently working on updating the documentation
[2013-10-28 17:59:27 -0400] tomduffield: but you can think about it like this
[2013-10-28 17:59:43 -0400] tomduffield: an organization contains roles, environments, data_bags and cookbooks
[2013-10-28 17:59:52 -0400] tomduffield: chef-repo = organization 
[2013-10-28 17:59:55 -0400] joe_k: so in the cookbook, i have to repeat the name of the cookbook in every attr?
[2013-10-28 18:00:08 -0400] tomduffield: yeah
[2013-10-28 18:00:08 -0400] joe_k: e.g. versionone-cookbook/attributes/default.rb
[2013-10-28 18:00:12 -0400] joe_k: every rule will say 
[2013-10-28 18:00:19 -0400] joe_k: defaults["versionone"][....] = 
[2013-10-28 18:00:23 -0400] tomduffield: yeah
[2013-10-28 18:00:35 -0400] tomduffield: its default, but you've got the idea
[2013-10-28 18:01:34 -0400] joe_k: how do people normally take things like passwords as parameters
[2013-10-28 18:01:41 -0400] joe_k: i dont really want an unsafe default
[2013-10-28 18:01:56 -0400] tomduffield: well
[2013-10-28 18:02:00 -0400] joe_k: i want everyone on the team to be able to use it without typing, maybe by setting up something in their home dir (additional run-time attributes?)
[2013-10-28 18:02:24 -0400] joe_k: and the cookbook has a recipe which uses that value
[2013-10-28 18:02:37 -0400] tomduffield: normally you put secure attributes in an encrypted data bag
[2013-10-28 18:03:24 -0400] tomduffield: joe_k: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html
[2013-10-28 18:05:18 -0400] joe_k: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html#store-data-in-a-data-bag "When the chef-repo is cloned from github, the following occurs:" ..... wait, what is supposed to be doing this behavior?
[2013-10-28 18:05:20 -0400] joe_k: git
[2013-10-28 18:05:22 -0400] joe_k: ?
[2013-10-28 18:06:11 -0400] tomduffield: dont worry too much about that
[2013-10-28 18:06:23 -0400] tomduffield: the important bit is that you would create a data bag to store your passwords in
[2013-10-28 18:08:18 -0400] joe_k: hm it recommends you write out a secret key file that you then refer to
[2013-10-28 18:08:23 -0400] joe_k: that kind of just kicks the can
[2013-10-28 18:08:31 -0400] joe_k: now i have to distribute the secret key file?
[2013-10-28 18:08:47 -0400] tomduffield: check out chef-vault: http://www.opscode.com/blog/2013/09/19/managing-secrets-with-chef-vault/
[2013-10-28 18:10:56 -0400] joe_k: keeping all this state on the server feels bad to me
[2013-10-28 18:11:03 -0400] joe_k: i want it checked in
[2013-10-28 18:13:10 -0400] tomduffield: you can keep it checked in
[2013-10-28 18:13:29 -0400] joe_k: chef-vault seems to manage data on the chef-server
[2013-10-28 18:13:56 -0400] tomduffield: chef-vault manages the encryption/decryption of data bags when running chef-client
[2013-10-28 18:14:40 -0400] tomduffield: you can still keep the chef-repo folder (and thusly the data_bags folder) in source control
[2013-10-28 18:19:58 -0400] joe_k: i have things in my cookbook that are kind of tangential to our product; like a recipe that changes some sql server configs
[2013-10-28 18:20:13 -0400] joe_k: should I just leave that in there because the cookbook uses it?
[2013-10-28 18:21:02 -0400] tomduffield: for right now, yeah
[2013-10-28 18:22:08 -0400] joe_k: in my case my "organization" refers to one test run for one software app.... im putting my chef-repo inside the app project folder
[2013-10-28 18:22:16 -0400] joe_k: does that sound reasonable?
[2013-10-28 18:22:39 -0400] joe_k: (this isn't for persistent infrastructure)
[2013-10-28 18:23:37 -0400] tomduffield: not really, no
[2013-10-28 18:23:45 -0400] tomduffield: organization refers to your company
[2013-10-28 18:23:47 -0400] tomduffield: always will
[2013-10-28 18:24:10 -0400] tomduffield: but in your case, it will work in this unique situation
[2013-10-28 18:24:19 -0400] joe_k: this isnt a set of infrastructure that's company-wide
[2013-10-28 18:24:19 -0400] tomduffield: be careful about carrying that forward though
[2013-10-28 18:24:21 -0400] joe_k: it's per-test-run
[2013-10-28 18:26:22 -0400] joe_k: is there a reson I describe my dependencies in both the berksfile and in the ./metadata.rb file ?
[2013-10-28 18:26:36 -0400] joe_k: oh wait, berksfile is for chef-repo and metadata.rb is for cookbook
[2013-10-28 18:26:59 -0400] joe_k: so berkshelf scans the metadata.rb of referred-to cookbooks and constructs the dep tree
[2013-10-28 18:27:34 -0400] joe_k: so does that mean if my cookbook metadata.rb refers to "powershell" then my chef_repo berksfile does not need too
[2013-10-28 18:27:37 -0400] joe_k: to
[2013-10-28 18:35:36 -0400] vt102: I can do something like "knife ssh role:base ..."  What am I doing when I do that?  Why am I not able to do something like "knife node show role[base]" or "...run_list add role[base]"?
[2013-10-28 18:36:09 -0400] vt102: Is the ssh subcommand special in that regard?
[2013-10-28 18:38:56 -0400] tomduffield: berksfile can be either per cookbook or per chef-repo
[2013-10-28 18:40:06 -0400] joe_k: if cookbook has metadata.rb which lists deps, is berksfile also necessary there to make berkshelf work?
[2013-10-28 18:41:03 -0400] joe_k: or are the deps in metadata.rb used _only_ by the chef-client to decide what to upload to the chef-server 
[2013-10-28 18:42:04 -0400] tomduffield: the deps in metadata.rb are used by chef-client to determine which cookbooks to download from the chef-server
[2013-10-28 18:42:33 -0400] tomduffield: berksfile will assist you in download and uploading the deps to the chef-server
[2013-10-28 18:43:46 -0400] joe_k: so wait this wont work
[2013-10-28 18:43:48 -0400] joe_k: default["versionone"]["sqlserver_product_instance"] = "MSSQL11.MSSQLSERVER"
[2013-10-28 18:43:50 -0400] joe_k: default["versionone"]["sqlserver_authmode_regkey"] = "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Microsoft SQL Server\\#{default["versionone"]["sqlserver_product_instance"]}\\MSSQLServer"
[2013-10-28 18:44:00 -0400] joe_k: because the second line will never see any other value for the attribute, right?
[2013-10-28 18:44:04 -0400] joe_k: i can't just do it that way
[2013-10-28 18:44:57 -0400] joe_k: i mean it would work right there, but the user would not be able to set an attribute to customize it?
[2013-10-28 18:52:16 -0400] tomduffield: right
[2013-10-28 18:52:38 -0400] tomduffield: typically you don't want one attribute to depend on another attribute
[2013-10-28 18:52:40 -0400] joe_k: i guess theres no way that can happen with ruby being imperative and not a data structure that is assembled then run
[2013-10-28 18:52:45 -0400] joe_k: oh really?
[2013-10-28 18:52:47 -0400] joe_k: hm
[2013-10-28 18:52:57 -0400] tomduffield: you can do that
[2013-10-28 18:53:07 -0400] tomduffield: but you introduce some unexpected complexities that can catch people
[2013-10-28 18:53:39 -0400] joe_k: and the right way to use it from a recipe is:
[2013-10-28 18:53:41 -0400] joe_k: registry_key node["versionone"]["sqlserver_authmode_regkey"] do
[2013-10-28 18:53:44 -0400] joe_k:   values [{name: 'LoginMode', type: :dword, data: 2}]
[2013-10-28 18:53:46 -0400] joe_k:   action :create
[2013-10-28 18:53:48 -0400] joe_k: end
[2013-10-28 18:53:50 -0400] joe_k: ?
[2013-10-28 18:59:21 -0400] tomduffield: that looks syntactically correct
[2013-10-28 19:33:24 -0400] joe_k: i am trying to figure out how to boot up two machines and have a service on one refer to the other
[2013-10-28 19:34:07 -0400] joe_k: thus i need to wait for the first one to come up before e.g. the IP address is available for the second
[2013-10-28 19:34:10 -0400] tomduffield: for what purpose
[2013-10-28 19:34:11 -0400] joe_k: does chef support this kind of thing?
[2013-10-28 19:34:34 -0400] joe_k: im still working on the same thing here .... automated integration testing of our app
[2013-10-28 19:34:53 -0400] joe_k: need an sql / iss / app server on one machine, visual studio client on another with a plugin connected to the first, etc
[2013-10-28 19:35:30 -0400] tomduffield: okay
[2013-10-28 19:35:41 -0400] joe_k: (i guess technically they could all be on one node, but what if they weren't - because my next task is with an ldap server on linux talking to our windows app)
[2013-10-28 19:36:55 -0400] tomduffield: so you can use the search functionality to determine the ip address of the other node
[2013-10-28 19:37:39 -0400] joe_k: how is the time ordering handled
[2013-10-28 19:38:00 -0400] joe_k: or do i just run the provision commands serially since they block
[2013-10-28 19:38:02 -0400] joe_k: hm.
[2013-10-28 19:38:48 -0400] joe_k: hm. they search the chef-server. so i need a way to uniqueify separate test runs that might be running at the same time
[2013-10-28 19:40:57 -0400] tomduffield: you'll need to fine a way to handle the timing yourself
[2013-10-28 20:05:58 -0400] joe_k: when I add attributes to boostrap with -j, is that just merged directly into the "node" hash
[2013-10-28 20:06:47 -0400] joe_k: so -j '{"versionone":{"sqlserver_password":"whatever"}}' would be the way to set node["versionone"]["sqlserver_password"] ?
[2013-10-28 20:08:13 -0400] tomduffield: that would be a way yes, but not the only way
[2013-10-28 20:09:06 -0400] joe_k: but the key/value hierarchy is correct?
[2013-10-28 20:09:36 -0400] joe_k: i am open to other ways if there is a better one
[2013-10-28 20:09:45 -0400] tomduffield: yes
[2013-10-28 20:09:52 -0400] tomduffield: other ways would include roles/environments
[2013-10-28 20:10:29 -0400] joe_k: right, those sound like persistent definitions, and this is more per-run data
[2013-10-28 20:10:45 -0400] joe_k: so I can write cookbooks without including a password, then set it at provision time on the command line
[2013-10-28 20:11:02 -0400] tomduffield: yeah
[2013-10-28 20:11:06 -0400] tomduffield: then you are right on track!
[2013-10-28 20:14:09 -0400] joe_k: now if only ruby/knife will read the command line without butchering my json :(
[2013-10-28 20:42:25 -0400] tdi: help
[2013-10-28 20:42:37 -0400] tomduffield: with what tdi? :)
[2013-10-28 20:43:19 -0400] tdi: sorry, I should read a tutorial on freenode/irc first
[2013-10-28 20:43:36 -0400] tomduffield: gotcha ;)
[2013-10-28 22:00:43 -0400] joe_k: seems like .chef should be in the user's home dir and not the chef-repo
[2013-10-28 22:00:50 -0400] joe_k: that's where all my user-related stuff like keys is
[2013-10-28 22:01:04 -0400] joe_k: (and it's even named like a unix user settings directory)
[2013-10-28 22:01:42 -0400] tomduffield: we put it in .chef to narrow the scope
[2013-10-28 22:01:54 -0400] tomduffield: normally the details you put in knife.rb coincide with an organization
[2013-10-28 22:02:06 -0400] tomduffield: since chef-repo ~~ organization, we put it in there
[2013-10-28 22:02:29 -0400] tomduffield: *put it in chef-repo
[2013-10-28 22:03:01 -0400] tomduffield: so if you are dealing with multiple organizations, you can have multiple chef-repos with multiple .chef folders storing your keys, etc from each organization
[2013-10-28 22:03:09 -0400] joe_k: but you also expect user-level stuff int here, which is why .gitignore ignores .pems :)
[2013-10-28 22:03:18 -0400] tomduffield: yeah
[2013-10-28 22:03:33 -0400] tomduffield: but we also put it in chef-repo to keep it all nice and bundled together
[2013-10-28 22:03:41 -0400] tomduffield: in practice, it doesn't need to go in chef-repo
[2013-10-28 22:03:42 -0400] joe_k: sure
[2013-10-28 22:03:44 -0400] tomduffield: it can go in your user folder
[2013-10-28 22:03:55 -0400] joe_k: im just having trouble finding a place for these credentials that I dont want to check in
[2013-10-28 22:04:09 -0400] tomduffield: the knife command will look for a .chef repo in the current directory then walk the path back to root until it finds one
[2013-10-28 22:04:10 -0400] joe_k: its a public repo that holds the chef dir
[2013-10-28 22:04:48 -0400] joe_k: if someone clones it, i want them to set their AWS key somewhere and be ready to go
[2013-10-28 22:05:06 -0400] tomduffield: right
[2013-10-28 22:05:30 -0400] tomduffield: you could tell them to set environment variables in their .bash_profile and make sure all your stuff references those
[2013-10-28 22:05:39 -0400] tomduffield: and store your person .chef directory in ~
[2013-10-28 22:05:50 -0400] joe_k: oh so does it overlay them
[2013-10-28 22:06:02 -0400] joe_k: uh let me re-read what you wrote
[2013-10-28 22:58:55 -0400] minotaur: hi chefs, looking for some help with debugging an issue with a wrapper cookbook I've written to the opscode openssh cookbook.
