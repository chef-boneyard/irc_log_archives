[2013-10-09 13:24:49 -0400] CPS: i'm a little unclear on how to set up a node to talk to the chef server
[2013-10-09 13:25:00 -0400] CPS: do i need chef client installed on the server as well as the workstation?
[2013-10-09 13:36:55 -0400] CPS: so in run 'knife bootstrap windows winrm ...' on the server?
[2013-10-09 14:31:37 -0400] CPS: mmzyk:  the -k option is giving me "The system cannot find the specified file"
[2013-10-09 14:31:52 -0400] CPS: -k 'C:\chef\validation.pem'
[2013-10-09 14:33:13 -0400] mmzyk: CPS you run it from the machine that has knife and your key file on it and point it at the machine you want to bootstrap, pointing to the key file on the machine you're running from.
[2013-10-09 14:33:58 -0400] CPS: i'm running it from a windows machine that has chef client installed on it
[2013-10-09 14:34:09 -0400] CPS: trying to connect it to a machine that has chef server installed
[2013-10-09 14:34:59 -0400] mmzyk: So the point of bootstrap is to get a client on the machine and get it initially setup - so if the machine already has chef-client on it, you shouldn't need it.
[2013-10-09 14:35:15 -0400] CPS: ah
[2013-10-09 14:36:10 -0400] CPS: is that install setup properly then? do i need chef client and chef server installed on the server machine?
[2013-10-09 14:36:59 -0400] mmzyk: No, you don't need client on the server machine, although a lot of people put it there as a way to have chef manage that machine as well. But probably not a complication you want to worry about while learning.
[2013-10-09 14:37:10 -0400] CPS: ok
[2013-10-09 14:37:31 -0400] mmzyk: Sounds like your setup is good, so long as the client is talking to the server like you expect.
[2013-10-09 14:37:41 -0400] CPS: where does the server store cookbooks? i uploaded an empty one from the client
[2013-10-09 14:38:30 -0400] mmzyk: I don't remember exactly where it saves all of that. Most people manage that by using knife and it's various commands to talk to the server.
[2013-10-09 14:38:49 -0400] mmzyk: http://docs.opscode.com/chef/knife.html#cookbook
[2013-10-09 14:38:52 -0400] CPS: write cookbooks from the machine they get installed on?
[2013-10-09 14:39:11 -0400] mmzyk: Not sure I follow that last question. 
[2013-10-09 14:39:31 -0400] CPS: the cookbooks are defined by ruby files
[2013-10-09 14:39:44 -0400] CPS: do people normally write those files on the client machines?
[2013-10-09 14:39:57 -0400] mmzyk: Yes, cookbooks are in ruby in a directory structure.
[2013-10-09 14:40:05 -0400] mmzyk: Ah, no, you don't have to.
[2013-10-09 14:40:17 -0400] mmzyk: So normally you have a workstation where you work and manage your cookbooks.
[2013-10-09 14:40:30 -0400] mmzyk: Then you upload them to the chef server and the client machine pulls the ones it needs from there.
[2013-10-09 14:40:58 -0400] mmzyk: A lot of people store their cookbooks in a github repo.
[2013-10-09 14:40:59 -0400] mmzyk: https://github.com/organizations/opscode-cookbooks
[2013-10-09 14:41:01 -0400] mmzyk: such as ^
[2013-10-09 14:41:29 -0400] mmzyk: Then a user can check out the repo, make changes and store it back in the repo (but the chef server doesn't know about the changes until you upload the cookbook to the chef server)
[2013-10-09 14:41:30 -0400] CPS: i'm looking at this for my company, i don't think we can use github
[2013-10-09 14:41:40 -0400] mmzyk: Well, any source control can work.
[2013-10-09 14:41:46 -0400] mmzyk: github was just an example.
[2013-10-09 14:42:02 -0400] mmzyk: The point is it's just a repo under source control, with each cookbook in it's down dir.
[2013-10-09 14:42:38 -0400] mmzyk: s/down/own
[2013-10-09 14:42:49 -0400] mmzyk: this is there the idea of infrastructure as code comes from.
[2013-10-09 14:43:36 -0400] mmzyk: So your cookbooks would be checked into source control - when you want to work on them, you check out the repo, make modifications, check back into source control, then upload to the chef server where they can then be used by the clients. Make sense?
[2013-10-09 14:44:07 -0400] CPS: yeah
[2013-10-09 14:44:23 -0400] mmzyk: So there isn't necessarily a client machine or any special machine you need to check them out on or work with them. So long as it can access source control and is setup with knife you can modify and upload cookbooks.
[2013-10-09 14:44:24 -0400] CPS: you've been very helpful, thank you
[2013-10-09 14:44:39 -0400] mmzyk: I do my best. I'm a developer with Opscode, just to be clear on that point.
[2013-10-09 14:46:22 -0400] CPS: do you know of a good guide for writing recipes for use on windows machines?
[2013-10-09 14:56:50 -0400] mmzyk: CPS No, but all recipe structures are generally the same, so follow a general guide and then here are the docs that detail windows specific resources and changes, so reference this heavily: http://docs.opscode.com/windows.html
[2013-10-09 14:57:53 -0400] mmzyk: Note that a lot of resources in Chef are cross platform, so if it isn't on that page you can still use it most of the time (unless it is obviously linux focused), but that page details the ways in which things differ specifically for windows
[2013-10-09 15:05:23 -0400] CPS: i think i'm still missing something. in the web ui it shows no nodes
[2013-10-09 15:06:46 -0400] CPS: how do i add my windows machine as a node that i can push recipes to/
[2013-10-09 15:12:42 -0400] CPS: oh nm knife node create [name] works
[2013-10-09 15:12:55 -0400] mmzyk: cool, glad you got that figured out.
[2013-10-09 15:13:28 -0400] CPS: is using the machine name as the node name ill-advised?
[2013-10-09 15:14:13 -0400] mmzyk: I don't know the answer to that actually. That would be a good question to ask in #chef or on the mailing list.
[2013-10-09 15:15:45 -0400] CPS: well we'll see what happens
[2013-10-09 15:16:16 -0400] mmzyk: I think it should work just fine, but I don't know if for some reason it becomes sub-optimal down the road.
[2013-10-09 15:16:48 -0400] CPS: so i've added a recipe to the run lsit
[2013-10-09 15:16:49 -0400] mmzyk: I come from a dev background, not an operations background, so there are some things like that that I don't have the experience with to provide a good answer.
[2013-10-09 15:16:58 -0400] CPS: is there a command to run the run list?
[2013-10-09 15:17:19 -0400] CPS: yeah i'm a developer as well so setting this all up is a little outside my area
[2013-10-09 15:17:54 -0400] mmzyk: a command to run the run list? To execute the run list on the node? That would be done by running chef-client on the node in question.
[2013-10-09 15:18:18 -0400] mmzyk: Usually sudo chef-client .. er, although I'm not sure what the sudo equivalent on windows is or if it is needed.
[2013-10-09 15:19:09 -0400] CPS: you run a command window as admin
[2013-10-09 15:19:58 -0400] mmzyk: ah, that's right.
[2013-10-09 15:22:03 -0400] CPS: so i ran chef-client on the node and for some reason it's trying to connect to the opscode website instead of my server
[2013-10-09 15:22:16 -0400] CPS: where is the chef_server_url config setting?
[2013-10-09 15:24:20 -0400] CPS: found it, client.rb
[2013-10-09 15:24:53 -0400] mmzyk: http://docs.opscode.com/config_rb_client.html
[2013-10-09 15:25:08 -0400] mmzyk: although it looks like we need to update the path to point to the windows location as well in those docs.
[2013-10-09 15:28:38 -0400] CPS: oh hey since you're a dev i should mention i found a problem when i was running knife configure -i on the client machine
[2013-10-09 15:28:58 -0400] CPS: if you use http: the server responds with a redirect and knife craps out
[2013-10-09 15:29:02 -0400] CPS: you have to use https
[2013-10-09 15:29:15 -0400] CPS: but all the documentation just says http
[2013-10-09 15:29:23 -0400] CPS: this may just be on windows
[2013-10-09 15:29:56 -0400] mmzyk: That might be a known bug, but I'll take the feedback and look into it. Thanks.
[2013-10-09 15:33:06 -0400] mmzyk: CPS what version of knife/chef-client are you running (they are both in the same ruby gem). Do a knife -v and it will tell you
[2013-10-09 15:33:48 -0400] CPS: 10.16.2 on the client machine
[2013-10-09 15:33:55 -0400] CPS: 11.4.0 on the server
[2013-10-09 15:34:34 -0400] CPS: which strikes me as odd now that i see that
[2013-10-09 15:35:21 -0400] mmzyk: yeah, 11 is all the newest stuff, but it's backwards compatible with 10.
[2013-10-09 15:35:54 -0400] mmzyk: There are a few edge cases where you can't do some stuff with 10 that you can do with 11, but they work together.
[2013-10-09 15:37:02 -0400] CPS: so i'm getting a 401 when i run chef-client now
[2013-10-09 15:37:28 -0400] CPS: client.rb has the correct client key file, the validation file exists, and the web ui lists the client i'm using
[2013-10-09 15:37:40 -0400] CPS: i can't find a pem on the server for that client, however
[2013-10-09 15:42:54 -0400] mmzyk: CPS see if this helps you: http://docs.opscode.com/install_workstation.html
[2013-10-09 15:44:01 -0400] mmzyk: look at the .pem files section - it tell you where in the you can get the keys and where to put them (I believe the paths are the same on linux and windows, you just need to do the path separator conversation mentally)
[2013-10-09 15:48:37 -0400] mmzyk: CPS your question on the location of the client.rb file has us updating the docs to add that location for windows, so thanks for the question. :)
[2013-10-09 16:08:48 -0400] CPS: cool
[2013-10-09 16:14:39 -0400] CPS: mmzyk: the message in the 401 is reporting the node name with part of it in caps, but the node is listed in the webui in all lower case and that's how it appears in the configs. is this relevant?
[2013-10-09 16:15:30 -0400] CPS: also i copied over chef-validator.pem to the chef-repo/.chef directory but no dice
[2013-10-09 16:17:28 -0400] mmzyk: Not sure if the caps matter or not.
[2013-10-09 16:17:48 -0400] mmzyk: You'll want to look at your client.rb file and see what .pem it's configured to use, I think
[2013-10-09 16:22:36 -0400] CPS: i have been, it's using the client pem created by knife config -i
[2013-10-09 16:22:48 -0400] CPS: knife client list shows the client, as does the webui
[2013-10-09 16:22:59 -0400] CPS: do i need to move anytihng over to the server in order to authenticate?
[2013-10-09 16:30:03 -0400] mmzyk: No, you shouldn't need to move anything to the server. I suggest looking at the steps here http://docs.opscode.com/install_workstation.html#get-the-pem-files-and-knife-rb-files and going through them step by step to the bottom of the page (or at least verifying them). On your node in question if all is setup properly knife should work.
[2013-10-09 16:30:43 -0400] mmzyk: I realize I sent that to you once. Ideally a bootstrap command would have put everything you needed in place, but if sounds like you got chef-client on the machine in some other way.
[2013-10-09 16:31:06 -0400] mmzyk: Getting the key pair in place can be a pain, but it's what ensure communication b/w the client and server is secure.
[2013-10-09 16:31:39 -0400] mmzyk: I haven't done it enough myself to just effortlessly tell you what might be wrong, which is why I'm referring you to the docs. Sorry if it's confusing. We need to try and make this easier.
[2013-10-09 16:33:42 -0400] CPS: in C:\chef-rep\.chef i have chef-validator.pem and [client].pem
[2013-10-09 16:34:13 -0400] CPS: in C:\chef i have validation.pem, chef-webui.pem, and client.rb
[2013-10-09 16:34:35 -0400] CPS: in client.rb: client_key        "C:/chef-repo/.chef/[client].pem"
[2013-10-09 16:34:41 -0400] CPS: validation_key    "C:/chef/validation.pem"
[2013-10-09 16:34:46 -0400] CPS: validation_client_name "chef-validator"
[2013-10-09 16:35:08 -0400] CPS: these settings are the same as in knife.rb
[2013-10-09 16:36:53 -0400] CPS: knife client list runs fine
[2013-10-09 16:37:34 -0400] CPS: also for some reason the config files use / for paths but don't work with \
[2013-10-09 16:37:42 -0400] mmzyk: I wonder if it is the case that the node name is off.
[2013-10-09 16:38:00 -0400] CPS: i specified node_name in client.rb
[2013-10-09 16:38:12 -0400] CPS: 401 shows it in lowercase now
[2013-10-09 16:38:24 -0400] CPS: it's not present in knife.rb and knife doesn't work if i add it
[2013-10-09 16:39:57 -0400] mmzyk: yeah, node name isn't relevant to knife.
[2013-10-09 16:40:16 -0400] mmzyk: What is the full error you get on a chef-client run?
[2013-10-09 16:42:06 -0400] CPS: Chef encountered an error attempting to load the node data for "[nodename]"
[2013-10-09 16:42:24 -0400] CPS: Authentication Error: Failed to authenticate to the chef server (http 401)
[2013-10-09 16:43:02 -0400] CPS: Server Response: Failed to authenticate as '[nodename]'. Ensure that your node_name and client key are correct
[2013-10-09 16:43:15 -0400] mmzyk: well, that's not as helpful as I was hoping.
[2013-10-09 16:43:34 -0400] CPS: it lists relevant config fields which are correct near as i can tell
[2013-10-09 16:46:12 -0400] mmzyk: All right, I solicited some help internally here at opscode
[2013-10-09 16:46:15 -0400] mmzyk:  1.  is the clock on his windows machine synced properly  2.  Is his client.pem file in C:\chef.  if so he might want to just delete client.pem, and "knife client delete" the host to start over
[2013-10-09 16:46:20 -0400] CPS: it also says, "If these settings are correct, your client_key may be invalid" which isn't entirely helpful in addition to beinga  comma splice
[2013-10-09 16:46:20 -0400] mmzyk: I was told to check those things.
[2013-10-09 16:47:00 -0400] mmzyk: I forgot about the clock skew check - if your clock is too out of sync with the servers it will deny the request as it assumes it is an outside attack.
[2013-10-09 16:47:27 -0400] CPS: clock is waaaay off
[2013-10-09 16:47:34 -0400] mmzyk: We should add that to the docs too.
[2013-10-09 16:53:07 -0400] CPS: The request failed because your clock has drifted by more than 15 minutes
[2013-10-09 16:53:15 -0400] CPS: do i have to drop the node and re add it?
[2013-10-09 16:53:28 -0400] CPS: the clocks match now and it gave me that erro
[2013-10-09 16:55:46 -0400] mmzyk: Honestly, I don't know, but it might we worth it to try and get to a clean slate.
[2013-10-09 17:03:43 -0400] CPS: can't re-add node, complains about the clock
[2013-10-09 17:04:10 -0400] mmzyk: huh.
[2013-10-09 17:04:29 -0400] mmzyk: And the clocks are synced at this point?
[2013-10-09 17:06:08 -0400] CPS: they're roughly the same time
[2013-10-09 17:06:24 -0400] CPS: within seconds of each other
[2013-10-09 17:06:55 -0400] mmzyk: That shouldn't be a problem, although it clearly things they are off. Did you completely delete the node from the server and then try re-adding it?
[2013-10-09 17:07:07 -0400] mmzyk: s/things/thinks
[2013-10-09 17:07:32 -0400] CPS: deleted it from the webui
[2013-10-09 17:07:40 -0400] CPS: gah
[2013-10-09 17:07:42 -0400] CPS: timezones
[2013-10-09 17:07:56 -0400] CPS: the clocks reported the same time but in different timezones
[2013-10-09 17:07:57 -0400] mmzyk: :)
[2013-10-09 17:08:19 -0400] mmzyk: I can't fix that time is hard. I do stuff like that all the time myself.
[2013-10-09 17:08:53 -0400] CPS: https://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Common+Errors lists this error
[2013-10-09 17:08:58 -0400] CPS: maybe add in that bit
[2013-10-09 17:09:51 -0400] CPS: right back to where i was though, chef-client getting a 401
[2013-10-09 17:11:15 -0400] mmzyk: At this point I suggest you try recreating the keys and starting over with those.
[2013-10-09 17:12:16 -0400] CPS: knife config -i will do that, correct?
[2013-10-09 17:13:04 -0400] mmzyk: I don't know - I think in the webui you can regen the keys and it will give you a new key to put in place.
[2013-10-09 17:14:47 -0400] mmzyk: You could try going through learn chef and try to get setup using the starter kit: https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/workstation-setup/
[2013-10-09 17:15:08 -0400] mmzyk: although that assumes you're using hosted chef - but you're running your own server? or am I wrong on that?
[2013-10-09 17:15:19 -0400] CPS: copied the private key from the webui to the client pem file
[2013-10-09 17:15:24 -0400] CPS: i am running my own server
[2013-10-09 17:15:34 -0400] CPS: what happens to the public key part of it?
[2013-10-09 17:18:23 -0400] mmzyk: I think the server stores that locally.
[2013-10-09 17:22:29 -0400] mmzyk: CPS is it possible you copied pasted the org key over incorrectly?
[2013-10-09 17:23:27 -0400] CPS: for chef-validator.pem and validation.pem i copied the files over directly
[2013-10-09 17:23:52 -0400] CPS: for the client pem i copied the contents from the webui and pasted it into wordpad
[2013-10-09 17:25:36 -0400] mmzyk: You're using open source server right?
[2013-10-09 17:25:56 -0400] CPS: believe so
[2013-10-09 17:26:18 -0400] pigram86: i have a few questions runs with multiple reboots
[2013-10-09 17:26:54 -0400] CPS: just changed the line ending characters, that wasn't the issue
[2013-10-09 17:27:10 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: i'm trying to catch up with your 401 problem ... how did you create your client and node? with knife bootstrap?
[2013-10-09 17:27:25 -0400] CPS: no, i installed chef client on its own
[2013-10-09 17:27:48 -0400] CPS: i ran knife config -i on the client and created a client pem file
[2013-10-09 17:28:12 -0400] CPS: i ran knife node create to add the machine as a node
[2013-10-09 17:28:29 -0400] CPS: but i can't run chef-client because it 401s
[2013-10-09 17:28:31 -0400] pigram86: Can Chef handle multiple reboots within a single run on windows?
[2013-10-09 17:29:46 -0400] mmzyk: pigram86 That is likely a better question to ask in the #chef room.
[2013-10-09 17:30:27 -0400] mmzyk: There are more people there who can likely give you better feedback on how chef handles reboots on windows.
[2013-10-09 17:30:55 -0400] pigram86: oh ok. I am just starting out with chef. Thanks i will join that channel. 
[2013-10-09 17:31:24 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: what are your node_name and client_key set to in your knife.rb?
[2013-10-09 17:33:45 -0400] CPS: jsnapp: node_name is not set in knife.rb
[2013-10-09 17:34:05 -0400] CPS: client key is 'C:/chef-repo/.chef/[client].pem'
[2013-10-09 17:34:08 -0400] CPS: which exists
[2013-10-09 17:34:35 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: ok, look at the node page in the webui that exists for the node you created
[2013-10-09 17:34:48 -0400] CPS: it's there
[2013-10-09 17:35:07 -0400] jsnapp: there should be a permissions link .. click it
[2013-10-09 17:35:10 -0400] mmzyk: I'm going to let jsnapp take it from here. He's worked these kind of errors more than I have. :)
[2013-10-09 17:35:28 -0400] jsnapp: and tell me what clients have permissions to that particular node
[2013-10-09 17:35:30 -0400] CPS: jsnapp: i'm not on the opscode hosted server
[2013-10-09 17:35:43 -0400] CPS: no permissions link
[2013-10-09 17:35:52 -0400] jsnapp: oh right, sorry
[2013-10-09 17:36:39 -0400] jsnapp: one second while i recalibrate my thoughts
[2013-10-09 17:37:34 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: you mind telling me the node name?
[2013-10-09 17:38:01 -0400] CPS: m-dev-adschef01
[2013-10-09 17:42:21 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: mind trying the following?  knife exec -E 'api.put("nodes/m-dev-adschef01", api.get("nodes/m-dev-adschef01"))' -k 'c:/chef-repo/.chef/client.pem -u m-dev-adschef01
[2013-10-09 17:44:14 -0400] jsnapp: it will make a direct api request to retrieve the node data and then use that to update the node data .. i'm hoping that by specifying the api user name you won't get the 401 error
[2013-10-09 17:50:29 -0400] CPS: failed to authenticate
[2013-10-09 17:51:01 -0400] CPS: failed to authenticate to [server] as [node] with key [client.pem]
[2013-10-09 17:51:49 -0400] jsnapp: can you add -VV   two capital V's to the end to get debugging output .. is the GET receiving a 200 OK response?
[2013-10-09 17:53:32 -0400] CPS: i don't think it is
[2013-10-09 17:53:54 -0400] CPS: DEBUG: Sending HTTP Request via GET to [server]
[2013-10-09 17:53:59 -0400] CPS: DEBUG: ---- HTTP Status and Header Data: ---- DEBUG: HTTP 1.1 401 Unauthorized
[2013-10-09 17:56:48 -0400] CPS: any ideas?
[2013-10-09 17:57:43 -0400] jsnapp: yeah, a few ... it's failing GET requests for sure ..
[2013-10-09 17:58:30 -0400] jsnapp: knife client show m-dev-adschef01 doesn't error right?
[2013-10-09 17:59:37 -0400] CPS: m-dev-adschef01 is a node, not a client
[2013-10-09 17:59:50 -0400] CPS: so that command errors, object not found
[2013-10-09 18:00:44 -0400] jsnapp: but you need a client to make api requests for that node
[2013-10-09 18:01:02 -0400] CPS: the client is my username
[2013-10-09 18:01:36 -0400] jsnapp: then retry that knife exec command and use -u [yourusername] instead
[2013-10-09 18:02:33 -0400] CPS: looks like that went through ok
[2013-10-09 18:03:52 -0400] jsnapp: ok, let me explain things a bit
[2013-10-09 18:05:08 -0400] jsnapp: first, is the node you are running chef-client on your workstation where you will be running knife commands or a separate server?
[2013-10-09 18:06:01 -0400] CPS: same box
[2013-10-09 18:06:09 -0400] CPS: for now, anyway
[2013-10-09 18:06:16 -0400] jsnapp: ok ..
[2013-10-09 18:07:50 -0400] jsnapp: what directory is your client.rb file in?
[2013-10-09 18:11:11 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: typically you'd have a client.rb in c:\chef
[2013-10-09 18:11:54 -0400] jsnapp: and the validator.pem file would be in there too
[2013-10-09 18:12:20 -0400] jsnapp: you wouldn't normally manually create a client for the chef-client to use for its runs
[2013-10-09 18:13:54 -0400] jsnapp: you would just run chef-client and the first time it runs it will use the validator.pem file to create a client
[2013-10-09 18:14:04 -0400] jsnapp: a client.pem that is
[2013-10-09 18:17:00 -0400] jsnapp: also, your username client should be an admin client ... the method i just described would create a non-admin client specifically for your workstation
[2013-10-09 18:17:14 -0400] jsnapp: better for security that way
[2013-10-09 18:24:50 -0400] CPS: jsnapp: C:\chef contains client.rb and validation.pem
[2013-10-09 18:25:31 -0400] CPS: (not chef-validator.pem)
[2013-10-09 18:26:05 -0400] CPS: the client i'm using is tagged as an admin
[2013-10-09 18:51:38 -0400] CPS: did you see what i wrote jsnapp ?
[2013-10-09 18:52:23 -0400] jsnapp: yeah, sorry i dropped off for a bit
[2013-10-09 18:52:51 -0400] jsnapp: CPS:  the username client you created with knife configure -i should be an admin ... it's what you will use when running knife commands ... the client used by chef-client for a node's run typically should not be an admin client
[2013-10-09 18:53:19 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: do you have any other questions or are you all set now?
[2013-10-09 18:53:37 -0400] CPS: will chef client not work if the user is an admin?
[2013-10-09 18:54:08 -0400] CPS: if that's the case, how do i got about reverting chef-client to create a pem as it would on first run?
[2013-10-09 18:58:05 -0400] jsnapp: chef-client can use admin clients .. that's not the problem ... the problem is that chef-client is trying to use a client with the same name as your node but that client doesn't exist
[2013-10-09 18:59:00 -0400] CPS: how can i tell it to use another client?
[2013-10-09 19:02:56 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: good question, normally chef-client defaults would be sufficient to create a client.pem in C:\chef using the c:\chef\validation.pem
[2013-10-09 19:03:25 -0400] jsnapp: are you somehow telling chef-client to use a different client name and client.pem?
[2013-10-09 19:03:48 -0400] CPS: i'm running chef-client by itself
[2013-10-09 19:03:59 -0400] CPS: client.rb has client_key        "C:/chef-repo/.chef/chef-validator.pem" validation_key    "C:/chef/validation.pem" validation_client_name "chef-validator"
[2013-10-09 19:05:12 -0400] CPS: i think the initial run of chef-client created validation.pem
[2013-10-09 19:12:54 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: try commenting out client_key line and run chef-client
[2013-10-09 19:13:12 -0400] jsnapp: it should create a c:\chef\client.pem
[2013-10-09 19:13:52 -0400] jsnapp: and a m-dev-adschef01 client in your chef server
[2013-10-09 19:17:55 -0400] CPS:  ok, so i took out that line and ran chef-client, no dice
[2013-10-09 19:18:19 -0400] CPS: added a client using the node name in the webui and copied the private key as client.pem
[2013-10-09 19:18:22 -0400] CPS: that worked
[2013-10-09 19:19:45 -0400] CPS: man what a headache
[2013-10-09 19:19:49 -0400] CPS: thanks for all the help\
[2013-10-09 19:20:37 -0400] bean__: usually chef-client running the first time (ie. bootstrap) it should create the client and get the pem itself
[2013-10-09 19:20:45 -0400] jsnapp: no problem .. and sorry for the headache :)
[2013-10-09 19:21:22 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: do the contents of validation.pem match the contents of chef-validator.pem?
[2013-10-09 19:23:44 -0400] CPS: no they do not
[2013-10-09 19:25:45 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: you said you thought validation.pem was put there by chef-client .. did you create the client.rb file?
[2013-10-09 19:29:43 -0400] CPS: i don't think so. i must have just edited what was there
[2013-10-09 19:29:49 -0400] CPS: i had to add the server url
[2013-10-09 19:30:29 -0400] jsnapp: did you run 'knife bootstrap' on this machine then?  how did you install chef-client?  
[2013-10-09 19:30:59 -0400] CPS: i installed it from a package
[2013-10-09 19:31:02 -0400] CPS: not bootstrap
[2013-10-09 19:31:50 -0400] CPS: actually someone installed it for me
[2013-10-09 19:32:31 -0400] bean__: usually you want to bootstrap from your workstation
[2013-10-09 19:32:58 -0400] jsnapp: bean__ this is CPS's workstation
[2013-10-09 19:33:07 -0400] bean__: oh
[2013-10-09 19:33:08 -0400] bean__: lol
[2013-10-09 19:33:13 -0400] jsnapp: :)
[2013-10-09 19:33:36 -0400] CPS: p much
[2013-10-09 19:33:50 -0400] CPS: we're planning on migrating to linux but in the meantime
[2013-10-09 19:34:33 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: i just checked a windows box and c:\chef is empty after installing chef-client ... the chef-client itself is installed to c:\opscode
[2013-10-09 19:35:05 -0400] jsnapp: c:\chef is the default location for things like client.rb validation.pem client.pem etc
[2013-10-09 19:35:16 -0400] CPS: that's how mine looks
[2013-10-09 19:36:42 -0400] jsnapp: so whoever put validation.pem there might have done something wrong to it .. if you're willing to continue with me for the sake of completion i can determine what to replace validation.pem with pretty easily and we can test that it does what it should have done on the first chef-client run
[2013-10-09 19:37:37 -0400] CPS: i
[2013-10-09 19:37:46 -0400] CPS: i'll just rename it to _validation.pem
[2013-10-09 19:38:17 -0400] CPS: this may help someone in the future so let's go
[2013-10-09 19:38:27 -0400] jsnapp: cool ..
[2013-10-09 19:38:39 -0400] jsnapp: one sec
[2013-10-09 19:41:28 -0400] jsnapp: knife node list -u chef-validator -k 'c:/chef/_validation.pem'
[2013-10-09 19:41:40 -0400] jsnapp: knife node list -u chef-validator -k 'C:/chef-repo/.chef/chef-validator.pem'
[2013-10-09 19:42:01 -0400] jsnapp: i believe the second one should fail
[2013-10-09 19:42:18 -0400] jsnapp: do either of them work?
[2013-10-09 19:44:02 -0400] CPS: first fails
[2013-10-09 19:44:10 -0400] CPS: failed to authenticate
[2013-10-09 19:44:28 -0400] CPS: second fails, not authorized (authenticated successfully)
[2013-10-09 19:44:39 -0400] CPS: guess only admins can list nodes
[2013-10-09 19:46:06 -0400] jsnapp: ok, then a better test would be to replace the "node list" with "client create test"
[2013-10-09 19:46:32 -0400] CPS: the first one is still going to fail because it couldn't authenticate
[2013-10-09 19:46:42 -0400] jsnapp: right
[2013-10-09 19:46:48 -0400] jsnapp: does the second work though?
[2013-10-09 19:48:31 -0400] CPS: it does
[2013-10-09 19:48:40 -0400] CPS: ll
[2013-10-09 19:49:13 -0400] CPS: spits out the private ket
[2013-10-09 19:49:15 -0400] CPS: key*
[2013-10-09 19:49:54 -0400] jsnapp: ok, my suggestion would be to copy C:/chef-repo/.chef/chef-validator.pem to c:\chef\validation.pem 
[2013-10-09 19:50:37 -0400] CPS: what does that accomplish? just so i understand this
[2013-10-09 19:51:35 -0400] jsnapp: i'm not sure where the validation.pem file came from but it's supposed to match the chef-validator.pem
[2013-10-09 19:53:29 -0400] jsnapp: this all probably appears more complicated because you are testing on your workstation ... a typical node (server) wouldn't have a chef-repo/.chef/ directory it would just have a /etc/chef or c:\chef directory that the chef-client looks to for thinkgs
[2013-10-09 19:54:34 -0400] CPS: yeah
[2013-10-09 19:55:09 -0400] CPS: so we're going to use this to install MSI or other installers on windows boxes
[2013-10-09 19:55:16 -0400] jsnapp: chef-client defaults will use the validation.pem file which is the chef-validator client's private key to "bootstrap" things by creating a client and corresponding client.pem for the node to use when making API requests
[2013-10-09 19:55:36 -0400] CPS: my approach is going to be having the installers in a network location, stored in databag
[2013-10-09 19:55:44 -0400] CPS: and scripts to grab and run the installers
[2013-10-09 19:55:54 -0400] CPS: does that sound like a sound approach?
[2013-10-09 19:56:42 -0400] jsnapp: the .msi installer stored in a databag?
[2013-10-09 19:56:59 -0400] jsnapp: oh nevermind
[2013-10-09 19:57:06 -0400] jsnapp: wow, i might need sleep :)
[2013-10-09 19:57:32 -0400] CPS: but it's not even 4pm!
[2013-10-09 19:57:52 -0400] mmzyk: timezones. :)
[2013-10-09 19:58:08 -0400] jsnapp: yeah, but he's right ... somewhere :)
[2013-10-09 19:58:36 -0400] mmzyk: That approach sounds doable CPS, but it's also something you might ask in #chef. A lot more users of chef are in that room and might offer other ways of doing it.
[2013-10-09 19:58:46 -0400] CPS: ok
[2013-10-09 19:58:53 -0400] mmzyk: Not sure how many of them run chef on windows, but it's worth asking and see what response is given.
[2013-10-09 19:59:19 -0400] CPS: so i created a databag in the webui
[2013-10-09 19:59:38 -0400] CPS: but my workstation doesn't have anything on it
[2013-10-09 19:59:43 -0400] CPS: how do i pull that from the server?
[2013-10-09 20:00:18 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: have you finished the validation.pem work already .. i was hoping to test it
[2013-10-09 20:00:31 -0400] CPS: oh i copied it over
[2013-10-09 20:00:34 -0400] CPS: was there more?
[2013-10-09 20:01:21 -0400] jsnapp: yeah if you don't mind you can delete the m-dev-adschef01 client from the webui and the c:\chef\client.pem
[2013-10-09 20:01:37 -0400] jsnapp: then run chef-client again and see that it recreates them
[2013-10-09 20:01:41 -0400] jsnapp: then we'll be done
[2013-10-09 20:01:48 -0400] jsnapp: with that part i mean
[2013-10-09 20:02:43 -0400] CPS: ok, deleted client from the webui and renamed c:\chef\client.pem to _client.pem
[2013-10-09 20:03:00 -0400] CPS: not that it will be any good now :\
[2013-10-09 20:03:15 -0400] jsnapp: cool, run chef-client and they should be recreated by the validation.pem
[2013-10-09 20:03:29 -0400] CPS: ha
[2013-10-09 20:03:46 -0400] CPS: no errors, recreated client.pem and registered client with node name
[2013-10-09 20:03:53 -0400] jsnapp: awesome
[2013-10-09 20:04:04 -0400] jsnapp: that's the way it should have been done in the first place
[2013-10-09 20:04:06 -0400] CPS: no idea how this got so mucked up to start
[2013-10-09 20:04:22 -0400] jsnapp: well, now it's straightened out at least
[2013-10-09 20:06:06 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: if you want to keep data bag item content on your disk (recommended especially for version control) then create the file on disk and use 'knife data bag from file ...' to upload the contents to the server http://docs.opscode.com/knife_data_bag.html#from-file
[2013-10-09 20:12:23 -0400] jsnapp: CPS: it sounds like you're all set for now ... i'm going to drop out unless you have other related questions
[2013-10-09 20:12:46 -0400] CPS: yeah i'm good for now
[2013-10-09 20:12:52 -0400] CPS: thanks so much for your help
[2013-10-09 20:13:03 -0400] jsnapp: ok, no problem
