[2013-08-22 11:59:54 -0400] shredder12: since template resource is executed in the compilation phase, I came across a solution to run it in ruby_block using chef::resource object.

[2013-08-22 14:32:07 -0400] Crashthatch: So I've created a resource, and I'm trying to save the values with JSON.pretty_generate( new_resource ), but I get a whole bunch of other properties also being output: noop, before, provider, allowed_actions etc. How do I just get the fields I defined?
[2013-08-22 17:09:01 -0400] BlakeRG: anyone have an idea of why this is bombing even though the only thing i did was add the apache2 cookbook to my config? http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=UzHij81z
[2013-08-22 17:41:11 -0400] binamov: BlakeRG i'm guessing something to do with this line: STDERR: httpd: Could not open configuration file /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf: Permission denied
[2013-08-22 18:31:54 -0400] BlakeRG: i figured out my problem is SElinux
[2013-08-22 18:32:26 -0400] BlakeRG: i'm using the yum cookbook with vagrant but i can't quite figure out how to use it to add an additional repo or install packages
