[2013-08-28 12:00:01 -0400] cogocogo: No chef-server package for Ubuntu-13.04 (raring)?
[2013-08-28 14:36:28 -0400] gchristensen: I've used chef-client with chef-server for about 2 years now, but never chef-solo. is there a learnchef equivalent to chef-solo? this seems server-focused.
[2013-08-28 14:59:23 -0400] scarolan: No tutorial for chef solo.  You might like to check out chef zero though.  IT spins up an in-memory chef server for testing, pretty slick  https://github.com/jkeiser/chef-zero
[2013-08-28 14:59:38 -0400] gchristensen: in this case its just for setting up my local machine
[2013-08-28 14:59:51 -0400] gchristensen: honestly, I know chef pretty well, I'm just not finding the 5 second rundown on using solo
[2013-08-28 15:00:16 -0400] gchristensen: but also, chef-zero is a drea m:)
[2013-08-28 15:04:14 -0400] scarolan: gchristensen: Are you using knife-solo?  THat might make it a bit easier for you
[2013-08-28 15:08:10 -0400] gchristensen: I don't want to make it simpler, I'm confident it'll be within my grasp. I'm literally looking for "this is an example chef-solo repository, and how you may run the chef-solo command to converge your node"
[2013-08-28 15:38:33 -0400] scarolan: Yea, we don't have anything like that.  At least not yet.
[2013-08-28 15:39:00 -0400] gchristensen: got it, thank you
[2013-08-28 18:30:34 -0400] aemcknig: ohai
[2013-08-28 18:30:52 -0400] aemcknig: I'm new to this whole chef deal and I'm trying to write a LWRP and test it using chef-shell
[2013-08-28 18:31:42 -0400] aemcknig: I'm confident that my resource and provider are in the correct location (cookbooks/<recipe>/{resources,providers}/<lwrp>.rb)
[2013-08-28 18:31:53 -0400] aemcknig: (Okay, I'll spill - they're called "cupcake")
[2013-08-28 18:32:10 -0400] aemcknig: and I reference them in my recipe with <recipe>_cupcake
[2013-08-28 18:32:30 -0400] aemcknig: oh, shoot.  s/recipe/cookbook/ for the past couple of lines, I think
[2013-08-28 18:33:01 -0400] aemcknig: Anyway, I'm getting the error "NameError: Cannot find a resource for homedirs_cupcake on centos version 6.2"
[2013-08-28 18:33:18 -0400] aemcknig: and I think I've exhausted the relevant information on the internet
[2013-08-28 18:33:21 -0400] aemcknig: anybody able to help out?
[2013-08-28 18:34:10 -0400] shark: hi huys, im newbie to Chef, I have installed ruby and on chef install I am getting an error, plz help
[2013-08-28 18:34:45 -0400] aemcknig: shark: I also am completely new to Chef, but what's the error?
[2013-08-28 18:35:11 -0400] shark: aemcknig: could you PM me, please
[2013-08-28 18:35:19 -0400] shark: don't want to spam here
[2013-08-28 18:37:02 -0400] aemcknig: Well, having the error message will certainly help anybody who wants to help you out in here ;)
[2013-08-28 18:37:05 -0400] aemcknig: but sure
[2013-08-28 18:37:24 -0400] shark:  gem install chef ERROR:  Loading command: install (LoadError)     cannot load such file -- zlib ERROR:  While executing gem ... (NameError)     uninitialized constant Gem::Commands::InstallCommand
[2013-08-28 18:37:40 -0400] shark: after that I have installed zlib
[2013-08-28 18:37:46 -0400] shark: by apt-get install zlib
[2013-08-28 18:37:54 -0400] shark: but I knew it will be too simple
[2013-08-28 18:37:54 -0400] shark: ;)
