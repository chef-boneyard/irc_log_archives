[2013-08-26 12:49:32 -0400] nijk: Looking for some help running the chef starter kit on a centos 6.4 node
[2013-08-26 12:50:19 -0400] nijk: I got as far as converging the node (https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/converge/) but it keeps failing
[2013-08-26 12:50:47 -0400] nijk: It appears to be trying to use apt-get rather than yum as the package manager but not sure why
[2013-08-26 12:52:27 -0400] nijk: Can anyone offer some advice on the correct config?
[2013-08-26 12:56:01 -0400] nijk: blimey it's quiet in here
[2013-08-26 13:08:19 -0400] nijk: FYI: I've managed to converge a node running on CentOS 6.4. It would have been helpful if the docs had suggested alternative package manager cookbooks rather than assuming debian based nodes
[2013-08-26 14:39:09 -0400] a13x2121: nijk, i agree, i ran into this issue myself over the weekend
