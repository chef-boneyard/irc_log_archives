[2013-08-02 15:51:41 -0400] Preytell2: Morning all, I have looked over the site and I just cannot find the link to download the start kit. I know I saw it when I signed up, but I cannot find it again.
[2013-08-02 15:54:10 -0400] binamov: hi Preytell2, did you have an idea of what version of Chef you wanted to try?
[2013-08-02 15:57:18 -0400] Preytell2: current version is fine, I am new to chef all together. So I need to learn how to use knife etc.
[2013-08-02 15:57:54 -0400] Preytell2: if I have to downgrade later to support my clients needs I can, after I learn how to use it.
[2013-08-02 15:58:21 -0400] Preytell2: I am/was a puppet kind of guy.
[2013-08-02 15:58:30 -0400] binamov: excellent! Preytell2 you can start here https://learnchef.opscode.com/
[2013-08-02 15:59:44 -0400] Preytell2: yes, that's where I am, and step 2 is extract the starter kit tar file, which I cannot find.
[2013-08-02 16:00:40 -0400] Preytell2: I know when I first signed up for hosted chef there was a link to get the starter kit, but I can't find that link again.
[2013-08-02 17:00:50 -0400] binamov: Preytell2 still not found it?
[2013-08-02 17:21:56 -0400] Preytell2: nope
[2013-08-02 17:22:29 -0400] Preytell2: but I kind of gave up, so I haven't spent much time looking.
[2013-08-02 17:23:04 -0400] Preytell2: All the other pieces of the LearnChef document are clickable links to the info, why is this piece not?
