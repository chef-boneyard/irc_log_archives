[2013-08-29 03:23:37 -0400] zurapa: hi! do you know any wiki about chef?
[2013-08-29 07:40:31 -0400] ocholetras: hi!
[2013-08-29 07:40:37 -0400] ocholetras: anybody here?
[2013-08-29 07:57:14 -0400] fishGoM00: m00
[2013-08-29 08:19:40 -0400] ocholetras: Does "knife data bag create ..."command actually creates the directories and files under data_bag directory on my chef-repo?
[2013-08-29 08:19:49 -0400] ocholetras: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html --- > Says you can create it manually or using knife... talking about the files ..
[2013-08-29 08:20:29 -0400] ocholetras: i mean actually create the file under data_bag directory, but knife create data bag ... only creates the data bag on the chef server..
[2013-08-29 08:20:32 -0400] ocholetras: but not the json file
[2013-08-29 08:44:27 -0400] fishGoM00: afaik they are created on the server
[2013-08-29 08:45:00 -0400] fishGoM00: the directory in your chef\knife repo is for storing json version if you create from file
[2013-08-29 08:53:34 -0400] ocholetras: That is the behaviour
[2013-08-29 08:54:00 -0400] ocholetras: but in the docs for what i understand says knife create the file also O_o
[2013-08-29 08:54:17 -0400] ocholetras: So if i want to edit and commit, i have to do it manually and allways use "from file"
[2013-08-29 08:54:25 -0400] ocholetras: am i right
[2013-08-29 08:55:17 -0400] fishGoM00: So you can edit and keep your own json version of databags in the repo and use them like "knife data bag from file BAG_NAME ITEM_NAME.json"
[2013-08-29 08:55:38 -0400] fishGoM00: Or you can use knife to create them (and edit them) on the server directly
[2013-08-29 08:57:58 -0400] ocholetras: that part is missing on the docs ^^
[2013-08-29 08:58:06 -0400] ocholetras: "on the server directly"
[2013-08-29 08:58:48 -0400] ocholetras: is there any place where i can report or suggest changes on the docS?
[2013-08-29 09:02:47 -0400] fishGoM00: mmm there is a page somewhere... but I cannot find it atm
[2013-08-29 12:36:07 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: Guys I need some advice...
[2013-08-29 12:36:16 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: Is possible to do this?
[2013-08-29 12:36:23 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: I need to download a remote file
[2013-08-29 12:37:07 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: and place it in a directory but the dir could be not the same in another vm instance
[2013-08-29 12:37:12 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: how can I do this remote_file "<%=node['jboss']['jboss_home']%>standalone/deployments/opscode_chef_html_logo.png" do
[2013-08-29 12:37:37 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: I need chef to replace <%=node['jboss']['jboss_home']%> for the correct data
[2013-08-29 12:44:45 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: I've found it
[2013-08-29 13:28:37 -0400] aemcknig: Hey, #learnchef, anybody in here?  I need help figuring out how to write an LWRP
[2013-08-29 14:42:21 -0400] sroyal: Hi, I have an probleme with "knife client list" when I'm doing the quick start guide. There is a way to know if it because there is an issue on "chef" side or if I need to contact my techs guys to unlock a port?
[2013-08-29 14:47:48 -0400] fishGoM00: sroyal: what error are you getting
[2013-08-29 14:48:56 -0400] sroyal: ERROR: Network Error: Error connecting to https://api.opscode.com/organizations/sylvaintestingchef/clients - A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a  period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond. - connect(2) Check your knife configuration and network settings
[2013-08-29 14:52:06 -0400] fishGoM00: I would definately start with your network guys and the firewall first
[2013-08-29 14:52:23 -0400] sroyal: thanks
[2013-08-29 14:53:41 -0400] fishGoM00: 4000 iirc
[2013-08-29 14:59:00 -0400] sroyal: so you know how can I add a proxy to git?
[2013-08-29 15:05:00 -0400] fishGoM00: it will be somewhere in the knife.rb
[2013-08-29 15:05:01 -0400] fishGoM00: http://docs.opscode.com/config_rb_knife.html
[2013-08-29 15:05:14 -0400] fishGoM00: not something I've done before
[2013-08-29 15:23:16 -0400] sroyal: thanks
[2013-08-29 15:27:25 -0400] sroyal: thanks, it working now
[2013-08-29 15:32:32 -0400] fishGoM00: nw
[2013-08-29 17:03:37 -0400] sroyal: Hi, I got an issue when I tried to do "knife client list". I fixed it by setting my proxy to knife  "http://docs.opscode.com/config_rb_knife.html". I continue the quick start guide but now I got an network error with this command "knife cookbook upload --all" Do you know if I need to set my proxy somewhere else?
[2013-08-29 17:28:53 -0400] sroyal: fixed with  http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-2291?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:changehistory-tabpanel
[2013-08-29 18:08:56 -0400] sroyal: Hi, I got some issues because I'm behind a proxy. Now, my new issue is when I do the command "knife bootstrap localhost [...]". "failed: connection time out". The quickstart guide talk about proxy, then I tried "knife bootstrap localhost   --bootstrap-proxy http://MYPROXY.com:9999 --ssh-user vagrant [...]" stil failed to connect somebody think I need to do something else for this command
[2013-08-29 18:27:55 -0400] scarolan: sroyal: Does "knife client list" and "knife node list" work for you now?
[2013-08-29 18:30:43 -0400] sroyal: now, yes. I add to add my proxy into knife
[2013-08-29 18:30:49 -0400] sroyal: ..
[2013-08-29 18:30:57 -0400] sroyal: I hade to add
[2013-08-29 18:32:18 -0400] sroyal: I just tried to add "knife[:bootstrap_proxy]" into "knife.rb". still fail to connect
[2013-08-29 19:01:30 -0400] scarolan: sroyal: are you trying to bootstrap a Vagrant VM?  It sounds to me like the VM may be unable to get out to the internet.
[2013-08-29 19:01:46 -0400] scarolan: You might try spinning up a VM and testing it manually, see if it can reach the opscode API
[2013-08-29 19:03:03 -0400] a13x212: how do bootstrap remote servers without exposing you whole chef server to the world?
[2013-08-29 19:04:38 -0400] sroyal: In fact, I'm following the QuickStart Guide. I started a VM with "vagrant up --no-color". Works. Now, I try to "Bootstrap the virtual machine with knife". I don't know how to test manually.
[2013-08-29 19:08:32 -0400] scarolan: Run "vagrant ssh".  That will get you into a command prompt on the VM
[2013-08-29 19:08:45 -0400] scarolan: then from there try this:
[2013-08-29 19:08:52 -0400] scarolan: wget https://api.opscode.com
[2013-08-29 19:09:22 -0400] scarolan: If you get an error then the problem is network-related.  
[2013-08-29 19:11:42 -0400] sroyal: thanks, I tried : "failed: connection time out". I'm behind a proxy and it give headaque to configure... Now I need to understand how to configure my proxy there
[2013-08-29 19:13:08 -0400] scarolan: So it seems that your workstation is able to get through the proxy
[2013-08-29 19:13:10 -0400] scarolan: but the VM is not
[2013-08-29 19:13:26 -0400] scarolan: you'll need to ask your network admins what you need to do for that VM to reach out through the proxy
[2013-08-29 19:13:37 -0400] sroyal: Where is the VM? on amazon?
[2013-08-29 19:14:39 -0400] sroyal: I did not get this when I read to quick start guide. I started a VM but I don't know where I start it
[2013-08-29 19:14:43 -0400] scarolan: No, it's on your local machine!
[2013-08-29 19:14:55 -0400] scarolan: if you open up Virtualbox you'll see it there
[2013-08-29 19:15:18 -0400] sroyal: haaa yes thanks.
[2013-08-29 19:15:30 -0400] scarolan: You might try bootstrapping an Amazon instance instead if you have access to EC2; you can spin up micro instances for free
[2013-08-29 19:16:09 -0400] sroyal: we will use amazon, but I wanted to be able to complete the tutorial first
[2013-08-29 19:16:49 -0400] sroyal: I will re-read the quick start guide. At leat, now I know it's on my machine, maybe I miss something else, thanks
[2013-08-29 19:17:14 -0400] scarolan: Yep, you'll get it working.  Just make sure your Vagrant (VIrtualbox) VM can get to the internet first.
[2013-08-29 19:17:29 -0400] scarolan: Or find another machine on your local network to bootstrap if it gives you trouble
[2013-08-29 19:17:57 -0400] sroyal: thanks
[2013-08-29 19:22:45 -0400] sroyal: then, I want to use another machine (I have one) I can do "knife bootstrap OtherMachineIP"? I'm not suppose to run something on the other machine first?
[2013-08-29 19:37:02 -0400] scarolan: Nope, the bootstrapper is meant to run on a stock OS image, as long as it is a supported platform.  CentOS, Ubuntu, and Red Hat should all work
[2013-08-29 19:37:14 -0400] scarolan: you can even bootstrap windows, although there's a little more setup required
[2013-08-29 19:39:39 -0400] sroyal: there is an example somewhere how to bootstrap window. the quickstart seem only explain how to use a VM...
[2013-08-29 19:41:05 -0400] sroyal: I found documentation "Overview", I will start with that... thanks
