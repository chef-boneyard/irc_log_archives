[2013-08-31 13:57:55 -0400] ast__: Hi. I have a problem with nexus cookbook. I filled encrypted data bag nexus_ssl_files _wildcard and got binary "/etc/nginx/shared/certificates/nexus-proxy.crt" and "/etc/nginx/shared/certificates/nexus-proxy.key" files instead of normal certificate format on the client. I broke my head:)

[2013-08-31 22:47:42 -0400] wpietri: Hi! I'm working my way through "Test-Driven Infrastructure with Chef" and I'm stumped. In hosted Chef, should a node have permissions to write to itself? My chef-client run fails at the end when it tries to write state back, but I'm not sure if I should change the permissions or how chef-client is running.
