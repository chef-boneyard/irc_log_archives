[2013-08-15 15:10:55 -0400] Scotts_Lost: good morning from san francisco
[2013-08-15 15:12:55 -0400] Scotts_Lost: i'm a noob to chef and need to learn some (very sorry to say) basics + advanced concepts.....by yesterday, if not sooner.  someone have time to chat for a few minutes?
[2013-08-15 16:09:58 -0400] snipe: I have a noob question. On https://learnchef.opscode.com/common-use-cases/multi-node-ec2/, it says "Next, we need to drop configuration files for Redis" - but I don't know which file to add that to
[2013-08-15 16:10:06 -0400] snipe: same for the memcached bit below it
[2013-08-15 16:16:38 -0400] binamov: snipe looks like it's part of a recipe
[2013-08-15 16:17:24 -0400] binamov: snipe i'm guessing it's continuation of my_app/recipes/default.rb
[2013-08-15 16:17:42 -0400] snipe: binamov: thank you - I'll try that. Still trying to grok where everything lives
[2013-08-15 16:18:04 -0400] binamov: yeah pretty sure it's part of the same recipe
[2013-08-15 16:24:44 -0400] snipe: binamov: I *thought* so, but glad to have it confirmed - thanks!
[2013-08-15 16:24:59 -0400] binamov: snipe does it work?
[2013-08-15 16:25:57 -0400] snipe: binamov: I'll tell you when I get a chance to implement :) Crazy day at the office
[2013-08-15 18:41:30 -0400] rmichael: Why would attributes be duplicated in metadata.rb and attributes/default.rb?
[2013-08-15 19:21:17 -0400] artcurmudgeon: need an idea how to create a receipe that will change ENV used by RestClient on a specific node. When it tries to call RestClient to the chef-server it smacks into the proxy. I added the proxy in /etc/chef/client.rb
[2013-08-15 20:08:23 -0400] dhau_: how do you apply a template to windows client?
[2013-08-15 20:45:53 -0400] dhau_: nm, I answered my own question
[2013-08-15 22:04:50 -0400] artcurmudgeon: I have an issue with a node behind a proxy, I added to proxy to the client.rb, but chef-client fails when it tries hits a RestClient.get that tries to connect directly instead of through the proxy. I am looking at the client.rb.erb and seeing it make reference to the http_proxy, but I am not sure if this is the right file to update, and if so where?
[2013-08-15 22:07:16 -0400] artcurmudgeon: or better yet, how do i sent ENV['http_proxy']? 
[2013-08-15 22:08:49 -0400] pkwong: hi.
[2013-08-15 22:10:27 -0400] pkwong: does anyone know of a definitive working with Chef recipes for the windows environment resource I might be able to look at?
[2013-08-15 22:32:30 -0400] pkwong: can I use the remote_file resource with windows?
