[2013-08-08 06:49:29 -0400] pradeepto: if I am still using Chef 10 ( 10.4.4 ), where should I be looking for Chef DSL ruby docs? I can't seem to find it anywhere.
[2013-08-08 13:26:21 -0400] Zauberfisch: greetings chents
[2013-08-08 13:26:24 -0400] Zauberfisch: *gents
[2013-08-08 13:26:36 -0400] Zauberfisch: been going through the basic getting started guide
[2013-08-08 13:26:41 -0400] Zauberfisch: but hit a couple of road blocks
[2013-08-08 13:27:10 -0400] Zauberfisch: which all of them I belive are errors in the docs rather than my mistakes
[2013-08-08 13:27:47 -0400] Zauberfisch: 1) networking_basic (cookbook) has a README.md, but chef validates for a README.textile
[2013-08-08 13:28:05 -0400] Zauberfisch: causing the error ERROR: Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - ...../networking_basic/README.textile
[2013-08-08 13:29:40 -0400] Zauberfisch: the contact page states I can report such issues here as well, should that be wrong as well please feel free to inrerrupt me and direct me to a bugtracker
[2013-08-08 13:30:12 -0400] Zauberfisch: 2) vagrant init will fail because the starter kit already includes a vagrant file and vagrant does not init if you already have that file
[2013-08-08 13:31:01 -0400] Zauberfisch: 3) knife bootstrap - will fail because the "apt" cookbook uses an undefined variable called "use_inline_resources" and the whole bootstrap dies
[2013-08-08 13:31:34 -0400] Zauberfisch: I can provide a detailed error message and trace on request
[2013-08-08 13:33:03 -0400] Zauberfisch: (note: I fixed it in my local setup and have it working now, but someone should fix the docs and/or the cookbooks suggested in the docs)
[2013-08-08 17:11:12 -0400] sanguisdex: how do I uses authorized_keys for a users data_bag?
[2013-08-08 18:28:31 -0400] brumschlag: I'm need to write a custom Provider for the file resource. How would I go about doing this?
[2013-08-08 23:23:44 -0400] yoshie902a: Can someone point me to a resource that explains the cookbook structure?
