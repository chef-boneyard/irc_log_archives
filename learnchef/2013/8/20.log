[2013-08-20 10:50:47 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: Someone can help me to how to use a recipe
[2013-08-20 10:51:00 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: I would like to use this http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/jboss
[2013-08-20 11:20:17 -0400] anu_: I am looking for how to use ruby_block resource to utilize a certain username//password instead when pulling files from artifactory..  can anyone help
[2013-08-20 11:33:59 -0400] perryofpeek: @anu_ , I can try but I am not sure what you are trying to do?
[2013-08-20 11:35:24 -0400] perryofpeek: @Breaking_Pitt , where have you got up to so far?
[2013-08-20 11:38:02 -0400] anu_: @perryofpeek, I am trying to download some files from remote server with username/password authentication i.e https://server_ip
[2013-08-20 11:38:46 -0400] perryofpeek: @aun on the box you are trying to converge (do the chef run) can you telnet to port 443? (https)?
[2013-08-20 11:38:48 -0400] anu_: @perryofpeek. tried using remote_file with https://username:password@serveripaddress/artifactory. but authentication doesn't works
[2013-08-20 11:39:18 -0400] anu_: nopes telnet gives connection timeout and so is wget 
[2013-08-20 11:40:00 -0400] perryofpeek: @anu , I think that's your problem right there. Firewwall? proxy server? 
[2013-08-20 11:40:53 -0400] anu_: looks like its firewall
[2013-08-20 11:41:36 -0400] anu_: @perryofpeek, just wanted to know does remote_file with https works?
[2013-08-20 11:51:42 -0400] anu_: is there any other way to pull the files from artifactory in chef
[2013-08-20 11:52:44 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: perryofpeek Just a question If I want to change something of this recipe I have to change it in attributes/default.rb
[2013-08-20 11:57:32 -0400] perryofpeek: @ anu, Breaking_pitt - just in a meeting , gimme 10
[2013-08-20 11:57:46 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: perryofpeek sure!
[2013-08-20 12:02:01 -0400] perryofpeek: @breaking_pitt , you can chaneg the attributes directly 
[2013-08-20 12:02:54 -0400] perryofpeek: or you can , create your own cookbook , and override the attributes , or you can override the attributes in a couple of other ways
[2013-08-20 12:03:47 -0400] perryofpeek: I personally prefere to create a wrapper cookbook , which has any local customisations, then use include_recipe , to call the recipe in the jboss cookbook 
[2013-08-20 12:04:44 -0400] perryofpeek: then when any modifications are made to the jboss cookbook , you can just pull them , with no git merge issues, and it provides a place to any any other additional code you want to write around jboos 
[2013-08-20 12:05:17 -0400] perryofpeek: @anu, not sure about https with remote_file, I don't see why it should not work, I will try this out myself. 
[2013-08-20 12:09:49 -0400] anu_: @perryofpeek, thanks
[2013-08-20 12:49:53 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: I'm getting this error FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::ChildConvergeError: Chef run process exited unsuccessfully (exit code 1 where I can find more info perryofpeek 
[2013-08-20 12:50:20 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: is there any other log different than stdout
[2013-08-20 12:50:30 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: because I can't find info...
[2013-08-20 13:26:22 -0400] perryofpeek: @Breaking_Pitt , you can set your logging to debug
[2013-08-20 13:27:11 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: perryofpeek I'm using chef-solo why this is asking me for a client.pem file?
[2013-08-20 13:27:19 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: this is driving me insane
[2013-08-20 13:30:52 -0400] perryofpeek: @Breaking_Pitt, I appreciate the learning curve, worth it in the end. can you show me some of your output and the command line for chef-solo
[2013-08-20 13:31:08 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: sure
[2013-08-20 13:35:50 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: Seems that today is monday. everything works bad today
[2013-08-20 13:37:43 -0400] Pac: hi there
[2013-08-20 13:37:50 -0400] Pac: i need help about this page : https://learnchef.opscode.com/starter-use-cases/multi-node-ec2/
[2013-08-20 13:38:25 -0400] Pac: "Next, add a Gemfile"  => is this a file named "Gemfile" to put in ~/chef-repo ?
[2013-08-20 13:38:52 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: perryofpeek pastebin.com/PVJBT8LM
[2013-08-20 13:40:52 -0400] perryofpeek: @Breaking_pitt, is your cookbook calling search?
[2013-08-20 13:41:27 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: it's the jboss cookbook looking the code seems that it is
[2013-08-20 13:41:48 -0400] perryofpeek: @Breaking_pitt http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13548534/chef-solo-chefexceptionsprivatekeymissing
[2013-08-20 13:42:01 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: let me check
[2013-08-20 13:42:12 -0400] Pac: i tried creating a file named Gemfile and then running the bundle command. It's stuck after outputing twice "Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/.."
[2013-08-20 13:42:28 -0400] perryofpeek: which basically points you too https://github.com/edelight/chef-solo-search
[2013-08-20 13:42:41 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: perryofpeek not able to install it..
[2013-08-20 13:42:43 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: :(
[2013-08-20 13:42:49 -0400] Breaking_Pitt: i've tried before
[2013-08-20 13:43:10 -0400] perryofpeek: and the yakk shaving begins. 
[2013-08-20 13:44:42 -0400] perryofpeek: @Pac do you have a http proxy server in the way ? can you telnet rubygems.orc 443? 
[2013-08-20 13:45:26 -0400] Pac: i'm in an EC2 VPC , everything should be opened. Telnet is ok
[2013-08-20 13:46:08 -0400] Pac: ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-59:~/chef-repo$ bundle install --path vendor Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/........ Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/..
[2013-08-20 13:46:20 -0400] Pac: the fetching seems ok and fast. then nothing
[2013-08-20 13:46:39 -0400] perryofpeek: @Pac --verbose ?
[2013-08-20 13:47:01 -0400] perryofpeek: @Breaking_Pitt what issue did you face with the chef-solo-search?
[2013-08-20 13:48:45 -0400] Pac: very verbose indeed. "End" before being stuck is there http://pastebin.com/4fv8JtQd
[2013-08-20 13:49:18 -0400] Pac: i see this  :  Unmet Dependencies: ["rubiii-apricoteatsgorilla", "tenderlove-frex", "spicycode-rcov"]
[2013-08-20 13:51:55 -0400] Pac: google gives me this only result (same pb) :  https://gist.github.com/hh/4666847/raw/1296aad7a977098850500c2d0b70b0e738b0eac0/Z1_berks%2Bvagrant-windows.mkd
[2013-08-20 13:54:06 -0400] perryofpeek: @Pac have a look at the "Easier technique" bit http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9467756/bundler-when-attempting-to-update-or-install-will-hang-forever
[2013-08-20 14:04:48 -0400] Pac: perry  : am i doing something wrong  (i never used ruby) ? maybe the file "Gemfile" ? or is this a problem for everybody ?
[2013-08-20 14:07:07 -0400] perryofpeek: @Pac this is not usually a problem for people, but this is computers right! :)
[2013-08-20 14:07:47 -0400] perryofpeek: @Pac , what is your OS? ruby version? and what does the Gem file look like?
[2013-08-20 14:08:08 -0400] perryofpeek: @Pac  what user are you  running this as?
[2013-08-20 14:08:45 -0400] perryofpeek: @Pac also maybe ask in the #Chef channel 
[2013-08-20 14:09:30 -0400] Pac: the file 'Gemfile' contains     source 'https://rubygems.org'  gem 'berkshelf' gem 'chef' gem 'knife-ec2'  
[2013-08-20 14:09:53 -0400] Pac: sorry for display, same contains as in the url https://learnchef.opscode.com/starter-use-cases/multi-node-ec2/
[2013-08-20 14:10:01 -0400] Pac: filename is ok ?
[2013-08-20 14:13:03 -0400] perryofpeek: yeah "G"emfile 
[2013-08-20 14:13:34 -0400] Pac: in ~/chef-repo
[2013-08-20 14:16:19 -0400] Pac: os is ubuntu 12.04.2,  ruby 1.9.3p429 
[2013-08-20 14:36:05 -0400] Pac: for the record, it seems that pb was coming from there : http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html
[2013-08-20 15:54:28 -0400] pkwong: good morning all.. just a quick question.. I'd like to list all the nodes without a role.  I assume I would use the knife search node "role:" command, but I can't figure out what to put in to represent null.
[2013-08-20 16:17:41 -0400] fishGoM00: Good question pkwong
[2013-08-20 16:18:07 -0400] fishGoM00: can't suggest anything that is useful in a recipe, but this might help to manually look at things
[2013-08-20 16:18:13 -0400] fishGoM00: knife search node "chef_environment:Development AND NOT role:Web-Server" -a roles
[2013-08-20 16:18:48 -0400] fishGoM00: go through your environments\roles like this to see if any have missing role attributes
[2013-08-20 17:12:18 -0400] pkwong: hi fishGoM00.  Yeah, I ended up doing just that :)
[2013-08-20 17:13:23 -0400] pkwong: it would be helpful to add a flag / command to knife that would allow a user to clients and nodes without a runlist. 
[2013-08-20 17:14:18 -0400] pkwong: I'm working through how to re-apply a role to a bootstrap that failed.  The client is registered, but the runlist is empty.  So "re-bootstrapping" isn't really an option.
[2013-08-20 17:17:51 -0400] pkwong: I know I can just add a role.. It's doing it programatically that's the *fun* part.
[2013-08-20 20:06:12 -0400] perfectsine: Is there a bug with node overrides?  I'm trying to override an attribute file default but the variable keeps returning the attribute file's data
[2013-08-20 20:25:57 -0400] jimboy: Hey guys  Im trying to set some attributes via a role or environment to disable ohai plugins. The format is as follows: [:disabled_plugins] = ["aplugin, moreplugin]    Im not sure how to do this in  json though 
[2013-08-20 20:58:44 -0400] droy: hi all
[2013-08-20 20:59:32 -0400] droy: i had played with Chef a while ago but never really took it too far.  I'm starting again and would like a clean environment.  what is the best way to clear out any already-configured chef details from my mac?
[2013-08-20 20:59:39 -0400] droy: delete the ~/.chef folder?
