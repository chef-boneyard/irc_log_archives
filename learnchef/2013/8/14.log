[2013-08-14 09:39:33 -0400] tugce: When using knife configure --initial, which keys we should refer?
[2013-08-14 14:00:48 -0400] artcurmudgeon: anyone ever setup a node behind a proxy?
[2013-08-14 14:06:45 -0400] nathenharvey: artcurmudgeon: have you set-up the proxy settings in your knife.rb / client.rb?  http://docs.opscode.com/config_rb_knife.html & http://docs.opscode.com/config_rb_client.html
[2013-08-14 14:18:41 -0400] artcurmudgeon: I put the proxy in the client.rb
[2013-08-14 14:19:44 -0400] artcurmudgeon: does the knife.rb reside on the node?
[2013-08-14 14:33:37 -0400] nathenharvey: no.  knife.rb is on your workstation
[2013-08-14 14:33:42 -0400] nathenharvey: client.rb is on the node
[2013-08-14 14:34:02 -0400] nathenharvey: when bootstrapping (knife node bootstrap) the knife settings are used to write the client.rb
[2013-08-14 14:41:03 -0400] artcurmudgeon: the node was prebuilt and then sent to site, once there I added the proxy to the client.rb and when I ran chef-client it connected(watched it on a cisco asa) but suddenly it tried to connect to out chef server on a port in the 40000 range and when it couldnt connect the chef-client failed
[2013-08-14 14:44:19 -0400] artcurmudgeon: oddly enough I had removed the client.pem and removed from the chef server using knife and it did connect long enough to download client.pem
[2013-08-14 19:42:05 -0400] disposable: i've just started with the quickstart tutorial and already the first step in the chef-repo is failing. is the error on line 27 important? http://pastebin.com/GwqJHq26

[2013-08-14 20:12:48 -0400] snipe: disposable: Rename the README.md to README.textile
[2013-08-14 20:14:26 -0400] snipe: disposable: I feel like I read that someone fixed that on GH, but I had the same problem. Renaming it in my local repo and committing that change worked
[2013-08-14 20:54:40 -0400] snipe: Is the learnchef documentation on GH? I'd like to submit a pull request for this page: https://learnchef.opscode.com/common-use-cases/multi-node-ec2/ - the Berksfile doesn't get created by installing them gem, you have to create it. 
[2013-08-14 20:54:56 -0400] snipe: The sentence is "Open the Berksfile at the root of your chef-repo and add the following (delete or comment any existing content)" which makes it sound like it will be created for you
[2013-08-14 21:31:07 -0400] disposable: snipe: thank you
[2013-08-14 21:31:31 -0400] snipe: disposable: did that work for you?
[2013-08-14 21:37:36 -0400] disposable: snipe: not sure - http://pastebin.com/r31kDex9 - as i don't know what output to expect
[2013-08-14 21:39:37 -0400] snipe: did you try running knife cookbook site install networking_basic again?
[2013-08-14 23:41:13 -0400] pk___: hello everyone currently I'm using the motd-tail cookbook and when i ssh into a box i can see what role and recipe it have. Is there something I can do for the windows side? does chef log what role and recipe are applied
