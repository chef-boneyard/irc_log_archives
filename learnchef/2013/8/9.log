[2013-08-09 00:58:02 -0400] RonaldP: I am setting up private chef, is it a bad idea to use chef to manage my private-chef.rb file on my chef cluster?
[2013-08-09 01:05:09 -0400] binamov: RonaldP you mean like with a cookbook file resource or something?
[2013-08-09 01:05:29 -0400] RonaldP: yeah
[2013-08-09 01:06:02 -0400] RonaldP: I'm in an experimentation phase right now, and so every time I make a change, I have to push it to all the servers
[2013-08-09 01:06:28 -0400] RonaldP: I expect I will use knife-ssh to handle the reconfigure
[2013-08-09 01:08:19 -0400] binamov: i honestly never set up an HA environment, but if it's just a config file (no secrets) then maybe use a template resource instead?
[2013-08-09 01:10:13 -0400] binamov: maybe with a notification to an execute resource that does reconfigure ?
[2013-08-09 01:10:20 -0400] RonaldP: I'm just digging into things, I just want to be able to update one thing, and have it happen everywhere. Each server gets the same config file, they read it, and figure out there roles from being listed in it
[2013-08-09 01:11:14 -0400] binamov: right. for config files typically you'd use template resources. that way you can dynamically create configs from data sources like attributes or data bags
[2013-08-09 01:11:30 -0400] RonaldP: so I need to push the same file to all of them, and then run reconfigure (that, I will use knife-ssh for, as I want them to make the change in as short a window as possible)
[2013-08-09 01:12:29 -0400] RonaldP: longer term, template resources seems like the right path (so when I add a new front end server, it is automatically added to the config, etc), but for today, a simple file is fine
[2013-08-09 01:12:50 -0400] RonaldP: mostly, I just want to make sure that running chef client on a chef server isn't a bad thing
[2013-08-09 01:13:11 -0400] binamov: yeah, then cookbook file resource and it notifies an execute resource to do reconfigure; knife ssh to run chef-client
[2013-08-09 01:15:27 -0400] binamov: RonaldP does that make sense?
[2013-08-09 01:16:21 -0400] RonaldP: yeah, it seems like the obvious thing to do, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything
[2013-08-09 01:16:29 -0400] binamov: the "whether it's a bad thing" really depends on what you put in the config file, so i say test the config file first :)
[2013-08-09 01:18:05 -0400] binamov: right. also, the execute resource, specify an action of :nothing; so it doesn't run on every chef-client run, but only when notified; i bet there's a more elegant way to do reconfigure than an execute resource
[2013-08-09 01:22:28 -0400] RonaldP: for this, I need all servers in the cluster to run reconfigure at the same time, so I'll use knife-ssh, or, longer term, perhaps pushy
[2013-08-09 01:22:59 -0400] binamov: make it an execute resource and use knife-ssh to just run sudo chef-client
[2013-08-09 01:23:53 -0400] binamov: i.e. trigger a client run
[2013-08-09 01:24:44 -0400] binamov: this way if some server is down, when it comes up it will autoreconfigure
[2013-08-09 01:36:11 -0400] RonaldP: thanks, time to head home
[2013-08-09 01:37:02 -0400] binamov: good luck!
[2013-08-09 11:26:10 -0400] VictorLin: Hi, the guide told me to download the starter kit, but where is it?
[2013-08-09 11:26:34 -0400] VictorLin: Why not just add a link to the `Starter Kit` in the guid?
[2013-08-09 11:50:18 -0400] Zauberfisch: VictorLin: I am just getting started with chef as well
[2013-08-09 11:51:36 -0400] Zauberfisch: but I think its because the files get customized for you
[2013-08-09 11:51:55 -0400] Zauberfisch: like it includes the .pem file that allows you to connect to the chef server with your user without login
[2013-08-09 11:52:43 -0400] Zauberfisch: VictorLin: you can find the download for it here:
[2013-08-09 11:52:45 -0400] Zauberfisch: https://preview.opscode.com/organizations
[2013-08-09 11:53:11 -0400] Zauberfisch: select the organisation from the list
[2013-08-09 11:53:24 -0400] Zauberfisch: and then on the left there is a link in the sidebar that says "Starter Kit"
[2013-08-09 12:00:04 -0400] VictorLin: Got it
[2013-08-09 12:00:06 -0400] VictorLin: thank you
[2013-08-09 12:00:30 -0400] VictorLin: No wonder I cannot find it even by google whole the Internet
[2013-08-09 12:40:24 -0400] mswinson: does anyone know if there is an ami plugin for knife ec2 for centos?
[2013-08-09 17:39:11 -0400] gpatmore: hi all
[2013-08-09 17:40:39 -0400] gpatmore: wondering about attrib file syntax.  is there any reason I need to add attribs one at a time, or can I wrap in default[:myhash] = { :prop1 => 1, :prop2 => 2 }
[2013-08-09 17:41:23 -0400] gpatmore: or any vulnerability to using such a syntax?
[2013-08-09 21:37:56 -0400] mrdnk: Hello, need help running through the tutorial
