[2013-08-06 20:16:23 -0400] zirpu: so i have a laptop w/ chef-server 11.0.8 install via deb package (ubuntu 12.04).  i'm trying to upload a new cookbook to it from my workstation.  it keeps failing trying to upload to https://ubuntu:443/...  
[2013-08-06 20:16:29 -0400] zirpu: anyone else seen this problem?
[2013-08-06 20:16:39 -0400] zirpu: it's a macbook running vagrant and virtualbox.
[2013-08-06 20:16:56 -0400] zirpu: ubuntu is not in /etc/hosts on laptop or the vm where the chef-server is running.
[2013-08-06 20:35:18 -0400] zirpu: the laptop is a macbook. the chef-server is installed in a virtualbox 4.2.16 VM running ubuntu 12.04 (x86_64).
[2013-08-06 20:35:52 -0400] zirpu: 'knife cookbook upload -o cookbooks new-book'  should just upload to the chef_server_url listed in $HOME/.chef/knife.rb  right?
[2013-08-06 20:54:16 -0400] zirpu: hrm. i think it's because i change the hostname after installing chef-server. bah
[2013-08-06 21:01:08 -0400] zirpu: yep. that and doing 'chef-server-ctl reconfigure' to regenerate the ssl server key.
[2013-08-06 21:01:36 -0400] zirpu: glad y'all are here to let me figure things out. :-)
