[2013-08-13 01:11:19 -0400] litch: Hi all - I have a question.  I've been setting up a chef deployment all day, and have my two boxes up and running on ec2 (an instance running mysql, and one acting as an app server).  I need to run some rake tasks on my app server, but it seems there's no ruby installed for the 'ubuntu' user that I set up and connect as.  How should I go about getting set up to run rake tasks on the server?

[2013-08-13 09:43:03 -0400] sparr: I've downloaded a cookbook via git from the opscode repository. How can I put that cookbook in my local chef repo/path so that knife can see it?
[2013-08-13 09:58:09 -0400] Hildgrim: Any way to check if a file system is mounted with mount "/foo" do; not_if ?
[2013-08-13 09:58:19 -0400] Hildgrim: googling gives me nada
[2013-08-13 10:04:27 -0400] sparr: there will be a node attribute for mounted filesystems
[2013-08-13 10:04:37 -0400] sparr: I don't know how to use that info, but I'm pretty sure that's what you want
[2013-08-13 10:08:26 -0400] Zauberfisch: q
[2013-08-13 10:08:48 -0400] Zauberfisch: misstell
[2013-08-13 10:22:32 -0400] sparr: the problem is that there's an attribute for each filesystem identified by its device, and what you want is the mount point, which is below each of those
[2013-08-13 11:16:33 -0400] sparr: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_ifconfig.html seems to specify attributes that https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/provider/ifconfig.rb doesn't implement
[2013-08-13 11:16:46 -0400] sparr: particularly bootproto, am I missing something?
[2013-08-13 11:23:53 -0400] tugce: sparr, I think bootproto is in lib/chef/resource/ifconfig.rb 
[2013-08-13 11:24:56 -0400] sparr: oh
[2013-08-13 11:34:39 -0400] sparr: it doesn't seem to support dhcp-configured interfaces
[2013-08-13 11:34:40 -0400] sparr: :(
[2013-08-13 12:31:03 -0400] tugce: Last 2 days I've been trying to install Chef / Chef-Server on Debian Squeeze. Yet no matter how much I try chef just doesnt work. Does chef installation problematic or do I suck?
[2013-08-13 12:31:56 -0400] tugce: For my internship our company will switch from puppet to chef and I'll be the one who convert puppet classes into chef cookbooks. Bur I can't start it because I don't have an chef enviroment to try cookbooks I write
[2013-08-13 12:32:07 -0400] tugce: I'd really appreciate any help
[2013-08-13 13:20:41 -0400] sparr: tugce: it would help a lot if you describe how far you've gotten. what tutorial / guide / instructions are you using, and what step fails to work as expected?
[2013-08-13 13:23:00 -0400] tugce: well i tried to install and run it. when i tried to install it via apt-get , dpkg -i, gems, omnibus there is always a problem about some missing files, package mismatch, configuration problems
[2013-08-13 13:50:40 -0400] sparr: well, pick one
[2013-08-13 13:50:46 -0400] sparr: proceed until you encounter a problem
[2013-08-13 13:50:49 -0400] sparr: then tell us the specific problem
[2013-08-13 15:07:57 -0400] clrmg: I'm troubleshooting my chef workstation setup, and I have a problem with rbenv. I'm missing a file called "rbenv.bash", wondering how I would create this file or what I might have missed?
[2013-08-13 15:49:09 -0400] sanguisdex: is there a cook book that will create users I have been trying "users" but it does not seem to include my data bags
[2013-08-13 16:59:28 -0400] sanguisdex: where and how do I access data bags when creating a server
[2013-08-13 17:00:44 -0400] sanguisdex: s/creating/boostrapping/
[2013-08-13 17:11:01 -0400] sparr: sanguisdex: I think you can simply reference them in recipes being run on the node, since it will contact the chef server as part of the process. but I'm new, so I could be wrong
[2013-08-13 17:13:07 -0400] sanguisdex: sparr: I I am using the users cookbook/recipe but no users are created when boot strapping happens.
[2013-08-13 17:13:36 -0400] sparr: and it expects to find a data bag full of user info?
[2013-08-13 20:29:18 -0400] gpatmore: hello all.  Im getting a NameError on tagged? function inside a provider action block.  any ideas why/how to fix?
[2013-08-13 20:29:59 -0400] gpatmore: NameError: Cannot find a resource for tagged?
[2013-08-13 20:54:21 -0400] johnnydtan: this page says "download the Starter Kit"  where can one find that? or, what is in there that we can just re-create on our own?
[2013-08-13 20:54:23 -0400] johnnydtan: https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/chef-repo/
[2013-08-13 20:58:57 -0400] johnnydtan: for reference, you go to your organization, then click on your org, then Starter Kit un-greys on the left side
[2013-08-13 21:00:33 -0400] MrWalrus: It's just a github repo (https://github.com/opscode/chef-repo), so you can always just clone it with git.
[2013-08-13 21:02:55 -0400] johnnydtan: perfect, thank you  that's easier actually since it wont require user/org keys to get reset
