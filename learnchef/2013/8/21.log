[2013-08-21 06:32:19 -0400] zerOnepal: hi everOne, I am having trouble installing chef with Arch Linux. Any help plez, What is the difference if I use the chef gem ?
[2013-08-21 06:33:11 -0400] zerOnepal: https://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh doesn't contain any thing about my os type

[2013-08-21 09:18:19 -0400] vaders: HI, I am a bit confused about configuring different environments like dev, uat & prod. Reading a lot of articles on how not to uses roles in authoring cookbooks but is it right to use roles when setting up different environments?
[2013-08-21 09:41:24 -0400] fishGoM00: I do, my roles are for types of machine... and those roles are then in each environment for dev, staging and production
[2013-08-21 10:30:31 -0400] vaders: fishGoM00 > thanks - when you run chef, how do you tell it to use a particular environment? Say DEV
[2013-08-21 11:03:07 -0400] a_c_m__: so, trying to do some "code" block execution, but trying to be good and use attributes
[2013-08-21 11:03:14 -0400] a_c_m__: wondering how to do that?

[2013-08-21 11:14:03 -0400] fishGoM00: vaders: I use chef server and each of the nodes can be in an environment eg. dev
[2013-08-21 11:14:57 -0400] fishGoM00: I then use roles to specify what the dev node should be running eg. apache etc
[2013-08-21 11:17:45 -0400] vaders: Thanks, I am probably going to have to take a step back and go through the docs again. My problem is that i can see how to define the roles and the environments but for the life of me I can't see how to use them. I must have a fundamental misunderstand of how it all fits together 
[2013-08-21 11:47:48 -0400] fishGoM00: to get an understanding I would recommend adding a cookbook for software you are familiar with eg. apache
[2013-08-21 11:48:07 -0400] fishGoM00: on your 'web-server' role add the apache cookbook
[2013-08-21 11:48:38 -0400] fishGoM00: the look in the cookbook->attributes->default file and you will see all the attributes you can use to configure apache
[2013-08-21 11:49:03 -0400] fishGoM00: configuring it a question of 'overriding' those attributes
[2013-08-21 11:49:19 -0400] fishGoM00: which you can do on a role/node/env basis
[2013-08-21 13:15:15 -0400] dokeefe: greetings - I posted this in #chef, this seems like a better place for it perhaps.  I am having issue trying to configure chef client; receive 'ERROR: Errno::ECONNRESET: Connection reset by peer - SSL_connect' after entering password for API user
[2013-08-21 20:21:19 -0400] perfectsine: I'm having a problem with my not_if statements being resolved consistently.  On initial deploy they resolve with false and redeploy my scripts, after some time they will start work though.  Has anyone seen that before?  Ubuntu 12.04 and Chef 11.4.4
[2013-08-21 20:23:24 -0400] pkboyz: Hello, I can't find documentation on how to config snmp setting for windows.
[2013-08-21 20:23:31 -0400] pkboyz: anyone know where i can find it
[2013-08-21 20:27:03 -0400] UForgotten: pkboyz: for win2k3 http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc759570(v=ws.10).aspx  - look through technet for further info on other windows OS'es for the native SNMP service, or use a third party snmp server like http://sourceforge.net/projects/net-snmp/
[2013-08-21 20:28:09 -0400] pkboyz: I want to be clear, I want chef the snmp setting for windows is this even possible ?
[2013-08-21 20:29:04 -0400] UForgotten: this is not clear. If you want to use chef to install the service maybe, not sure what else you would use chef for regarding snmp.
[2013-08-21 20:30:39 -0400] pkboyz: what I want to do is to have chef set up the community name and trap destinations
[2013-08-21 20:31:26 -0400] UForgotten: then you'd have to find a cookbook or write the code to do it, if there's a programatical way to do it.  net-snmp may have good enough documentation to figure it out.  Have not needed this use case so I can't say.
