[2013-08-23 14:38:26 -0400] dgm: dumb question, but where is the starter kit listed on https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/chef-repo/  ?
[2013-08-23 14:39:09 -0400] dgm: My workplace has a chef login already, but it just goes to a manage console and doesn't appear to have any links to a starter kit.
[2013-08-23 14:41:29 -0400] dgm: in fact the only thing in the magae interface appears to be a vagrant vm that someone else built with this quick start guide.
[2013-08-23 14:47:42 -0400] dgm: I'm ... guessing ... it's https://github.com/wested/chef-repo
[2013-08-23 14:52:40 -0400] dgm: no, that's a bare repo, but apparently I should have something with a pem file
[2013-08-23 15:04:32 -0400] fishGoM00: iunno to be honest not tried the starter kit
[2013-08-23 15:05:02 -0400] fishGoM00: looks like it is just a cloned repo to download however, you can do that with git by following these instructions
[2013-08-23 15:05:04 -0400] fishGoM00: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Creating+a+Chef+Repository
[2013-08-23 15:29:19 -0400] dgm: apparently this download was also supposed to include a vagrant file for setting up a sample vm.  
[2013-08-23 15:38:59 -0400] teddy_: Hi, i'm trying to setup a chef workstation on an ubuntu box and when I do "knife configure --initial", I get: "ERROR: Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - getaddrinfo" - does anyone have any ideas?
[2013-08-23 15:50:57 -0400] Jose__: Hi, I have installed a chef server and workstation in separate VMs
[2013-08-23 15:51:36 -0400] Jose__: Now, I'm trying to install a cookbook with: "knife cookbook site install aws_developer_tools" but a dependency fails
[2013-08-23 15:52:56 -0400] Jose__: The aws_developer_tools itself install ok, java cookbook ok, and some others ok but the last fails with this:
[2013-08-23 15:52:56 -0400] Jose__: Cookbook chef_handler version 1.1.4 successfully installed Installing chef_ruby to /home/ubuntu/chef-repo/cookbooks Checking out the master branch. Creating pristine copy branch chef-vendor-chef_ruby ERROR: The object you are looking for could not be found Response:
[2013-08-23 15:53:08 -0400] Jose__: Any ideas?
[2013-08-23 15:55:04 -0400] Jose___: Hi?
[2013-08-23 15:55:59 -0400] Joes_: .
[2013-08-23 15:57:22 -0400] Joes_: d
[2013-08-23 15:57:26 -0400] fishGoM00: mmm, I get exactly the same thing when trying to install this cookbook
[2013-08-23 15:57:27 -0400] fishGoM00: knife cookbook site install chef-vendor-chef_ruby
[2013-08-23 15:57:35 -0400] fishGoM00: gives
[2013-08-23 15:57:36 -0400] fishGoM00: ERROR: The object you are looking for could not be found
[2013-08-23 15:57:36 -0400] fishGoM00: Response:
[2013-08-23 15:57:52 -0400] Joes_: yes...
[2013-08-23 15:58:19 -0400] Joes_: And the cookbook seems to be stable...
[2013-08-23 15:58:23 -0400] fishGoM00: try to contact the maintainer fo the cookbook I guess :/
[2013-08-23 15:58:36 -0400] Joes_: ok, thanks
[2013-08-23 16:01:42 -0400] fishGoM00: can you link to the cookbook, I cannot find it
[2013-08-23 16:05:24 -0400] joses: https://github.com/Lytro/aws_developer_tools
[2013-08-23 16:10:45 -0400] joses: The metadata.rb has chef-ruby as a dependency
[2013-08-23 16:10:48 -0400] joses: depends 'chef_ruby', '>= 2.2.0'
[2013-08-23 16:19:47 -0400] fishGoM00: perhaps install it directly from github
[2013-08-23 16:19:48 -0400] fishGoM00: https://github.com/websterclay/knife-github-cookbooks
[2013-08-23 16:20:27 -0400] fishGoM00: then "knife cookbook github install Lytro/chef_ruby"
[2013-08-23 16:21:08 -0400] fishGoM00: that should get it installed for you and let you carry on with the aws tools
[2013-08-23 16:29:09 -0400] joses: But then when I issue the "knife cookbook site install aws_developer_tools" it fails again
