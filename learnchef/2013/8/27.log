[2013-08-27 11:35:44 -0400] girishb: ?
[2013-08-27 11:36:18 -0400] girishb: I'm new to Chef and documentation is not good enough in chef sire 
[2013-08-27 11:36:21 -0400] girishb: site
[2013-08-27 11:36:32 -0400] girishb: please help me 
[2013-08-27 11:55:13 -0400] fishGoM00: Add the recipe to a node or a role and let chef-client run on the intended target to see what happens
[2013-08-27 11:55:32 -0400] fishGoM00: it will do what is defined in the recipe
[2013-08-27 12:06:00 -0400] ocholetras: hi guys!
[2013-08-27 12:06:05 -0400] ocholetras: one simple question
[2013-08-27 12:06:39 -0400] ocholetras: Does "knife data bag create ..."command actually creates the directories and files under data_bag directory on my chef-repo?
[2013-08-27 12:06:59 -0400] ocholetras: Because when i use it, it creates data bag on the server, but not the files on my repo...
[2013-08-27 12:07:41 -0400] ocholetras: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html --- > Says you can create it manually or using knife... talking about the files ..
[2013-08-27 13:23:37 -0400] fishGoM00: ocholetras: I don't think databags exist on the knife repo (I've got three atm and they are all chef server-side)
[2013-08-27 13:24:17 -0400] fishGoM00: they can be created from a file which is where I presume the repo gets that data_bag directory
[2013-08-27 17:09:09 -0400] a13x212: can I include a cookbook in another cookbook and override attributes from a recipe?
[2013-08-27 23:29:00 -0400] andrewdotnich: hello, is anyone around?
[2013-08-27 23:30:20 -0400] andrewdotnich: I have a strange error that I don't understand: https://gist.github.com/anicholson/d6c7c3935d3aa38d2058
[2013-08-27 23:43:26 -0400] andrewdotnich: as you can see, Chef is complaining that :disable is an incorrect action, and that only :nothing and :run are valid - which surely isn't right
[2013-08-27 23:43:36 -0400] andrewdotnich: Can anyone give me some pointers as to why this is happening?
