[2013-08-01 17:51:23 -0400] dgall: Hello all- I am wondering if Vagrant is used when pushing configurations to machines (outside localhost) or is this only for demonstration purposes with Virtualbox
[2013-08-01 19:15:57 -0400] jschoolcraft: There's a provider infrastructure to vagrant which will allow it to provision resources other than virtualbox (including VMware Fusion, Digital Ocean, et al)
[2013-08-01 20:29:47 -0400] dgall: what is considered the "standard" method to push an install to a box on my LAN instead of localhost?

[2013-08-01 20:42:44 -0400] s2t2: the definition file nginx_site.rb is in place, but something isn't working.
[2013-08-01 20:43:03 -0400] s2t2: i'm hoping someone can lend a helping hand
[2013-08-01 21:05:30 -0400] s2t2: maybe i've come to the wrong place...
