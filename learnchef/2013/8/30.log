[2013-08-30 09:11:42 -0400] nieldw: To get going on chef I'm trying to use the cookbook  ssh-keys by nickola. I've created the users data bag and items for each of the users I want to add ssh keys for, but I'm not sure what `node[:ssh_keys]` are. Is that also a data bag?

[2013-08-30 12:45:37 -0400] testing: Hi, there an example somewhere how to setup and bootstrap a window PC? The quick start guide use a VM and I have problem, If I try to bootsrap my other PC, I got "[...] the machine actively refused it". Probably because I did not setup correctly the target machine, but I did not find how to do it.

[2013-08-30 12:49:19 -0400] ocholetras: dont know if it is useful to you
[2013-08-30 12:49:23 -0400] ocholetras: but could help
[2013-08-30 12:49:40 -0400] testing: I will watch, thanks
[2013-08-30 12:50:26 -0400] nieldw: I don't know anything about windows, but "actively refused" sounds like when there's no ssh-server on a box.
[2013-08-30 12:52:07 -0400] ocholetras: yeah sounds like that
[2013-08-30 13:00:49 -0400] testing: yes, probably because I did not start anything. Thanks, I will search how to start a ssh-server
[2013-08-30 13:30:09 -0400] scarolan: testing: the other way to accomplish this is to make sure winrm is enabled.  
[2013-08-30 16:38:00 -0400] lmickh: Howdy.  Going through the TDI book and seem to have caused an issue after installing chruby on an omnibus chef client install.  Here is what I get when I run knife:  https://gist.github.com/lmickh/6391619
[2013-08-30 16:40:09 -0400] lmickh: Nevermind.  Just figured it out.  Pay no attention to me.
[2013-08-30 19:29:26 -0400] Guest43967: I'm trying to create my first chef cookbook, does anyone know of any very detailed guides? The ones I've been able to find are pretty vague.

[2013-08-30 19:34:37 -0400] Guest43967: I've tried that and it's helped a bit, do you know of any other good guides?
[2013-08-30 19:36:10 -0400] a13x212: i agree with you, most are vague
