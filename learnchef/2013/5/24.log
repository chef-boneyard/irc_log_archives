[2013-05-24 10:39:27 -0400] Ravi__: Hello Chef!!
[2013-05-24 10:39:49 -0400] Ravi__: Hey I am looking for automating the instance creation on AWS.
[2013-05-24 10:39:57 -0400] Ravi__: Can I use chef for it
[2013-05-24 10:44:49 -0400] Cope: yes
[2013-05-24 10:45:06 -0400] Cope: look at the knife-ec2 plugin
[2013-05-24 10:45:25 -0400] Cope: https://github.com/opscode/knife-ec2
[2013-05-24 15:33:18 -0400] lpiaounl: hi there, wondering if there's a way to specify which ruby interpreter chef-client uses
[2013-05-24 15:34:24 -0400] lpiaounl: problem is, i'm trying to bootstrap a node but i'm getting my connection reset when trying knife bootstrap tries to register the client for the first time
[2013-05-24 15:34:44 -0400] lpiaounl: seems to be related to the combination of ruby/openssl used
[2013-05-24 15:35:09 -0400] lpiaounl: rather, the versions of ruby and openssl used
[2013-05-24 15:49:34 -0400] jhnftzptrck: Hello, I'm doing this tutorial https://learnchef.opscode.com/common-use-cases/multi-node-ec2/ and I keep getting a 500 "Internal Server Error", and an error saying " '1.0.' does not match 'x.y.z' or 'x.y' " - any ideas?
[2013-05-24 16:29:31 -0400] Cope: lpiaounl: we recommend you use the Opscode "omnibus" packages
[2013-05-24 16:29:46 -0400] Cope: lpiaounl: these vendor a known-good Ruby, plus various dependencies
[2013-05-24 16:29:56 -0400] Cope: lpiaounl: see more at http://opscode.com/chef/install
[2013-05-24 16:30:17 -0400] Cope: jhnftzptrck: could you paste the full error, with context please?
[2013-05-24 17:34:11 -0400] jhnftzptrck: @Cope: You can get details of the error from here - http://s3.amazonaws.com/johnfitzpatrick/ChefError.rtf
[2013-05-24 17:35:10 -0400] jhnftzptrck: I'll only leave that link open for a little while, then block read access......
[2013-05-24 17:49:05 -0400] lpiaounl: Cope: I initially let "knife bootstrap" install the chef-client and it resulted in ERRCONNRESET, just now tried using the installer you linked me to on a fresh VM and got the same thing
[2013-05-24 17:50:44 -0400] lpiaounl: Cope: I wrote a little Ruby script to try to reproduce the error. Using the embedded Ruby interpreter in /opt/chef/embedded/... I got the ERRCONNRESET but no error using the version of Ruby installed through the package manager
[2013-05-24 17:52:10 -0400] lpiaounl: Cope: Here's a link describing an almost identical problem http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11321403/openssl-trouble-with-ruby-1-9-3
[2013-05-24 17:53:09 -0400] lpiaounl: Cope: Only I'm on RHEL 6.3
[2013-05-24 18:34:33 -0400] lpiaounl: should I open a ticket maybe ?
[2013-05-24 18:49:34 -0400] Cope: lpiaounl: sorry - was eating
[2013-05-24 18:49:57 -0400] lpiaounl: np, i'm still here :-)
[2013-05-24 18:50:35 -0400] Cope: lpiaounl: so whats teh setup now? On your client you're running a fresh vm with omnibus chef
[2013-05-24 18:50:39 -0400] Cope: lpiaounl: what's the server?
[2013-05-24 18:52:00 -0400] lpiaounl: Cope: yep, client is a clean vm with the omnibus chef and the server is the current GA opensource chef both running on RHEL 6.3
[2013-05-24 18:56:19 -0400] Cope: lpiaounl: does sound fishy; I don't have a open source chef server on rhel 6 to hand, and I'm kinda engaged on something right now.  I'd send an email to the chef users list and see if anyone else has seen this.
[2013-05-24 18:56:40 -0400] Cope: and then maybe open a ticket, if you get no fixes / clues from that
[2013-05-24 18:59:02 -0400] lpiaounl: Cope: alright, will do 
[2013-05-24 19:01:21 -0400] lpiaounl: Cope: also wondering if there's any documentation about how chef-client uses Ruby that you could refer me to so I can test some stuff ?
[2013-05-24 21:49:54 -0400] thanatas: Is there any docs on chef-shell, not seeing it on the it other then it was renamed from shef
[2013-05-24 21:55:52 -0400] behemphi: Hey @thanatas
[2013-05-24 21:55:52 -0400] behemphi: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Shef
[2013-05-24 21:56:09 -0400] behemphi: chef-shell used to be `shef` so suggest searching on that
