[2013-05-18 08:58:12 -0400] fsck0ff: hey guys.. I am having a problem with chef and the apache2 cookbook on CentOs 6.4... anyone care to help a little?
[2013-05-18 09:05:55 -0400] fsck0ff: default.rb recipe ends up with something like 
[2013-05-18 09:06:00 -0400] fsck0ff: STDOUT: Starting httpd: [FAILED]
[2013-05-18 09:06:02 -0400] fsck0ff: STDERR: httpd: Syntax error on line 140 of /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf: Syntax error on line 1 of /etc/httpd/mods-enabled/proxy_http.load: Cannot load /usr/lib64/httpd/modules/mod_proxy_http.so into server: /usr/lib64/httpd/modules/mod_proxy_http.so: undefined symbol: ap_proxy_location_reverse_map
[2013-05-18 09:06:52 -0400] fsck0ff: tracked it down to LoadModule proxy_module /usr/lib64/httpd/modules/mod_proxy.so missing
[2013-05-18 09:07:16 -0400] fsck0ff: but am not sure how to resolve that in chef...
