[2013-05-02 08:38:22 -0400] dorongutman: hello, I'm learning vagrant and chef (solo), and I'm trying to setup a basic LAMP stack (ubuntu and php). however, I don't understand how I define the virtual host for apache2
[2013-05-02 08:38:31 -0400] dorongutman: where do I put the file with "web_app" definition (web_app "my_site" do .) and how do I configure vagrant to use that file ?
[2013-05-02 08:38:40 -0400] dorongutman: (I'm a php developer, and not familiar with ruby)
[2013-05-02 12:20:50 -0400] atyz: So... I feel incredibly stupid asking this question. I'm trying to modify my chef-server config. I've found that I need to modify /etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb. I've noticed there is no such file. so I've created it. I've tried pasting in the JSON structure I received from chef-server-ctl show-config but it throws syntax errors. I then tried to replicate what i found here (http://docs.opscode.com/config_rb_chef_server.html)
[2013-05-02 12:21:30 -0400] atyz: i.e. rabbitmq['password'] = icecream. this is just totally ignored. I have no idea what i'm supposed to put into this file. any direction would be appreciated
[2013-05-02 12:51:40 -0400] atyz: Oh, it seems that reads from chef-server-running.json
[2013-05-02 12:51:49 -0400] atyz: so you have to reconfigure before the changes are reflected
[2013-05-02 17:22:34 -0400] dillyjay: dumb question, but i'm having a tough time finding an answer in docs/google. can you use YAML to define attributes, and in an 'attributes/*' file, can you load a YAML file and merge it into the hash?
[2013-05-02 17:23:36 -0400] UForgotten: dillyjay: probably not without some sort of yaml2json conversion.
[2013-05-02 17:24:41 -0400] dillyjay: i thought attributes used the blah['belch']['baloo'] hash notation?
[2013-05-02 17:27:57 -0400] dillyjay: basically, i'm trying to set it up so end users who are unfamiliar with chef can define all attributes in a YAML file, then merge that YAML file into the attribute hash in my recipe
[2013-05-02 17:30:01 -0400] UForgotten: as far as I know, you can set attributes in either ruby or json depending on where you put them in your chef run, they are just variables. facebook and disney have done something like what you describe but I'm not sure how they accomplished it.  http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_attribute_files.html
[2013-05-02 17:35:02 -0400] dillyjay: Facebook and disney? i don't get it, that's just a link to the attribute files doc. i did read that btw
