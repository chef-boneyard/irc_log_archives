[2013-05-28 00:37:42 -0400] snowe2010: anyone here willing to help me with some errors I'm getting?
[2013-05-28 00:38:07 -0400] cnk: When using chef-solo and community packages, where should I put overrides to the stock stuff? Do I create files in the data bags directory that are specific to my needs? or is there some place outside of the cookbook directory where I should put my stuff to minimize merge conflicts when updating from the community cookbook site? 
[2013-05-28 00:38:47 -0400] cnk: snowe2010: don't think I can help - unless the error is really just Ruby syntax but how about trying
[2013-05-28 00:40:13 -0400] snowe2010: ok so I'm trying to install oracle jdk 6 in a vagrant box. I've got the json set to :install_flavor => "oracle", "oracle" => "accept_oracle_download_terms" => true
[2013-05-28 00:40:42 -0400] cnk: How about one room or the other? let's take this to #chef
[2013-05-28 00:40:44 -0400] snowe2010: and I'm getting an error saying "FATAL: set alternative failed" "Error executing action `install` on resource 'java_ark[jdk]'
[2013-05-28 00:40:58 -0400] snowe2010: ha ok
[2013-05-28 16:44:22 -0400] pithagorians: how can i make the apt recipe do update and upgrade?
[2013-05-28 16:56:45 -0400] acts_as_coder: pithagorians: not sure about upgrade, but I believe "apt-get update" runs when you do this:
[2013-05-28 16:56:45 -0400] acts_as_coder: include_recipe "apt"
[2013-05-28 16:57:19 -0400] acts_as_coder: making sure you have already added a "depends" line for it in metadata.rb
[2013-05-28 18:26:22 -0400] behemphi: @pithagorians it seems to me that apt-get update is not someting to run every time
[2013-05-28 18:26:34 -0400] behemphi: sorry apt-get upgrade
[2013-05-28 18:26:47 -0400] behemphi: rather it is something to schedule
[2013-05-28 18:27:26 -0400] behemphi: For "one off" things like that we use a cookbook for the purpose and add the recipe to the run_list
[2013-05-28 18:27:58 -0400] behemphi: you can check out @mattray one-shot to see how he does it.  Ours was based on that

[2013-05-28 19:10:04 -0400] pithagorians: behemphi:thx
