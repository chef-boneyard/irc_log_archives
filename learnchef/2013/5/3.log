[2013-05-03 15:24:12 -0400] behemphi: I am working my way through getting a vagrant box set up using the opscode ubuntu10.04-gems basebox. 
[2013-05-03 15:24:40 -0400] behemphi: When I was running the kinfe bootstrap command, my base recipe failed with a 403
[2013-05-03 15:24:50 -0400] behemphi: suddenly and right at the end.
[2013-05-03 15:25:26 -0400] behemphi: then, the user named vagrant seems to have been unprivileged (i.e. could not bcome root without a password). 
[2013-05-03 15:25:56 -0400] behemphi: B/c of my base recipe rnning I was able to log in as myself, but when I run the chef client I get a 403 right after the cookbook completes
[2013-05-03 15:26:19 -0400] behemphi: Can anyone point me in a direction for troubleshooting this?
[2013-05-03 15:32:47 -0400] behemphi: It looks like it is failing on node.save
[2013-05-03 15:32:51 -0400] behemphi: if that helps
[2013-05-03 21:38:33 -0400] rb1980: okay, i looked and looked, but can't find an easy example of how to do this: I need to set an attribute based of the exit code of an external command.  Can anyone help?
[2013-05-03 21:38:46 -0400] rb1980: something like this:
[2013-05-03 21:38:52 -0400] rb1980: if system("command")
[2013-05-03 21:38:52 -0400] rb1980: node.default["foo"] = "bar"
[2013-05-03 21:38:52 -0400] rb1980: end
[2013-05-03 23:46:29 -0400] Chaterz: hi
[2013-05-03 23:46:36 -0400] Chaterz: is this a programming language ?
