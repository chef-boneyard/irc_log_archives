[2013-05-16 15:05:38 -0400] ebel: I'm getting started with chef to deploy our django web app, and I'm using the python cookbook ( http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/python ), but I can't see how to do pip install with a requirements file?
[2013-05-16 16:03:44 -0400] behemphi: hi @ebel
[2013-05-16 16:03:52 -0400] behemphi: We do the same thing
[2013-05-16 16:04:05 -0400] behemphi: and there is no LWRP for using pip_requirements file
[2013-05-16 16:04:53 -0400] behemphi: bash 'install_from_pip_requirements' do
[2013-05-16 16:04:54 -0400] behemphi:   code <<-EOH
[2013-05-16 16:04:54 -0400] behemphi:     source #{node.feedmagnet.virtualenv_path}deployment/bin/activate
[2013-05-16 16:04:54 -0400] behemphi:     pip install -r pip-requirements.txt
[2013-05-16 16:04:54 -0400] behemphi:   EOH
[2013-05-16 16:04:54 -0400] behemphi:   cwd node.feedmagnet.home_dir
[2013-05-16 16:04:54 -0400] behemphi:   user 'www-data'
[2013-05-16 16:04:55 -0400] behemphi: end
[2013-05-16 16:14:50 -0400] ebel: heh
[2013-05-16 19:10:24 -0400] thanatas: So I got chef up and running in a demo environment.  Now I'm looking to speed up my testing of cookbooks.  Is vagrant the recommended way to do this?  I'm reading over berkshelf and not sure what it does to save me time
[2013-05-16 19:12:03 -0400] sethvargo: @thanatas have you seen test-kitchen?
[2013-05-16 19:12:30 -0400] thanatas: I was starting to read over it and then it talked about vagrant  https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen
[2013-05-16 19:12:42 -0400] sethvargo: right - it uses vagrant under the hood
[2013-05-16 19:12:51 -0400] sethvargo: but you could also use ec2 lxc, etc
[2013-05-16 19:12:59 -0400] thanatas: ok thanks
[2013-05-16 19:30:33 -0400] thanatas: wow used virtual box to do full box installs before, can't believe how fast vagrant is
[2013-05-16 19:40:01 -0400] sethvargo: hahahah
[2013-05-16 20:06:42 -0400] geggam_wk: that is called the difference between vm and real hardware
[2013-05-16 20:07:12 -0400] thanatas: going to have so much more time to screw around at work with this this is life changing
[2013-05-16 20:07:51 -0400] geggam_wk: thanatas, something i am starting to implement but havent finished is crowbar
[2013-05-16 20:08:04 -0400] geggam_wk: it helps chef
[2013-05-16 20:09:11 -0400] thanatas: Cool.  I started with chef last summer but had to stop.  Was struggling with chef-solo and getting my bootstrap script to work.  I'm glad to see the new chef docs, makes it way easier to get started.
[2013-05-16 20:13:29 -0400] thehar: It's come a long way.
[2013-05-16 22:03:27 -0400] thanatas: on https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen  --  it states  "In your Gemfile, add test-kitchen as a dependency:"   I'm not sure where I would find this file?  I see most of my cookbooks have one of these already.
[2013-05-16 22:04:21 -0400] thanatas: ok nm i see https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen/wiki/Getting-Started has more information
