[2013-05-17 12:53:14 -0400] jamest: i was noticing in the docs that it says I can create databags manually in the chef repo,  where is the repo directory on the server as I haven't seen a reference to it's location
[2013-05-17 13:37:58 -0400] binamov: jamest found an answer?
[2013-05-17 13:40:52 -0400] jamest: nope
[2013-05-17 13:41:15 -0400] jamest: tried creating a data bad and running find on the server but no luck
[2013-05-17 13:41:25 -0400] jamest: s/bad/bag
[2013-05-17 13:43:43 -0400] binamov: i think it means you can manually create chef-repo/data_bags/*.json http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html
[2013-05-17 13:44:52 -0400] jamest: ah, so creating the file local manually but still using knife to upload it
[2013-05-17 13:45:10 -0400] jamest: not on the server directly
[2013-05-17 13:45:40 -0400] binamov: yes
[2013-05-17 13:45:55 -0400] jamest: ok, thanks
[2013-05-17 16:35:40 -0400] dsteen: Hi all!  any way to figure out if an IP is in a certain subnet?

[2013-05-17 19:34:48 -0400] itarchmerc: i'm trying to deploy a php application using the application and application_php cookbooks.  I created a custom cookbook for my application and everything goes smoothly until i try to checkout from my private git repo.  I see that the deploy key is created with the correct perms and the contents are right, but I get the following error "Ran git ls-remote git@github.com:myorg/myproj.git HEAD returned 128".  I can't run that comm
[2013-05-17 19:34:49 -0400] itarchmerc: interactively on the provisioned node either.  This key does work to access that repo from another server.  I'm pretty sure it's an SSH issue, but I'm stumped.  Any ideas?
[2013-05-17 19:40:26 -0400] Kyle11: No real idea but I would try to run the normal git clone in the /tmp dir on the node and see if that works
