[2013-05-22 04:20:47 -0400] sathish: Hi guys I've finished all the screencasts in learnchef.opscode these things are straightforward for me, but how do I proceed to like provisioning a machine install packages etc?
[2013-05-22 09:28:36 -0400] Hamled: I'm attempting to go through the quickstart guide at learnchef.opscode.com and I've got a user account and organization setup for Hosted Chef, but I can't get my chef client to authenticate with the opscode servers at all. I've tried regenerating both the organization validation key and my client key and I've double checked that the client key provided to me through the website is exactly the same as what's in my .pem file
[2013-05-22 09:29:33 -0400] Hamled: but I still just get the following https://gist.github.com/Hamled/2cf6844c3a3471c4da86
[2013-05-22 09:31:04 -0400] binamov: what about knife.rb ?
[2013-05-22 09:31:06 -0400] Hamled: I've checked in the knife.rb and it says the node_name is "hamled", should that perhaps be portalus-validator? I haven't hcanged anything in it
[2013-05-22 09:31:54 -0400] binamov: Hamled so you're still doing the workstation setup?
[2013-05-22 09:32:16 -0400] Hamled: well I did the workstation setup and now I'm on the Using A Chef Repo sttep
[2013-05-22 09:33:14 -0400] Hamled: but I suppose it is setting up chef for a workstation? I'm not completely familiar with the terminology yet but this is my development machine I'm trying to configure, rather than a machine I want to provision/deploy to
[2013-05-22 09:33:23 -0400] binamov: yeah i'd say get a new hamled.pem validator.pem and knife.rb
[2013-05-22 09:33:41 -0400] Hamled: I've done all that but I'll go ahead and do it again
[2013-05-22 09:33:53 -0400] Hamled: is there a particular order I would need to do it in
[2013-05-22 09:34:00 -0400] binamov: and make sure all 3 are in chef-repo/.chef/
[2013-05-22 09:34:06 -0400] Hamled: last time I regenerated my client key first, then the validator key
[2013-05-22 09:34:07 -0400] Hamled: they are
[2013-05-22 09:34:42 -0400] binamov: yeah just get the pems and knife.rb again
[2013-05-22 09:35:23 -0400] Hamled: ahhh hmmm, okay this ended up working
[2013-05-22 09:35:39 -0400] binamov: cool
[2013-05-22 09:36:29 -0400] Hamled: so when I got the key the first time, as part of the login process it was just presented as text on the webpage and I copied it into a .pem file (I even tried changing windows line endings to unix line endings when I compared it against the validator.pem, when I thought I might have created a UTF8 encoded client .pem file by accident)
[2013-05-22 09:36:46 -0400] Hamled: and when I regenerated it I did so by going to my public URL on the community site and clicking "get private key" which said it was regenerating the key
[2013-05-22 09:36:53 -0400] binamov: yeah that happens
[2013-05-22 09:37:15 -0400] binamov: sometimes ppl copy paste and miss bits, or paste into notepad...
[2013-05-22 09:37:18 -0400] Hamled: but when I did it by going to change password it gave me a .pem file directly, and that worked so... yea I dunno what I was doing wrong
[2013-05-22 09:37:38 -0400] Hamled: that's what I figured, so I double checked it with a hex editor and a differ and... I dunno
[2013-05-22 09:37:52 -0400] binamov: don't worry, keep moving, good luck :)
[2013-05-22 09:37:55 -0400] Hamled: yep thanks :)
[2013-05-22 10:47:47 -0400] luke_: Hi guys, can anyone help me change the port that chef runs on? I'm failing installation right now because we already have port 8000 in use
[2013-05-22 10:53:10 -0400] binamov: luke_ i imagine you can't disable the 800 port service, install chef, change port, reenable service?
[2013-05-22 10:53:14 -0400] binamov: 8000
[2013-05-22 10:53:57 -0400] luke_: 8000, indeed
[2013-05-22 10:54:21 -0400] luke_: I can't at the moment since people are using the service on port 8000
[2013-05-22 10:56:19 -0400] binamov: chef doesn't install at all?
[2013-05-22 10:57:21 -0400] binamov: or installs but doesn't start?
[2013-05-22 11:15:46 -0400] Cope: luke_: what does your  /etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb say?
[2013-05-22 11:27:29 -0400] luke_: one sec, apologies just had a meeting
[2013-05-22 11:32:17 -0400] luke_: aha, yes i was looking for that chef-server.rb file earlier... Unfortunately it's not present yet. Looking at the installation guide at http://docs.opscode.com/install_server.html I'm stuck on step 6
[2013-05-22 11:34:24 -0400] luke_: the command hangs on " * execute[verify-system-status] action run" for ~10 seconds and then dumps me back to the console.
[2013-05-22 11:35:34 -0400] luke_: The verification logic at /opt/chef-server/embedded/cookbooks/chef-server/recipes/bootstrap.rb is the thing that reports failure - clearly trying to test that chef server is running at port 8000
[2013-05-22 11:35:51 -0400] luke_: I just can't see where it's getting it's config from
[2013-05-22 11:36:03 -0400] luke_: any thoughts?
[2013-05-22 14:23:19 -0400] halfbaked: Hi there 
[2013-05-22 14:23:30 -0400] halfbaked: I am very new on chef 
[2013-05-22 14:23:47 -0400] halfbaked: I have a question , 
[2013-05-22 14:24:37 -0400] halfbaked: how can I add a new cookbook or edit a cookbook ?
[2013-05-22 14:28:31 -0400] behemphi: Good Morning @halfbaked
[2013-05-22 14:28:40 -0400] behemphi: What do you want to add the cookbook too?
[2013-05-22 14:28:50 -0400] behemphi: do you mean add it to the chef server so that it runs on your nodes
[2013-05-22 14:29:03 -0400] behemphi: or add it to your chef-repo for development
[2013-05-22 14:29:15 -0400] behemphi: (i.e. start a new empty cookbook)
[2013-05-22 14:45:17 -0400] halfbaked: Hi @behemphi
[2013-05-22 14:45:33 -0400] halfbaked: I am using vagrant + chef solo
[2013-05-22 14:45:45 -0400] halfbaked: I have a sample from git repository 
[2013-05-22 14:45:50 -0400] halfbaked: centos + mysql 
[2013-05-22 14:46:04 -0400] behemphi: I hate to say it but I am unsure myself and very interested in the answer as I am changing my development workflow
[2013-05-22 14:46:05 -0400] halfbaked: it works find with vagrant and chef solo
[2013-05-22 14:46:46 -0400] halfbaked: that is fine 
[2013-05-22 14:46:48 -0400] halfbaked: : (
[2013-05-22 14:47:27 -0400] behemphi: Y it is unclear to me where to put the cookbooks I want to be executed adn the like
[2013-05-22 14:50:07 -0400] halfbaked: Thanks no problem I will hunt out : )
[2013-05-22 16:38:17 -0400] billybutts: HI everyone I came from learning puppet, where there were nice tutorials guiding you through the different components of puppet. Is there anything like that for chef that is more of a guide, rather than straight documentation, to help me write my first cookbook?
[2013-05-22 20:36:37 -0400] pithagorians: hi all. i want to move my existing servers to manage with chef. what will chef do with my existing configs?
[2013-05-22 20:41:08 -0400] Cope: nothing
[2013-05-22 20:41:16 -0400] Cope: or as much or as little as you ask it to :)
[2013-05-22 20:54:15 -0400] behemphi: @pithagorians it will overwrite what you tell it to and not touch anything else
[2013-05-22 20:54:32 -0400] behemphi: This is really nice for existing servers b/c you can "move in" at your pace
[2013-05-22 20:54:39 -0400] behemphi: rather than deal with "all or nothing"
[2013-05-22 20:55:07 -0400] behemphi: If you would like a recommendation, start with the community users cookbook and just manage your ssh users to your machines
[2013-05-22 20:55:30 -0400] behemphi: then move to some part of your app.  E.g. if you use apache, then use the apache communicty cookbook and get it all right
[2013-05-22 20:55:32 -0400] behemphi: then mysql
[2013-05-22 20:55:35 -0400] behemphi: php
[2013-05-22 20:55:36 -0400] behemphi: etc
[2013-05-22 21:18:39 -0400] pithagorians: behemphi: thx
