[2013-05-09 05:22:28 -0400] ElderFain: I'm really confused about knife vs chef solo vs librarian-chef.. I'm trying to do something like here, https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/chef-repo/ 
[2013-05-09 05:22:44 -0400] ElderFain: where I setup some aliases for my vagrant vm with chef solo
[2013-05-09 05:23:47 -0400] ElderFain: I have a site-cookbooks/mystuff/recipes/default.rb
[2013-05-09 05:24:22 -0400] ElderFain: i don't have a metadata.rb file to add any depends 'magic_shell'
[2013-05-09 16:36:18 -0400] QKRTHNU: Hello
[2013-05-09 16:37:10 -0400] QKRTHNU: I'm hoping someone here can help me out.   I'm running into an authentication error trying to register a vagrant VM to hosted chef.
[2013-05-09 16:48:37 -0400] holojorge: what is the message?
[2013-05-09 16:49:46 -0400] QKRTHNU: Failed to authenticate to the chef server (http 401).
[2013-05-09 16:49:46 -0400] QKRTHNU: Ensure that your node_name and client key are correct.
[2013-05-09 16:50:58 -0400] QKRTHNU: The validation.pem file on the vagrant box matches the one used on my workstation.  I'm able to do a Knife client list successfully from my workstation.
[2013-05-09 16:51:48 -0400] holojorge: vagrant destroy does not remove the node and client in the chef-server
[2013-05-09 16:52:10 -0400] holojorge: may be you should check if you have a previous node and client in the server
[2013-05-09 16:52:15 -0400] holojorge: and remove them
[2013-05-09 16:52:25 -0400] QKRTHNU: It never succesfully created a client/node, so there's nothing to delete.
[2013-05-09 16:52:39 -0400] holojorge: ah, ok :-)
[2013-05-09 16:53:27 -0400] holojorge: do you have the following sentence in your Vagrantfile? chef.validation_key_path = ".chef/validation.pem"
[2013-05-09 16:53:37 -0400] holojorge: inside config.vm.provision section
[2013-05-09 16:55:29 -0400] holojorge: and the proper directory .chef and the validation.pem or chef-validation.pem file?
[2013-05-09 16:56:13 -0400] holojorge: are you using chef 11 or chef 10?
[2013-05-09 16:56:36 -0400] holojorge: and the last one: does your vagrant box support chef 11?
[2013-05-09 16:57:48 -0400] QKRTHNU: chef 11.  Yeah, the chef.validation_key_path line is correct and the pem files are in the .chef directory inside the folder with the Vagrantfile.
[2013-05-09 16:58:31 -0400] holojorge: what is your configuration for: chef.chef_server_url
[2013-05-09 16:58:49 -0400] holojorge: in chef 11 chef.chef_server_url should point to https
[2013-05-09 16:59:51 -0400] QKRTHNU: https://api.opscode.com/organizations/MyHostedChefOrgName
[2013-05-09 17:01:58 -0400] holojorge: can you enter in your vagrant box and check which version of chef is installed? chef-client -v
[2013-05-09 17:02:29 -0400] QKRTHNU: Running Knife client list from the directory containing Vagrantfile returns my client list from hosted chef, so my knife.rb must be setup properly, correct?
[2013-05-09 17:02:41 -0400] QKRTHNU: Yeah, just a sec.
[2013-05-09 17:03:35 -0400] QKRTHNU: vagrant@vagrant:~$ chef-client -v
[2013-05-09 17:03:35 -0400] QKRTHNU: Chef: 11.2.0
[2013-05-09 17:03:55 -0400] holojorge: puff, no idea! :-(
[2013-05-09 17:04:09 -0400] QKRTHNU: My workstation is running 11.4.4, is that an issue?
[2013-05-09 17:04:31 -0400] holojorge: don't know. Read the changelog
[2013-05-09 17:05:14 -0400] holojorge: I'm afraid I cannot help you
[2013-05-09 17:05:29 -0400] holojorge: try in the #chef channel
[2013-05-09 17:07:33 -0400] QKRTHNU: No prob, thanks anyway.
