[2013-05-31 09:52:17 -0400] mike_k: I am using site-cookbooks recipe which accesses 'nginx' recipe's attributes like "#{node['nginx']['dir']}". It works. Do I have to explicitly include the nginx recipe or make Chef aware that my custom recipe depends on 'nginx'?
[2013-05-31 10:15:35 -0400] binamov: mike_k yes if your custom recipe needs nginx then you should include it
[2013-05-31 10:16:06 -0400] mike_k: binamov: it just needs to read it's attributes
[2013-05-31 10:16:24 -0400] binamov: who install nginx then?
[2013-05-31 10:17:19 -0400] mike_k: it is installed by node/role/ third-party nginx recipe. and then my recipe is run. http://docs.opscode.com/chef/dsl_recipe.html#include-recipes - I should do it like this?
[2013-05-31 10:18:31 -0400] binamov: mike_k as long as chef has installed nginx and is thus aware of its existence, you don't need to include
[2013-05-31 10:19:01 -0400] binamov: mike_k you do probably want to indicate a dependency in metadata.rb
[2013-05-31 10:19:08 -0400] mike_k: so if I omit the nginx from role or node my recipe would fail to find nginx's attribute. would including the recipe inside my own make it fail with more explicit warning?
[2013-05-31 10:19:28 -0400] mike_k: binamov: ah, yep. that is probably what I want. thanks
[2013-05-31 10:19:50 -0400] binamov: mike_k yup, metadata.rb of your custom recipe
[2013-05-31 10:20:02 -0400] mike_k: thanks
[2013-05-31 13:36:49 -0400] eponymi: here's a dummy question: say your organization has three products. should each of those products have its own "kitchen" or "chef-repo"? also, are the terms "kitchen" and "chef-repo" interchangeable?
[2013-05-31 14:53:04 -0400] eponymi: is there any way to specify the location of a cookbook in metadata.rb? i.e. `depends "mycookbook", git: 'git://github.com/me/mycookbooks.git'`
[2013-05-31 17:04:51 -0400] ateetor: Hello; I'm having some trouble with knife-windows.  on my workstation when I run "knife bootstrap windows winrm IP_HERE -x USER_HERE" it says it cannot connect to windows:22 as if windows was the ip.   I have ran "gem install knife-windows" succesfully on my workstation.  Does anyone have an idea what might be wrong?
[2013-05-31 17:05:06 -0400] ateetor: I've also tried  "knife bootstrap windows ssh IP_HERE -x USER_HERE -p 2222" with a ssh server running on that port too and that got the same result
[2013-05-31 17:05:33 -0400] behemphi: no, the expectation is that it has been uploaded to the chef server (if using chef-client)
[2013-05-31 17:05:49 -0400] behemphi: sorry thatwas to a much older question :-)
[2013-05-31 17:06:11 -0400] ateetor: heh you confused me :P
[2013-05-31 17:06:34 -0400] behemphi: I am not a windows users at all
[2013-05-31 17:06:42 -0400] behemphi: good luck with it though!
[2013-05-31 17:08:35 -0400] ateetor: thank you.  I've found people with the same problem on google but none of them have a solution posted 
[2013-05-31 18:18:00 -0400] annirun: If anyone could look at my problem i'm having with knife-windows it would be much appreciated http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16863158/knife-windows-network-error-getaddrinfo-name-or-service-not-known-windows22
[2013-05-31 19:19:07 -0400] gabceb: Hi! Quick question. I want to be able to add a recipe to my role only when a role is used on production. What is the best/simple way to achieve this? To be more specific I have a role that should add the new_relic monitor recipe only when it is used on EC2 but not when used on vagrant
[2013-05-31 19:20:40 -0400] behemphi: @gabceb why do this with a role?
[2013-05-31 19:20:48 -0400] behemphi: why not write a quick cookbok for it
[2013-05-31 19:21:03 -0400] behemphi: then only include that cookbook pinned to the version you want in your prod env
[2013-05-31 19:21:12 -0400] behemphi: then include a no-op version in your dev env
[2013-05-31 19:21:13 -0400] gabceb: hmmm. Good question. :) I am new to Chef. Just getting started. Sorry if it is a dumb thing to do :)
[2013-05-31 19:21:24 -0400] behemphi: not dumb at all
[2013-05-31 19:21:43 -0400] behemphi: just asking so I know a bit more about what you are trying to do and why
[2013-05-31 19:21:44 -0400] gabceb: ohh so use envs to handle vagrant vs EC2?
[2013-05-31 19:22:13 -0400] behemphi: that is how I read what you are writing.  You are fundamentallys saying my environments are different
[2013-05-31 19:22:23 -0400] gabceb: yes
[2013-05-31 19:22:41 -0400] behemphi: so rather than tie behavior to which cloud provider or vm manager is being used, tie it to the environment
[2013-05-31 19:22:54 -0400] behemphi: when you dev in vagrant use the dev environment.  
[2013-05-31 19:23:15 -0400] behemphi: when launching to prod, the cookbook verion will be the one that installs NR
[2013-05-31 19:23:15 -0400] gabceb: ok. I will try that. I can also just add an attribute to skip the cookbook and add that attribute to the dev env I guess
[2013-05-31 19:23:30 -0400] behemphi: yes you could do that too
[2013-05-31 19:23:30 -0400] gabceb: thanks behemphi I will give that a try!
[2013-05-31 19:23:38 -0400] behemphi: sure, happy cooking :-)
