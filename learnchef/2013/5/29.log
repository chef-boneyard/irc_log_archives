[2013-05-29 03:02:44 -0400] chaosmaker: Hi all, am I missing something or does not exists any cookbook like the resolver cookbook but for windows?
[2013-05-29 11:46:16 -0400] Maesto: Is it normal that during knife bootstrap on a CentOS machine the recepie networking_basic fails? The package "netpkg" doesn't exist on CentOS but the readme says the cookbook should work.
[2013-05-29 11:48:57 -0400] Maesto: nevermindthink I found it
[2013-05-29 11:59:25 -0400] Maesto: OK the networking_basic Cookbook wants to install 2 packages on CentOS whitch dont exist. It is easy to fix inside attibutes/default.rb.
[2013-05-29 11:59:25 -0400] Maesto: Guess I fix it and then make a Pull request?
[2013-05-29 12:28:26 -0400] behemphi: Hey Maesto, a pull request is defn the best way to go
[2013-05-29 12:28:29 -0400] behemphi: very cool!
[2013-05-29 16:39:38 -0400] gabceb: Hi everybody, quick question. I am a Chef newbie and I am still getting my head around it.
[2013-05-29 16:39:38 -0400] gabceb: For my case I am deploying a server with nginx and nodejs. I have gone thru installing knife, cookbooks and deploying to Vagrant with no problems (i am using Chef hosted).
[2013-05-29 16:39:39 -0400] gabceb: Now my question is, my nginx is still using the default conf file. How do I set a specific .conf for my node server. Should I add it to the nginx cookbook? If so what happens when I also need to deploy a Rails server on a different node that also uses nginx?
[2013-05-29 17:03:48 -0400] sethvargo: @gabceb you should create a wrapper cookbook. You should never modify a community cookbook unless contributing back
[2013-05-29 17:04:22 -0400] sethvargo: @gabceb depending on the configuration you want, it may be a node attribute
[2013-05-29 17:04:27 -0400] sethvargo: ^configuraable
[2013-05-29 17:49:46 -0400] gabceb: thanks sethvargo. I will try it out. Do you happen to have a github repo with an example? If not don't worry, i will give it a try
[2013-05-29 17:57:54 -0400] sethvargo: @gabceb I don't have one handy, but I'll try and hook something up and respond to your email
[2013-05-29 18:01:08 -0400] gabceb: this actually worked for me -> http://leopard.in.ua/2013/01/05/chef-solo-getting-started-part-2/
[2013-05-29 18:01:11 -0400] gabceb: thanks again!
[2013-05-29 18:03:04 -0400] sethvargo: awesome!
