[2013-05-13 09:49:35 -0400] CygnusS: hi! i'd like to do a loop over a remote-directory to symlink subdirs into my apache doc-root. How can this be done in chef/ruby?
[2013-05-13 15:44:51 -0400] behemphi1: Good Morning.  I am trying to work with Vagrant and chef-solo.  When I Vagrant up I get the message 
[2013-05-13 15:44:54 -0400] behemphi1: "The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
[2013-05-13 15:44:55 -0400] behemphi1: Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!
[2013-05-13 15:44:55 -0400] behemphi1: chown -R vagrant /tmp/vagrant-chef-1"
[2013-05-13 15:45:10 -0400] behemphi1: which is odd b/c when I vagrant ssh I can run that command with no problem
[2013-05-13 15:45:31 -0400] behemphi1: When chef-solo runs it says it cannto find the cookbook
[2013-05-13 15:45:57 -0400] behemphi1: and the /tmp/*/cookbooks directory is, in fact, empty
[2013-05-13 15:46:08 -0400] behemphi1: has anyone encountered/solved this issue?
[2013-05-13 15:47:33 -0400] behemphi1: even more disturbing I just noticed that when the guest mounts my cookbook directory, it also appears empty on my workstation now!
