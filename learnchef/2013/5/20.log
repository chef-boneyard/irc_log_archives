[2013-05-20 14:25:30 -0400] dsteen: is there a way to use the knife search in a recipe?  For example, if I want a list of boxes that have an IP of 192.16.0.195, I can use "knife search node "network_interfaces_*_addresses:192.16.0.195".   Is there a way to similarely get a list of address for a box?  For example:  node["network_interfaces_*_addresses"]

[2013-05-20 18:42:48 -0400] jamest: figured it'd be idempotent by default 
[2013-05-20 19:44:29 -0400] bean__: jamest: i'd wrap it in some sort of a check
