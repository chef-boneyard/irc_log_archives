[2013-05-21 00:03:00 -0400] thehar: is there a seth lurking about?
[2013-05-21 14:20:11 -0400] jongep86: hi, with the tutorial at 'knife bootstrap ...' i get an  error "ERROR: OpenSSL::PKey::PKeyError: not a private key (/home/maarten/.ssh/id_rsa" after the first line saying "Bootstrapping Chef on localhost"
[2013-05-21 14:20:31 -0400] jongep86: What can i do to succesfully bootstrap the tutorial?
[2013-05-21 14:21:51 -0400] artcurmudgeon: Jong...google came up with this  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9847962/chef-and-knife-to-bootstrap-ec2-opensslpkeyrsaerror-private-key-needed
[2013-05-21 14:22:43 -0400] Cope: jongep86: what is the full line you are giving to knife bootstrap?
[2013-05-21 14:23:01 -0400] jongep86: knife bootstrap localhost --ssh-user vagrant --ssh-password vagrant --ssh-port 2222 --run-list "recipe[apt],recipe[aliases],recipe[apache2],recipe[networking_basic]" --sudo
[2013-05-21 14:23:35 -0400] jongep86: with vagrant ssh  I can enter the vm
[2013-05-21 14:23:47 -0400] Cope: vagrant ssh uses a magic keypair
[2013-05-21 14:24:07 -0400] Cope: looks like knife is trying to use your local key
[2013-05-21 14:24:43 -0400] jongep86: when i move the key out of the way the errors becomes "knife bootstrap localhost --ssh-user vagrant --ssh-password vagrant --ssh-port 2222 --run-list "recipe[apt],recipe[aliases],recipe[apache2],recipe[networking_basic]" --sudo"
[2013-05-21 14:25:07 -0400] jongep86: sorry, the errors is "ERROR: Net::SSH::Disconnect: disconnected: Too many authentication failures for vagrant (2)"
[2013-05-21 14:25:42 -0400] Cope: jongep86: the vagrant key lives at:
[2013-05-21 14:25:55 -0400] Cope: ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
[2013-05-21 14:26:14 -0400] jongep86: so I can use that key, isn't it?
[2013-05-21 14:26:23 -0400] Cope: you can try passing that as an argument to knife, or use ssh-agent
[2013-05-21 14:27:16 -0400] jongep86: thanks, works!
[2013-05-21 14:28:23 -0400] Cope: ace :)
[2013-05-21 20:01:43 -0400] rodneyo: hello: Is it possible to restrict the usage of knife so that only authorized people can do stuff like add,modify delete nodes or create/modify a data bag etc
[2013-05-21 20:02:50 -0400] behemphi: @rodneyo do you mean on a shared server?
[2013-05-21 20:03:13 -0400] rodneyo: no, on a dedicated server
[2013-05-21 20:03:31 -0400] behemphi: sorry I mean a machine shared by one or more uses
[2013-05-21 20:04:10 -0400] rodneyo: behemphi:  ah, yes
[2013-05-21 20:04:20 -0400] behemphi: The way I did this was to but my chef creds in /home/me/.chef and remove them from etc and the chef_repo
[2013-05-21 20:05:32 -0400] behemphi: WHen I added team members they each got their own creds that way any of us could easily be removed from the chef server (hosted chef in our case) and effectively lock them out.
[2013-05-21 20:06:31 -0400] rodneyo: behemphi:  brilliant!  I'll give that a try
[2013-05-21 20:12:03 -0400] behemphi: All, if you are in Austin TX, or close by tomorrow, Matt Ray of Opscode (great guy) is doing office hours at the Monkey Nest.  Please check out Austin Devops on meetup.com for details.
[2013-05-21 21:50:21 -0400] luke_: Hi all, I'm looking to use chef to deploy application build artifacts (EARs, WARs etc)... am struggling to find a best practice example of doing this with Chef, given my requirement that we want to deploy a specific version of the build to a specific environment on demand... can anyone help pleaes?
[2013-05-21 22:38:32 -0400] davidelliott: just finished the getting started guide and wanted to post some feedback here
