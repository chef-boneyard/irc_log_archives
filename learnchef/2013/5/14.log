[2013-05-14 14:14:49 -0400] hick: hi people, somebody know , how can I get interface which is used by chef-client for connecting to chef-server?
[2013-05-14 14:20:52 -0400] behemphi: not sure what you mean @hick
[2013-05-14 14:21:05 -0400] behemphi: interface to connect to the chef-server do you mean the API?
[2013-05-14 14:28:31 -0400] hick: I am talking about network interface , I need to know it's name and IP address
[2013-05-14 14:29:14 -0400] hick: network interface which is used by chef-client to connect to the chef server
[2013-05-14 14:32:36 -0400] behemphi: the chef-client talks to the chef server via API endpoints.   
[2013-05-14 14:32:59 -0400] behemphi: For example if you are using hosted chef your url will look something like:  "https://api.opscode.com/organizations/your-org-name
[2013-05-14 14:46:27 -0400] eponymi: i'm using librarian to install cookbooks but i'm getting funny behavior and hoping for help. my repository has three branches: master, sys, proj. sys is for vagrant/chef, proj is for app, and master is for both read in as subtrees. but when i run librarian-chef install, it installs the cookbooks in the root of all three branches.
[2013-05-14 16:11:38 -0400] dsteen: morning all.  anyone know how to refrence classes from libraries created in one cookbook, in a different cookbook?
[2013-05-14 16:12:21 -0400] sethvargo: @dsteen you'll need to depend on that cookbook in your metadata.rb
[2013-05-14 16:12:46 -0400] sethvargo: @dsteen for example, if you wanted to use a library from the "foo" cookbook in your "bar" cookbook, you would need to add depends "foo" to the metadata in your bar cookbook
[2013-05-14 16:13:50 -0400] dsteen: @sethvargo hm.  so I have that part set, I guess I may be asking a more basic ruby question.  How do I reference the class?
[2013-05-14 16:13:53 -0400] dsteen: so for example:
[2013-05-14 16:14:09 -0400] dsteen: If I have a class that I create Chef::Recipe::FileEdit
[2013-05-14 16:14:20 -0400] dsteen: how do I reference that class in a diffrent cookbook?
[2013-05-14 16:14:50 -0400] sethvargo: @dsteen Chef::Recipe::FileEdit
[2013-05-14 16:15:00 -0400] sethvargo: depending on how you wrote it, you may need to create an instance of it
[2013-05-14 16:15:04 -0400] sethvargo: you may also need to require it
[2013-05-14 16:15:14 -0400] sethvargo: require 'fileedit' # or whatever you named it
[2013-05-14 16:15:25 -0400] sethvargo: There's also Chef::Util::FileEdit
[2013-05-14 16:15:54 -0400] dsteen: @sethvargo  yeah i saw that, and I'm basing my code on it :-)
[2013-05-14 16:16:08 -0400] sethvargo: hehe ok. just making sure you weren't reinventing the wheel
[2013-05-14 16:16:09 -0400] sethvargo: @ds
[2013-05-14 16:16:26 -0400] sethvargo: @dsteen I actually have to run, but you can email me if you have any follow up questions: sethvargo@opscode
[2013-05-14 16:16:33 -0400] dsteen: cool thanks!
[2013-05-14 18:05:45 -0400] dsteen: is it possible to use the 'log' function in a libraries file?
