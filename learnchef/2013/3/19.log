[2013-03-19 13:30:06 -0400] gellanium: When i try do "knife cookbook upload vim"(or another recipes)  i get an error: "ERROR: Failed to authenticate to http://IP:4000 as root with key /root/.chef/root.pem Response:  Failed to authenticate. Ensure that your client key is valid. "  But when i try connect to server using this key - all rigth.
[2013-03-19 13:37:24 -0400] gellanium: Any body can help me?
[2013-03-19 13:58:31 -0400] petecheslock: what do you mean "when you try to connect to the server with the key"?  what command do you do to connect to the server?
[2013-03-19 13:58:37 -0400] petecheslock: like via SSH?
[2013-03-19 14:00:39 -0400] petecheslock: you should have been able to download your user key from the chef server in order to authenticate to the api.
[2013-03-19 14:00:52 -0400] petecheslock: gellanium it'll be different than your ssh key
[2013-03-19 14:05:01 -0400] petecheslock: gellanium - i think this is the doc you want to setup your workstation - http://docs.opscode.com/chef/install_workstation.html

[2013-03-19 14:15:29 -0400] gellanium: I'll fix this problem.

[2013-03-19 19:54:42 -0400] jaqque: playing with the learnchef tutorial, just finished converginf my first node, and i noticed a couple "irregularities"
[2013-03-19 19:55:22 -0400] jaqque: 1) 30 resources updated, instead of 18 as the documentation pointed out, and 2) the curl responded with a 404 instead of an "it works!" apache default
[2013-03-19 20:23:51 -0400] jaqque: under NTP Common Use Cases, i needed to change ntpd to ntp so Ubuntu would actually start the right service. there was probably a smarter way to do it (use the community ntp?) but i am simply following along the tutorial
[2013-03-19 20:38:28 -0400] jaqque: OH - this is a goodone. the bash-to-chef, the phpmyadmin, downloads a phpmyadmin.tar.gz. gunzip fails, because 
[2013-03-19 20:38:31 -0400] jaqque: cookbooks/phpmyadmin.tar.gz: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
[2013-03-19 20:41:57 -0400] jaqque: user error: i used ``knife cookbook site install phpmyadmin'' which apparently doesn't work
[2013-03-19 21:23:06 -0400] threesome: Hello! Question about organizing my workspace. In my main ~/workspace/ directory where I have all my projects, do I need to have at least 2? One chef-repo project which is my local copy of what will get uploaded to the chef server, as well as my actual project (e.g. Vagrant) that will use the cookbooks from my chef-repo project?
