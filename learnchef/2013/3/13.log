[2013-03-13 19:30:54 -0400] clundquist: where is the best place to learn about chef core? that is, how chef works, not how to write recipes and such
[2013-03-13 19:31:22 -0400] clundquist: I've been reading the source, but I wanted to check if there was a more structured intro
[2013-03-13 19:42:59 -0400] j^2: clundquist: the wiki has taught me alot 
[2013-03-13 19:43:28 -0400] j^2: well, it points to http://docs.opscode.com/ now
[2013-03-13 19:43:38 -0400] j^2: but all in all it's been extremely helpful
[2013-03-13 19:43:43 -0400] clundquist: j^2: likewise, right now what I am really struggling with is importing "node.to_json" from one chef-solo run to the next
[2013-03-13 19:43:56 -0400] clundquist: so I am doing
[2013-03-13 19:44:25 -0400] clundquist: Chef::Client.new( JSON.parse(::File.read("/path/to/dump.json")))
[2013-03-13 19:44:32 -0400] clundquist: and the default attributes I am looking for are gone
[2013-03-13 19:44:49 -0400] j^2: ah, yeah i dont play with chef-solo at all
[2013-03-13 19:45:21 -0400] clundquist: I'm just trying to figure out how attributes are calculated and when
[2013-03-13 19:45:43 -0400] clundquist: so I've been reading, https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/application.rb and https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/application/apply.rb
[2013-03-13 21:15:23 -0400] jtimberman: clundquist: reading the source is a good start :)
[2013-03-13 21:15:31 -0400] jtimberman: clundquist: thats where i learned 
[2013-03-13 21:16:20 -0400] clundquist: how do I do this better? https://github.com/ChrisLundquist/kb/compare/feature-something-awesome
[2013-03-13 22:30:13 -0400] JustinAiken: ok stupid question - how do i create a group inside a recepie?
[2013-03-13 22:30:20 -0400] JustinAiken: or in the Cheffile
[2013-03-13 22:30:35 -0400] clundquist: in Berksfile you do
[2013-03-13 22:30:39 -0400] clundquist: group :integration do
[2013-03-13 22:30:44 -0400] clundquist: cookbook #....
[2013-03-13 22:30:45 -0400] clundquist: end
[2013-03-13 22:30:53 -0400] clundquist: I imagine it is the same in Cheffile
[2013-03-13 22:31:12 -0400] maplebed: JustinAiken: also http://docs.opscode.com/resource_group.html
[2013-03-13 22:31:33 -0400] JustinAiken: ah ha, that's exactly what i was looking for
[2013-03-13 22:31:34 -0400] JustinAiken: thanks! :)
[2013-03-13 22:31:38 -0400] maplebed: yw!
[2013-03-13 22:31:56 -0400] clundquist: I feel super awesome giving the right answer to the wrong question
[2013-03-13 22:31:59 -0400] maplebed: (also, best of luck with ejabberd.  I do *not* have fond memories of installing that thing.)
[2013-03-13 22:33:25 -0400] JustinAiken: haha, got it running pretty easy on macgetting it in a VM is a whole other story...
[2013-03-13 23:43:03 -0400] denken: so, i come from a puppet background and im wrapping my head around chef. i have a question; with puppet, you can just tell the puppet master to git clone a repo on a regular basis and thats it. humans can clone/branch/merge/push that repo in a pretty standard development model... with chef it would appear to have to use knife to push a git repo of 'chef stuff' onto the chef servers
[2013-03-13 23:43:42 -0400] denken: my question is; is it possible to have a chef server pull its cookbooks, etc. directly from git, or do you have to work the knife dance into your development workflow
[2013-03-13 23:44:08 -0400] denken: perhaps thats a horrible idea... im not sure. it was so simple with puppet though. chef seems overly complicated but im trying to give it a chance.
[2013-03-13 23:45:44 -0400] clundquist: denken, yes you can do anything, no there isn't great tooling around it yet
[2013-03-13 23:46:05 -0400] maplebed: if you think of the knife stuff as the 'deploy' step, it's valuable to keep deploying code separate from your revision control system.
[2013-03-13 23:46:06 -0400] clundquist: so there are 2 workflows, both broken in different ways
[2013-03-13 23:46:36 -0400] clundquist: berkshelf / riot games, as I understand it, use chef-server as there version control system, and just upload and download to it
[2013-03-13 23:46:38 -0400] maplebed: (not too many people run their production systems on HEAD with an automatic restart on code change.  ;) )
[2013-03-13 23:47:23 -0400] clundquist: the other method is to have a post-commit hook on github (enterprise) that hits a cgi script
[2013-03-13 23:47:47 -0400] denken: the way im doing it with puppet is that the puppet masters git pull from a 'production' branch
[2013-03-13 23:48:16 -0400] denken: dev's can make feature branches and of course have their own puppet master that pulls from wherever they want (along with dev clients that pull from that puppet master)
[2013-03-13 23:48:46 -0400] maplebed: yeah, closest to that is a post-commit hook listening to the production branch that does the knife stuff.
[2013-03-13 23:49:05 -0400] denken: yeah that was my thought as well
[2013-03-13 23:49:15 -0400] denken: hmm
[2013-03-13 23:49:30 -0400] clundquist: on the plus side, it is event based instead of polling :)
[2013-03-13 23:49:34 -0400] maplebed: I considered doing that but have held off; I enjoy the control of choosing when to knife stuff independent of when it gets committed to git.
[2013-03-13 23:50:21 -0400] clundquist: we have separate chef solo work flow from chef-client/server
[2013-03-13 23:50:23 -0400] denken: maplebed: in our scenario, you just dont 'git merge & push' off your dev server until youre happy with everything
[2013-03-13 23:50:30 -0400] clundquist: so we automate the solo stuff, then push the server stuff
[2013-03-13 23:50:40 -0400] denken: and then it gets pushed into master of course, and merged on down to staging and production with the release
[2013-03-13 23:51:48 -0400] clundquist: out of curiosity, why are you unhappy with puppet?
[2013-03-13 23:51:50 -0400] denken: clundquist: hmm interesting
[2013-03-13 23:52:19 -0400] denken: clundquist: im not. just started last week at a chef shop ;)
[2013-03-13 23:52:32 -0400] denken: im not about to advocate switching to puppet unless there are some really good reasons to do so
[2013-03-13 23:53:51 -0400] denken: i call it a 'chef shop'... there are hundred different teams though, some of which use puppet
[2013-03-13 23:53:57 -0400] denken: this team uses chef currently though
[2013-03-13 23:59:21 -0400] denken: at any rate, the answer is "you have to use knife" which is what i thought :P
[2013-03-13 23:59:25 -0400] denken: interesting
