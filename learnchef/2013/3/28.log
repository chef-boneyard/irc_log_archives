[2013-03-28 18:44:43 -0400] coldkreap: Hello. I am encountering a problem with converging a node in chef. I am on a windows 7 machine. The error I get is "No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it"
[2013-03-28 18:44:49 -0400] coldkreap: can anyone help me out?
[2013-03-28 18:58:01 -0400] coldkreap: Well I've found that vagrant is failing to start because it is trying to write to a network drive that has no disk space left. I think my work computer maps some directories to there like my documents, pictures etc.
