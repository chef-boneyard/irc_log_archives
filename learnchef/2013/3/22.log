[2013-03-22 11:14:17 -0400] chef099: hello
[2013-03-22 11:19:24 -0400] chef099: any idea about creating file and directory  on nods  by using chef server 
[2013-03-22 13:49:34 -0400] rep0st: chef099: there's a directory provider that create directories for you. As far as the files there's a couple ways to do it. You can source the file using the files directory of a cookbook, or you can source a template file. see here: http://docs.opscode.com/resource.html
[2013-03-22 13:53:06 -0400] rep0st: caspyin: if it's not in the chef opscode docs. I'm assuming that it might be a ruby method of some sort. 
[2013-03-22 18:16:33 -0400] basic`: i'm having trouble understanding how to configure an email handler from the documentation
[2013-03-22 18:16:51 -0400] basic`: i've installed the chef_handler cookbook, where do i put this example code and how do i tell chef to send emails?
[2013-03-22 19:01:08 -0400] timops: @basic` how much have you done so far?
[2013-03-22 19:01:31 -0400] timops: you should put the handler inside of the cookbook directory, under /files/default/handlers
[2013-03-22 19:02:07 -0400] timops: then you create a chef_handler resource to reference it, and drop the recipe that includes this resource somewhere early in your run_list
[2013-03-22 20:10:26 -0400] basic`: timops: i haven't done much yet, i mean i have a bunch of cookbooks and roles and other things, but nothing for the handler stuff yet
[2013-03-22 20:12:29 -0400] behemphi: @basic i have nothing useful to add (yet) but would like to know if you are in the Austin, TX area?
[2013-03-22 20:12:40 -0400] behemphi: (pondering a hack day for testing with chef)
[2013-03-22 20:15:00 -0400] basic`: behemphi: i'm in Corvallis, OR unfortunately
[2013-03-22 20:19:28 -0400] behemphi: I cannot imagine "unfortunately" really applying there :-), but I will encourage you to get a Devops or Chef Meetup going in your area
[2013-03-22 20:19:38 -0400] behemphi: Opscode is hugely supportive!
[2013-03-22 20:21:47 -0400] behemphi: @basic, I have not done this yet for reals myself, have you seen this:
[2013-03-22 20:21:48 -0400] behemphi: https://github.com/kisoku/chef-handler-mail
[2013-03-22 20:21:55 -0400] behemphi: there is a nice example I was able to hack in
[2013-03-22 20:22:11 -0400] behemphi: I don't have my code as it was a transient thing I was fooling with
[2013-03-22 20:24:58 -0400] basic`: behemphi: i did see that handler, i just wasn't sure how to implement it
[2013-03-22 20:25:37 -0400] basic`: i imagine the LWRP is easiest to use, but wasn't sure where to put the checkout of 'chef-handler-mail'
[2013-03-22 20:32:06 -0400] basic`: that doesn't go in cookbooks i imagine?
[2013-03-22 20:32:20 -0400] behemphi: I remember installing it this way, but I don't remember it the result:
[2013-03-22 20:33:58 -0400] behemphi: (again this was hacking)
[2013-03-22 20:34:44 -0400] behemphi: I put the project in /opt/chef-handler-mail
[2013-03-22 20:34:52 -0400] behemphi: then the require statement used that path
[2013-03-22 20:35:07 -0400] behemphi: From there I included the code in a recipe and got an email
[2013-03-22 20:35:22 -0400] behemphi: however I had to install pony and a few other gems to do it
[2013-03-22 20:35:50 -0400] behemphi: This is why I backed up and left it.  Felt too much like hacking
[2013-03-22 20:37:34 -0400] basic`: ya, that seems strange that you can't have chef just install the handler stuff itself and manage the gems and other pieces
[2013-03-22 20:37:44 -0400] basic`: but i dont see a cookbook that does that for mail, yet
[2013-03-22 20:38:19 -0400] behemphi: Yeah, that is true
[2013-03-22 20:38:24 -0400] behemphi: so there is this:
[2013-03-22 20:38:30 -0400] behemphi: https://rubygems.org/gems/chef-handler-mail
[2013-03-22 20:38:41 -0400] behemphi: which is the same thing but can be installed via ruby-gems
[2013-03-22 20:38:57 -0400] behemphi: then there is no path stuff to worry about (can you tell I am not a rubyist :-)
[2013-03-22 20:39:26 -0400] basic`: so i could just create a recipe that installs the chef-handler-mail gem?
[2013-03-22 20:39:27 -0400] behemphi: That got me pony for free and worked smoother.  Felt alot less like hacking
[2013-03-22 20:39:34 -0400] behemphi: yes
[2013-03-22 20:40:16 -0400] behemphi: I believe you will want a "chef_gem" resource rather than "gem" if you are using omnibus to install
[2013-03-22 20:40:33 -0400] behemphi: that will put the gem in side the chef ecosytem created by the installer 
[2013-03-22 20:40:59 -0400] behemphi: However I am with you in that it seems that an lwrp should be provided by a cookbook.  
[2013-03-22 20:41:08 -0400] basic`: ah yes, i guess i dont understand that completely, but i am using omnibus/omnitruck
[2013-03-22 20:41:15 -0400] behemphi: Either way I hope a recount of my failings helps you find succcess a bit faster
[2013-03-22 20:41:20 -0400] basic`: ha
[2013-03-22 20:41:43 -0400] behemphi: Omnibus is the way to go, as it installs chef and the version of ruby it wants without changing anything about your system
[2013-03-22 20:42:13 -0400] behemphi: so if you have an app on ruby 1.8 all is still good b/c chef wants 1.9 but will take care of all of it seemlessly for you
[2013-03-22 20:42:22 -0400] basic`: that makes sense
[2013-03-22 20:42:32 -0400] basic`: does the handler only go on the chef server? maybe that's also part of my confusion
[2013-03-22 20:53:15 -0400] basic`: behemphi: how do i use chef_gem with chef 11?
[2013-03-22 21:03:26 -0400] basic`: ah, apparently it still need the chef_gem cookbook even though it says it's for < 0.10
[2013-03-22 21:03:36 -0400] behemphi: Looking @basic
[2013-03-22 21:03:47 -0400] behemphi: they recently redirected some of the wiki pages on me!
[2013-03-22 21:03:48 -0400] basic`: needs*
[2013-03-22 21:04:09 -0400] behemphi: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_package.html
[2013-03-22 21:04:20 -0400] behemphi: do a ctl-f for chef_gem
[2013-03-22 21:05:08 -0400] basic`: AHH ok
[2013-03-22 21:05:10 -0400] basic`: that makes more sense
[2013-03-22 21:05:12 -0400] behemphi: I should say my sad attempt at help should not reflect poorly on @nathenharvey or @jtimberman  I am not an opscode employee
[2013-03-22 21:05:23 -0400] behemphi: just trying to give a little back for all the past help!
[2013-03-22 21:05:36 -0400] basic`: behemphi: totally understand, i was doing the same thing last night :)
[2013-03-22 21:07:00 -0400] basic`: hmm.. now how do i knife delete this cookbook /me reads up
[2013-03-22 21:07:19 -0400] behemphi: knife cookbook delete <name>
[2013-03-22 21:07:55 -0400] basic`: does that handle the git repo too?
[2013-03-22 21:31:16 -0400] maplebed: nope.
[2013-03-22 21:31:42 -0400] maplebed: knife cookbook upload/delete/list are only chef-server operations.  sfaik knife create is the only one that talks to git.
[2013-03-22 21:31:55 -0400] maplebed: s/create/site install/ sorry.
[2013-03-22 21:32:01 -0400] maplebed: (create doesn't talk to git.)
