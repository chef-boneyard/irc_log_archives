[2013-03-25 13:43:48 -0400] jmcginn13: hello, i'm getting an error running the getting started guide, looks like the version of apache specified doesn't exist
[2013-03-25 13:44:39 -0400] jmcginn13: if I run apt-get on the box with the same version I get: Version '2.2.22-1ubuntu1.2' for 'apache2' was not found
[2013-03-25 13:58:43 -0400] jmcginn13: so the default recipe for apache has: package "apache2" do   package_name node['apache']['package'] end
[2013-03-25 13:59:12 -0400] jmcginn13: and the readme says: "As of v1.2.0, this cookbook makes use of `node['platform_family']` to simplify platform selection logic. This attribute was introduced in Ohai v0.6.12. The recipe methods were introduced in Chef v0.10.10. If"
[2013-03-25 14:00:37 -0400] jmcginn13: I'm guessing that something is out of wack with the getting started guide vagrant box and the new recipe maybe?
[2013-03-25 14:04:57 -0400] jmcginn13: hmm odd, I just ran it again and it worked, verifying
[2013-03-25 14:08:10 -0400] jmcginn13: k it worked
