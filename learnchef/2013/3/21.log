[2013-03-21 08:25:26 -0400] tms: I have installed chef-server. Now where can I find the help for connecting it to chef-client
[2013-03-21 13:20:58 -0400] rd1988: an run script ,creat file ,  restart some services  on nods using chef server web interface
[2013-03-21 14:18:11 -0400] DaveK: Hi: I got a question. Why cant i find any cookbooks for installing any kind of eclipse? at least i cant find any at http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks or by asking google.
[2013-03-21 14:21:49 -0400] ngrayson: like the IDE eclipse
[2013-03-21 14:21:51 -0400] ngrayson: ?
[2013-03-21 14:22:41 -0400] DaveK: y
[2013-03-21 14:23:04 -0400] ngrayson: i don't really think that is a thing people usually do with chef
[2013-03-21 14:23:11 -0400] ngrayson: why do you want to?
[2013-03-21 14:23:40 -0400] DaveK: because i want to set up an vm and preinstall a tomcat and eclipse
[2013-03-21 14:24:13 -0400] ngrayson: is there a package in apt-get or yum for it?
[2013-03-21 14:24:27 -0400] DaveK: next step would be configuring the eclipse, so it already knows the tomcat as application server before it is started the first time by a user
[2013-03-21 14:25:05 -0400] DaveK: i can just do a apt-get install eclipse instead
[2013-03-21 14:25:18 -0400] ngrayson: well you can do taht with a recipe you write
[2013-03-21 14:25:34 -0400] ngrayson: makes it easy if it's apt-get-able
[2013-03-21 14:25:44 -0400] DaveK: ill do that then. was just wondering, that noone did it before...
[2013-03-21 14:26:01 -0400] ngrayson: i think most use chef to manage servers
[2013-03-21 14:26:09 -0400] ngrayson: and there is no need for eclipse on a server
[2013-03-21 14:27:03 -0400] DaveK: iam thinking about using it to set up vm's for diffrent users, so that those vm's wont need to be configured manually one after another
[2013-03-21 14:27:33 -0400] DaveK: and part of it is giving all users the same (well working) development environment
[2013-03-21 14:28:00 -0400] DaveK: the aim is to get rid of all these 5-minutes-one-by-one configurations
[2013-03-21 14:28:37 -0400] DaveK: they eat up my day and i thought i could use vagrant + chef to achieve this
[2013-03-21 14:32:24 -0400] DaveK: if i correctly understand i could use vagrant+chef to configure and distribute vm's to many users via a server?
[2013-03-21 14:37:32 -0400] ngrayson: that is a strange use case i think
[2013-03-21 14:37:51 -0400] ngrayson: vagrant is more to test server environments i would say
[2013-03-21 14:39:00 -0400] DaveK: what would you use instead?
[2013-03-21 14:39:06 -0400] ngrayson: for what you are saying i would suggest a git repo with all configuration files in it
[2013-03-21 14:39:16 -0400] ngrayson: then set up env variables or symlinks
[2013-03-21 14:39:28 -0400] ngrayson: then when there is an update just have your users git pull
[2013-03-21 14:39:47 -0400] ngrayson: what platform are your devs on?
[2013-03-21 14:40:07 -0400] DaveK: but the point is i dont want any user to update
[2013-03-21 14:40:52 -0400] ngrayson: well if you do vagrant + chef they are going to need to update the recipes you give them
[2013-03-21 14:41:04 -0400] ngrayson: and work from a vm, i wouldn't want to do that
[2013-03-21 14:41:29 -0400] DaveK: well they are working via unix vm's
[2013-03-21 14:42:01 -0400] DaveK: i wouldnt want that, but thats the way it is.
[2013-03-21 14:42:06 -0400] ngrayson: gross okay
[2013-03-21 14:42:11 -0400] ngrayson: well what you are doing will work then
[2013-03-21 14:42:21 -0400] DaveK: and iam not in the position to change it. i just have to deal with it
[2013-03-21 14:42:22 -0400] ngrayson: i would use berkshelf
[2013-03-21 14:42:39 -0400] ngrayson: then setup one recipe to install everything
[2013-03-21 14:42:54 -0400] ngrayson: the user does git pull; vagrant up
[2013-03-21 14:43:15 -0400] ngrayson: it launches a vm for them
[2013-03-21 14:44:03 -0400] DaveK: well that would be a local vm then right?
[2013-03-21 14:44:22 -0400] ngrayson: yes
[2013-03-21 14:44:34 -0400] ngrayson: vagrant is for local vms
[2013-03-21 14:45:59 -0400] DaveK: i guess i should take another look at vagrant then. if its possible to setup multiple vm's on central server. the workstations would then connect to the central vm on the server.
[2013-03-21 14:46:22 -0400] ngrayson: that might work, seems complicated 
[2013-03-21 14:46:45 -0400] DaveK: yep. i think so. and i dont like it. but hey, not my choice ;-)
[2013-03-21 14:47:39 -0400] DaveK: my main concern about it, that it would be to complicated for the use you get. and its too slow imho.
[2013-03-21 14:54:03 -0400] ngrayson: that is why a local vm would be easier
[2013-03-21 14:54:15 -0400] ngrayson: are they on windows mac or linux?
[2013-03-21 14:58:57 -0400] DaveK: most are using linux
[2013-03-21 14:59:27 -0400] DaveK: some are using windows and work on unix vm's via vnc
[2013-03-21 15:00:32 -0400] DaveK: so most development is using linux.
[2013-03-21 15:02:52 -0400] ngrayson: local vagrants would work well on linux
[2013-03-21 15:18:30 -0400] sunny: I used encrypted_data_bag_secret for mysql passwords.
[2013-03-21 15:18:41 -0400] sunny: I added following lines in server.rb recipe of mysql cookbook 
[2013-03-21 15:18:57 -0400] sunny: secrets = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("secrets", "mysql") if secrets && mysql_passwords = secrets[node.chef_environment]   node.default['mysql']['server_root_password'] = mysql_passwords['root']   node.default['mysql']['server_repl_password'] = mysql_passwords['repl']   node.default['mysql']['server_debian_password'] = mysql_passwords['debian'] end
[2013-03-21 15:19:20 -0400] sunny: I created node up in the EC2.
[2013-03-21 15:19:33 -0400] sunny: I sshed into node.
[2013-03-21 15:19:42 -0400] sunny: I tried to login into mysql using password I provided when I created secret data bag.
[2013-03-21 15:20:24 -0400] sunny: I am not able to login into mysql using password I provided
[2013-03-21 15:21:29 -0400] sunny: I have repeated whole process couple of times
[2013-03-21 15:22:12 -0400] sunny: any one came across this kind of problem??
[2013-03-21 15:24:15 -0400] sunny: any idea??
[2013-03-21 15:33:17 -0400] jtimberman: HI
[2013-03-21 15:34:39 -0400] jtimberman: sunny: can you gist the code from your recipe? it's kind of hard to read on a single line
[2013-03-21 15:46:36 -0400] sunny: secrets = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("secrets", "mysql")
[2013-03-21 15:46:53 -0400] sunny: if secrets && mysql_passwords = secrets[node.chef_environment]
[2013-03-21 15:47:05 -0400] sunny: node.default['mysql']['server_root_password'] = mysql_passwords['root']
[2013-03-21 15:47:15 -0400] sunny: node.default['mysql']['server_repl_password'] = mysql_passwords['repl']
[2013-03-21 15:47:25 -0400] sunny: node.default['mysql']['server_debian_password'] = mysql_passwords['debian']
[2013-03-21 15:47:35 -0400] sunny: end
[2013-03-21 15:48:25 -0400] sunny: this is custom code I added into mysql 
[2013-03-21 15:49:09 -0400] sunny: recipe
[2013-03-21 18:42:33 -0400] mauo: hey can anyone answer a chef getting started guide question?
[2013-03-21 18:43:38 -0400] jaqque: i MAY be able to, since i have been going through it recently myself
[2013-03-21 18:43:47 -0400] jaqque: but i have zero association with opscode
[2013-03-21 18:44:42 -0400] mauo: in particular..i have a question about bootstraping the vagrant vm -- the guid tells you bootstrap localhost -- but i don't understand how knife would know localhost is my vagrant vm...the bootstrap runs but nothing happens on the vm -- verification fails
[2013-03-21 18:45:06 -0400] ngrayson: vagrant handles taht
[2013-03-21 18:45:08 -0400] mauo: i tried asigning the vm an ip -- that lets me ssh vagrant@ip_address but then knife has connection errors
[2013-03-21 18:45:20 -0400] ngrayson: it forwards 2222 on localhost to 22 in the vm
[2013-03-21 18:45:30 -0400] jaqque: once i got the vagrant virtualbox instance up, everything worked fine
[2013-03-21 18:45:37 -0400] ngrayson: if you want to just ssh just to `vagrant ssh`
[2013-03-21 18:46:20 -0400] mauo: yeah vagrant ssh works...but knife bootstrap <options> don't appear to exec on the vm -- when i check for the aliases there not there
[2013-03-21 18:46:50 -0400] ngrayson: what is the command you are running?
[2013-03-21 18:51:24 -0400] mauo: i guess i'll retrace my steps...i can't get the vm to bootstrap
[2013-03-21 18:56:27 -0400] ngrayson: what command are you running to bootstrap?
[2013-03-21 19:03:37 -0400] mauo: i must of borked something in the setup i destroyed the vm and readded the box from a local copy and it appears that knife is now bootstraping correctly
[2013-03-21 19:04:58 -0400] mauo: ...however now i am running into a problem with the apache recipe -- i get an exception in the install block -- rcving 100 when expecting 0 -- @ngrayson i am running knife bootstrap with the given options
[2013-03-21 19:05:48 -0400] ngrayson: well the bootstrap worked
[2013-03-21 19:05:57 -0400] ngrayson: can you gist the error?
[2013-03-21 19:07:20 -0400] mauo: yep -> https://gist.github.com/mauriciosilva/5215742
[2013-03-21 19:07:51 -0400] mauo: trying to install manually to see if get an exception -- but it looks okay so far
[2013-03-21 19:27:10 -0400] ngrayson: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_package.html
[2013-03-21 19:27:20 -0400] ngrayson: you dont' need the ()'s around the package name
[2013-03-21 19:27:29 -0400] ngrayson: wait nvm
[2013-03-21 19:29:19 -0400] ngrayson: what is your node['apache']['package'] set to?
[2013-03-21 21:38:47 -0400] caspyin: Hi all. Is "build" a resource like "script" or "bash"? I see it used in the omnibus-software project but can't find any documentation on it.
