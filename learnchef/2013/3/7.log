[2013-03-07 03:56:08 -0500] jtimberman: jebenexer: better to ask that kind of question in #chef, generally speaking. or after "business hours" in the US, post to the chef users mailing list.
[2013-03-07 03:57:06 -0500] jebenexer: alright, I think I'm making progress though, found /opt/chef-server/embedded/cookbooks/chef-server/recipes/nginx.rb
[2013-03-07 10:25:42 -0500] haan: Hi! I have just added a new node, ubuntu 12.10 instead of 12.04, and chef-solo 11.04 instead of 10.16; Now, all my existing recipes are throwing up exceptions, claiming "uninitialized constant Opscode::Openssl", and later "uninitialized constant Opscode::Mysql".
[2013-03-07 10:27:02 -0500] haan: I'll try #chef too...
[2013-03-07 16:01:19 -0500] ColinR: So I have an attributes/default.rb file that defines an attribute for a logstash output configuration, e.g. default['logstash']['server']['outputs'] = [   :graphite => {     :host => "#{search(:node, node.logstash.graphite_query)[0]['ipaddress']}",     :metrics => ["logstash.other.events", "1"]   } ]
[2013-03-07 16:01:36 -0500] ColinR: search doesn't work in this file, but I need to dynamically set the host value. Is there a way to use search for setting an attribute in the attributes/default.rb file or will I need to set another attribute in a recipe and then have my logstash output reference that attribute?

[2013-03-07 16:25:17 -0500] holojorge: does anybody have a good service definition that identifies when the service is starting for the first time and when is getting restarted after configuration change?
[2013-03-07 20:42:38 -0500] guest511613: hey guys, when are the virtual office hours starting?
