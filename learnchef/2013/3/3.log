[2013-03-03 19:57:06 -0500] ShawnMcCool: i have all of my cookbooks etc up on hosted chef, but i was wondering if i could ask a few questions about data bags. for example, with chef-solo i have a data_bags folder that is identified within my Vagrantfile. Then, i have data_bags/sites/local.json
[2013-03-03 19:57:21 -0500] ShawnMcCool: and that's it, just that one file within one sub-folder, but i'm unclear as to how to get that data bag implemented correctly with hosted chef
