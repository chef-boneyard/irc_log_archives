[2013-03-29 10:55:15 -0400] shay-: what is best practise to manage files like sudoers? would you recommend to create a own cookbook and manage entries with attributes?
[2013-03-29 14:42:46 -0400] ast__: Hello.
[2013-03-29 14:43:07 -0400] ast__: Could someone help me with recipe for users cookbook?
[2013-03-29 14:50:29 -0400] ast__: I want do add many ssh-keys in one user from different data_bags.
[2013-03-29 15:16:20 -0400] rep0st: ast__: can you clarify? Typically you can have many ssh keys for a single user in a data bag. 
[2013-03-29 15:16:38 -0400] rep0st: and i hope we're talking about public keys?
[2013-03-29 15:28:54 -0400] ast__: Yes, we talk about public keys. I have a single user and many developers with own's public key's. And I want to add these keys to a one single user in a system.
[2013-03-29 15:32:21 -0400] ast__: Sorry for my english...

[2013-03-29 15:39:04 -0400] Drewzar: ast__: Here's an old cookbook we used to do the same thing, https://gist.github.com/Drewzar/5271597
[2013-03-29 15:39:20 -0400] souschefhobbes: using knife ec2 server create ... -j '{"my_att" : "value"}'   
[2013-03-29 15:39:45 -0400] souschefhobbes: where I pass a JSON string... i should be able to access it in a recipe using node['my_att']?
[2013-03-29 15:43:02 -0400] ast__: @Drewzar I will try this, thanks
[2013-03-29 15:44:23 -0400] ast__: @souschefhobbes I wanted to keep all my user in a one place and use roles for manage it. Maybe I do not correctly doing this...
[2013-03-29 16:44:30 -0400] souschefhobbes: What would prevent the first-boot.json being loaded with attributes?
[2013-03-29 16:44:40 -0400] souschefhobbes: It is only accepting my run-list.
[2013-03-29 17:09:23 -0400] dillyjay: i'm trying to install test-kitchen via bundler and Gemfile, but it's breaking vagrant (v1.1.2). the test-kitchen available according to rubygems.org is version 0.7.0. the gemspec for v0.7.0 adds a dependency on the vagrant gem. vagrant 1.1 no longer supports gem installation, and installing the gem breaks vagrant. 
[2013-03-29 17:09:52 -0400] dillyjay: the github repo for opscode/test-kitchen has a 1.0 branch, which does not list vagrant as a dependency
[2013-03-29 17:12:39 -0400] dillyjay: how should this be solved? ignore dependencies when installing test-kitchen gem?
[2013-03-29 22:15:36 -0400] shoelessone: hi all
[2013-03-29 22:17:55 -0400] shoelessone: So, I'm learning vagrant, and I'm learning chef, and of course I'm having some issues. In particular, my goal is to 1) setup a LAMP stack with vagrant/chef that allows me to run a PHP application, test it in my OSX environment by visiting (for instance "http://test.com") and be able to develop locally with PHPStorm
