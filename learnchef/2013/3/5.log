[2013-03-05 12:55:11 -0500] Saritha: I'm trying to install java thru opsworks, using cookbooks for java here https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/java. Getting Caught exception during execution of custom recipe: java: Chef::Exceptions::CookbookNotFound. 
[2013-03-05 12:56:29 -0500] Saritha: I strongly suspect it is to do with folder structure in /opt/aws/opsworks/current/site-cookbooks/. Any one came across this issue?
