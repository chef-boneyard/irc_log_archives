[2013-03-27 06:48:21 -0400] Ogil: hello
[2013-03-27 17:36:35 -0400] dillyjay: is it permitted to nest roles? i.e. place one role in the run list of another role?
[2013-03-27 17:40:21 -0400] maplebed: yes
[2013-03-27 17:40:56 -0400] maplebed: I have a role "base" that gets included in may other roles.
[2013-03-27 17:42:21 -0400] behemphi: Hey dillyjay you can certainly do this, but the question is "is it a good idea".  Nested roles could be pretty tough to reason about when something goes wrong. This is especially true if you are using attributes at the role level.
[2013-03-27 17:43:12 -0400] dillyjay: behemphi: is there a more suitable approach for "bootstrapping" machines? i figure all of my machines will need sudo, apt, and ntp
[2013-03-27 17:43:53 -0400] behemphi: Like @maplebed I have a base role too
[2013-03-27 17:44:07 -0400] behemphi: that was a total typo
[2013-03-27 17:44:24 -0400] behemphi: Unlike @maplebed I don't have a base role. I have a base cookbook that is applied in all roles
[2013-03-27 17:44:36 -0400] behemphi: all my common packages and shell user management goes there
[2013-03-27 17:44:47 -0400] dillyjay: so your "base" cookbook is what i called a "bootstrap" role?
[2013-03-27 17:45:16 -0400] behemphi: yes
[2013-03-27 17:45:42 -0400] behemphi: knife rackspace server create -E 'production' -r "role[web-server]' -S web1 -N web1 -f 4
[2013-03-27 17:45:57 -0400] behemphi: that brings up a fully configured webserver from the ground up
[2013-03-27 17:46:09 -0400] behemphi: and is what I take you to mean by "bootstrap"
[2013-03-27 17:46:28 -0400] dillyjay: and why is it better suited as a cookbook/recipe than a role that gets extended? i'm not saying that it isn't, i'm just curious
[2013-03-27 17:47:11 -0400] behemphi: I try to arrange things with the idea that something will go wrong.  I find that  a flat run_list helps me
[2013-03-27 17:47:20 -0400] behemphi: knife role show "production"
[2013-03-27 17:47:29 -0400] behemphi: and bam a list of cookbooks
[2013-03-27 17:47:32 -0400] behemphi: no further digging
[2013-03-27 17:48:02 -0400] behemphi: It is an internal fight I ahve dev vs admin.  The dev in me wants better abstraction.  The admin wants utter simplicity
[2013-03-27 17:48:31 -0400] dillyjay: makes sense. i am designer, then a dev, and now trying to pick up sysadmin to earn residual income on hosting. 
[2013-03-27 17:48:52 -0400] dillyjay: but i like to do everything in the proper way, embracing best practices; your explanation makes sense
[2013-03-27 17:48:57 -0400] behemphi: @nathenharvey just hosted a couple of FoodFightShow s on this topic.  I am really curious if he has a strong thought
[2013-03-27 17:49:26 -0400] ngrayson: a lot a people are moving away from roles at all
[2013-03-27 17:49:39 -0400] behemphi: @dillyjay chef (ruby) is more like perl in that there is more than one way, so "best practice" is a bit of a dirty phrase
[2013-03-27 17:49:46 -0400] ngrayson: just use one application cookbook to control everything
[2013-03-27 17:50:03 -0400] behemphi: lol ngrayson  and one cookbook to control them all!
[2013-03-27 17:50:07 -0400] behemphi: I will name it Sauron
[2013-03-27 17:50:11 -0400] dillyjay: ngrayson: even if you're provisioning multiple machines with well-defined responsibilities?
[2013-03-27 17:50:21 -0400] ngrayson: you have one cookbook per node
[2013-03-27 17:50:26 -0400] behemphi: It is a neat idea, I just have not had time to think my way through it
[2013-03-27 17:50:39 -0400] behemphi: are you doing it that way?
[2013-03-27 17:50:54 -0400] ngrayson: yes
[2013-03-27 17:51:09 -0400] ngrayson: we started using berkshelf to manage them
[2013-03-27 17:51:15 -0400] ngrayson: http://berkshelf.com/
[2013-03-27 17:51:19 -0400] dillyjay: ngrayson: where were you when i spent the better part of this week reading all this d*mn documentation
[2013-03-27 17:51:19 -0400] behemphi: one cookbook per node seems odd though I have 140 nodes.  Many of them identical.  
[2013-03-27 17:51:38 -0400] ngrayson: right that recipe is used on more then one node
[2013-03-27 17:51:42 -0400] behemphi: is it more like one cookbook per over-arching function?
[2013-03-27 17:51:50 -0400] ngrayson: it's like your web-server role
[2013-03-27 17:51:50 -0400] behemphi: ah OK
[2013-03-27 17:51:53 -0400] ngrayson: but it's a recipe
[2013-03-27 17:51:57 -0400] ngrayson: so it's versioned
[2013-03-27 17:52:04 -0400] behemphi: I get it, was trying to not use the word "role" 
[2013-03-27 17:52:11 -0400] ngrayson: lol yeah
[2013-03-27 17:52:20 -0400] behemphi: interesting
[2013-03-27 17:52:27 -0400] ngrayson: berkshelf is where i would suggest starting if you are trying to learn chef
[2013-03-27 17:52:42 -0400] behemphi: Berkshelf is another tool I need to look at (along with librarian).  
[2013-03-27 17:52:44 -0400] ngrayson: it manages all of your upstream cookbooks for you
[2013-03-27 17:52:58 -0400] ngrayson: it's a replacement for librarion
[2013-03-27 17:53:24 -0400] behemphi: dillyjay:  I agree using something like berkshelf or librarian is a good idea.  
[2013-03-27 17:53:36 -0400] dillyjay: i am using librarian
[2013-03-27 17:53:54 -0400] dillyjay: i just started with ruby this week though; so. many. gems.
[2013-03-27 17:54:02 -0400] ngrayson: the biggest difference is how they are controled
[2013-03-27 17:54:13 -0400] ngrayson: berkshelt does a git repo per cookbook
[2013-03-27 17:54:36 -0400] ngrayson: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slF72K03ixM&feature=youtu.be is the food fight show for berkshelf
[2013-03-27 17:55:13 -0400] dillyjay: ok, complete dummy's question here: the php cookbook on the opscode site has an attribute for "checksum". is that just the MD5 hash underneath the install on php.net/downloads.php?
[2013-03-27 17:55:39 -0400] behemphi: The big thing that has me interested in Berkshelf is the lack of managing git subprojects.  
[2013-03-27 17:55:46 -0400] ngrayson: yes
[2013-03-27 17:55:54 -0400] ngrayson: it's amazing at managing that for you
[2013-03-27 17:56:08 -0400] ngrayson: we just have a namespace for all cookbook repos
[2013-03-27 17:57:24 -0400] dillyjay: ok, so that is something i was puzzled about the other day. there are a bunch of cookbooks that i want to modify. i'm having trouble deciding whether i should override attributes, fork the repo and modify it, etc.
[2013-03-27 17:57:37 -0400] dillyjay: and if i do that, do i create a bagillion git submodules?
[2013-03-27 17:57:40 -0400] behemphi: @dillyjay
[2013-03-27 17:57:43 -0400] dillyjay: (note: i hate submodules)
[2013-03-27 17:57:53 -0400] behemphi: There is the notion of "wrapper cookbooks" to service yo uthere
[2013-03-27 17:58:07 -0400] dillyjay: hm, did not see that in my research this week, will look into it
[2013-03-27 17:58:11 -0400] behemphi: write a cookbook that overides the attributes in the community cookbook
[2013-03-27 17:58:20 -0400] behemphi: and write recipes for the customizations you want to do
[2013-03-27 17:58:29 -0400] behemphi: I _just_ finished doing this with nginx
[2013-03-27 17:58:48 -0400] dillyjay: ok, so don't just override the attributes in the role/node definition?
[2013-03-27 17:59:08 -0400] behemphi: I am pretty religious about never directly altering a community cookbook.  I think that is what has saved me real trouble without librarian or berkshelf
[2013-03-27 17:59:45 -0400] behemphi: the general consensus (note I did not say best practice :-) is that attributes in roles should be avoided.
[2013-03-27 18:00:12 -0400] behemphi: If you do it on th enode directly you have scaling and consistency issues
[2013-03-27 18:00:15 -0400] behemphi: I have about 50 web servers
[2013-03-27 18:00:23 -0400] behemphi: I don't want to manually set node data for each
[2013-03-27 18:00:53 -0400] behemphi: and any manual process or script outside the chef ecosystem in potential for inconsistency
[2013-03-27 18:01:54 -0400] ngrayson: dillyjay behemphi wrapper cookbooks are a great idea
[2013-03-27 18:01:58 -0400] dillyjay: yeah, i didn't type what i meant to say
[2013-03-27 18:02:11 -0400] ngrayson: we are switching to them as we speak
[2013-03-27 18:02:33 -0400] ngrayson: http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-write-reusable-chef-cookbooks.html
[2013-03-27 18:02:39 -0400] ngrayson: good post on that topic
[2013-03-27 18:02:45 -0400] behemphi: I am in the middle of doing the same ngrayson
[2013-03-27 18:02:59 -0400] behemphi: that blog is Brian Berry another FoodFightSHow host 
[2013-03-27 18:03:04 -0400] ngrayson: yep
[2013-03-27 18:03:07 -0400] behemphi: great guy and deep thinker
[2013-03-27 18:03:33 -0400] behemphi: He is the one I am parroting with, "roles are aliases for run_lists"
[2013-03-27 18:10:03 -0400] rep0st: in my honest opinion attributes that are set in roles should be set with the notion that that attribute won't ever have to change. 
[2013-03-27 18:10:13 -0400] rep0st: i.e setting search domains, or ntp servers, or dns servers, 
[2013-03-27 18:10:40 -0400] rep0st: roles should be able to paint a picture of the make up of your infrastructure
[2013-03-27 18:11:07 -0400] dillyjay: this part makes sense to the dev in me: "Roles are also a big fat global variable across your entire infrastructure. You can't version them. You can't roll out a new role incrementally. Changing a role instantly affects every node that uses it regardless of its environment."
[2013-03-27 18:11:31 -0400] dillyjay: roll over to a django or symfony discussion and say you're using global anything
[2013-03-27 18:12:47 -0400] behemphi: @rep0st I look at environment level attributes that way
[2013-03-27 18:12:59 -0400] behemphi: My only role level attributes are for NTP
[2013-03-27 18:13:05 -0400] behemphi: b/c the cookbook requires them
[2013-03-27 18:13:26 -0400] behemphi: and dillyjay that "globalness" is biting me hard with our current rollout
[2013-03-27 18:13:38 -0400] rep0st: behemphi: but then you can't utilize environments for cookbook developments 
[2013-03-27 18:13:43 -0400] behemphi: thus the reason I have been thinking about it so much
[2013-03-27 18:14:03 -0400] behemphi: not sure what you mean @rep0st
[2013-03-27 18:14:22 -0400] ngrayson: my thinking is that setting all attributes in a cookbook makes the most sense since they are versioned
[2013-03-27 18:14:26 -0400] dillyjay: now all that needs to happen for this truly to be the best sysadmin setup for devs is instituting inheritance
[2013-03-27 18:14:33 -0400] behemphi: for me, I have environements corresponding so the size of a cluster.  So i have sensible defaults for the servers there is all.  
[2013-03-27 18:14:33 -0400] ngrayson: roles are run list aliases only
[2013-03-27 18:14:45 -0400] ngrayson: environments are cookbook version pinning systems only
[2013-03-27 18:14:48 -0400] rep0st: @behemphi: so, when i work on a cookbook i increment the version of that cookbook then i execute the following `knife cookbook upload bob -E dev`
[2013-03-27 18:15:57 -0400] behemphi: we keep the envs in source control
[2013-03-27 18:16:06 -0400] behemphi: and change them as we change the versions.  
[2013-03-27 18:16:18 -0400] ngrayson: rep0st that just updates that environment's pin to the one you are uploading right?
[2013-03-27 18:16:22 -0400] behemphi: our script to move from dev to test to prod handles keeping our versions in sync
[2013-03-27 18:16:33 -0400] behemphi: but we keep all our internal cookbooks locked to the same verion
[2013-03-27 18:16:44 -0400] ngrayson: what format do you use to keep them in vcs?
[2013-03-27 18:16:49 -0400] rep0st: ngrayson: that's correct
[2013-03-27 18:16:49 -0400] behemphi: we do that by having a .version file and having metadata.rb read that file for the current version
[2013-03-27 18:16:58 -0400] ngrayson: ruby dsl or json?
[2013-03-27 18:17:08 -0400] behemphi: <yuck>json</yuck>
[2013-03-27 18:17:18 -0400] ngrayson: yeah taht is the only way to compare them though
[2013-03-27 18:17:18 -0400] behemphi: I could not find good doc on the ruby dsl at the time
[2013-03-27 18:17:27 -0400] dillyjay: like, instead of having to chef-rewind, it would be fantastic if i could say, `my-php` cookbook "extends" the official `php` cookbook. then, before things are written in, the configurations are merged
[2013-03-27 18:17:48 -0400] rep0st: behemphi: well to be fair chef was menat to be used base on what the current workflow and business requirements dictate
[2013-03-27 18:18:14 -0400] rep0st: behemphi: but in our environment we have multiple products that could have a different mysql configuration. 
[2013-03-27 18:18:22 -0400] ngrayson: dillyjay you only need to rewind changes that need to be made in cookbooks
[2013-03-27 18:18:34 -0400] ngrayson: most of the changes will be attributes
[2013-03-27 18:18:39 -0400] rep0st: so we use the chef-environments to keep those application cookbooks pinned to ensure data leakage from a role doesn't get introduced
[2013-03-27 18:18:43 -0400] behemphi: Makes total sense @rep0st  For us, we release the same app 50+ times
[2013-03-27 18:18:54 -0400] behemphi: in differnet sizes and configs
[2013-03-27 18:19:04 -0400] dillyjay: ngrayson: right, but i do need to make changes to cookbooks
[2013-03-27 18:19:04 -0400] ngrayson: rep0st do you set any attributes in your environments?
[2013-03-27 18:19:17 -0400] behemphi: so I can see where your use case would preclude the use of the env like I am talking about
[2013-03-27 18:20:28 -0400] rep0st: ngrayson: absolutely. We set attributes in our chef-envrionment that are product specific. like i said, since my company has multiple products that could hvae different tomcat xml files we need to be able to ensure those settings for that specific product get set no matter what, hence hoping to achieve idempotence
[2013-03-27 18:21:12 -0400] dillyjay: ngrayson: and it shouldn't be the responsibility of the official cookbook writer to keep up with all the different idiosyncrasies of popular packages
[2013-03-27 18:21:28 -0400] rep0st: ngrayson: our roles only set "system" specific values. When i say system i mean dns, ntp, smtp relayhost. etc. settings that don't really change, but if they need to change can be changed at will. 
[2013-03-27 18:21:33 -0400] ngrayson: how do you make sure that when you promote a uat or dev to prod you don't overwrite attrs that are supposed to be different?
[2013-03-27 18:22:20 -0400] ngrayson: rep0st ^
[2013-03-27 18:22:42 -0400] ngrayson: dillyjay well they are pretty good and generic though in most cases
[2013-03-27 18:23:18 -0400] rep0st: ngrayson: thanks for the tag i almost got confused. Since we're at the early stages of adopting chef into our environment. We recently just moved away from using golden image. There's a sseperate team that handles code releases. In my point of view, the release process won't be integrated with chef in the near future. We have some pidgeon holes that we need to clear up befure integrating chef with code releases.
[2013-03-27 18:23:42 -0400] dillyjay: i agree; i just think allowing for cookbook inheritance or extension would make them better :)
[2013-03-27 18:25:00 -0400] ngrayson: rep0st we are looking at writing a knife plugin that promotes the right attrs from one env to the next by keeping lists of which attrs are promotable and which ones are env specific 
[2013-03-27 18:25:30 -0400] ngrayson: dillyjay it would be nice but i still think rewind is better than rebasing your forks
[2013-03-27 18:25:55 -0400] dillyjay: not sure what rebasing your forks means?
[2013-03-27 18:26:43 -0400] ngrayson: if you fork an opscode cookbook you will want those updates from opscode when they get pushed
[2013-03-27 18:26:55 -0400] ngrayson: you will have to rebase the upstream changes in
[2013-03-27 18:28:12 -0400] dillyjay: what if the `extends` declaration was linked to a git repo?
[2013-03-27 18:28:36 -0400] ngrayson: that is kind of what berkshelf does
[2013-03-27 18:28:54 -0400] ngrayson: it sets the upstream cookbook location then lets you change things with rewind
[2013-03-27 18:29:04 -0400] ngrayson: idk of another way of doing it currently
[2013-03-27 18:29:18 -0400] dillyjay: i should probably read about berkshelf before i think there's something i'd do differently
[2013-03-27 18:29:38 -0400] dillyjay: the "rewind" part is what gets me though
[2013-03-27 18:29:59 -0400] ngrayson: yeah
[2013-03-27 18:30:28 -0400] ngrayson: the best part is the vagrant integration 
[2013-03-27 18:31:09 -0400] dillyjay: bc i don't like the million times i will definitely fall for the gotcha on the chef-rewind doc page
[2013-03-27 18:32:19 -0400] dillyjay: so i'd rather have a cookbook directory with the same name, an extends declaration, and a lock file somewhere that says what commit from the official cookbook my extension is based on
[2013-03-27 18:32:47 -0400] ngrayson: i think that is easier said than done
[2013-03-27 18:33:42 -0400] dillyjay: why? not trying to be petulant, just curious. facilitating it is definitely way beyond my capabilities.
[2013-03-27 18:34:38 -0400] behemphi: I am pretty sure opscode would have to embed VCS at that point.  
[2013-03-27 18:35:12 -0400] behemphi: or write some sort of least common denom
[2013-03-27 18:35:32 -0400] behemphi: b/c gthe notion of a commit and branch differ from CVS to SVN to GIT etc
[2013-03-27 18:35:53 -0400] dillyjay: i didn't know there was svn support
[2013-03-27 18:36:10 -0400] behemphi: Chef itself is VCS agnostic
[2013-03-27 18:36:11 -0400] ngrayson: well chef doesn't really know about git
[2013-03-27 18:36:16 -0400] ngrayson: yeah
[2013-03-27 18:36:21 -0400] behemphi: Opscode uses git as their VCS
[2013-03-27 18:36:40 -0400] behemphi: so git "feels" like it belongs there
[2013-03-27 18:36:42 -0400] ngrayson: when you upload to a chef server it doesn't care where it got the files
[2013-03-27 18:37:00 -0400] dillyjay: i suppose that's responsible of chef...
[2013-03-27 19:31:43 -0400] vincentmac: Question:  I'm trying to deploy an app from a private git repo (following http://docs.opscode.com/resource_deploy.html).  How should I handle my private key?  I don't want my private key stored as a file in my cookbook.  Should I store it in an [encrypted] data bag and then use a template to create the private deploy_key?
