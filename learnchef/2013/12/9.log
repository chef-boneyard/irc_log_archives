[2013-12-09 16:07:11 -0500] yeo_: can you bootstrap a client from the client?
[2013-12-09 16:10:41 -0500] yeo_: i dont' have a publicly accessible IP which is why i can't do it using knife from my workstation
[2013-12-09 16:11:22 -0500] yeo_: my client doesn't have a publicly accessible IP
[2013-12-09 16:58:24 -0500] bean__: yeo_: doesn't need a public ip afaik?
[2013-12-09 17:10:06 -0500] jidar: so I've got this recipe that I pulled down to allow me to edit users, https://github.com/fnichol/chef-user but I don't quite understand how to utilize it. It says to add it to the runlist, which I've done and now the resource 'user_account' will be available
[2013-12-09 17:10:41 -0500] jidar: but I'm not quite sure where to utilize the resource, 'user_account' is this something that I should be doing inside of another cookbook?
[2013-12-09 17:11:00 -0500] jidar: ie: a cookbook that comes after the users cookbook in the runlist
[2013-12-09 17:43:54 -0500] bean__: jidar: yes
[2013-12-09 17:44:00 -0500] jidar: this damn thing
[2013-12-09 17:44:09 -0500] jidar: overwrites my ssh keys everytime it runs
[2013-12-09 17:48:37 -0500] bean__: what thing?
[2013-12-09 17:48:40 -0500] bean__: chef-user?
[2013-12-09 18:01:40 -0500] jidar: yea, chef-user, I ended up just stuffing the right keys in there and having it overwrite the values that are already there with them...
[2013-12-09 18:46:36 -0500] yeo_: how would i bootstrap to opscode's chef server with my client that doesn't have a publicly-accessible IP?
[2013-12-09 18:48:00 -0500] tligda: You would have to run a VPN between your chef server and chef client.
[2013-12-09 18:48:33 -0500] yeo_: so no way i can do the bootstrapping FROM my client?
[2013-12-09 18:48:53 -0500] yeo_: wihtout having to VPN
[2013-12-09 18:49:14 -0500] tligda: No way that I'm aware of.
[2013-12-09 18:49:24 -0500] yeo_: got it
[2013-12-09 18:49:26 -0500] yeo_: thank you
[2013-12-09 19:24:45 -0500] yeo_: if i have different types of web servers, should i be creating a recipe for each web server type? or using attributes to customize settings? or attributes in roles?
[2013-12-09 19:47:07 -0500] mmzyk: yeo_ I think the answer is that depends.
[2013-12-09 19:47:49 -0500] mmzyk: In short, do what works for you.
[2013-12-09 19:48:30 -0500] mmzyk: But to riff a bit, if you're webservers are getting the same software but configured differently, that's probalby something you would have the same recipes across them, but then have different attributes and roles for.
[2013-12-09 19:48:41 -0500] mmzyk: To configure what needs configuring.
[2013-12-09 19:49:08 -0500] mmzyk: You might as in chef and see what the recommendation there is and see what a wider audience considers as a best practice.
[2013-12-09 19:55:24 -0500] yeo_: yeah i figured it could be handled a number of way, but i was looking for best practices
[2013-12-09 19:55:33 -0500] yeo_: thanks mmzyk
[2013-12-09 22:12:12 -0500] jidar: when you bootstrap a server, the hostname/ip you use to connect to the machine is that passed in anywhere as a variable?
[2013-12-09 22:19:40 -0500] AcesWayUpHigh: node['fqdn'] node['ipaddress'] http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_attributes.html ?
[2013-12-09 22:21:06 -0500] jidar: so the fqdn is wrong when the server boots, ie: hostname returns ip-x-x-x-x.ec2.local or whichever
[2013-12-09 22:21:10 -0500] jidar: but I've got dns already configured
[2013-12-09 22:21:21 -0500] jidar: let me read this doc first though
[2013-12-09 22:21:50 -0500] AcesWayUpHigh: jidar, you prob have to set your hostname properly on your server
[2013-12-09 22:22:03 -0500] jidar: then what's the point of using a bootstraper?
[2013-12-09 22:22:41 -0500] AcesWayUpHigh: bootstrapper just intalls the chef client and does an initial run
[2013-12-09 22:24:22 -0500] jidar: seems sort of weird that I can't just bootstrap a recipe and have it do what I'm asking
[2013-12-09 22:45:37 -0500] jidar: oh ok
[2013-12-09 22:45:56 -0500] jidar: so you can pass in the -N 'foo.foo.com' and I've got fqdn-cookbook that helps out
[2013-12-09 22:46:16 -0500] jidar: looks like its not persistant though, so that might be something else
[2013-12-09 22:46:40 -0500] jidar: I take that back, it adds a hosts file entry
