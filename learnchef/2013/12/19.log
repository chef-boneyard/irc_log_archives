[2013-12-19 20:25:02 -0500] vt102: Using knife vsphere, and hitting a vCenter server using AD creds.  I can not get "foo\bar" to work in any combo in my knife.rb file.  From the cli with --vspass 'foo\bar', it works just fine.  Any suggestions?
[2013-12-19 20:25:49 -0500] vt102: My assumption was that it was getting expanded, so I started just throwing more backslashes in.  Went all the way to knife[:vpshere_user] = 'foo\\\\bar'  with no succes.
[2013-12-19 20:27:40 -0500] vt102: UGH!!!  Misspelled vsphere.  Of course I see it once I ask in channel.  LOL
[2013-12-19 23:32:24 -0500] boldfield: I've got an issue that I've been spinning my wheels on that I was hoping someone could help me with.  I've got a function in one of my cookbook libraries that depends on evaluating the home directory of a user provided by a package in a nodes run list. The issue I'm bumping into is that when the library is initially imported (during converg?) a line of code containing "Dir.home(user)" is being evaluated
[2013-12-19 23:34:05 -0500] boldfield: because it's being evaluated before any recipes have actually run, the user does not yet exist... anyone have any idea of how I can avoid this?  Ive tried using a ruby block with action :nothing that subscribes to the package of interest, but the code seems to still be evaluated early
[2013-12-19 23:54:22 -0500] boldfield: n.m. figured out a work around
[2013-12-19 23:55:35 -0500] boldfield: for interested parties, it was to set action to :nothing, create a ruby_block which subscribed to the package resource which set the attribute of interest inside the block and notified the bash resource
[2013-12-19 23:55:46 -0500] boldfield: now... figure out how to get it to run if the package is already installed...
