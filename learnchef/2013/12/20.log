[2013-12-20 02:39:50 -0500] dmg412: when going through the intro to chef tutorial I am getting an error dealing with " Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/readline/lib/libreadline.6.2.dylib (LoadError)" when trying to bootstrap the vagrant box
[2013-12-20 15:08:28 -0500] mikeh: What is the best SSH client to use on windows when you are working with knife (bootstrapping, chef-client, etc.)?
[2013-12-20 15:11:27 -0500] wowowewa: :D
[2013-12-20 15:15:51 -0500] micgo: mikeh: you don't need a SSH client to work with knife
[2013-12-20 15:16:05 -0500] micgo: but Putty is pretty much the standard I've found on windows
[2013-12-20 15:16:49 -0500] micgo: knife uses openssh internally to communicate to servers/nodes over ssh when you run "knife ssh" or "knife bootstrap"
[2013-12-20 15:17:15 -0500] mikeh: thx micgo
[2013-12-20 15:17:29 -0500] mikeh: wouldnt the machine you are bootstrapping need an ssh server though?
[2013-12-20 15:17:40 -0500] mikeh: how would knife connect without that?
[2013-12-20 15:19:26 -0500] micgo: mikeh: yes, the server you are connecting to would need a ssh server, which most *nix systems have built in. If you need to manage windows servers, you can use knife-windows and go through winrm instead
[2013-12-20 15:19:41 -0500] micgo: https://github.com/opscode/knife-windows
[2013-12-20 15:19:57 -0500] micgo: then you just need to ensure that winrm is enabled on your windows servers
[2013-12-20 15:20:26 -0500] mikeh: ah, ok.  that makes sense.  thx for the help
[2013-12-20 15:38:27 -0500] Zack_: Hello, Is anyone here that is active?
[2013-12-20 15:40:44 -0500] Zack_: Anyway, my question is that I downloaded a local chef server from http://www.getchef.com/chef/install/ and installed it on a VM. It works fine but I don't see the option to create/manage Organizations on the web view. Can anyone explain why this option is not here?
[2013-12-20 15:42:09 -0500] nicgrayson: Zack_: the OSS version doesn't have orgs
[2013-12-20 15:42:43 -0500] Zack_: Ah OK
[2013-12-20 15:43:13 -0500] nicgrayson: Zack_: it's assumed that if you are running it it's for your org
[2013-12-20 15:44:30 -0500] Zack_: Well we are an organization but we want multiple internal organizations, such as Engineering, QA, etc. 
[2013-12-20 15:44:39 -0500] jonlives: Zack_: yeah only the private and hosted versions of enterprise chef support multiple orgs. The open source version only allows one.
[2013-12-20 15:44:49 -0500] Zack_: Does that make sense to do that or should there always just be one organization?
[2013-12-20 15:45:06 -0500] jonlives: Zack_: what do you want to seperate between orgs?
[2013-12-20 15:45:19 -0500] jonlives: everything including users etc, or just cookbook versions etc?
[2013-12-20 15:46:09 -0500] Zack_: We want to separate certain things since there are different types of engineers etc.  
[2013-12-20 15:46:24 -0500] Zack_: could this be done easier with one organization but more roles and enviornments?
[2013-12-20 15:46:40 -0500] jonlives: Zack_: it depends, is the answer
[2013-12-20 15:46:47 -0500] jonlives: that's why I asked what you wanted to partition
[2013-12-20 15:47:24 -0500] jonlives: if you want to maintain totally seperate user lists and infrastructure, you need orgs. if you just want to have different cookbook versions and attributes per "org", you could use environments
[2013-12-20 15:47:49 -0500] jonlives: by "infrastructure" I mean keep your nodes, clients etc totally independant per org.
[2013-12-20 15:48:01 -0500] Zack_: Yeah I think that is what we want
[2013-12-20 15:48:03 -0500] Zack_: ok thanks
[2013-12-20 15:48:08 -0500] jonlives: Zack_: np :)
[2013-12-20 16:27:39 -0500] vt102: Running into versioning issues-- can I use two different versions of a single recipe?  Or I am only able to use one version, period, on a node?
[2013-12-20 16:28:42 -0500] vt102: Looks like just one version, period.
[2013-12-20 16:32:06 -0500] zoobert: Trying to work through some of the tutorials. I had no problems yesterday, but I restarted vagrant, etc. and now I have issues
[2013-12-20 16:32:16 -0500] vt102: Running into problems with yum.  Yum 2.x and 3.x are quite different.  Trying to pin "< 3.0.0", but when using berkshelf, it keeps pulling in modules using 3.x.
[2013-12-20 16:32:28 -0500] zoobert: when I issue knife client list I get multiple items
[2013-12-20 16:37:25 -0500] vt102: I guess what I need to do is also pin back the other recipes pulling in the newer yum...
[2013-12-20 16:48:41 -0500] vt102: Actually, part of my problem is, I'm changing my cookbook, uploading the cookbook, and what the node is getting is still the old version?  The cookbook isn't frozen...why isn't it getting replaced when I upload?
[2013-12-20 16:51:16 -0500] vt102: So...berks is TELLING me it is uploading the cookbooks...but it's probably  lying.  https://github.com/berkshelf/berkshelf/issues/688
[2013-12-20 17:03:06 -0500] ctote: Hey everyone - I keep getting Chef::Exceptions::InvalidRemoteFileURI when specifying default["server_files"] = "\\winmomfs1\3rdParty\Oracle Client\Oracle_11g\win64_11gR2_client.zip" and then trying to access that attribute in my default.rb recipe
