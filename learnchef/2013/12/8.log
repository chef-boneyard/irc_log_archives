[2013-12-08 18:11:32 -0500] mojibake: need a little help with trying to deploy a custom cookbook to write some re-write rules. https://github.com/mojibake-umd/cookbookdeploy/blob/master/rewrite_images/recipes/default.rb
[2013-12-08 18:11:32 -0500] mojibake: AWS error log shows Chef::Exceptions::EnclosingDirectoryDoesNotExist: Parent directory /etc/httpd/sites-available/#{node[:deploy][application]}.conf.d does not exist.
[2013-12-08 18:12:10 -0500] mojibake: If i hard code a directory name in there use an "application" I know exists, it will create the file using the template. So it look like I am just hung up on how to properly reference an attribute supplied by the depoly JSON.
