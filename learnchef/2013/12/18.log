[2013-12-18 20:35:51 -0500] nathenharvey: what questions do you have?  
[2013-12-18 20:36:21 -0500] gestrella: Im using chef + vagrant on a Centos 6.4
[2013-12-18 20:36:32 -0500] gestrella: Centos by default has ruby 1.8.7
[2013-12-18 20:36:47 -0500] gestrella: I need to install a gem that requires ruby 1.9.3
[2013-12-18 20:37:40 -0500] gestrella: I don't want to reinvent the wheel here. I want to know what would be the best practice to install ruby 1.9.3 on this scenario
[2013-12-18 20:38:28 -0500] nathenharvey: You might want to start by looking at vagrant-omnibus - https://github.com/schisamo/vagrant-omnibus
[2013-12-18 20:39:11 -0500] nathenharvey: this will make sure that chef is installed using the omnibus installer and will give you the ruby that comes along with that
[2013-12-18 20:39:31 -0500] nathenharvey: do you need the gem for use with chef or for use with your app?
[2013-12-18 20:39:57 -0500] gestrella: I downloaded a box from www.vagrant.es that already has chef installed.
[2013-12-18 20:40:18 -0500] gestrella: I need the gem for my app
[2013-12-18 20:42:45 -0500] nathenharvey: there are a number of ruby cookbooks on the community site that might help http://community.opscode.com/search?page=1&query=ruby&scope=home
[2013-12-18 20:43:00 -0500] gestrella: ok
[2013-12-18 20:43:03 -0500] gestrella: let me check
[2013-12-18 20:43:22 -0500] nathenharvey: in the past, I've built a ruby package using fpm and then installed that package to replace the default system ruby
[2013-12-18 20:43:33 -0500] nathenharvey: https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm
[2013-12-18 20:44:00 -0500] gestrella: Thats what I want to avoid. I dont want to do something that night be done!
[2013-12-18 20:44:19 -0500] gestrella: let see
[2013-12-18 20:45:09 -0500] nathenharvey: fpm is pretty easy though and might be the best way to go in production anyhow.  having your own ruby package makes sense
[2013-12-18 20:45:12 -0500] nathenharvey: https://gist.github.com/nathenharvey/2634212
[2013-12-18 20:45:22 -0500] nathenharvey: ^^ is an older gist of building ruby
[2013-12-18 20:46:50 -0500] gestrella: Thanks
[2013-12-18 21:25:37 -0500] vt102: What's the correct way to determine what version by opensource server is?  /opt/chef-server/version-manifest.txt says "chef-server 11.0.10" but 11.0.10 doesn't appear to be a release version?
[2013-12-18 21:28:50 -0500] tomduffield: vt102: 11.0.10 is a release version for chef server
[2013-12-18 21:29:22 -0500] tomduffield: vt102: you may be thinking of chef-client, which does not have a 11.0.10
[2013-12-18 21:29:27 -0500] vt102: Yup.  I"m looking at the client versions.  Sorry!
[2013-12-18 21:29:39 -0500] tomduffield: no worries
[2013-12-18 21:29:43 -0500] vt102: But...how do I determine what version of client I should use for that version of server?
[2013-12-18 21:30:04 -0500] vt102: Since they don't match up.
[2013-12-18 21:30:37 -0500] tomduffield: there is no hard dependency 
[2013-12-18 21:30:46 -0500] tomduffield: i would say as long as your are using 11 in both you should be fine
