[2013-12-05 07:01:43 -0500] Lost: hi all
[2013-12-05 07:01:56 -0500] Lost: anybody got time for a quick chef question ?
[2013-12-05 15:14:10 -0500] litch: I'm having a problem getting a recipe to execute - it is appearing in my run list when i run a 'vagrant provision' but doesn't seem to be executing.  How can I troubleshoot this?
[2013-12-05 15:41:26 -0500] CPS: when you use the log resource, where does chef client write logs?
[2013-12-05 15:46:13 -0500] litch: Ok let me try another question.  I'm really really struggling with getting a decently-working ruby running.
[2013-12-05 15:46:32 -0500] litch: I've tried using ruby_build and got ruby 2.0.0 installed, but then my bundler seems to use the omnibus ruby
[2013-12-05 15:46:44 -0500] litch: I am not sure how to convince my system to use a ruby other than omnibus
[2013-12-05 16:05:57 -0500] litch: Hey, there's nathenharvey
[2013-12-05 16:06:34 -0500] litch: Mind if I keep poking at this ruby problem a little bit with you?  (I'm @sototallysweet on twitter)
[2013-12-05 16:06:39 -0500] litch: I'd asked in here first...
[2013-12-05 16:07:09 -0500] nathenharvey: litch: sure.  though I'm multi-tasking so might be slow to answer ;)
[2013-12-05 16:07:33 -0500] nathenharvey: litch: good to hear you've found the webinar and video series helpful.  thanks for letting me know!
[2013-12-05 16:07:39 -0500] litch: Of course!
[2013-12-05 16:09:21 -0500] litch: Sure.  So I have a ruby 2.0.0 build fine on my vagrant instance (using cookbook ruby_build).  I do know that using RVM on production isn't so great...  But I'm having a tough time actually getting my system to use the ruby that I've built in /usr/local/ruby.  I know that there's like "regular" ubnutu ways of fixing this, but I thought that this would be a use case that a community cookbook addressed
[2013-12-05 16:11:39 -0500] litch: I'm starting from the https://opscode-vm.s3.amazonaws.com/vagrant/opscode_ubuntu-12.04-i386_provisionerless.box
[2013-12-05 16:14:27 -0500] litch: Though reading your fpm it looks like you are just clobbering the usr/bin ruby...
[2013-12-05 16:15:49 -0500] nathenharvey: litch: yes.  Just use omnibus-installed ruby for chef.  install a packaged version of the ruby you want on the system
[2013-12-05 16:16:10 -0500] litch: and when bundle runs in my rails app it should use the correct ruby and not the omnibus one?
[2013-12-05 16:16:58 -0500] nathenharvey: litch: it should.  that's what you want to happen.  but, obviously, testing is required.  honestly, it's been a while since I've messed around with that
[2013-12-05 16:17:06 -0500] litch: ok great.  thank you
[2013-12-05 16:18:44 -0500] nathenharvey: litch: hope that helps ;)
[2013-12-05 16:21:22 -0500] litch: me too! =)
[2013-12-05 16:42:06 -0500] cannonball: Running opensource chef-server, a node can connect to server to get config when chef-client or chef-shell is run.  The workstation can connect to server to upload and manage cookbooks, node attributes, etc.  But knife ssh from the workstation (to a node) fails to connect to the requested node.
[2013-12-05 16:42:21 -0500] cannonball: It has to be a certificate missing or not specified, but I'm confused as to which one that would be.
[2013-12-05 16:43:07 -0500] sfalcon: cannonball: can you ssh to the node from your workstation?
[2013-12-05 16:43:41 -0500] cannonball: If I enter the password, yes.
[2013-12-05 16:44:09 -0500] cannonball: I was expecting it to use certs to do everything automatically like knife commands to the server.
[2013-12-05 16:44:17 -0500] cannonball: ...and node connections to the server.
[2013-12-05 16:53:13 -0500] vt102: I'm renaming a bunch of nodes.  What's the correct way to handle that?  Delete the client/node, and then readd with the new name?
[2013-12-05 17:01:30 -0500] sfalcon: cannonball: that requires you to setup authorized_keys on the nodes. Chef doesn't do that automagically for you.
[2013-12-05 17:01:54 -0500] cannonball: roger that, thanks.
[2013-12-05 18:36:20 -0500] paul_andrew: Trying to use test-kitchen on mac, having issues with the installation directory for gems. Seems to depend on higher privs. Whats the general solution to handle gems. I would like to not have to use sudo every time i use test-kitchen.
[2013-12-05 18:59:27 -0500] Signe: Ok...  So, I'm trying to work my way through the tutorials for the second time, now.  One big blocker... I can't find a single place to re-download the "get started" zip.  It's only available during the signup process and not linked or referenced anywhere else that I can find.
[2013-12-05 19:01:13 -0500] mojibake: For AWS I am trying to use the following.
[2013-12-05 19:01:14 -0500] mojibake: 13:43:31 - mojibake: node[:applications][:name].each do |application, deploy|
[2013-12-05 19:01:15 -0500] mojibake: 13:43:31 - mojibake: template '/etc/httpd/sites-available/#{node[:applications][:name]}.conf.d/rewrite_images.conf' do
[2013-12-05 19:01:15 -0500] mojibake: 13:43:31 - mojibake: source 'rewrite_images.conf.erb'
[2013-12-05 19:01:15 -0500] mojibake: 13:43:31 - mojibake: owner 'root'
[2013-12-05 19:01:15 -0500] mojibake: 13:43:31 - mojibake: group 'root'
[2013-12-05 19:01:16 -0500] mojibake: 13:43:31 - mojibake: mode 0644
[2013-12-05 19:01:16 -0500] mojibake: 13:43:31 - mojibake: end
[2013-12-05 19:01:21 -0500] mojibake: end
[2013-12-05 19:02:05 -0500] mojibake: Deply log is showing.
[2013-12-05 19:02:06 -0500] mojibake: Caught exception while compiling OpsWorks custom run list: NoMethodError - undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass - /opt/aws/opsworks/releases/20131125133823_214/site-cookbooks/rewrite_images/recipes/default.rb:1:in `from_file'
[2013-12-05 19:03:22 -0500] mojibake: If I hard code the location in template line without the node....each, then it will create the file as expected. But I am having issues referencing the application name to create the file.
[2013-12-05 19:07:57 -0500] paul_andrew: got it working with rbenv
[2013-12-05 19:13:42 -0500] vt102: I'm renaming a bunch of nodes.  What's the best way to handle getting the renamed in chef (not on the host itself)?
[2013-12-05 19:13:58 -0500] vt102: (Or, rather, I already renamed them, and now they're unmanaged. ;-)
[2013-12-05 19:19:51 -0500] Signe: Guh.
[2013-12-05 19:47:01 -0500] litch: I have a recipe that upgrades my ruby version during the initial box config, and that works nicely, but then some later step fails because it is based on the old ruby install.  Is it possible (good?) to have a run die and start again? I see the omnibus_updater will kill a run if it updates itself (which makes sense) but doesn't than leave a failed run and then you have to manually trigger it again (or wait the whole interval?)

[2013-12-05 19:47:50 -0500] isafarnik: The link only becomes active after selecting your organization.
[2013-12-05 19:48:53 -0500] Signe: I found it about 90 seconds before you responded.  Very difficult, especially since it's only on the beta-ui site.
[2013-12-05 22:00:46 -0500] fveillette: Anybody that found a way to put chef log in windows event viewer?
[2013-12-05 22:39:33 -0500] jslusher: I keep running into various errors when trying to install the redis in the EC2 section of the use cases.
