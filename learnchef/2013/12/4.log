[2013-12-04 02:01:54 -0500] nick343: Hi.  Trying to download for latest version of OSX 10.9, but your download page only goes to 10.7.  Curl -L command provided aborts because of OS version.   What do you recommend, downgrade my mac?
[2013-12-04 02:08:54 -0500] nick343: nevermind I used the hack here: https://gist.github.com/driesvints/7160641   -- kinda lame
[2013-12-04 02:23:16 -0500] nick343: How come I see all these mentions of being tested on CentOS, but the download page does not have an entry for CentOS?   what am I supposed to be using.

[2013-12-04 13:42:48 -0500] mymichelle: What is best practice when you provision an entire application? Let say you have a parent recipe which includes apache and django. Django needs to connect to DB on another host. Do you have a namespace like node['myapp']['db_host'] and map that into whatever attribute django requires?
[2013-12-04 16:57:49 -0500] ptah: hey guys. I'm having some issues installing a chef_gem within my cookbook. I have it declared in a recipe after including several of it's dependency cookbooks. it seems the load order is off because omitting the chef_gem call on the first run then adding it back seems to resolve the bug
[2013-12-04 16:58:23 -0500] ptah: anybody ever run into this issue?
[2013-12-04 17:23:55 -0500] jbz: Cheers all, stupid Chef/Ruby question.  If I have an attribute which is an array of hashes, and I want to check if there's anything in it before taking an action, what's the best way to do that?  Is there an .empty? method?
[2013-12-04 17:30:23 -0500] mattray: jbz: will the attribute definitely be there, or should you check for nil?
[2013-12-04 17:30:42 -0500] mattray: ie. if nothing gets put into the array, is it even defined?
[2013-12-04 17:43:00 -0500] jbz: mattray I think I'd want to check for nil
[2013-12-04 17:43:05 -0500] jbz: I'm looking at the problem, and it's sort of hacky
[2013-12-04 17:43:14 -0500] jbz: and I need to make it un-hacky as possible hehe
[2013-12-04 17:43:17 -0500] jbz: so
[2013-12-04 17:43:32 -0500] jbz: I have a cookbook which installs software.  It has a bunch of attribs which set up that software's config file and init scripts.
[2013-12-04 17:43:46 -0500] jbz: what I need to do is mod the cookbook so it can handle *multiple namespaced instances* of the software on the same node.
[2013-12-04 17:44:06 -0500] jbz: What I was thinking of doing is having a separate attribute space of instances, with each instance containing the requisite values
[2013-12-04 17:44:15 -0500] jbz: and then if that namespace was *empty*, just installing the base-level default.
[2013-12-04 17:44:25 -0500] jbz: If it wasn't empty, ignoring the base default and iterating through the instances in the namespace.
[2013-12-04 17:44:56 -0500] jbz: Now what I"m thinking is that it might make more sense to have a data bag with all the various instance configs, since they're consistent across the infrastructure, and then just having an attribute which lists *which* instances to install.
[2013-12-04 17:45:00 -0500] jbz: That sounds much cleaner to me.
[2013-12-04 17:45:08 -0500] jbz: And if that attribute is empty, then just use the base default attributes.
[2013-12-04 19:18:18 -0500] nick343: Hi.. where should I download the chef-repo to on my server?   I have /usr/me/home/chef/chef-repo   is this good?
[2013-12-04 19:46:30 -0500] nick34342: is anyone in here?
[2013-12-04 20:01:22 -0500] nick34342: I'm going thru the webinar.. but right from the beginning he's talking about a .chef folder..   well I used git to sync the chef-repository but there is no folder like that!!
[2013-12-04 20:05:10 -0500] nick34342: heloooooo

[2013-12-04 21:35:50 -0500] fveillette: i have an issue with windows_zipfile
[2013-12-04 21:36:09 -0500] fveillette: it's not install the last gem version of rubyzip
[2013-12-04 21:36:16 -0500] fveillette: and i don't understand why
[2013-12-04 23:02:22 -0500] robinpc: having a fit doing something that should be easy ... referencing a databag in a recipe and using part of the contents in a bash resource.  All compiles, but I can't find how to dereference the call to load the databag.  Anybody have an example?
[2013-12-04 23:04:02 -0500] fveillette: i have an issue with windows_zipfile
[2013-12-04 23:04:06 -0500] fveillette: it's not install the last gem version of rubyzip

[2013-12-04 23:06:54 -0500] Thesolonius: robinpc have you tried data_bag_item("bag", "item")?
[2013-12-04 23:10:06 -0500] robinpc: @thesolonius ... yes, works fine in chef-shell; in the recipe it compiles but I can find no way to dereference it in the bash resource 
[2013-12-04 23:38:16 -0500] Thesolonius: @robinpc bash "name" do item = data_bag_item("bag", "item") environment = { KEY_MY_BASH_SCRIPT_USES => item["key_in_data_bag"] } end
[2013-12-04 23:38:18 -0500] Thesolonius: like that?
[2013-12-04 23:38:51 -0500] Thesolonius: Or am I misunderstanding what you mean by "dereference it"
[2013-12-04 23:39:05 -0500] Thesolonius: I was just looking at http://docs.opscode.com/dsl_recipe_method_data_bag.html
