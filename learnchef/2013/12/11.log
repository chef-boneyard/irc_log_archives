[2013-12-11 17:56:51 -0500] resno: is there a chef book?
[2013-12-11 17:57:13 -0500] resno: or are the guides and such solid?
[2013-12-11 18:15:29 -0500] vt102: Does chef-client local mode in 11.8 replace chef-solo?
[2013-12-11 18:17:24 -0500] jidar: is that chef-zero?
[2013-12-11 18:18:13 -0500] vt102: Says it relies on chef-zero
[2013-12-11 18:19:22 -0500] vt102: "Local mode is a way to run the chef-client against the chef-repo on a local machine as if it were running against the server. Local mode relies on chef-zero..."
[2013-12-11 18:20:20 -0500] vt102: I guess it is the same thing.  "chef-zero was originally a standalone tool; it is enabled within the chef-client by using the --local-mode option."
[2013-12-11 19:49:21 -0500] mattray: vt102: chef-solo is still there, but chef-zero is a better solution
[2013-12-11 19:49:34 -0500] mattray: no need to change up your recipe syntax
[2013-12-11 19:49:43 -0500] mattray: same features as a full chef server
[2013-12-11 19:51:29 -0500] Visit0r: good day
[2013-12-11 20:25:48 -0500] gverri: Can anyone help me with a newbie question?
[2013-12-11 20:26:04 -0500] gverri: What is the equivalent of this "chef.json" https://gist.github.com/gverri/7917786 on hosted chef?
[2013-12-11 20:39:50 -0500] sethvargo: @gverri thats the attributes hash
