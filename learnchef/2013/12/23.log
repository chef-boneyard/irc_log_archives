[2013-12-23 15:25:37 -0500] mojibake: Still very new..Which is why I am asking here....This is for Opsworks at AWS. I am successfully able to reference "application" in recipe like so.
[2013-12-23 15:25:37 -0500] mojibake: node[:deploy].each do |application, deploy|
[2013-12-23 15:25:37 -0500] mojibake: template "/etc/httpd/sites-available/#{application}.conf.d/rewrite_images.conf" do
[2013-12-23 15:25:37 -0500] mojibake:    source 'rewrite_images.conf.erb'
[2013-12-23 15:25:38 -0500] mojibake:    owner 'root'
[2013-12-23 15:25:38 -0500] mojibake:    group 'root'
[2013-12-23 15:25:38 -0500] mojibake:    mode 0644
[2013-12-23 15:25:39 -0500] mojibake:  end
[2013-12-23 15:25:39 -0500] mojibake: next
[2013-12-23 15:25:39 -0500] mojibake: end
[2013-12-23 15:25:39 -0500] mojibake: However, how to I go able accessing "#{application}" in the template that is being written? How is the variable to be passed back to template, and how to reference it in the template.
[2013-12-23 15:25:40 -0500] mojibake: Thank you.
