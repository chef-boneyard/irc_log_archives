[2013-12-21 02:24:04 -0500] vt102: What's your opinion about red hat vs. debian?  I keep struggling to get community recipes to install under red hat, and they seem to work much, much better on debian.  I'm guessing that means the majority of chef users are using debian-based distros?  Do you agree?
[2013-12-21 21:09:27 -0500] rontec76_: I've created a basic recipe and data_bag for setting up a user on my debian based node. When I try to converge the node I get "404 Object Not Found". I see that error in a bunch of posts but can't pinpoint the cause in my case. Any tips?
[2013-12-21 21:09:59 -0500] rontec76_: I've verified that all my recipes and data_bags are on the chef server too.
[2013-12-21 21:10:52 -0500] rontec76_: If I remove the reference to my data_bag from the recipe then I can converge it no problem. So it seems to be related to the data_bag. I'm just now sure how.
