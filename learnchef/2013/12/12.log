[2013-12-12 03:12:41 -0500] Byt3_: how is this even possible whilst providing a vaild cb/recipe?
[2013-12-12 03:16:56 -0500] Byt3_: anyone?
[2013-12-12 03:19:12 -0500] Byt3_: cookbook is populated with code
[2013-12-12 03:19:31 -0500] Byt3_: run-list for the node is not empty
[2013-12-12 03:21:21 -0500] Byt3_: still chef-client run converges 0 resources
[2013-12-12 03:21:32 -0500] Byt3_: and does nothing
[2013-12-12 03:47:02 -0500] Byt3_: ?
[2013-12-12 04:16:36 -0500] Byt3_: found it
[2013-12-12 04:20:31 -0500] Byt3_: it was the case statement in my attributes file
[2013-12-12 16:13:30 -0500] CPS: is there any documentation out there for managing active directory tasks in chef?
[2013-12-12 16:21:54 -0500] CPS: in order to use the windows cookbook, will putting "require_recipe "windows"" suffice?
[2013-12-12 16:30:47 -0500] mmzyk: CPS not that I know of, re: active directory
[2013-12-12 16:31:19 -0500] CPS: ok. is it planned?
[2013-12-12 16:31:34 -0500] mmzyk: I believe putting require_recipe 'windows' is the same as require_recipe 'windows::default', so that should be fine.
[2013-12-12 16:32:06 -0500] mmzyk: assume you don't have a recipe in your currently cookbook named windows, and the windows cookbook is on the chef server, of course.
[2013-12-12 16:32:26 -0500] CPS: it's giving me a compile error. "make sure you configure the dependency in your metadata"
[2013-12-12 16:32:28 -0500] mmzyk: CPS I'm not sure. I don' t know exactly what is planned around windows work.
[2013-12-12 16:32:48 -0500] mmzyk: CPS Ah, yeah, I think b/c it's an external cookbook you also need to add it to the metadata file. I forgot about that.
[2013-12-12 16:33:00 -0500] CPS: what's the syntax for that?
[2013-12-12 16:33:25 -0500] mmzyk: depends "windows"
[2013-12-12 16:34:09 -0500] mmzyk: That is what is used by chef's dependency solver to make sure you have all your dependencies at the beginning of a run, I believe.
[2013-12-12 16:34:13 -0500] mmzyk: Or at least it's part of the picture.
[2013-12-12 16:34:25 -0500] CPS: comman separated or something else?
[2013-12-12 16:35:00 -0500] CPS: comma*
[2013-12-12 16:36:42 -0500] mmzyk: for the depends?
[2013-12-12 16:37:01 -0500] mmzyk: I normally do one per line if you have multiple cookbooks to depend on
[2013-12-12 16:37:06 -0500] mmzyk: so,
[2013-12-12 16:37:12 -0500] CPS: oh ok
[2013-12-12 16:37:13 -0500] mmzyk: depends 'windows'
[2013-12-12 16:37:16 -0500] mmzyk: depends 'foo'
[2013-12-12 16:37:18 -0500] mmzyk: etc.
[2013-12-12 16:37:29 -0500] mmzyk: It might be able to take a comma seperated list, I'm not sure.
[2013-12-12 16:47:22 -0500] Visit0r: ....].each do |name_service| 
[2013-12-12 16:47:30 -0500] Visit0r: notifies :restart,resources(:services => name_service),:delayed
[2013-12-12 16:47:48 -0500] Visit0r: does not work
[2013-12-12 16:49:21 -0500] Visit0r: how can i use this kind of approach with notifies?
[2013-12-12 16:49:48 -0500] Visit0r: so it would work
[2013-12-12 16:54:28 -0500] CPS: so i've got 2 dozen things I want to have in a windows_feature directive. Is there a nicer way of doing it than just having that many resource blocks? like array iteration or something?
[2013-12-12 16:54:45 -0500] Visit0r: have experimented with resources(:services => #{name_service}), ..ces => '#{name_service}') .. ces => name_service)
[2013-12-12 16:55:13 -0500] Visit0r: of which all do not seem to work
[2013-12-12 16:55:55 -0500] mmzyk: CPS it's ruby code, so you can build up things dynamically and using arrays with .each, etc.
[2013-12-12 16:59:21 -0500] mmzyk: Visit0r, you can have multiple notifies blocks: http://docs.opscode.com/chef/resources.html#notifications
[2013-12-12 16:59:37 -0500] Visit0r: also notifies :restart,resources(:services => 'name_service') does not work
[2013-12-12 17:01:10 -0500] mmzyk: So, resources(:services => ''name_service') - that part is a string telling notifies which service to restart. That said, it can be a variable that resolves to a string, but you need to make sure it's resolving to something that notifies will recognize.
[2013-12-12 17:01:11 -0500] Visit0r: my resource_name comes from an .each do |name_service|, @ mmzyk
[2013-12-12 17:02:27 -0500] mmzyk: Right, but I'm not sure if that is going to work. I haven't tried to write a notifies in this way. I suggest you ask in #chef and see what people there have done. 
[2013-12-12 17:03:32 -0500] Visit0r: okay, for me it seems notifies is not able to recognize my resource_name, so i thought it was a simple syntax-error on my side
[2013-12-12 17:03:40 -0500] Visit0r: @ mmzyk
[2013-12-12 17:03:57 -0500] mmzyk: ah, okay.
[2013-12-12 17:05:20 -0500] mmzyk: So you might need to use ruby string interpolation there. "resources(:servicess => #{name_service})" or something like that to get it to recognized that it is dealing with a variable that needs to be substituted.
[2013-12-12 17:05:45 -0500] Visit0r: well, i've experimented with that, it did not work
[2013-12-12 17:06:27 -0500] Visit0r: #{name_service} ... '#{name_service}' .. etc..
[2013-12-12 17:06:57 -0500] mmzyk: I'm not sure then. Ask in #chef, as someone there might have tried out something similar.
[2013-12-12 17:07:13 -0500] Visit0r: okay
[2013-12-12 17:07:19 -0500] Visit0r: anyhow, thank you for the input
[2013-12-12 17:07:26 -0500] Visit0r: @ mmzyk
[2013-12-12 17:07:45 -0500] mmzyk: no problem, sorry I didn't solve it for you.
[2013-12-12 17:40:53 -0500] ec99988_: Hi, I added a Ubuntu node to chef.  When I do "knife search node my-node -a domain", it doesn't return a domain name.  Can someone tell me where does chef get the domain information from the node?
[2013-12-12 17:57:17 -0500] Adobeman: hi, I'm trying to setup chef server on Fedora 18.  Getting stucked on this line.. "ruby_block[supervise_rabbitmq_sleep] action run" after I did chef-server-ctl reconfigure.  I googled it, and it looks like I need to modify "/opt/chef-server/embedded/cookbooks/runit/recipes/default.rb", to define Fedora somehow? 
[2013-12-12 17:57:35 -0500] Adobeman: doesnt "redhat" covers Fedora?
[2013-12-12 18:06:46 -0500] Visit0r: http://bpaste.net/show/4NsMbr9aWJZjm7AvWCCO/
[2013-12-12 18:16:16 -0500] Visit0r: notifies is not able to recognize my resource_name, http://bpaste.net/show/ppHGtVK4R1kqXfbpURE0/
[2013-12-12 18:20:29 -0500] Visit0r: where do i go from here?
[2013-12-12 18:37:18 -0500] Visit0r: http://bpaste.net/show/ynYBF44eh2tqWU1XUSNB/
[2013-12-12 19:50:47 -0500] cannonball: Visit0r: This is what I would expect to work:    notifies :restart,'service[#{name_service_x}]',:delayed
[2013-12-12 19:51:24 -0500] Visit0r: exactly, cannonball, so it does with execute, http://bpaste.net/show/fLD7YKzV1gMvWNzLXknI/
[2013-12-12 19:52:36 -0500] Visit0r: yet notifies will not accept my resource_name
[2013-12-12 19:53:11 -0500] cannonball: Are you positive that the service is actually declared?  1) Find in your chef-client output where the service you think you should be notifying is actually processed.  2) Stick a debug statement in the loop:      Chef::Log.debug("Managing Service #{name_service_x}")
[2013-12-12 19:53:52 -0500] Visit0r: the service does exist, the paste has been abstracted, will do the chef::log.debug and report back, @ cannonball
[2013-12-12 19:54:42 -0500] CPS: Visit0r: did you edit out something? 'service' is a literal string
[2013-12-12 19:54:52 -0500] CPS: is that a placeholder for an actual service name?
[2013-12-12 19:55:12 -0500] cannonball: CPS yeah he is obfuscating.
[2013-12-12 19:56:02 -0500] cannonball: Visit0r: Add into your debug output also the contents of node.[:platform_family]   (personally I just use node.platform_family).
[2013-12-12 19:56:34 -0500] Visit0r: it'd translate to any actual service name, ala 'apache2', 'ntp', 'fail2ban', etc..etc..
[2013-12-12 19:56:39 -0500] CPS: Visit0r: your notifies should be a resource name, not a service name
[2013-12-12 19:57:04 -0500] CPS: e.g.  notifies :run, "execute[install]", :immediately
[2013-12-12 19:57:21 -0500] CPS: elsewhere execute "install" do... is defined
[2013-12-12 19:57:23 -0500] Visit0r: http://bpaste.net/show/fLD7YKzV1gMvWNzLXknI/, so what am i doing wrong here, exactly?
[2013-12-12 19:57:34 -0500] cannonball: I think the service name you think it should be processing turns out not to be the same one it actually is processing.
[2013-12-12 19:58:09 -0500] CPS: which resource are you trying to trigger? what line?
[2013-12-12 19:58:12 -0500] cannonball: CPS: he's notifying the service resource defined in the array loop before that.
[2013-12-12 19:58:26 -0500] cannonball: defined in line 23.
[2013-12-12 19:58:56 -0500] Visit0r: well, i want notifies to accept my resource_name given by the each do |service_name_x|
[2013-12-12 19:59:37 -0500] CPS: i think it'd be something like notifies :restart, service['servicename'], :delayed
[2013-12-12 19:59:45 -0500] CPS: but I haven't used notifies with a variable like that
[2013-12-12 20:00:07 -0500] Visit0r: all of the things i've been experimenting with, are noted in the paste
[2013-12-12 20:00:22 -0500] CPS: rather, "service[#{servicename}]" with the quotes
[2013-12-12 20:00:31 -0500] CPS: try that
[2013-12-12 20:00:38 -0500] Visit0r: i did
[2013-12-12 20:01:10 -0500] CPS: got a log i could see where that doesn't work?
[2013-12-12 20:01:35 -0500] Visit0r: okay, i'll fire up a example
[2013-12-12 20:01:43 -0500] cannonball: yeah, I'd like to see the chef-run output.  I bet the service isn't named in the first loop what you are accessing it with in the second loop.
[2013-12-12 20:05:08 -0500] cannonball: Visit0r: And to answer your question, the variable should work just fine.  Here's an example from the sysctl community cookbook:
[2013-12-12 20:05:10 -0500] cannonball: cookbooks/common/recipes/sysctl.rb:    notifies :create, "template[#{sysctl_path}]", :immediately
[2013-12-12 20:06:13 -0500] cannonball: I'm no Ruby expert.  Does using 'string' versus "string" do anything different WRT variable expansion?  i.e. is "string#{var}" the same as 'string#{var}' ?
[2013-12-12 20:06:21 -0500] sethvargo: @cannonball yes
[2013-12-12 20:06:28 -0500] sethvargo: double quotes are expanded, single are not
[2013-12-12 20:06:28 -0500] CPS: yes
[2013-12-12 20:06:33 -0500] sethvargo: same with %q vs %Q
[2013-12-12 20:06:44 -0500] CPS: single quotes doesn't interpret variables
[2013-12-12 20:06:51 -0500] CPS: it's for literal strings
[2013-12-12 20:06:53 -0500] cannonball: He's using single quotes everywhere in his pasted output.
[2013-12-12 20:07:18 -0500] CPS: to use #{} you need to use "s
[2013-12-12 20:07:28 -0500] CPS: almost positive
[2013-12-12 20:07:29 -0500] Visit0r: Aha!
[2013-12-12 20:07:36 -0500] CPS: there
[2013-12-12 20:07:39 -0500] Visit0r: "" instead of '' ?
[2013-12-12 20:07:46 -0500] CPS: there's a reason notepad++ colors them differently!
[2013-12-12 20:07:58 -0500] CPS: Visit0r: that alone will not fix your problem
[2013-12-12 20:08:12 -0500] CPS: but try  "service[#{servicename}]"
[2013-12-12 20:08:12 -0500] Visit0r: this was the outup http://bpaste.net/show/lYabGZOczdhDyJo57ejt/
[2013-12-12 20:09:09 -0500] Visit0r: composed a quick ntp cookbook
[2013-12-12 20:09:16 -0500] cannonball: Visit0r: One way that should work (assuming this is inside the name_service_x loop:    notifies :restart,"service[#{name_service_x}]",:delayed
[2013-12-12 20:09:51 -0500] cannonball: Visit0r: right.  the output is explicit:     resource service[#{name_service_ntp}]
[2013-12-12 20:10:24 -0500] cannonball: It's looking for a service named #{name_service_ntp}, instead of whatever the value of name_service_ntp is.  Change it to double quotes and it should fix that part at least.
[2013-12-12 20:10:56 -0500] Visit0r: so, back to the basics, when and when not to use '' instead of "" ?
[2013-12-12 20:11:10 -0500] CPS: double quotes if you want to use variables in the string
[2013-12-12 20:11:43 -0500] Visit0r: let's see if it fixes that, i'll report back
[2013-12-12 20:12:18 -0500] CPS: if you don't have variables you want to use, you can use the other quote in a string without escaping it, so '"hello"' is valid and "'hello'" is valid and you don't have to do "\"hello\""
[2013-12-12 20:13:48 -0500] Visit0r: no method error
[2013-12-12 20:13:51 -0500] Visit0r: with ""
[2013-12-12 20:15:11 -0500] Visit0r:  15>>    notifies :restart,"service[#{name_service_ntp}]",:delayed

[2013-12-12 20:16:35 -0500] CPS: gonna need to see the whole thing
[2013-12-12 20:20:29 -0500] Visit0r: alright, second chef-client run with example cookbook, same thing, http://bpaste.net/show/mRZVm1cvvk0eFAdhN7vu/
[2013-12-12 20:20:59 -0500] Visit0r: @ CPS
[2013-12-12 20:21:28 -0500] CPS: so... name_service_ntp is a variable name
[2013-12-12 20:21:41 -0500] CPS: the ouput there doesn't include a bit where the variable is initialized
[2013-12-12 20:21:47 -0500] CPS: did you initialize it anywhere?
[2013-12-12 20:22:12 -0500] Visit0r: yes, this way, http://bpaste.net/show/fLD7YKzV1gMvWNzLXknI/
[2013-12-12 20:22:54 -0500] CPS: i'm not seeing it in there either
[2013-12-12 20:23:04 -0500] sethvargo: @CPS you've called it name_service_x
[2013-12-12 20:23:50 -0500] sethvargo: Also, I highly recommend using GitHub Gists because they will add syntax highlighting, which makes it much easier to catch tiny syntax mistakes :smile:
[2013-12-12 20:24:41 -0500] CPS: Visit0r: based on that error my guess is chef doesn't know what name_service_ntp is because it isn't declared anywhere
[2013-12-12 20:24:55 -0500] CPS: add a line above the resource name_service_ntp="ntp" or something
[2013-12-12 20:25:32 -0500] Visit0r: my resource_name comes form each do |resouce|
[2013-12-12 20:26:00 -0500] Visit0r: which again is a if-statement in my attributes
[2013-12-12 20:26:26 -0500] sethvargo: @Visit0r I'm not seeing that in the recipe you posted
[2013-12-12 20:26:57 -0500] Visit0r: http://bpaste.net/show/fLD7YKzV1gMvWNzLXknI/
[2013-12-12 20:27:18 -0500] Visit0r: this is how i set it up, basically, for any service i'm using
[2013-12-12 20:27:27 -0500] Visit0r: and yes, i'm making sure it actually exists
[2013-12-12 20:27:42 -0500] sethvargo: @Visit0r I'm really not understanding that gist - it's not valid ruby and the things you're talking about aren't inside it...
[2013-12-12 20:28:29 -0500] CPS: yeah a more complete paste would be helpful
[2013-12-12 20:28:53 -0500] CPS: because nothing i've seen points to anything other than an uninitialized variable
[2013-12-12 20:35:47 -0500] Visit0r: alright, i'm sorry for causing so much confusing, i've now written a basic example cookbook
[2013-12-12 20:35:49 -0500] Visit0r: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b31f7d2dbeed10baeeb4
[2013-12-12 20:36:10 -0500] Visit0r: attributes following, if you guys need it
[2013-12-12 20:36:23 -0500] Visit0r: *confusion
[2013-12-12 20:37:29 -0500] Visit0r: @CPS,  @sethvargo
[2013-12-12 20:38:19 -0500] cannonball: First, in line 15, you are accessing a variable that is part of a loop (27-33) somewhere else.
[2013-12-12 20:38:21 -0500] sethvargo: @Visit0r this isn't correct: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b31f7d2dbeed10baeeb4#file-gistfile1-rb-L15
[2013-12-12 20:38:29 -0500] sethvargo: That variable doesn't exist anywhere
[2013-12-12 20:38:37 -0500] sethvargo: "name_service_ntp" isn't defined
[2013-12-12 20:38:42 -0500] sethvargo: You are using "path_combined_ntp"
[2013-12-12 20:39:00 -0500] sethvargo: Second, here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b31f7d2dbeed10baeeb4#file-gistfile1-rb-L24. Same thing
[2013-12-12 20:39:11 -0500] sethvargo: Here, however, it IS defined: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b31f7d2dbeed10baeeb4#file-gistfile1-rb-L27
[2013-12-12 20:40:30 -0500] cannonball: Visit0r: I think you would get a better mental picture if you indented your code to show where loops are, giving you a vistual representation of when variables would be in scope or out of scope.
[2013-12-12 20:42:14 -0500] CPS: Visit0r: how much programming experience do you have?
[2013-12-12 20:42:39 -0500] Visit0r: close to zero, c++ ages ago
[2013-12-12 20:43:05 -0500] CPS: this is starting to make sense then
[2013-12-12 20:43:26 -0500] CPS: loop variables aren't accessible outside of their loop
[2013-12-12 20:43:36 -0500] CPS: (and if they are it's probably a bug)
[2013-12-12 20:43:41 -0500] sethvargo: @CPS "scope"
[2013-12-12 20:43:56 -0500] Visit0r: i see, because the same approach works for "execute"
[2013-12-12 20:43:58 -0500] CPS: yes, go read up on variable scope
[2013-12-12 20:44:09 -0500] Visit0r: so my thought was , it'd work for "notifies"
[2013-12-12 20:44:25 -0500] CPS: right, in your original execute, the variable command is accessed inside its loop
[2013-12-12 20:45:12 -0500] Visit0r: so as soon as i'm outside the loop, my variable is not readable by other code-blocks
[2013-12-12 20:45:20 -0500] Visit0r: is that correct?
[2013-12-12 20:45:21 -0500] cannonball: Visit0r: You define the variable "name_service_ntp" in line 27.  It's only defined while it's looping through each item in that array between lines 27 and 33.  But you are trying to access it in lines 15 and 24, *before* it has any value.
[2013-12-12 20:45:23 -0500] cannonball: Correct.
[2013-12-12 20:45:27 -0500] CPS: correct
[2013-12-12 20:45:35 -0500] Visit0r: oh my
[2013-12-12 20:45:58 -0500] sethvargo: @Visit0r yup. And it's true for anything that creates scope (if, unless, for, each, def, class, module)
[2013-12-12 20:46:06 -0500] CPS: sethvargo: i was trying to explain the concept with minimal jargon
[2013-12-12 20:47:11 -0500] Visit0r: so i will have to define a variable, if used in this manner, for every block?
[2013-12-12 20:47:42 -0500] CPS: depends what you're trying to do i suppose
[2013-12-12 20:47:57 -0500] CPS: why are you notifying a service block from inside a directory block?
[2013-12-12 20:48:42 -0500] Visit0r: as changes to users and groups are being monitored
[2013-12-12 20:49:56 -0500] CPS: i don't follow
[2013-12-12 20:50:36 -0500] Visit0r: a service will recognize changes with each reload/restart
[2013-12-12 20:50:49 -0500] cannonball: It almost sounds like a schema problem.  He's crossing relationships between a singleton (ntp.conf), some array items for directories (path combined), and some array items for services (name service)...and the connection between them is not clear (it should be a part of the attribute definition how they group together).
[2013-12-12 20:53:59 -0500] CPS: why not just make all your directory changes and loop through the services at the end?
[2013-12-12 20:54:16 -0500] CPS: do you need to restart the service after each change?
[2013-12-12 20:58:27 -0500] Visit0r: it'd be desired to have it restart with each change, yes
[2013-12-12 20:59:06 -0500] cannonball: Visit0r: Will node['example']['ntp']['name_service'] ever have more than one item in that array?
[2013-12-12 20:59:23 -0500] CPS: in that case, assign the list of services to a variable, then inside the directory resource loop over the array and restart each one
[2013-12-12 20:59:48 -0500] CPS: that will work as long as the variable is declared at a level above the loop
[2013-12-12 21:00:44 -0500] Visit0r: items are set via if statement, cannonball
[2013-12-12 21:01:54 -0500] cannonball: Visit0r: That's not what I asked.   Will it ever contain something like ["service1","service2","service3"] ?  If it only will ever contain one service, ie ["service"], then it you're making it complicated by making it into an array.
[2013-12-12 21:03:33 -0500] Visit0r: it only contains one vaild service name
[2013-12-12 21:03:52 -0500] CPS: just make it a string then
[2013-12-12 21:04:29 -0500] Visit0r: yet it has different values for different platforms
[2013-12-12 21:04:37 -0500] Visit0r: defined through if statements
[2013-12-12 21:04:41 -0500] cannonball: Or a part of a hash (which is what I think he needs to do.  Or maybe "ntp" is his hash.
[2013-12-12 21:04:43 -0500] CPS: irrelevant
[2013-12-12 21:04:55 -0500] CPS: if it only ever has one value it shouldn't be an array
[2013-12-12 21:08:06 -0500] Visit0r: so, this kind of abstraction is rather to be considered a wrong approach, @CPS?
[2013-12-12 21:08:32 -0500] CPS: you've got the right idea in setting the value based on platform
[2013-12-12 21:09:03 -0500] CPS: but, correct me if i'm wrong, the service name will be one of A, B, or C, and never a combination of the (e.g. A and B)
[2013-12-12 21:09:29 -0500] CPS: in that situation, you don't want to use an array because an array allows multiple values, which would be incorrect in this case
[2013-12-12 21:09:34 -0500] CPS: you want something that has only one value
[2013-12-12 21:11:10 -0500] CPS: although i'm not sure what default['cookbook_name']['recipe_name']['name_service'] means in chef terms
[2013-12-12 21:12:58 -0500] Visit0r: it'd be default['cookbook_name']['recipe_name']['attribute_name']
[2013-12-12 21:14:45 -0500] CPS: what is default, in this context?
[2013-12-12 21:17:58 -0500] cannonball: Visit0r: Here is a simple cookbook that does kind of the same thing that you are struggling with.  (am curious what problems others would find with it too)
[2013-12-12 21:18:00 -0500] cannonball: https://gist.github.com/mrballcb/7935582
[2013-12-12 21:21:39 -0500] CPS: cannonball: is service "named" a placeholder?
[2013-12-12 21:23:02 -0500] cannonball: No, it is the actual name of the init script, as in /etc/init.d/named.  I'm not using a variable for the service name like Visit0r was trying to do, so it's why I said "kind of the same thing".
[2013-12-12 21:23:22 -0500] CPS: oh ok, i'm coming from windows, didn't realize that was a thing
[2013-12-12 21:25:28 -0500] Visit0r: does service[service_name] recognize init scripts?
[2013-12-12 21:26:55 -0500] cannonball: That's what service[] *IS*.  service[ntp] looks for /etc/init.d/ntp.     service[named] looks for /etc/init.d/named.     (Not literally, but it's the same basic thing.)
[2013-12-12 21:27:44 -0500] cannonball: Google for 'chef resource service'.  Click on the first link that comes up that goes to the opscode website.  That will explain it in great detail, with examples at the bottom.
[2013-12-12 21:28:05 -0500] Visit0r: yes, i've been reading this just a minute ago
[2013-12-12 21:28:40 -0500] Visit0r: i'd still like to make this work with variables
[2013-12-12 21:30:02 -0500] Visit0r: except for if it recognizes different init scripts on different platforms
[2013-12-12 21:30:40 -0500] CPS: Visit0r: change it from an array to a string and do notifies :whatever, "service[#{default['cookbook_name']['recipe_name']['name_service']}]", :whenever
[2013-12-12 21:31:56 -0500] Visit0r: i'll give it a go
[2013-12-12 21:32:03 -0500] cannonball: Visit0r: The "service" resource is indeed cross-platform.  It knows how to start and stop services on each of the platforms that you can run chef on.
[2013-12-12 21:32:40 -0500] Visit0r: i'll try both, will report back
[2013-12-12 21:32:42 -0500] cannonball: In that "service" page, if you look at the "Providers" section, it lists all of the different platforms that it supports (i.e. the Long Name).
[2013-12-12 21:33:44 -0500] cannonball: chef does all the logic to determine which one is best to use, you just use "service NAME" and it figures out how to do all of the actions (start, stop, restart, status, enable, disable, etc).
[2013-12-12 21:34:21 -0500] cannonball: Visit0r: If you have some time, I suggest you also go through: https://learnchef.opscode.com/
[2013-12-12 21:35:34 -0500] Visit0r: is there a list of default values for the notifies service resource?
[2013-12-12 21:36:09 -0500] Visit0r: even that service-names differ on platforms. it must have a name to default to
[2013-12-12 21:36:12 -0500] CPS: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_common.html#notifications
[2013-12-12 21:37:09 -0500] CPS: just figure out which service you need to use, put it in a variable, and notify the service resource with the variable
[2013-12-12 21:37:46 -0500] Visit0r: "service[#{default['cookbook_name']['recipe_name']['name_service']}]"
[2013-12-12 21:38:02 -0500] CPS: should work
[2013-12-12 21:42:06 -0500] Visit0r: notifies :restart, resources(:service => node[:recipe_name][:service]), :delayed
[2013-12-12 21:42:12 -0500] Visit0r: or like this?
[2013-12-12 21:42:27 -0500] CPS: i haven't seen syntax like that
[2013-12-12 21:43:00 -0500] CPS: well, i've seen syntax like that for templates, but nowhere else
[2013-12-12 21:43:59 -0500] cannonball: I've never used resources() like that.
[2013-12-12 21:44:24 -0500] cannonball: If I had to guess, I would say that roughly translates to node["recipe_name"]["service"] = "blah", which will try to restart service[blah].
[2013-12-12 21:45:18 -0500] cannonball: IMHO, your biggest problem is that *I* am a relative newbie to Chef and Ruby.
[2013-12-12 21:45:24 -0500] thegame: need some help with vagrant-fuelphp, anyone?
[2013-12-12 21:45:34 -0500] cannonball: I'm still learning too.
[2013-12-12 21:45:54 -0500] CPS: lol me too
[2013-12-12 21:45:57 -0500] CPS: and on windows, no less
[2013-12-12 21:46:08 -0500] CPS: but his original problem was straight ruby
[2013-12-12 21:46:30 -0500] Visit0r: that's right
[2013-12-12 21:46:51 -0500] cannonball: Yes.
[2013-12-12 21:48:02 -0500] cannonball: I have a question.  And it's a ruby question, not a chef question.
[2013-12-12 21:48:50 -0500] CPS: ok
[2013-12-12 21:49:00 -0500] cannonball: Suppose I have a potential variable.  It may or may not exist.   It's bag[0..1][:role][#{role}][:interface].
[2013-12-12 21:49:10 -0500] cannonball: When i'm checking to see if it exists, this is what I've done up to this point:
[2013-12-12 21:49:16 -0500] cannonball:     if defined?(bag[0]) && defined?(bag[0][:role]) &&
[2013-12-12 21:49:16 -0500] cannonball:        defined?(bag[0][:role][role]) &&
[2013-12-12 21:49:17 -0500] cannonball:        defined?(bag[0][:role][role][:interface]) then
[2013-12-12 21:49:38 -0500] CPS: eww
[2013-12-12 21:49:40 -0500] cannonball: do I have to test each step of the array or hash like that?  Or can I just do the final one and it will be ok?
[2013-12-12 21:49:52 -0500] CPS: what do you do if it doesn't exist?
[2013-12-12 21:49:59 -0500] cannonball: nothing.
[2013-12-12 21:50:06 -0500] cannonball: If it exists, it pushes it onto an array.
[2013-12-12 21:50:23 -0500] CPS: use a begin/rescue block
[2013-12-12 21:50:31 -0500] cannonball: I can show you the whole function if you want in a gist.
[2013-12-12 21:50:38 -0500] CPS: if you get an array out of bounds (or whatever) exception, ignore it and mveo on
[2013-12-12 21:51:04 -0500] CPS: nah this is a fairly basic case
[2013-12-12 21:51:24 -0500] CPS: try to access the array value and do a thing with it, if you get an error that it doesn't exist, ignore it and move on
[2013-12-12 21:51:35 -0500] CPS: begin/rescue is perfect for this
[2013-12-12 21:52:02 -0500] cannonball: I was able to do it in chef-shell without blowing up.  But I don't know how it will work in an actual run.  I guess I'll give it a shot.
[2013-12-12 21:52:28 -0500] CPS: you can have raw ruby code inside recipes
[2013-12-12 21:52:45 -0500] CPS: should work fine
[2013-12-12 22:38:24 -0500] joinlki: Hi there. I need some help with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20546996/chef-minitest-to-check-the-content-of-a-file
[2013-12-12 22:38:58 -0500] joinlki: And I was wondering if anyone knew how I could import/use databags in my minitest.
