[2013-12-13 16:21:03 -0500] cannonball: If I am in the middle of some ruby code, and i want to send a notification to a "service" resource to stop immediately, how would I do that?  In other words, how can I send an inline notification without it being a part of some other resource?
[2013-12-13 16:21:37 -0500] cannonball: May have asked too quick.  Google is finding stuff...

It seems pretty straightforward to make a cookbook with a recipie & file to accomplish that, but it also seems like putting all your eggs in the same basket.
[2013-12-13 16:24:39 -0500] pmacklin: I mean, your encrypted data is essentially stored right next to the decryption key. But at the same time, the secret file doesn't get automagically handled by Chef (at least not that I've seen).
[2013-12-13 16:31:35 -0500] pmacklin: any one spare an opinion on encrypted data bags?

[2013-12-13 16:36:09 -0500] Guest92381: is there any technical differnece between running resources with guards and running them with ruby if statments?
[2013-12-13 16:37:41 -0500] sethvargo: @Guest92381 yes. Ruby if statements won't add the item to the resource collection
[2013-12-13 16:37:49 -0500] sethvargo: So you won't be able to notify it to do something
[2013-12-13 16:42:22 -0500] Guest92381: interesting

[2013-12-13 17:15:05 -0500] pmacklin: Also, there seems to be a problem with this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18319367/encrypteddatabagitem-load-produces-cannot-convert-nil-into-string
[2013-12-13 17:15:34 -0500] pmacklin: I guess we're just not using chef::config for the databag secret yet.
[2013-12-13 17:17:09 -0500] pmacklin: Can someone point me to where/how to use chef config?
[2013-12-13 17:42:35 -0500] bean__: pmacklin: you should be able to just have it pushed up when you bootstrap
[2013-12-13 17:52:00 -0500] pmacklin: bean__: push up the secret file? is there a bootstrap flag for that? or is it supposed to be automatic?
[2013-12-13 18:12:34 -0500] bean__: pmacklin: it's int he default bootstrap script I believe
[2013-12-13 18:13:59 -0500] cannonball: In my testing, it appears that the resources() chef command cannot be accessed in a recipe file *after* the "private" declaration.  I have to enclose it in a ruby_block.  Is this an accurate assessment?
