[2013-12-03 00:30:09 -0500] manzaiya: is there a way to run vagrant in verbose mode so I can tell if the chef-solo provisioner is applying the run_list? I am completely new to chef and vagrant and really don't know what I am doing.
[2013-12-03 01:08:26 -0500] grepory: do attribute files and recipe files have to be named the same? e.g. recipes/default.rb refers to attributes in attributes/default.rb?

[2013-12-03 13:44:42 -0500] mojibake: New to chef/aws. does anyone know how the default cookbooks (example deploy::php), pull/passed the application name in AWS Opsworks? I would like to setup custom cookbook using application name set in AWS Opsworks stack like the default cookbook does. I dug through all the definitions, attributies, recipes and templates for Apache2, and php, and still could not figure out. https://github.com/aws/opsworks-cookbooks  anythoughts.... Or a seconda
[2013-12-03 13:44:42 -0500] mojibake: primary answer, how would I pass the name(even if statically set) via custom JSON, with the custom cookbook, and use it.   
[2013-12-03 15:22:34 -0500] rshade98: in tests can you do multiple conditions like only_if {node[:app][:master]=true && File.exists?('/tmp/cronfile')}
[2013-12-03 16:05:25 -0500] pradeepto: hey folks, can I have a if clause inside a yum_package block? Something like "version package_version if package_verion != 'latest'"
[2013-12-03 16:50:02 -0500] yeo: should the mysql password be set in node attributes?
[2013-12-03 16:50:54 -0500] pradeepto: yeo: i am not expert here but maybe you should use encrypted data bags for that.
[2013-12-03 16:52:31 -0500] nathenharvey: yeo: the mysql cookbook from the community site (http://ckbk.it/mysql) will set node attributes for the passwords in the server recipe
[2013-12-03 16:52:57 -0500] nathenharvey: yeo: see https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql/blob/master/recipes/server.rb#L23-40
[2013-12-03 16:55:02 -0500] yeo: is "secure_password" a variable set some where?
[2013-12-03 16:57:54 -0500] nathenharvey: yeo: it's a library defined by the openssl cookbook - https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/openssl/blob/master/libraries/secure_password.rb#L26-34
[2013-12-03 16:58:27 -0500] ctote: Hey everyone - I'm trying to require 'winrm' in my .rb file, but I keep getting `require': cannot load such file -- winrm (LoadError)
[2013-12-03 16:58:41 -0500] ctote: I'm pretty new to chef/ruby, so I'm pretty confused
[2013-12-03 16:59:36 -0500] pradeepto: nathenharvey: hi, can I have a if clause inside a yum_package block? Something like "version package_version if package_verion != 'latest'".  ( Sorry about the direct ping, I had asked earlier but didn't get a reply)
[2013-12-03 17:07:09 -0500] yeo: thank you for the help guys
[2013-12-03 17:12:17 -0500] nathenharvey: pradeepto: you can set the action to :upgrade
[2013-12-03 17:12:24 -0500] nathenharvey: that will ensure that a package is the latest version.
[2013-12-03 17:12:33 -0500] nathenharvey: but I'd be very careful about doing that!
[2013-12-03 17:13:32 -0500] nathenharvey: think about what happens when chef-client runs on your production system.  Do you want to upgrade the package immediately after it becomes available?  Will there be negative side effects?
[2013-12-03 17:13:58 -0500] pradeepto: nathenharvey: is "latest" some kind of internal keyword?
[2013-12-03 17:14:15 -0500] nathenharvey: no.  you just don't specify a version
[2013-12-03 17:14:32 -0500] nathenharvey: set the action to :upgrade and it'll always make sure the package is at the latest release
[2013-12-03 17:14:49 -0500] pradeepto: hmmm
[2013-12-03 17:15:00 -0500] nathenharvey: package "foo" do; action :upgrade; end (semicolons for line breaks)
[2013-12-03 17:16:04 -0500] nathenharvey: you might also want to use the "package" resource instead of the "yum_package" resource.  Not sure of your requirements but the more general resource might be a better fit
[2013-12-03 17:16:40 -0500] pradeepto: ah so, we have this hash which is our package list, package_name => 'version-number', and we iterate through this package hash and run yum_package for each entry.
[2013-12-03 17:18:04 -0500] nathenharvey: pradeepto: you could do the same with the "package" resource. but that's not what you're asking ;)
[2013-12-03 17:19:13 -0500] CPS: anyone have experience setting up a ruby gem server? i can hit the root  of the server but /gems gives me a 404. the main index lists all the gems i expect to see
[2013-12-03 17:20:27 -0500] pradeepto: nathenharvey: I understand what you are trying to say. Good point that.
[2013-12-03 17:21:24 -0500] nathenharvey: pradeepto: you could do something like this, too - https://gist.github.com/nathenharvey/7773391
[2013-12-03 17:21:46 -0500] nathenharvey: pradeepto: that's just a quick hack.  might be an even cleaner way to accomplish that.  
[2013-12-03 17:22:19 -0500] nathenharvey: depending on your packages though, you may actually want to break them up into multiple recipes / cookbooks and manage each separately
[2013-12-03 17:22:52 -0500] pradeepto: yes, true
[2013-12-03 17:24:56 -0500] rsmitty: Is there a way to provide a detailed error to stdout when a resource guard fails?
[2013-12-03 17:26:45 -0500] pradeepto: nathenharvey: thanks for the gist, for the sake of completeness, this is what I have originally - https://gist.github.com/pradeepto/61fe22a67385c57d4cce
[2013-12-03 17:27:00 -0500] rsmitty: i'd like to provide some feedback as to why I'm failing an execute block
[2013-12-03 18:11:40 -0500] ctote: Hey everyone - I'm trying to run some winrm commands but keep getting this:  Bad HTTP response returned from server (401). (WinRM::WinRMHTTPTransportError)
[2013-12-03 18:11:44 -0500] ctote: Do I have something configured wrong?
[2013-12-03 18:33:30 -0500] CPS: 401 means unauthorized
[2013-12-03 18:49:18 -0500] yeo: is there a reason why the chef's mysql cookbook uses a randomly generated password for root?  is it stored to be used for other account creation/privilege manipulation? 
[2013-12-03 19:14:11 -0500] nathenharvey: yeo: there set that way by default so that Chef know the passwords for subsequent chef-client runs
[2013-12-03 19:14:29 -0500] nathenharvey: yeo: check the README for that cookbook though.  "The following attributes are randomly generated passwords handled in the mysql::server recipe, using the OpenSSL cookbook's secure_password helper method. These are set using the set_unless node attribute method, which allows them to be easily overridden e.g. in a role."
[2013-12-03 20:37:45 -0500] cannonball: Hello all.  I want to test some of my logic in irb.  What do I need to require in interactive mode to be able to call data_bag_item() ?  I already did:  require 'chef'    and it responded with true (so I assume that means it loaded successfully).
[2013-12-03 20:39:46 -0500] cannonball: Ah, chef-shell.  I was making it MUCH harder than it needed to be.
