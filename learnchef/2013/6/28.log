[2013-06-28 14:45:43 -0400] ianneub: howdy all! is there a consensus as to which is best - one chef server for dev/staging/prod? or a chef server per environment? or something else?
[2013-06-28 14:46:54 -0400] behemphi: @ianneub  I use a single server (Hosted Chef) to manage ~200 nodes
[2013-06-28 14:47:04 -0400] behemphi: This is with no problems at all.
[2013-06-28 14:47:44 -0400] behemphi: So if your question is about scale I think you will be OK with a single server unless the number of nodes is stunning
[2013-06-28 14:47:52 -0400] ianneub: behemphi: that's the route i thought to take as well. unfortunately my company doesn't want to use hosted chef, so i'm building it myself. 
[2013-06-28 14:48:25 -0400] behemphi: I have not run my own chef server
[2013-06-28 14:48:41 -0400] behemphi: so I cannot talk about scale for OpenSource Chef
[2013-06-28 14:48:42 -0400] ianneub: behemphi: not so much scale, more wondering about logic, does it make sense to use one machine, are there any pitfalls
[2013-06-28 14:48:45 -0400] ianneub: stuff like that
[2013-06-28 14:49:06 -0400] behemphi: I can speak to that in that we do use one chef server
[2013-06-28 14:49:15 -0400] behemphi: We make extensive use of environments
[2013-06-28 14:49:45 -0400] behemphi: pin our cookbook versions and use 4 diff prod envs to roll out or releases to different customers in phases
[2013-06-28 14:49:59 -0400] ianneub: oh very nice
[2013-06-28 14:50:21 -0400] behemphi: The only thing I can really see you getting with multiple servers is some easing of the global nature of roles, data bags and environemnts
[2013-06-28 14:50:34 -0400] behemphi: but that would be in exchange for violating DRY
[2013-06-28 14:50:58 -0400] behemphi: Given that your just getting started I would say one chef server is the way to go
[2013-06-28 14:51:09 -0400] ianneub: exactly, i wasn't too thrilled with the idea of maintaining twice or more chef servers
[2013-06-28 14:51:34 -0400] behemphi: I personally think we made a mistake in putting attributes in our environments and roles
[2013-06-28 14:51:47 -0400] behemphi: as we are rewriting everything from the ground up now we are going to move away from that
[2013-06-28 14:52:14 -0400] behemphi: the easy of tweaking and env var on the server falls over pretty fast when decoupled from source control
[2013-06-28 14:52:36 -0400] ianneub: do all of your nodes talk to the chef server using the same IP address? i've inherited a system that separates everything into uniq amazon VPC's. the result is that the dev environment can't talk to the production IPs directly
[2013-06-28 14:52:38 -0400] behemphi: We are going to try to move away from roles completely as well and substitue cookbooks in their place
[2013-06-28 14:52:48 -0400] behemphi: but that is a pretty controversial method right now
[2013-06-28 14:52:53 -0400] ianneub: behemphi: thats the pattern i've followed as well
[2013-06-28 14:53:01 -0400] ianneub: the berkshelf style
[2013-06-28 14:53:13 -0400] behemphi: yep that is the way we are going
[2013-06-28 14:53:20 -0400] behemphi: we are extremely flat
[2013-06-28 14:53:40 -0400] behemphi: so in answer to that question we talk to api.opscode.com (rather than an IP)
[2013-06-28 14:53:59 -0400] ianneub: oh right. that would make it a ton easier having the chef server outside your envs
[2013-06-28 14:54:01 -0400] behemphi: I suspect you will be able to make some DNS magic so that the same is true for your chef server
[2013-06-28 14:54:51 -0400] behemphi: My background is databases tho, so that network stuff is the deep magic :-)
[2013-06-28 14:54:51 -0400] ianneub: maybe i could replicate that in my own env. the way it stands now i'd have to use two custom DNS servers to split the DNS up
[2013-06-28 14:55:48 -0400] behemphi: I _think_ you could do something like open a hole via VPN (or something similar) for only the chef server
[2013-06-28 14:55:55 -0400] behemphi: the details of that are far beyond me though
[2013-06-28 14:55:58 -0400] ianneub: yeah i was thinking about that too
[2013-06-28 14:56:19 -0400] ianneub: i want to do that anyway to make it easier to work with the differrent networks from my local machine
[2013-06-28 14:57:08 -0400] behemphi: cool
[2013-06-28 14:57:21 -0400] ianneub: thanks behemphi, that gives me some things to think about, it really helps to have someone else to bounce ideas off of. make sure i'm not a complete fool :)
[2013-06-28 14:59:07 -0400] behemphi: Totally, I did this all from scratch on my own until I got to the first ChefConf.  So I lurk here and try to contribute to the community as a way of paying the debt :-)
[2013-06-28 15:00:37 -0400] ianneub: is that a good conf? now that i will be using this in production, maybe i can convince the powers that be to send me there
[2013-06-28 15:04:01 -0400] behemphi: I cannot say enough good things about Chef Conf TBH
[2013-06-28 15:04:08 -0400] behemphi: Great sessions
[2013-06-28 15:04:11 -0400] behemphi: great community
[2013-06-28 19:41:12 -0400] yanick: hi, i'm starting to play with chef, I wonder about one thing though.... do you usually use community recipes? or do you do them from scratch? i talk about common stuff like nginx, haproxy, postgres and others
[2013-06-28 19:42:45 -0400] ianneub: yanick: i use community recipies when available
[2013-06-28 19:43:08 -0400] ianneub: this is what i follow - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYt0E84kYUI - might be a bit of language in there that may not be good in your env
[2013-06-28 19:45:46 -0400] yanick: i''ll check it out, thanks :)
[2013-06-28 20:06:23 -0400] behemphi: @yanick, we almost always implement community recipes with "wrapper cookbooks" 
[2013-06-28 20:06:27 -0400] behemphi: this is pretty good
[2013-06-28 20:06:27 -0400] behemphi: http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-write-reusable-chef-cookbooks.html
[2013-06-28 20:06:42 -0400] behemphi: and the video above is superb as well
[2013-06-28 20:13:54 -0400] yanick: thank you behemphi, I've saved it to read later
[2013-06-28 20:15:19 -0400] yanick: now I just need to figure out if it's better to start with a single server doing everything (web, db, background jobs) or 2-3 servers... I'm scared that starting with 1 doing everything will be more complex to migrate to multiple servers later (both ways using chef)
[2013-06-28 20:16:26 -0400] behemphi: @yanick do you mean chef servers 
[2013-06-28 20:16:31 -0400] yanick: for now I've installed the server on a virtual machine and it's working good
[2013-06-28 20:16:35 -0400] behemphi: or are you talking about your app topology?
[2013-06-28 20:16:50 -0400] yanick: no, about the app topology
[2013-06-28 20:17:22 -0400] yanick: i'll have just one chef server machine (a 512 mb instance on digital ocean... it should work)
[2013-06-28 20:18:09 -0400] behemphi: In terms of Chef the number of nodes is pretty irrelevant (excpet in how you factor out common things like ssh users to their own cookbook (see the opscode users cookbook). )
[2013-06-28 20:18:31 -0400] behemphi: in terms of the app itself, that would require knowing alot of stuff
[2013-06-28 20:18:44 -0400] behemphi: but if you plan to scale better to start with seperate machines
[2013-06-28 20:19:28 -0400] behemphi: I should backtrack a bit too.  Seperate machines will be slightly harder with Chef b/c you will need to work out how they communicate and the order then come up in (e.g. DB before web host, etc)
[2013-06-28 20:20:48 -0400] yanick: but it'd be better having them already in place since the beginning instead of changin it while everything is running on production, I think it should be simple.. :)
[2013-06-28 20:25:39 -0400] yanick: now I'm also checking out the various recipes to find out what I should install on a clean ubuntu server installation... for now I've taken a note about: nginx, postgres, apt, runit, git, build-essential, openssl, ntp, chef-client, users, haproxy, memcached, postfix, redis, monit, rvm, newrelic, unicorn, timezone, imagemagick, htop, fail2ban, and maybe nagios (I don't know if I'll use it yet)
[2013-06-28 20:31:36 -0400] behemphi: @yanick, we just wrote a pull request for users if you are interested.  allows for the creation of config files by including them in the JSON https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/users/pull/29
[2013-06-28 20:31:50 -0400] behemphi: stuff like .vimrc, .inputrc, etc
[2013-06-28 20:32:04 -0400] behemphi: if you plan to log in to the machines at all it is nice to be "comfy"
[2013-06-28 20:32:54 -0400] yanick: great
[2013-06-28 20:34:35 -0400] behemphi: Also @yanick if at all possible I recommend Hosted Chef (I don't work for Opscode)
[2013-06-28 20:34:53 -0400] behemphi: makes it all much easier and the first 5 nodes are free
[2013-06-28 20:35:27 -0400] yanick: is it so complex to take care of the chef server on an own machine?
[2013-06-28 20:35:48 -0400] behemphi: it is alot of other moving parts that are not really "core business".  
[2013-06-28 20:37:00 -0400] behemphi: so by using it (to start anyway) you get to focus on the recipes and other stuff. 
[2013-06-28 20:37:52 -0400] yanick: that makes sense, although installing the server was pretty straightforward using the .deb file
[2013-06-28 20:38:21 -0400] behemphi: having not done it myself, I am not sure what the headache level is.  It has been almost 0 with Hosted Chef
[2013-06-28 20:38:30 -0400] behemphi: so we are too lazy to move right now
[2013-06-28 20:38:32 -0400] behemphi: :-)
[2013-06-28 20:41:02 -0400] yanick: eheh... I checked the previous versions and it was quite complex to have it running (having to install by yourself all the requirements), the deb does it all by itself and at the end you have the server working :) I'll have to check on a real vps instead of a virtual machine, but it should be more or less the same (maybe just changing the domain on nginx)
[2013-06-28 20:47:05 -0400] behemphi: cool, I might have to look that way soon then
[2013-06-28 20:47:44 -0400] yanick: :)
[2013-06-28 20:53:45 -0400] ianneub: i can chime in on the local chef server too. i've noticed a few bugs in the interface that aren't in hosted chef
[2013-06-28 20:53:53 -0400] ianneub: i assume those will be fixed in community chef soon?
[2013-06-28 20:57:53 -0400] yanick: which bugs have you noticed? from what I read the admin area of the opensource version is maintained only by the community and not opscode, I think you should check if they're already on their issue tracker 
[2013-06-28 20:59:00 -0400] ianneub: yanick: i did not realize that. some examples: editing an environment.. none of my existing data is there. so each time i edit, i have to edit all the fields
[2013-06-28 20:59:17 -0400] ianneub: i hit a 500 error when i try to create a data bag
[2013-06-28 20:59:44 -0400] ianneub: i also could not use berkshelf apply <env> command
[2013-06-28 20:59:54 -0400] ianneub: it could just be something wrong with my install. but i just use the knife cli and it works fine
[2013-06-28 21:00:29 -0400] yanick: oh, I see.. I haven't played with it much yet :\
[2013-06-28 21:00:55 -0400] ianneub: made me want to use hosted chef (which i've used on another project)
[2013-06-28 21:03:04 -0400] yanick: it surely has its advantages... if you can afford it :)
[2013-06-28 21:03:12 -0400] ianneub: exactly :)
[2013-06-28 21:09:38 -0400] vbo: Hi all.  I have just a couple of hours experience with Chef, so excuse my newbiness.  I need to start an service (with the Upstart provider) *and* pass a parameter to the service.  I've seen that this was covered by the issue #3048 but I couldn't find an example in the official doc nor the wiki.  Do you have any pointer/example?
