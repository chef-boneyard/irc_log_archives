[2013-06-06 18:51:19 -0400] eponymi: so test-kitchen automatically runs cucumber features? didn't know that.
[2013-06-06 23:09:04 -0400] dantmcgowan: I have setup a centos64 vm with chef building lamp stack.It builds the following: apache (2.2.15); mysql (5.1.69) and php (5.3.3). I have been asked to setup different versions for each component. My attempt at php 5.3.25 resulted in this message: "Chef::Exceptions::Package: Version 5.3.25 of php not found. Did you specify both version and release?" .where would I find releaseare there only specific versions and releases 
[2013-06-06 23:28:38 -0400] sascha_d: @dantmcgowan it can't find a package in your available repos.  So if you do a `yum info php` it will tell you what package(s) it has available
[2013-06-06 23:34:27 -0400] dantmcgowan: thanks @sascha_d...so on guest (vm) `yum info php` only reports the version successfully built - 5.3.3
[2013-06-06 23:34:52 -0400] sascha_d: yep, that's what I have in my 6.3 base repo
[2013-06-06 23:35:18 -0400] sascha_d: if you have other packages, it would show "available packages" and "installed packages"
[2013-06-06 23:36:33 -0400] sascha_d: so you'll either need to go download other rpms and put them in a local custom repo or set up additional repo configs to wherever they are located
[2013-06-06 23:39:22 -0400] dantmcgowan: @sascha_d so my use case is building vm with these lamp components within a vagrant file....so u are suggesting some custom repo setup on vm prior to running chef?
[2013-06-06 23:39:39 -0400] sascha_d: no, there's a yum cookbook
[2013-06-06 23:40:04 -0400] sascha_d: with a yum_repository resource and a couple of common repo recipes (like for epel)
[2013-06-06 23:40:13 -0400] sascha_d: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/yum
[2013-06-06 23:44:22 -0400] dantmcgowan: @sascha_d oooh i see ...so if i include yum in my build list then `yum info php` will show available packages?
[2013-06-06 23:44:51 -0400] sascha_d: well, maybe
[2013-06-06 23:45:04 -0400] sascha_d: I'm guessing there's another more recent one in the epel repo?
[2013-06-06 23:45:15 -0400] sascha_d: so if you have unrestricted internet, it shouldn't be too bad?
[2013-06-06 23:46:02 -0400] sascha_d: also there's this: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/php
[2013-06-06 23:47:41 -0400] dantmcgowan: @sascha_d...this may be a pure newbie comment...but seems really hard to get a package with a specific version...
[2013-06-06 23:47:43 -0400] sascha_d: so looks like it will download the source code and compile php
[2013-06-06 23:47:48 -0400] sascha_d: well, yes
[2013-06-06 23:48:21 -0400] sascha_d: chef is not a package manager.  You need to be in charge of your packages.  Depending on what you're doing these build for, there are different ways you can approach it
[2013-06-06 23:48:53 -0400] dantmcgowan: so goal was to use vagrant and chef to have a consistent vm built
[2013-06-06 23:49:17 -0400] sascha_d: I approve 100%
[2013-06-06 23:49:28 -0400] sascha_d: the question is, what needs to go in that vm?
[2013-06-06 23:50:03 -0400] sascha_d: I can see you are building a lamp stack.  Are those versions specific for your needs or are they part of the example?
[2013-06-06 23:50:16 -0400] sascha_d: I haven't looked at much of the learnchef site
[2013-06-06 23:51:10 -0400] dantmcgowan: by default my chef cookbooks build the following: apache (2.2.15); mysql (5.1.69) and php (5.3.3)
[2013-06-06 23:51:29 -0400] dantmcgowan:  my target versions for each component is apache (2.2.3); mysql (5.5.30) and php (5.3.25)
[2013-06-06 23:52:37 -0400] dantmcgowan: so i tried modifying cookbooks/php/recipes/package.rb and putting version 5.3.25 before the action install
[2013-06-06 23:52:41 -0400] sascha_d: right
[2013-06-06 23:52:52 -0400] dantmcgowan: and got the error...but i did nothing with yum cookbook
[2013-06-06 23:52:55 -0400] sascha_d: so none of the centos base repos are going to have that
[2013-06-06 23:53:01 -0400] sascha_d: b/c it's even older than what they already have
[2013-06-06 23:53:03 -0400] sascha_d: which is old
[2013-06-06 23:53:12 -0400] sascha_d: are you using these versions now?
[2013-06-06 23:53:16 -0400] sascha_d: someplace else?
[2013-06-06 23:53:20 -0400] dantmcgowan: yes
[2013-06-06 23:53:31 -0400] sascha_d: how do you install them?
[2013-06-06 23:54:09 -0400] dantmcgowan: it was one of the package managers...not recalling atm
[2013-06-06 23:54:50 -0400] sascha_d: well, Centos base offiical has 5.3 for 6 and php5.1 for 5
[2013-06-06 23:54:59 -0400] dantmcgowan: but my efforts now are to target a new os on a new vm...and keeping components the same (if possible
[2013-06-06 23:55:06 -0400] sascha_d: so wherever you are pulling those version from...
[2013-06-06 23:56:00 -0400] sascha_d: http://us.php.net/downloads.php
[2013-06-06 23:56:41 -0400] sascha_d: So let me give you a little chef tidbit: The advantage you get here is that Chef knows how to interact with your package manager (yum or apt or whatevs) without you having to tell it anything
[2013-06-06 23:57:03 -0400] sascha_d: However, keeping a package repo or a collection of known packages is something you should think about, depending on your access to the interent
[2013-06-06 23:57:05 -0400] sascha_d: Internet
[2013-06-06 23:57:06 -0400] sascha_d: http://us.php.net/downloads.php
[2013-06-06 23:57:08 -0400] sascha_d: so there's that
[2013-06-06 23:57:23 -0400] sascha_d: You can actually update the php recipe to install from source instead of using the package
[2013-06-06 23:57:46 -0400] sascha_d: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/php/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L22
[2013-06-06 23:57:48 -0400] sascha_d: on that line
[2013-06-06 23:57:52 -0400] sascha_d: switch it to "source"
[2013-06-06 23:57:55 -0400] dantmcgowan: so more important than these specific versions - is to just have consistent versions whenever vagrant file and chef cookbooks r run
[2013-06-06 23:58:13 -0400] sascha_d: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/php/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L22
[2013-06-06 23:58:26 -0400] sascha_d: sorr
[2013-06-06 23:58:26 -0400] sascha_d: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/php/blob/master/attributes/default.rb#L60
[2013-06-06 23:58:37 -0400] sascha_d: on the second spot is where you set the version
[2013-06-06 23:58:49 -0400] sascha_d: if the php url has the version, it will (should) download and build it
[2013-06-06 23:59:00 -0400] sascha_d: well so right
[2013-06-06 23:59:08 -0400] sascha_d: then you use the package install type
[2013-06-06 23:59:40 -0400] sascha_d: and unless you get another repo from somewhere, you will always get that php 5.3.3 version
