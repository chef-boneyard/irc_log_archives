[2013-06-11 15:21:55 -0400] rep0st: so i'm a self admitted noob learning git. I have a fairly decent handle on chef. What i'm trying to do is emulate opscode-cookbooks on github by having each cookbook in its own git repository within our internal git repo we have light modifications in some of the community cookbooks. i.e apt default.rb recipe has light decision making on what internal apt repos to drop in. I'm having trouble installing the newest apt cookbook via knife cookbook site ins
