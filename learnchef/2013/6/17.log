[2013-06-17 05:58:13 -0400] Walid: hi, can one explain the logic behind magic_shell_alias
[2013-06-17 05:58:58 -0400] Walid: as i did follow the procedure as much as possible "using centos instead of Ubuntu" and i have one issu with the default.rb only, otherwise everything else is fine
[2013-06-17 06:01:55 -0400] binamov: Walid can we see a gist?
[2013-06-17 06:08:00 -0400] Walid: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5794895
[2013-06-17 06:08:09 -0400] Walid: here it is binamov 
[2013-06-17 06:13:56 -0400] Walid: ok i fixed it, i used Ansible ;-P
[2013-06-17 06:14:04 -0400] binamov: did you upload the cookbook?
[2013-06-17 06:14:16 -0400] Walid: yes the playbook did fix it, thanks
[2013-06-17 12:46:29 -0400] JDGaillard: Hi ! I am actually looking for a patch-deploiment tool for deploie some patches via a VPN and I am wndering if Chef is what I need?
[2013-06-17 14:35:40 -0400] bleepbloop: quick question, not sure if anyone is active
[2013-06-17 14:36:22 -0400] bleepbloop: I have been trying to get ruby-block to run a cron job for me, it doesn't throw any errors, but nothing seems to happen either https://gist.github.com/rbclark/18adc7315bc89556b4ea
[2013-06-17 14:37:05 -0400] bleepbloop: I need it to be in a ruby block because if I try to do it as a regular cron resource then I can't get to the environment variables I have set that I need

[2013-06-17 15:09:57 -0400] theNetImp: having an issue with chef.  I have set up an EC2 instance using knife ec2, and have created a collection of cookbooks, but when I tried to tell knife to run chef-client on the ec2 server it errors out.
[2013-06-17 15:10:08 -0400] theNetImp: My error is "FATAL: 1 node found, but does not have the required attribute to establish the connection. Try setting another attribute to open the connection using --attribute." 
[2013-06-17 15:10:38 -0400] theNetImp: the cli I am using is "knife ssh name:i-98a4fead -x ubuntu "sudo chef-client" -a ec2.public_dns"
[2013-06-17 15:10:57 -0400] theNetImp: I've googled around, used -V to get more information, but I am at a loss
[2013-06-17 15:11:25 -0400] theNetImp: thoughts?

[2013-06-17 17:06:19 -0400] theNetImp: oops
[2013-06-17 19:41:36 -0400] DandyPandy: Silly question. I've setup chef-server and now I need to know what port I should tell knife to connect on. What's the default? The default in the knife setup is 4000, but that port isn't listening on the server.
[2013-06-17 19:42:00 -0400] DandyPandy: I've tried 443, but I'm getting an error trying to upload a cookbook.
