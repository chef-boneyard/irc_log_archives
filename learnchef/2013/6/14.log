[2013-06-14 02:20:32 -0400] gems: if i modify a role in dev, how do i prevent the changes in that role from causing issues in prod?
[2013-06-14 03:57:30 -0400] sascha_d: @gems look for information on Chef Environments and env runlists
[2013-06-14 03:57:43 -0400] sascha_d: also, try the main chef channel as there's more people there
[2013-06-14 14:38:51 -0400] fractaloop: What exactly is this omnibus stuff I see a lot? I get the impression it's like apt/yum/zypper for Chef
[2013-06-14 14:57:42 -0400] mattray: fractaloop: it's a package builder for including all the dependencies needed for your application
[2013-06-14 14:58:17 -0400] mattray: we use it with chef-client to have the same version of Ruby and Chef with all dependencies be the same across Linux, Windows, Unixes
[2013-06-14 14:58:32 -0400] mattray: no more futzing with finding Ruby 1.9.3 for RHEL 5
[2013-06-14 14:58:40 -0400] mattray: or the pain of Ruby on Windows
[2013-06-14 14:58:46 -0400] mattray: installs to /opt/chef-client
[2013-06-14 14:59:07 -0400] fractaloop: "Your application" being?
[2013-06-14 14:59:19 -0400] mattray: chef-client, chef-server
[2013-06-14 14:59:33 -0400] fractaloop: Ah ok thanks
[2013-06-14 14:59:33 -0400] mattray: people have started building their own applications with it too
[2013-06-14 14:59:42 -0400] mattray: we also build the server with it now, so erlang, ruby and java dependencies are all included in a single package, no distro dependencies
[2013-06-14 15:00:05 -0400] mattray: it insulates you from the vagaries of the operating system
[2013-06-14 15:00:23 -0400] mattray: and it's cross platform
[2013-06-14 15:00:49 -0400] mattray: ruby, python, erlang, java, doesn't really matter
[2013-06-14 22:27:07 -0400] polo: How do you echo output on a bash provider?
[2013-06-14 22:27:34 -0400] polo: I have a recipe that does echo, but when I trigger it on the node running a "chef-client" no output is generated.
