[2013-06-20 15:45:45 -0400] ianneub: I'm building my first LWRP, but hitting a snag when trying to notify other resources (outside the provider i'm writting). i get a Chef::Exceptions::ResourceNotFound: resource execute[nxensite mysite] is configured to notify resource service[nginx] with action reload, but service[nginx] cannot be found in the resource collection.
[2013-06-20 15:45:59 -0400] ianneub: i've tried with and without use_inline_resources, but both ways i hit some kind of issue, so not sure where to go from here. any thoughts?
[2013-06-20 15:49:52 -0400] gems: I've moved my role override attributes into a chef environment.  My environment now contains attributes specific to that env for the proxy and webserver roles.  When I set a node to that environment, the node now has attributes for proxy and webserver.  However, a node will only be *either* a proxy or webserver, and doesn't need attributes for the other.  Anyone have any tips or is this ok?
[2013-06-20 15:54:03 -0400] ianneub: gems: as long as the run_list only tells each node to be one or the other, then it shouldn't matter that it as additional attributes
[2013-06-20 15:56:16 -0400] gems: great, thanks

[2013-06-20 22:42:42 -0400] ianneub: you can do that from the node edit page on the chef server
[2013-06-20 22:45:21 -0400] netty195: ok that was simple
[2013-06-20 22:46:55 -0400] netty195: will this do the same thing (for my info)
[2013-06-20 22:46:55 -0400] netty195: knife exec -E 'nodes.transform("name:Staging1") { |n| n.chef_environment("staging") }'
