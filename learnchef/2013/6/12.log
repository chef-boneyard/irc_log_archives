[2013-06-12 11:06:52 -0400] nicloay:  Hi everyone
[2013-06-12 11:07:12 -0400] nicloay: Could someone explain to me what i need to do next. I applied role to the node, this role contains some receipts, but i can't find what to do next to apply new receipts to the node. do i need to use knife bootstrap NODE_NAME or something else.
[2013-06-12 17:02:46 -0400] richard_wolford: Hi, I'm having severe chef problems   I have successfully bootstrapped a linux node from a windows workstation.  I have also set its run list, all using the knife command.  In my knife.rb and client.rb (on the linux node) I have specified the IP address of the chef server.  However, every time I call chef-client on the linux node, it is trying to use a host name of a chef server that doesn't even exist.  How to I get chef c
[2013-06-12 20:39:49 -0400] ozz: hello, can anyone help me understand the difference between a role and an environment?
[2013-06-12 20:41:16 -0400] rep0st: a role is a definitive repeatable pattern that can be applied to multiple nodes. a node can only belong to 1 environment. In attribute precedence, attributes in an environment get applied over attributes in roles
[2013-06-12 20:41:19 -0400] ozz: the code i'm working with currently uses roles for each environment... ex: server_dev, server_prod.  I'm trying to figure out how to change these roles to use environments and i'm not real clear on teh difference.
[2013-06-12 20:42:01 -0400] rep0st: so a node can only belong to one environment
[2013-06-12 20:42:11 -0400] rep0st: while a node can belong to multiple roles
[2013-06-12 20:42:32 -0400] rep0st: so taking your example i would have a prod chef environment and a dev chef environment
[2013-06-12 20:42:45 -0400] rep0st: each environment would contain attributes specific to that dev or prod environment
[2013-06-12 20:43:06 -0400] rep0st: while a role can set the run list for that environment. So in your role you can set env_run_list
[2013-06-12 20:44:24 -0400] rep0st: when using a role. only set items in the run_list section if it's not unique. If it's unique to a dev or prod environment set it in there. 
[2013-06-12 20:48:11 -0400] ozzz_: sorry, i had a dc there.  to follow up what you wrote:
[2013-06-12 20:48:36 -0400] ozzz_: if I have multiple roles in dev, each with their own attributes, would i then put all those attributes in 1 environment dev file?
[2013-06-12 20:48:52 -0400] ozzz_: basically leaving only the run_list left in the roles
[2013-06-12 20:50:11 -0400] rep0st: if they're specific to one particular dev environment
[2013-06-12 20:50:21 -0400] rep0st: because don't forget a node can only belong to one environment
[2013-06-12 20:51:59 -0400] ozzz_: so this gets back to my confusion... if i put the environment specific attributes in the environment file, as well as the run list in the environment file... there's nothing really left in my role.
[2013-06-12 20:52:13 -0400] rep0st: in my opinion attributes in roles should only ever exist if they're never going to change. 
[2013-06-12 20:52:39 -0400] rep0st: usually roles dictate what run list to run per chef environment
[2013-06-12 20:53:38 -0400] rep0st: so if i have a role called default in that role i have two env_run_lists dev and prod. in the dev run list i tell it to run recipe[sudo] and then in the dev chef environment file i set the attributes in authorization , groups what groups to log into. 
[2013-06-12 20:54:07 -0400] rep0st: that ensures my dev nodes don't get production sudo settings
[2013-06-12 20:55:11 -0400] rep0st: in the default role i would have stuff like dns-nameservers or ntp server attributes or snmp attributes as those attributes get applied to all nodes with the default role
[2013-06-12 20:57:34 -0400] rep0st: and within that default role i would have a generic run_list of recipe[resolver], recipe[snmp],recipe[ntp::client]
[2013-06-12 20:57:36 -0400] rep0st: hope that makes sense
[2013-06-12 20:59:10 -0400] ozzz_: couldn't those attributes you left in the roles be different from environment to environment?
[2013-06-12 20:59:41 -0400] rep0st: meaning dns servers ntp and snmp?
[2013-06-12 20:59:42 -0400] rep0st: i mean
[2013-06-12 20:59:50 -0400] ozzz_: yes
[2013-06-12 21:02:05 -0400] rep0st: possible, but if that's the case i would update my resume. i picked those because it really shouldnt, but it could be possible. It depends on your situation and how your infrastructure is setup. But the point i was trying to make is that, attributes inside of role should be only be there if they can be safely applied across ALL nodes and not change very often. In my infrastructure my dev and prod environments share ntp, dns, and snmp settings so i set t
[2013-06-12 21:03:38 -0400] ozzz_: Gotcha.  I now see what you were saying, I was taking some mental freedoms with your example. :)
[2013-06-12 21:03:48 -0400] rep0st: no worries
[2013-06-12 21:05:02 -0400] rep0st: if you think an attribute is going to change more than once or if it needs logic applied to it. a cookbook is where you want to go. 
[2013-06-12 21:05:57 -0400] rep0st: if you need an attribute applied to a set of nodes and absolutely make sure they need to get set 1000% of the time AND you know they're going to chagne from time to time.. a chef environment is what you want. 
[2013-06-12 21:06:10 -0400] rep0st: that's how i've been approacing the chef objects
[2013-06-12 21:08:15 -0400] ozzz_: Ok feeling a little better about them.  Lastly, can you clear up the environment env_run_lists vs the role env_run_lists for me?
[2013-06-12 21:08:58 -0400] rep0st: ? you mean in a role file, the difference between run_list and env_run_list?
[2013-06-12 21:13:14 -0400] rep0st: in any event env_run_list dictates a run list for a specific chef_environment
[2013-06-12 21:13:25 -0400] rep0st: where as  run_list dictates a more generic run_list 
[2013-06-12 22:19:46 -0400] dardub: brand new to chef, if I make local changes to a recipe, how do I make the changes take effect in vagrant, i'm using hosted opscode service
[2013-06-12 22:22:00 -0400] dardub: oh, is it vagrant provision?
[2013-06-12 22:30:22 -0400] andreask: nyone an elegant idea how to print the value of a data bag entry to sdout ? ... like a script returning a secret on execution
[2013-06-12 22:33:26 -0400] mattray1: andreask: knife data bag show BAG ITEM?
[2013-06-12 22:34:38 -0400] andreask: mattray: I'd prefer to not install knife on all clients ... is that possible with chef-client? or a bad idea?
[2013-06-12 22:34:56 -0400] mattray: knife comes with the chef-client
[2013-06-12 22:35:12 -0400] mattray: it's in the .deb
[2013-06-12 22:36:17 -0400] andreask: hmm ... so I would at least need to provide a config file for knife?
[2013-06-12 23:40:16 -0400] bangmo: Is there a way to create a group of servers in chef, without having to create a property for the node on each node?
[2013-06-12 23:40:28 -0400] bangmo: Is there an entity that allows me to group servers?
[2013-06-12 23:40:39 -0400] bangmo: Say - a role or environment that associates servers with it?
[2013-06-12 23:41:36 -0400] bangmo: and then is there a runlist that by association the servers will be able to execute if I simply trigger chef-client on each server rather than using knife?
[2013-06-12 23:42:28 -0400] bangmo: Someone?
