[2013-06-25 12:57:24 -0400] wsoula: I installed chef server 11 and I tried to do a simple knife client list but I get a connection reset by peer error message, can anyone help me figure out what is wrong?
[2013-06-25 12:59:11 -0400] wsoula: I copied my private key from the webui, I got the private key for chef-validator in clients of the webui.  And got knife.rb from trying to run knife configure -i, but that failed till I realized that chef 11 is on ssl and the path to it is https://[chef-server-url]

[2013-06-25 14:13:31 -0400] tmilne: Hi. I'm learning how to use chef, but currently I'm having a problem setting up multiple nodes on the same machine. Currently, I'm trying to use knife ssh to run a command on the node, but I have no idea where to set the ip address for it. I've created the node using knife and it's appeared on the chef server (I'm using the hosted solution at the moment). Any hints, tips or links to useful pages? Thanks!
[2013-06-25 14:56:53 -0400] pedda: hi all
[2013-06-25 14:57:09 -0400] pedda: i'm starting with chef and i have a problem using the mysql cookbook.. 
[2013-06-25 14:57:25 -0400] pedda: i have some error telling me, mysql client can't be installed..
[2013-06-25 14:57:56 -0400] pedda: i googled a lot and found a gist mentioning the use of apt cookbook.. but even if i rely on apt recipe included first, my problem persists..
[2013-06-25 14:58:02 -0400] pedda: https://gist.github.com/lvnilesh/4039324
[2013-06-25 15:00:00 -0400] knuckolls: pedda: if you log into the machine can you run this by hand? `apt-get -q -y install mysql-client=5.5.24-0ubuntu0.12.04.1`
[2013-06-25 15:01:02 -0400] pedda: no, as the vm fails at a point where ssh is not possible.. but let me comment out that recipe and create the vm once again..
[2013-06-25 15:02:29 -0400] knuckolls: but but.. how did it bootstrap the vm without ssh?
[2013-06-25 15:03:21 -0400] pedda: ?
[2013-06-25 15:04:35 -0400] pedda: i mixed things up.. 
[2013-06-25 15:05:07 -0400] pedda: the first time i type vagrant up, the booting fails of the vm fails which ends up in an aborted status
[2013-06-25 15:05:20 -0400] pedda: i am advised to run my vm from within vb
[2013-06-25 15:05:22 -0400] knuckolls: `vagrant ssh`
[2013-06-25 15:05:44 -0400] knuckolls: if the box is up, you should be able to vagrant ssh into it, even if the chef provisioner failed
[2013-06-25 15:06:00 -0400] knuckolls: pedda: ^^
[2013-06-25 15:06:10 -0400] pedda: sorry..
[2013-06-25 15:06:15 -0400] pedda: just give me a sec..
[2013-06-25 15:06:21 -0400] knuckolls: sure
[2013-06-25 15:07:06 -0400] pedda: well the first time i run vagrant up, the vm fails to remain in the running state
[2013-06-25 15:07:28 -0400] knuckolls: oh really?
[2013-06-25 15:07:29 -0400] pedda: the second time i run vagrant up, it starts the whole provisoning process which usually fails because of the mysql recipe..
[2013-06-25 15:07:42 -0400] knuckolls: you can vagrant up --no-provision
[2013-06-25 15:07:44 -0400] knuckolls: or something like that
[2013-06-25 15:07:47 -0400] knuckolls: there is a flag.
[2013-06-25 15:08:04 -0400] pedda: but i commented it out, and try to provision without mysql , to see if the command can be run manually with success
[2013-06-25 15:08:19 -0400] pedda: oh, didn't knew there is --no-provision
[2013-06-25 15:08:25 -0400] pedda: speeds up testing a lot
[2013-06-25 15:08:55 -0400] pedda: i use bindfs in addition to nfs feature.. thought this can cause the first error..
[2013-06-25 15:09:25 -0400] pedda: didn't inspect that further, as the vm remains running if i use vagrant up for a second time
[2013-06-25 15:11:37 -0400] pedda: damnit apache2 ends up with the same error
[2013-06-25 15:11:51 -0400] pedda: but i can ssh into the vm
[2013-06-25 15:11:59 -0400] pedda: i will try the mysql install command now
[2013-06-25 15:13:15 -0400] pedda: knuckolls if i try this: apt-get -q -y install libmysqlclient-dev=5.5.31-0ubuntu0.12.04.2 i get: W: Not using locking for read only lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock
[2013-06-25 15:13:59 -0400] pedda: if i run dpkg --configure -a to correct the problem, ii get a message about still being in a read only file system
[2013-06-25 15:16:14 -0400] pedda: i will run vagrant with --no-provisioning
[2013-06-25 15:20:23 -0400] knuckolls: pedda: try it with sudo
[2013-06-25 15:20:43 -0400] knuckolls: pedda: then run an apt-get update, and try again to see if that's the problem
[2013-06-25 15:21:22 -0400] pedda: i destroyed the box already (as i can't halt it anymore)
[2013-06-25 15:21:52 -0400] pedda: i tried with sudo
[2013-06-25 15:21:54 -0400] pedda: btw
[2013-06-25 15:22:04 -0400] pedda: but i missed apt-get update
[2013-06-25 15:22:36 -0400] knuckolls: the locking error is one i'm unfamiliar with
[2013-06-25 15:22:52 -0400] pedda: tbh. my vagrant vm was working quite fine until i decided to rely on community cookbooks to stay "up to date" with the use of git submodules..
[2013-06-25 15:23:00 -0400] knuckolls: but 99% of my problems with apt have been due to update not being run, or two apt things running at the same time and getting ultra-mad
[2013-06-25 15:23:14 -0400] pedda: okay.. good to know
[2013-06-25 15:23:23 -0400] knuckolls: may i kindly point you in the direction of berkshelf instead of the submodule route
[2013-06-25 15:23:32 -0400] knuckolls: i consider it cookbook development easy-mode
[2013-06-25 15:23:50 -0400] pedda: berkshelf?
[2013-06-25 15:23:59 -0400] pedda: let me google it
[2013-06-25 15:24:10 -0400] knuckolls: there was a keynote about it at the last chefconf
[2013-06-25 15:24:12 -0400] pedda: i noticed knife a few hours ago..
[2013-06-25 15:24:13 -0400] knuckolls: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYt0E84kYUI
[2013-06-25 15:31:25 -0400] pedda: knuckolls i need some time now ;)
[2013-06-25 15:31:37 -0400] pedda: i will checkout berkshelf
[2013-06-25 18:25:23 -0400] wimvandijck: Hi, I'm having trouble bootstrapping a server. My workstation (OSX) seems to be setup fine. knife client list shows the desired output. But if I run 'knife bootstrap xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' I get: Unmatched '. , followed by 'Badly placed ()'s'. and 'invalid null command'. Any pointers to what might cause this?
[2013-06-25 18:25:35 -0400] wimvandijck: The server is freeBSD 9.1
[2013-06-25 18:26:07 -0400] wimvandijck: and has the chef gem (10.24.0) installed
[2013-06-25 18:26:37 -0400] wimvandijck: I checked the bootstrap.rb code, but found no mention of these error messages...
[2013-06-25 18:29:13 -0400] wimvandijck: The ssh login works, I see public key authentication succeeding on the server side
[2013-06-25 18:32:47 -0400] wimvandijck: aha! those are csh errors... the root account on the server had csh as shell. Changing that to bash makes the error go away :)
[2013-06-25 18:59:34 -0400] KineticChef: Hello, I am trying to do the first chef tutorial and I seem to be running into an issue with Vagrant and the VirtualBox
[2013-06-25 19:00:46 -0400] KineticChef: This is the error I run into: http://pastie.org/8079768
[2013-06-25 19:00:59 -0400] KineticChef: Can I please have help resolving this issue?
[2013-06-25 19:02:30 -0400] xrl: I'm getting "Your validation client is not authorized to create the client for this node (HTTP 403)." but I don't know what I changed to break it
[2013-06-25 19:02:35 -0400] xrl: we already have a chef setup
[2013-06-25 19:02:44 -0400] xrl: but now I'm redoing the chef system with berkhself
[2013-06-25 19:02:56 -0400] xrl: still deploying with knife and a .chef/knife.rb (unchanged from before)
[2013-06-25 19:03:05 -0400] xrl: the only thing I can think is that this is an upgrade from chef 10 to chef 11
[2013-06-25 19:16:27 -0400] KineticChef: Is anyone here?
[2013-06-25 19:18:15 -0400] ktam: hello, I'd be grateful if someone could explain best practices for chef attributes: it's stated that "normal" attributes are the only ones that persist through chef runs, yet it's advised that default attributes should be the most often used wherever possible
[2013-06-25 19:19:25 -0400] ktam: we have a bunch of existing cookbooks using normal ("set") to define attributes in attribute files
[2013-06-25 19:20:08 -0400] ktam: but this is leading to annoying behaviour when those attribute definitions are removed from the cookbooks - they persist in the chef org instead of being reset
[2013-06-25 19:20:25 -0400] ktam: a couple of potential solutions: 1) using override 2) rewriting the cookbooks to use default
[2013-06-25 19:21:05 -0400] ktam: however, it's stated in the opscode chef docs that 1) override should only be used where necessary
[2013-06-25 19:21:30 -0400] ktam: and 2) using default for attributes at this point won't override them in the cheforg, because they are of lower precence
[2013-06-25 19:24:14 -0400] ktam: most annoyingly, 3) it seems that the only attribute that persists "across the chef run' is normal - so does that mean using any other level of attribute won't persist in the chef org?
[2013-06-25 19:24:28 -0400] ktam: any advice would be much appreciated
[2013-06-25 20:16:48 -0400] wsoula: i installed chef 11 today and i can view the web-ui at http://localhost:9462.  What do I need to change to view the web-ui at http://[fqdn]:9462?
[2013-06-25 20:49:31 -0400] xrl: does a node go one-to-one with a server? it looks like I'm able to create multiple of the same node
[2013-06-25 20:49:36 -0400] xrl: can I do a lock on that?
