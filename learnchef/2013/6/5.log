[2013-06-05 01:57:11 -0400] dgrijalva: hi guys.  quick q: Is it possible to require a library from another cookbook?
[2013-06-05 06:25:34 -0400] chrishough: I am trying to find a great walkthrough on setting up 2 servers, 1 postgress, 1 web server for a rails apps.  anyone know of a good guide by chance? 
[2013-06-05 06:46:33 -0400] chrishough: does chef hosted need the knife-solo gem?
[2013-06-05 17:30:40 -0400] eponymi: not necessarily a ruby lang question (more cucumber and chef), but i figured i might find some help here. in the chef cookbook for mysql (https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql), there are two files in ./test/features/support/. these files are not `require`d anywhere that i can see. but they are used in the step_definitions. is there some sort of auto loading magic in cucumber that i am missing?
[2013-06-05 19:47:09 -0400] chrishough: clear
[2013-06-05 19:56:36 -0400] behemphi: (screen goes blank  prompt flashing)
[2013-06-05 19:56:45 -0400] behemphi: :-)
[2013-06-05 20:13:18 -0400] rich__: chef newbie here, trying to get chef-server-11.0.8-1.el6.x86_64.rpm working on RHEL 6.4.  getting errors after sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure
[2013-06-05 20:13:33 -0400] rich__: the first one is: [2013-06-05T15:08:53-05:00] FATAL: Stacktrace dumped to /opt/chef-server/embedded/cookbooks/cache/chef-stacktrace.out
[2013-06-05 20:14:14 -0400] rich__: i don't want to flood the # with error messages. please advise what else i should share :)
[2013-06-05 20:14:40 -0400] behemphi: hello rich__
[2013-06-05 20:15:15 -0400] behemphi: Usually post error text to pastebin or gist
[2013-06-05 20:15:32 -0400] behemphi: be aware that passwords _can_ show up when you run in debug mode,
[2013-06-05 20:15:43 -0400] rich__: thanks b. let me see if i can get to pastebin from my corporate network :(
[2013-06-05 20:15:50 -0400] behemphi: I am not familiar with chef-server
[2013-06-05 20:15:59 -0400] behemphi: we use Hosted Chef so we don't have that headache
[2013-06-05 20:16:24 -0400] rich__: ah, thanks
[2013-06-05 20:16:25 -0400] behemphi: if you are really just getting started with the learnign process, I would suggest the free account (5 nodes) so you get reduce the learning curve
[2013-06-05 20:16:48 -0400] behemphi: I suspect your corp net will keep you from hosted chef too
[2013-06-05 20:16:54 -0400] rich__: behemphi, good suggestion. i have an account setup but we have a very ... conservative... firewall here.
[2013-06-05 20:17:06 -0400] rich__: i'm surprised i can get to this irc chat :)
[2013-06-05 20:17:07 -0400] behemphi: So, in that case you might _start_ with chef-solo
[2013-06-05 20:17:14 -0400] rich__: http://pastebin.com/TBMph7Fn
[2013-06-05 20:17:20 -0400] rich__: chef-solo, ok. i'll google that.
[2013-06-05 20:17:30 -0400] behemphi: I prefer chef-client b/c of the state I get from the server
[2013-06-05 20:17:43 -0400] behemphi: but again, as a learning tool it will reduce the curve substantially
[2013-06-05 20:18:05 -0400] behemphi: sorry I cannot help you getting the server going.  We just have not yet had that problem (yay!)
[2013-06-05 20:18:42 -0400] rich__: i'm glad you haven't had that problem :)  thanks for the feedback though. 
[2013-06-05 20:23:21 -0400] rich__: behemphi, are you attending the Chef 2 Day Fundamentals in Austin in a couple weeks?
[2013-06-05 20:23:41 -0400] behemphi: No, I have most of the content there down.
[2013-06-05 20:23:55 -0400] behemphi: I am holding out for a workflow series
[2013-06-05 20:23:56 -0400] rich__: ah ok
[2013-06-05 20:24:15 -0400] behemphi: berkshelf, vagrant, test kitchen, fauxhai, etc
[2013-06-05 20:24:32 -0400] behemphi: I would recommend it though Rich
[2013-06-05 20:24:54 -0400] behemphi: If you are Austin, do you know about Austin Devops and Chef Cafe?
[2013-06-05 20:25:10 -0400] rich__: we're considering it for sure.  I didn't know about that. I"m just down the road in San Antonio
[2013-06-05 20:25:31 -0400] behemphi: THe former is pretty general (we meet Monday), the later is Matt Ray having office hours once a month and is just awesome for chef specific stuff
[2013-06-05 20:25:45 -0400] rich__: I recently read The Phoenix Project and begged and pleaded with teammates to read it as well... and now we have a bug up our ass to improve our deployment/development efforts :)
[2013-06-05 20:25:59 -0400] behemphi: I read it too after Chef Conf
[2013-06-05 20:26:02 -0400] behemphi: fantastic
[2013-06-05 20:26:10 -0400] behemphi: I recommend also reading The Goal
[2013-06-05 20:26:11 -0400] rich__: agreed! i followed it up by reading The Goal
[2013-06-05 20:26:15 -0400] behemphi: jynx!
[2013-06-05 20:26:21 -0400] rich__: then i bought 4 more Goldratt books :)
[2013-06-05 20:26:30 -0400] behemphi: you have me there!
[2013-06-05 20:26:35 -0400] behemphi: who do you work for?
[2013-06-05 20:26:48 -0400] rich__: i've found several folks have the same experience... they read TPJ and then get really interested in The Goal and such
[2013-06-05 20:26:53 -0400] rich__: TPP
[2013-06-05 20:27:01 -0400] rich__: Frost Bank, sshh ;)
[2013-06-05 20:27:01 -0400] behemphi: I wonder if we could somehow setup Austin Devops to "broadcast" so that you all in SA could virtually attend
[2013-06-05 20:27:13 -0400] behemphi: neat!
[2013-06-05 20:28:12 -0400] rich__: yourself? I'd look you up on Linkedin... but it's on the naughty list ;)
[2013-06-05 20:28:39 -0400] behemphi: I am at a small startup called Feedmagnet
[2013-06-05 20:29:05 -0400] behemphi: We have about 200 rackspace cloud servers.  Chef is critical to our operation
[2013-06-05 20:29:09 -0400] behemphi: no chef = no feedmagnet
[2013-06-05 20:29:32 -0400] rich__: awesome
[2013-06-05 20:29:38 -0400] behemphi: I lurk here to help out as a way of contribing b/c I cannot get my act together on pull requests
[2013-06-05 20:30:14 -0400] rich__: lol
[2013-06-05 20:31:15 -0400] rich__: i may try the previous version of chef-server and see if i get the same errors.
[2013-06-05 20:31:39 -0400] behemphi: shot in the dark:  Are you using the omnibus installer?
[2013-06-05 20:31:56 -0400] rich__: i thought that was what the rpm was... maybe not?
[2013-06-05 20:31:58 -0400] behemphi: apparently that is the schizizle
[2013-06-05 20:32:21 -0400] behemphi: no, omnibus AFAIK is a completely self contained envrionment
[2013-06-05 20:32:28 -0400] behemphi: has its own ruby and everything
[2013-06-05 20:32:42 -0400] rundeckuser9: hi all, i'm trying to use rundeck with the knife winrm, and i'm getting /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/chef-11.4.4/lib/chef/knife.rb:235:in `pwd': No such file or directory - getcwd (Errno::ENOENT)
[2013-06-05 20:33:01 -0400] rundeckuser9: when i set plugin.script-exec.default.command=knife -v it works fine but when i add knife winrm -h it says can't find cwd
[2013-06-05 20:33:12 -0400] rich__: i went to http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/, clicked the Chef Server, selected Enterprise Linux, 6, x86_64 and downloaded it.
[2013-06-05 20:33:30 -0400] rundeckuser9: how does knife know where to find winrm?
[2013-06-05 20:35:43 -0400] rich__: hi rundeckuser9, i'll have to leave that question to someone else. i'm a newbie trying to get a basic chef-server install completed ;)
[2013-06-05 20:36:57 -0400] behemphi: @rich__ that looks like it is omnibus, so I am totally out of ideas
[2013-06-05 20:42:57 -0400] rich__: thanks. i'm trying the previous release, 11.0.6
[2013-06-05 20:43:59 -0400] rich__: i think it'll fail too. when i do "ps -ef 
[2013-06-05 20:44:04 -0400] rich__:  "ps -ef | grep chef"
[2013-06-05 20:44:07 -0400] rich__: i see a strange process:
[2013-06-05 20:44:08 -0400] rich__: runsvdir -P /opt/chef-server/service log: ing: unable to open supervise/pid.new: file does not exist?runsv rabbitmq: warning: unable to open log/supervise/pid.new: file does not exist?runsv rabbitmq: warning: unable to open log/supervise/pid.new: file does not exist?runsv postgresql: warning: unable to open log/supervise/pid.new: file does not exist?runsv postgresql: warning: unable to open log/supervise/pid.new: file does not exi
[2013-06-05 20:44:26 -0400] rich__: i'd bet that it shouldn't say "file does not exist?" like that :)
[2013-06-05 20:44:35 -0400] behemphi: lol, good guess
[2013-06-05 20:44:42 -0400] behemphi: I am totally out of my depth here
[2013-06-05 20:44:51 -0400] rich__: lol, me too! but it's been kinda fun
[2013-06-05 20:44:58 -0400] rich__: it sure beats working ;)
[2013-06-05 20:45:09 -0400] behemphi: hacking > working
[2013-06-05 20:45:12 -0400] behemphi: I can get on board with that
[2013-06-05 20:52:15 -0400] dantmcgowan: i have tried several lamp tutorials and i have noticed that recipes frequently require me to add dependent cookbooks. I find i have to add build-essential, xml, openssl using "knife" command. Is there a better way for me to fulfill dependencies without having to add the cookbooks?
[2013-06-05 20:54:30 -0400] behemphi: @dantmcgowan  Can you explain what you mean by "using knife cmd"?
[2013-06-05 20:56:33 -0400] dantmcgowan: for instance after getting cookbook not found for build-essential I run "knife cookbook site download build-essential", then expand downloaded file into cookbooks dir
[2013-06-05 20:58:25 -0400] dantmcgowan: this approach works...but i figure there is probably a better way
[2013-06-05 20:59:59 -0400] behemphi: ah
[2013-06-05 21:00:59 -0400] behemphi: OK, so fundamentally @dantmcgowan the cookbook required must be on the chef server.  This could be any old version with the right name or it could be a required version.
[2013-06-05 21:01:20 -0400] behemphi: You method of managing it with knife is one way to make this happen
[2013-06-05 21:01:50 -0400] behemphi: There is a tool that has gained huge traction for managing this sort of thing out there called Berkshelf
[2013-06-05 21:02:08 -0400] behemphi: I _think_ that might be what you mean by "better way"
[2013-06-05 21:02:23 -0400] rich__: @behemphi, solved my problem.  shmmax and shmall in /etc/sysctl.conf were set for one of my oracle test installations which postgres did not like :)
[2013-06-05 21:02:47 -0400] behemphi: yikes, that will do it
[2013-06-05 21:02:53 -0400] rich__: when i viewed /var/log/chef-server/postgresql/current it showed me errors like: FATAL:  could not create shared memory segment: Cannot allocate memory
[2013-06-05 21:02:57 -0400] behemphi: and nice catch in the estoteria!
[2013-06-05 21:03:46 -0400] dantmcgowan: thx @behemphi i will look into berkshelf
[2013-06-05 21:07:11 -0400] dantmcgowan: now onto my blocker. I have been unable to run recipe for apt for a centos64 vm. I get this message "FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::Package: package[update-notifier-common] (apt::default line 48) had an error: Chef::Exceptions::Package: No version specified, and no candidate version available for update-notifier-common"
[2013-06-05 21:07:30 -0400] dantmcgowan: i have isolated my recipes list to only building apt
[2013-06-05 21:11:33 -0400] behemphi: @dantmcgowan that looks like the resource (yum I think) is not finding the package you are naming.
[2013-06-05 21:11:54 -0400] behemphi: somewhere in the error output frome the chef run will be the exact cmd run at the OS level
[2013-06-05 21:12:09 -0400] behemphi: try to copy/paste that to your CLI and see if it runs or what error it gives you
[2013-06-05 21:12:25 -0400] behemphi: It could be something as easy as a mispelling of the pkg name
[2013-06-05 21:18:30 -0400] dantmcgowan: @behemphi ok so error i see on run is this "Error executing action `run` on resource 'execute[apt-get-update]'"
[2013-06-05 21:19:03 -0400] behemphi: hmm
[2013-06-05 21:19:04 -0400] dantmcgowan: not sure what this translates to on cli?
[2013-06-05 21:19:27 -0400] behemphi: can you put the entire runs output in a gist or pastebin and provide the link
[2013-06-05 21:19:36 -0400] dantmcgowan: sure
[2013-06-05 21:25:38 -0400] dantmcgowan: @behemphi here is the gist: https://gist.github.com/dantmcgowan/5717442
[2013-06-05 21:28:12 -0400] behemphi: first question @dantmcgowan
[2013-06-05 21:28:16 -0400] behemphi: did you install the apt cookbook?
[2013-06-05 21:28:25 -0400] behemphi: (likely as a dependency from your first question)
[2013-06-05 21:31:10 -0400] behemphi: forget that, I assumed it provided an lwrp for update and upgrade but it does not
[2013-06-05 21:31:22 -0400] dantmcgowan: @behemphi yes I added to my cookbooks folder with this "git submodule add https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/apt.git cookbooks/apt"
[2013-06-05 21:31:47 -0400] behemphi: This is the useful error 
[2013-06-05 21:31:48 -0400] behemphi: Errno::ENOENT
[2013-06-05 21:31:48 -0400] behemphi: -------------

[2013-06-05 21:32:53 -0400] dantmcgowan: i tried the submodule method thinking the results may be different than the "knife
[2013-06-05 21:34:19 -0400] dantmcgowan: I tried the git submodule method to see if i mite get around the error i got with "knife" but alas I arrived at the same place - so a good test that both methods get you the same code at least
[2013-06-05 21:35:06 -0400] behemphi: The section below is "Compiled Resource"
[2013-06-05 21:35:16 -0400] behemphi: note the line command 
[2013-06-05 21:35:28 -0400] behemphi: seems like it should be hunky dory
[2013-06-05 21:35:54 -0400] behemphi: but given the error it also seems like it things "apt-get udpate" is a file to be executed
[2013-06-05 21:38:06 -0400] behemphi: sorry to ask the obvious @dantmcgowan
[2013-06-05 21:38:12 -0400] behemphi: wait
[2013-06-05 21:38:16 -0400] behemphi: you are on Centos right?
[2013-06-05 21:39:24 -0400] dantmcgowan: yes centos64
[2013-06-05 21:39:52 -0400] behemphi: so, of course apt-get does not exist! 
[2013-06-05 21:39:55 -0400] behemphi: < slaps head
[2013-06-05 21:40:03 -0400] behemphi: that is for debian/ubuntu
[2013-06-05 21:40:14 -0400] behemphi: and you should not include it directly in your run_list
[2013-06-05 21:40:37 -0400] behemphi: the metadata directive "depends" is in another recipe and requres it
[2013-06-05 21:40:43 -0400] dantmcgowan: @behemphi aha....so much for the tutorial....
[2013-06-05 21:40:51 -0400] behemphi: it will pull that cookbook in (really check that it exists)
[2013-06-05 21:40:58 -0400] behemphi: then never run it
[2013-06-05 21:41:16 -0400] behemphi: likely it will use the yum cookbook you also must have grabbed too
[2013-06-05 21:41:53 -0400] behemphi: I _think_ chef 11 allows for platform specific dependencies
[2013-06-05 21:42:18 -0400] behemphi: but most cookbooks have not yet implemented b/c they would be backwards incompat
[2013-06-05 21:42:30 -0400] dantmcgowan: @behemphi so here is what i was following http://adamcod.es/2013/01/15/vagrant-is-easy-chef-is-hard-part2.html
[2013-06-05 21:42:52 -0400] dantmcgowan: do i just drop the apt cookbook from the run list?
[2013-06-05 21:43:23 -0400] behemphi: yes
[2013-06-05 21:43:30 -0400] behemphi: but not from your repo
[2013-06-05 21:43:45 -0400] dantmcgowan: @behemphi...so it should just check im on centos and not attempt...correct?
[2013-06-05 21:44:35 -0400] dantmcgowan: @behemphi...ok i will leave in cookbooks but drop from run list and try again
[2013-06-05 21:44:37 -0400] behemphi: well, "it" is the php cookbook so one of the others.  So it will just check that apt is there
[2013-06-05 21:44:43 -0400] behemphi: then move on but never use it
[2013-06-05 21:52:08 -0400] dantmcgowan: @behemphi looks good: "INFO: Chef Run complete in 175.595594607 seconds"  thx for the help!
[2013-06-05 21:52:18 -0400] behemphi: sure
[2013-06-05 21:52:24 -0400] behemphi: happy cheffing
[2013-06-05 21:54:32 -0400] tBunnyMan: Thought maybe I should ask in here. I am not a ruby guy by far. Chef-11.4.4 depends on [json (<= 1.7.7, >= 1.4.4)]. However knife-linode depends on json (~> 1.7). How does one rig this to work? When I try to knife linode datacenter it bombs (Gem::LoadError)
[2013-06-05 22:14:46 -0400] rich__: time to bug out. thanks for the help boyd!
