[2013-06-13 00:27:29 -0400] ivanoats: does the apt recipe work with the latest version of chef? getting errors: https://gist.github.com/ivanoats/5770289
[2013-06-13 03:04:21 -0400] dieend: Hello, I was trying to bootstrap a node with knife. But it giving error like this:
[2013-06-13 03:04:22 -0400] dieend: localhost /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mixlib-log-1.4.1/lib/mixlib/log.rb:97:in `level=' localhost :  localhost Log level must be one of :debug, :info, :warn, :error, or :fatal localhost  ( localhost ArgumentError localhost ) localhost  localhost  localhost from /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/chef-10.14.4/lib/chef/application.rb:117:in `configure_logging' localhost from /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gem
[2013-06-13 03:05:07 -0400] dieend: chef-client -v give 11.4.4
[2013-06-13 03:05:19 -0400] dieend: so I assume it is because incompatible version
[2013-06-13 03:05:29 -0400] dieend: If I am correct, how to fix the problem?
[2013-06-13 04:32:28 -0400] gems: Hello all.  I was curious if someone has experience running a vm on parallels on os x and successfully bootstrapping with a hosted chef server?
[2013-06-13 05:48:43 -0400] simba_: wow this is really cool that people are helping like this
[2013-06-13 05:49:17 -0400] simba_: is there anyone here?

[2013-06-13 14:48:55 -0400] mmccarthy: This is probably a silly question but I keep getting "the following cookbooks are required by the client but don't exist on the server" "roles" when trying to create a server with a role ... anyone know why?
[2013-06-13 14:49:42 -0400] mattray: mmccarthy: you probably mis-typed your run list for your node
[2013-06-13 14:49:53 -0400] mattray: knife node show node FOO -r
[2013-06-13 14:50:05 -0400] mattray: and you probably have recipe[roles]
[2013-06-13 14:51:11 -0400] mmccarthy: when I started the node the runlist was -r "role[alfresco]"
[2013-06-13 14:51:22 -0400] mmccarthy: still working on the show node
[2013-06-13 14:52:43 -0400] mmccarthy: the runlist is empty when I do knife node show
[2013-06-13 14:59:46 -0400] mattray: mmccarthy: empty run list? then it should converge with no issues
[2013-06-13 15:00:36 -0400] mmccarthy: mattray: Well that is what knife node show node says. my runlist contains "role[alfresco]" which of course has a run list in it.
[2013-06-13 15:01:00 -0400] mmccarthy: mattray: But my runlist definitely does not include "recipe[roles]"
[2013-06-13 15:01:51 -0400] mmccarthy: Can a role file include commented lines? i.e # comment here
[2013-06-13 15:02:35 -0400] mattray: mmccarthy: maybe there's a typo in the run list inside the alfresco role?
[2013-06-13 15:03:00 -0400] mmccarthy: mattray: Will I get that error if a recipe does not exist?
[2013-06-13 15:03:07 -0400] mattray: yes
[2013-06-13 15:03:34 -0400] mmccarthy: That's probably it then. I will keep looking for the typo. Thanks.
[2013-06-13 15:11:06 -0400] mmccarthy: mattray: Will it give that error if there is another typo? I made the runlist in the role only "recipe[apt]" and still got the same error.
[2013-06-13 15:11:22 -0400] mattray: and you uploaded it to the server?
[2013-06-13 15:11:39 -0400] mmccarthy: yes
[2013-06-13 15:12:17 -0400] mmccarthy: verified using the web interface (using hosted chef)
[2013-06-13 15:16:58 -0400] mmccarthy: mattray: Okay, looks like there may be an error somewhere else in the file. Got rid of the default_attributes and overrride_attributes and it worked with just "recipe[apt]".
[2013-06-13 15:17:15 -0400] mattray: great
[2013-06-13 15:18:54 -0400] mmccarthy: mattray: Actually, I misspoke. Same error.
[2013-06-13 15:26:08 -0400] mmccarthy: I started over with a brand new role (http://pastebin.com/hcdQmdvJ) with nothing but "apt" in the recipe list. It still fails. Something else must be going wrong...
[2013-06-13 15:30:16 -0400] mmccarthy: What!? I rename the same file to apt.rb from alfresco_pre.rb, upload it to the server, and it runs to completion. Can anyone explain?
[2013-06-13 15:31:17 -0400] mmccarthy: Oh, I also changed the name in the role file from alfresco_pre to apt.
[2013-06-13 15:32:40 -0400] mattray: the name of the file doesn't matter, the name inside matters
[2013-06-13 15:32:51 -0400] rep0st: @mattray: lol beat me to it
[2013-06-13 15:45:03 -0400] mmccarthy: Yeah, so that doesn't explain why the same text worked as one role name but not another.
[2013-06-13 15:46:26 -0400] mmccarthy: The error message is completely useless.
[2013-06-13 15:53:32 -0400] mmccarthy: So, creating the same role from within the web client also fails. Does that mean there is a problem in one of the cookbooks?

I've created a dev environment and have all my environment attributes for both my dev web server and proxy.
