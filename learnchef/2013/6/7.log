[2013-06-07 00:00:19 -0400] dantmcgowan: gr8...thx @sascha_d i have some things to try now!
[2013-06-07 00:00:25 -0400] sascha_d: good luck!
[2013-06-07 17:17:22 -0400] z3cka: okay, so I've bootstrapped a node with knife... I'm ready to use another cookbook on the same node, do I use "knife bootstrap ... --runt-list "recipe[foo]" --sudo" again?
[2013-06-07 17:18:10 -0400] behemphi: @z3cka You can say `knife node edit`
[2013-06-07 17:18:23 -0400] behemphi: and add the cookbook to your run_list there
[2013-06-07 17:18:37 -0400] z3cka: cool
[2013-06-07 17:18:59 -0400] behemphi: as you get farther you might consider using a role as a way to alias a common run_list
[2013-06-07 17:19:00 -0400] z3cka: i was running bootstrap over and over, and that just didn't feel right
[2013-06-07 17:19:29 -0400] behemphi: then your run-list can be "role[web-server]" or something like that
[2013-06-07 17:19:41 -0400] behemphi: for your bootstrap of a new node I mean
[2013-06-07 17:19:41 -0400] z3cka: okay, ya... I have some reading to do about roles
[2013-06-07 17:19:50 -0400] z3cka: cool
[2013-06-07 17:20:08 -0400] z3cka: thanks, will try knife node edit
[2013-06-07 17:20:12 -0400] z3cka: cheers
[2013-06-07 17:20:24 -0400] behemphi: that comes with the caveat that alot of the big thinkers are saying favor defining these things in a custom cookbook rather than using roles at all
[2013-06-07 17:20:26 -0400] behemphi: sure
[2013-06-07 17:20:27 -0400] behemphi: cheers
[2013-06-07 17:20:55 -0400] z3cka: interesting
[2013-06-07 17:21:09 -0400] z3cka: i hope to understand that thought soon :-)
[2013-06-07 17:24:48 -0400] tBunnyMan: I'm no pro either but AFAICT the jist of it is to have a web-server, db-server, ect cookbook for all your types and to include all the other required cookbooks and such in the *-server cookbook
[2013-06-07 17:30:38 -0400] z3cka: behemphi: I've saved my run_list on my node, what do I do next?
[2013-06-07 17:32:50 -0400] behemphi: if you log in to the node you can :
[2013-06-07 17:32:58 -0400] behemphi: `sudo chef-client`
[2013-06-07 17:33:08 -0400] behemphi: any change you make to the node requires chef-client to run
[2013-06-07 17:33:24 -0400] behemphi: if you have it running on an interval you can wait for that time period to pass as well
[2013-06-07 17:33:39 -0400] behemphi: If you have serveral machines you can do this from your workstation
[2013-06-07 17:33:55 -0400] behemphi: knife ssh "name:*" 'sudo chef-client'
[2013-06-07 17:34:07 -0400] behemphi: that will run the chef-client on all your nodes
[2013-06-07 17:34:27 -0400] z3cka: nice
[2013-06-07 17:34:47 -0400] behemphi: note that knife ssh will run anything you can do at the shell on your nodes
[2013-06-07 17:34:52 -0400] behemphi: e.g.
[2013-06-07 17:35:13 -0400] behemphi: knife ssh "chef_environment:prod AND role:web_host" 'uptime'
[2013-06-07 17:35:22 -0400] z3cka: i think it worked... but the new cookbook I tried using was missing a dependency, i think...
[2013-06-07 17:35:25 -0400] z3cka: neat
[2013-06-07 17:35:27 -0400] behemphi: the first bit is a solr seach string
[2013-06-07 17:35:34 -0400] behemphi: the second is the command
