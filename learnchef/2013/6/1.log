[2013-06-01 20:21:28 -0400] zytta: I'm trying to run "npm install" (from NodeJS) as an execute resource.
[2013-06-01 20:21:53 -0400] zytta: I need it to run as a specific user, and so far I see this is not possible without hackish solutions
[2013-06-01 20:22:14 -0400] zytta: Does anyone have a nice snippet I can use? :)
