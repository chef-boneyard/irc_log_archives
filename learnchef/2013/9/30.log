[2013-09-30 06:07:05 -0400] Ron__: Hello.  I see other mentions of "/opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mixlib-log-1.4.1/lib/mixlib/log.rb:97:in `level='" when bootstrapping.  I do not see a clear answer, anyone have some advice?
[2013-09-30 06:10:39 -0400] Ron__: chef-client -v Chef: 10.18.2
[2013-09-30 06:11:05 -0400] Ron__: gem list | grep chef chef (11.6.0)

[2013-09-30 19:25:55 -0400] Guest15176: I have written this chef recipe  below,   This is what i expect/require  * The bash resource shall fail is the shell script i am running below fails,  * the cookbook file should not say up to date if the bash script below fail  Please advise  cookbook_file "#{node[:mule][:deploy_dir]}/x-billing-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip" do   source "x-billing-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip"   mode 777   notifies :run, "bash[install_bill]", :immediately end  # Ru
[2013-09-30 19:26:20 -0400] Guest15176: bash "install_bill" do      cwd "#{node[:mule][:bin_dir]}"      code <<-EOH        ./deploy.sh -v x-billing-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT -e $env ebpi x-billing        sleep 30         echo " i am done deploying the app"      EOH      returns 0       action :nothing  end
[2013-09-30 19:27:56 -0400] mmzyk: can you gist that or paste bin it or something so that is easy to read Guest15176?
[2013-09-30 19:30:13 -0400] Guest15176: sure
[2013-09-30 19:31:02 -0400] Guest15176: https://gist.github.com/mthak/6768875
[2013-09-30 19:46:59 -0400] mmzyk: All right, I'm no expert, but given what you have and what you want to do Guest15176, you'll want to look at the subscribe syntax for notifications to get the bash block to report back to the cookbook file block: http://docs.opscode.com/chef/resources.html#subscribes-syntax
[2013-09-30 19:48:23 -0400] mmzyk: You'll want to pair this w/ the returns option for the bash block, so if the bash block returns something other than 0 it fails.

[2013-09-30 19:48:53 -0400] mmzyk: I think that will get you what you want, although another option might be to look at taking the bash block and moving it all into chef to give you finer control.
[2013-09-30 19:49:08 -0400] mmzyk: And hopefully he/she comes back so they can see everything I just wrote.
