[2013-09-25 15:39:37 -0400] kmaqsudi: Does anyone know of any cookbooks for icinga?
[2013-09-25 18:28:46 -0400] objectiveous: How does one discover what cookbooks (and versions thereof) are installed on a node? 
[2013-09-25 19:58:30 -0400] mmzyk: Well, objectiveous has left and I just now saw their question. I'll answer it anyway.
[2013-09-25 19:58:39 -0400] mmzyk: What you're looking for is the node's run list.
[2013-09-25 19:58:50 -0400] mmzyk: cookbooks themselves are stored on the chef server.
[2013-09-25 19:59:09 -0400] mmzyk: knife node show NODE_NAME --run_list will give you what you want, I believe.
[2013-09-25 19:59:31 -0400] mmzyk: Docs are here: http://docs.opscode.com/chef/knife.html#id345
[2013-09-25 20:01:55 -0400] mmzyk: And for kmaqsuid's question from way earlier in the day, the community site has this cookbook for icinga: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/icinga 
[2013-09-25 20:02:00 -0400] mmzyk: I have no clue of it's quality.
[2013-09-25 20:03:23 -0400] mmzyk: Any one else have a chef question I can maybe help with? I'll do my best while I'm currently here.
