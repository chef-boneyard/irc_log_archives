[2013-09-06 20:19:34 -0400] c-pi: Hello, I'm looking for docs or a how-to on configuring VMs using chef server and cookbooks.  I have read through a good number of docs.opscode.com links.  I have successfully build chef server, a workstation, configured knife, and have boot strapped a node but am failing to understand how to implment recipies I have created
[2013-09-06 20:20:11 -0400] bean__: c-pi: upload them to the chef server and add them to your run list?
[2013-09-06 20:21:06 -0400] c-pi: I'm getting errors when attempting to upload a very simple cookbook from my workstation to my server
[2013-09-06 20:21:29 -0400] c-pi: "Exception: NameError: uninitialized constant Chef::CookbookUploader::Queue"
[2013-09-06 20:21:46 -0400] c-pi: googling has not returned much for me
[2013-09-06 20:22:31 -0400] c-pi: basically I attribute this hiccup in my just not knowing the underlying functionality of chef's components
[2013-09-06 20:27:36 -0400] c-pi: I'm look for a better understanding on how chef and git work together, how to create default recipies which can be applied to all servers based on OS or hostname, or provision VMs and have them look to my chef server without having to use knife to push the client
[2013-09-06 20:28:20 -0400] bean__: c-pi: what version of ruby are you running
[2013-09-06 20:28:26 -0400] bean__: and what version of the chef gem do you have locally
[2013-09-06 20:29:22 -0400] c-pi: forgive me, I'm am an Ops based engineer so Ruby is not my strong point.  are you looking for the versions on my workstation?
[2013-09-06 20:29:31 -0400] bean__: yes
[2013-09-06 20:29:45 -0400] c-pi: ruby 1.8.7 (2011-06-30 patchlevel 352) [x86_64-linux]
[2013-09-06 20:29:52 -0400] c-pi: from my workstation
[2013-09-06 20:29:54 -0400] bean__: ah, yeah, you might want to get ruby 1.9
[2013-09-06 20:30:02 -0400] bean__: idk if they support 1.8 any more
[2013-09-06 20:30:18 -0400] c-pi: gem -> 1.8.10
[2013-09-06 20:30:55 -0400] c-pi: installed ruby from code as instructed by the opscode workstation build training doc
[2013-09-06 20:31:02 -0400] bean__: hmm okay.
[2013-09-06 20:31:20 -0400] c-pi: can I uninstall ruby and install the newer version?
[2013-09-06 20:31:28 -0400] c-pi: or does it require a rebuild?
[2013-09-06 20:31:34 -0400] bean__: sure could. What version of the chef gem do you have though.
[2013-09-06 20:31:53 -0400] c-pi: how would I find that?
[2013-09-06 20:32:18 -0400] bean__: danny@Daniels-MacBook-Air ~/src/banno-openldap master  gem list | grep "chef "
