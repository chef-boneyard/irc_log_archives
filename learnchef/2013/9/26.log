'apt-get install zlib1g-dev' did not help. Any clue about fixing this? Thanks!

[2013-09-26 14:20:18 -0400] holojorge: hi, do you know how to upgrade a packaged chef-server 11.0.4 to latest version ?? Is there any step-by-step guide? Thanks in advance
[2013-09-26 17:53:02 -0400] mmzyk: holojorge - should just be able to put the new packages in place, since data format is the same. http://adigitalnotepad.com/post/upgrade-chef-server-11-0-4-to-11-0-6
[2013-09-26 17:53:08 -0400] mmzyk: something like that, I would think.

[2013-09-26 22:52:57 -0400] wramthun: And I'm trying to bootstrap a client with a new recipe.
[2013-09-26 22:55:56 -0400] wramthun: I ran the following bootstrap from the workstation and it appeared to work, but the client doesn't show up in my list....
[2013-09-26 22:56:24 -0400] wramthun: "knife bootstrap <client FQDN> -x myusername -P mypassword --sudo --run-list "recipe[foobar]"
