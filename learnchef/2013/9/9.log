[2013-09-09 12:23:48 -0400] sefakoc: When I enter server ip on browser, webui doesn't open
[2013-09-09 12:24:08 -0400] sefakoc: Eventhough I have configured and tested the server successfully
[2013-09-09 12:24:16 -0400] sefakoc: What could be the problem??
[2013-09-09 12:24:27 -0400] sefakoc: Any help is appreciated
[2013-09-09 13:50:50 -0400] fishGoM00: sefakoc: first check firewalls and connectivity etc
[2013-09-09 16:33:59 -0400] vt102: I have chef install and running chef-client manually is working great.  How is chef-client run in the real world, though?  Is it intended to be a manual process?  Should I be setting it to run out of cron or some such?
[2013-09-09 16:35:29 -0400] fishGoM00: you can cron it but it's easier to add it to the run list for the node 
[2013-09-09 16:36:21 -0400] fishGoM00: most people will bootstrap a node and add the client straight into the runlist like this 
[2013-09-09 16:36:22 -0400] fishGoM00: knife bootstrap IP_ADDRESS -r 'recipe[chef-client]' -x USER -P PASSWORD --sudo
[2013-09-09 16:36:37 -0400] fishGoM00: but you can also login and run it manually from cli
[2013-09-09 16:36:50 -0400] fishGoM00: ..../usr/bin/chef-client
[2013-09-09 16:36:53 -0400] fishGoM00: hth
[2013-09-09 16:38:11 -0400] vt102: Sorry if I sound dense, I'm pretty new to this-- aren't the recipes run by chef-client?  So, if I tell chef-client to run chef-client, I still don't see where chef-client is getting called...

[2013-09-09 18:54:20 -0400] jleveque: I am having trouble with variables scope within erb files

[2013-09-09 18:56:21 -0400] jleveque: On line 4 it cannot get the value of platform wich was defined lkocally
[2013-09-09 18:56:29 -0400] jleveque: with error message can't convert nil into String
[2013-09-09 18:57:59 -0400] jleveque: Can you tell me a way to solve that problem ?
[2013-09-09 20:55:50 -0400] mburns: You can have special Files based on node[:platform], but can you do the same with node[:platform_family]? I don't want to duplicate all the work on Centos to support RHEL.
