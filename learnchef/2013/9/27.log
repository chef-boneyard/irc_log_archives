[2013-09-27 01:03:00 -0400] mmzyk: wramthun You said it appeared to work? Can you offer any more info than that?
[2013-09-27 01:03:15 -0400] mmzyk: Perhaps the bootstrap docks might highlight something you missed? http://docs.opscode.com/knife_bootstrap.html
[2013-09-27 01:04:03 -0400] mmzyk: without knowing a bit more it's hard to fully troubleshoot, such as if you're following the learn chef guide or trying to bootstrap a client outside of that.
[2013-09-27 08:50:21 -0400] holojorge: mmzyk: Thanks! I have checked that upgrade from 11.0.4 to 11.0.6 does work, but unfortunately, upgrading to 11.0.8 brokes connection with database, and not sure about the rigth procedure
[2013-09-27 12:06:50 -0400] asd: Hi guys, I'm stuck. any ideas: knife bootstrap windows winrm 192.168.52.136 -x Administrator -P 'p@ssw0rd' Bootstrapping Chef on windows ERROR: Network Error: getaddrinfo: No such host is known. Check your knife configuration and network settings ?
[2013-09-27 12:07:01 -0400] asd: I can ping the node fine
[2013-09-27 17:09:27 -0400] isafarnik: s/circkets/crickets
[2013-09-27 17:27:17 -0400] jasond: did knife loose its "solo" subcommand?
[2013-09-27 17:27:57 -0400] isafarnik: knife-solo is a plugin these days
[2013-09-27 17:28:19 -0400] isafarnik: http://matschaffer.github.io/knife-solo/
[2013-09-27 17:28:42 -0400] isafarnik: Install it via "(sudo) gem install knife-solo"
[2013-09-27 17:29:11 -0400] jasond: ah ok, but will does it matter that it won't get installed in /opt/chef?
[2013-09-27 17:29:57 -0400] isafarnik: You want to be using the "gem" command from that ruby
[2013-09-27 17:30:16 -0400] jasond: i see.  thank you!
[2013-09-27 19:36:07 -0400] bobbywil_: hey there, anyone around?
[2013-09-27 19:36:29 -0400] isafarnik: I am here!
[2013-09-27 19:37:09 -0400] isafarnik: What's going on?
[2013-09-27 19:37:28 -0400] bobbywil_: isafarnik: hi! I have a kind of a silly question. I am trying to figure out why node[:nginx] is nil during recipe compilation
[2013-09-27 19:38:29 -0400] isafarnik: Do you know where it should be being set?
[2013-09-27 19:38:59 -0400] bobbywil_: isafarnik: no, that's part of my not understanding
[2013-09-27 19:58:43 -0400] mattray: bobbywil_: are you expecting it from a cookbook?
[2013-09-27 19:59:13 -0400] bobbywil_: mattray: yeah, in the nginx cookbook itself
[2013-09-27 20:00:00 -0400] mattray: if the nginx cookbook has an attributes file with [:nginx] attributes, that should be on the node if nginx is in the run list
[2013-09-27 20:00:05 -0400] mattray: Chef 11 right?
[2013-09-27 20:00:50 -0400] bobbywil_: mattray, isafarnik: also it is important to note, that this only failed when I was using a recipe that was including nginx as a dependency, this doesn't happen when I swap out the unicorn recipe with nginx 
[2013-09-27 20:00:56 -0400] bobbywil_: mattray: yeah chef 11
[2013-09-27 20:03:33 -0400] mattray: so you have a node with a run list of something like "recipe[nginx]"?
[2013-09-27 20:03:46 -0400] mattray: and when it's running, it hits a node[:nginx] and blows up?
[2013-09-27 20:04:17 -0400] bobbywil_: actually, it is include_recipe nginx, and then inside of the nginx recipe node[:nginx] is nil
[2013-09-27 20:43:58 -0400] kallistec: bobbywil_: using chef-solo, I'm guessing? If so, you're probably missing a `depends` statement in your metadata
[2013-09-27 20:45:01 -0400] kallistec: brief description: http://docs.opscode.com/breaking_changes_chef_11.html#non-recipe-file-evaluation-includes-dependencies
[2013-09-27 20:47:32 -0400] bobbywil_: kallistec: thanks, also remember me from derailed in denver haha
[2013-09-27 20:49:19 -0400] kallistec: bobbywil_: yeah man, and we hung out a bit at rubyconf that one year
[2013-09-27 20:49:28 -0400] bobbywil_: kallistec: oh yeah! dude 2009
[2013-09-27 20:50:27 -0400] bobbywil_: kallistec: I am getting back into chef with this new consulting thing I am doing, and as you can tell I am major newb tier again since quite a bit has changed
[2013-09-27 20:51:07 -0400] kallistec: bobbywil_: yeah, it happens :) Plus it's easy to forget a lot of stuff if you're not using it constantly
[2013-09-27 20:54:34 -0400] bobbywilson0: kallistec, mattray, isafarnik: that was it I needed the depends in the metadata.rb thanks for the help
[2013-09-27 20:55:17 -0400] kallistec: bobbywilson0: np, I want to add a better error message for this particular case, but "time for dat" and all
[2013-09-27 20:56:03 -0400] bobbywilson0: kallistec: haha, yeah no worries, this is I assume a pretty old recipe, didn't even have a metadata.rb :-/
[2013-09-27 22:22:23 -0400] mburns: Will file action :delete fail badly if the file doesn't exist?
[2013-09-27 22:26:10 -0400] mattray: mburns: nope
[2013-09-27 22:26:17 -0400] mattray: it's quite happy, its work is done
[2013-09-27 22:28:02 -0400] mburns: mattray: thank you for the sanity check :)
