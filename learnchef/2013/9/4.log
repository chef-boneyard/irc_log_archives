[2013-09-04 03:51:06 -0400] arussel: I'm following https://learnchef.opscode.com/starter-use-cases/multi-node-ec2/ and got: Error executing action `install` on resource 'package[build-essential]' when bootstraping the redis node.
[2013-09-04 07:21:06 -0400] Wouter___: hi Everyone
[2013-09-04 07:21:49 -0400] Wouter___: having a problem with converging my first node
[2013-09-04 07:22:23 -0400] Wouter___: the alias recipe is not installing
[2013-09-04 07:22:55 -0400] Wouter___: Cannot find a resource for magic_shell_alias on ubuntu version 12.04
[2013-09-04 18:31:45 -0400] clakeb: Does the Advanced OS X workstation setup require sudo?
[2013-09-04 18:47:27 -0400] sparr: how can I download an entire data bag, so that I could edit it and then re-upload it using `knife data bag from file` ?
[2013-09-04 19:18:07 -0400] arussel: how can I update a vagrant node ? I've tried to ssh into it, but chef-client isn't install
[2013-09-04 19:32:01 -0400] clakeb: @arussel I'm no expert but in your vagrantfile you can have chef provision the vagrant box
[2013-09-04 19:32:11 -0400] clakeb: are you using Berkshelf?
[2013-09-04 19:36:58 -0400] arussel: I'm following learnchef and use knife bootstrap localhost to run chef on it.
[2013-09-04 19:37:18 -0400] arussel: I can provision, I want to know how to update
[2013-09-04 19:38:01 -0400] arussel: it says "From the node, you can run sudo chef-client to force a Chef run", well, I can't
[2013-09-04 19:38:18 -0400] arussel: is it because this is a vagrant node ?
[2013-09-04 19:38:36 -0400] clakeb: Then, in my limited knowledge chef wasn't bootstrapped.
[2013-09-04 19:39:31 -0400] clakeb: Make sure you are bootstrapping the correct IP address or host
[2013-09-04 19:39:44 -0400] clakeb: it may not be localhost for your setup
[2013-09-04 19:39:54 -0400] arussel: it is bootstraped, I can see output and it is localhost
[2013-09-04 19:40:19 -0400] clakeb: Hmm.
[2013-09-04 19:44:28 -0400] clakeb: did you download the "Starter Kit"
[2013-09-04 19:45:14 -0400] arussel: clakeb: my question is how to update the node, not how to bootstrap the node, I have done this already.
[2013-09-04 19:45:43 -0400] clakeb: I am not certain you did
[2013-09-04 19:46:20 -0400] clakeb: because if you are following the "Coverge the Node" tutorial you would have downloaded the starter kit with the VagrantFile
[2013-09-04 19:46:35 -0400] arussel: how do you explain that my recipes have been run ?
[2013-09-04 19:47:03 -0400] clakeb: I can't. like I said I'm not an expert. I'm just thinking through a likely scenario.
[2013-09-04 19:47:15 -0400] clakeb: Sorry I couldn't help.
[2013-09-04 19:47:22 -0400] arussel: nice try :-)
[2013-09-04 19:48:42 -0400] clakeb: Answer this question though. Do you have a VagrantFile in your chef-repo?
[2013-09-04 19:49:11 -0400] arussel: yes
[2013-09-04 19:49:40 -0400] clakeb: Check that and maybe it will give you some answers
[2013-09-04 19:50:27 -0400] arussel: clakeb: answer on how to update the node ?
[2013-09-04 19:50:47 -0400] clakeb: What do you mean by "update"?
[2013-09-04 19:51:00 -0400] arussel: rerun a cookbook
[2013-09-04 19:55:15 -0400] clakeb: arussel: looking in to what this might be.
[2013-09-04 19:59:57 -0400] clakeb: Ok so here is what I was thinking.
[2013-09-04 20:01:15 -0400] clakeb: the VagrantFile in the starter kit sets the host to (USERNAMR)-starter so localhost may not be your Vagrant hostname
[2013-09-04 20:09:51 -0400] clakeb: arussel: did you get my solution
[2013-09-04 20:09:58 -0400] clakeb: or rather my suggestion
