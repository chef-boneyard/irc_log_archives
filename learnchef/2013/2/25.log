[2013-02-25 23:19:36 -0500] ashmckenzie: hi, anyone around to answer a cron related question ?
[2013-02-25 23:22:36 -0500] sethvargo: ashmckenzie:  what's up?
[2013-02-25 23:53:21 -0500] ashmckenzie: hey @sethvargo : was wondering if you had any thoughts on creating crons via chef, but having them disabled ?
[2013-02-25 23:54:17 -0500] ashmckenzie: backstory, we want to get our DR setup all setup and ready-to-go, but we don't want the crons to actually run but be 'disabled'..  the only way I can see so far is to comment them out or just not deploy the jobs until we ned them
[2013-02-25 23:59:01 -0500] sethvargo: hey ashmckenzie sorry, i was afk
