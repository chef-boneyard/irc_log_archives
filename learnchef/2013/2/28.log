[2013-02-28 16:00:30 -0500] holojorge: hi everyone
[2013-02-28 16:02:05 -0500] holojorge: Do you know how to migrate from a chef server (10.12.0) to a new chef 11 server (different machines)?  I tried to do by using knife-server gem, but It didn't work
[2013-02-28 16:11:22 -0500] sethvargo: @holo
[2013-02-28 16:11:28 -0500] sethvargo: @holojorge did you use omnibus?
[2013-02-28 16:14:04 -0500] holojorge: Don't know, the server was installed by using the ubuntu package
[2013-02-28 16:14:11 -0500] holojorge: The client is managed by rbenv
[2013-02-28 16:17:57 -0500] holojorge: so the client was installed by a gem install
[2013-02-28 16:18:17 -0500] holojorge: Does it matters? Server is installed with omnibus or system packaging?
