[2013-11-07 12:30:24 -0500] loco-yokel: In a cookbooks files dir, how do determine what to name the dir for a specific OS version? Is there ohai output I can look at?
[2013-11-07 12:34:01 -0500] loco-yokel: Wait, so maybe this is not controlled by the chef infrastructure, you for the relative path in your recipes?
[2013-11-07 12:51:39 -0500] loco-yokel: you form
[2013-11-07 14:42:08 -0500] fveillette: does someone can help me with registry_key ressource
[2013-11-07 14:42:14 -0500] fveillette: when i set action to create_if_missing, if the key exist but one of it's value is not correct... the chef run don't change it
[2013-11-07 14:54:26 -0500] loco-yokel: same problem with hosts_entry
[2013-11-07 14:55:18 -0500] loco-yokel: There are a lot of edges on the "idempotence" claim of Chef
[2013-11-07 15:00:07 -0500] kristianpaul: Hi

[2013-11-07 15:04:36 -0500] kristianpaul: cookbok?
[2013-11-07 15:10:17 -0500] grepory: Isn't there an easy way to tell if a machine is virtual or physical?
[2013-11-07 15:10:22 -0500] grepory: In a recipe, I mean.

[2013-11-07 16:26:32 -0500] droy: hi all, is anyone using knife solo (http://matschaffer.github.io/knife-solo/) ?  I can't figure out how to get it to run a single cookbook recipe instead of all recipes i have defined in the node json...
[2013-11-07 16:27:04 -0500] droy: the docs say to use -r <node/recipe> but that seems to be ignore
[2013-11-07 16:27:05 -0500] droy: d

[2013-11-07 16:38:40 -0500] droy: holms: thanks
[2013-11-07 16:39:58 -0500] holms: if i were i'd just stick to this. trying to get into chef-server.. i'm actually suffering whole weeks already

[2013-11-07 20:23:03 -0500] dogboy: I have a chef question. I'm trying to get Java 7 to install instead of Java 6 using a wrapper recipe and I can't get it to work.
[2013-11-07 20:24:35 -0500] dogboy: I used "node.override[:java][:jdk_version] = '7'" with the java community cookbook and it won't take the setting.
[2013-11-07 20:28:39 -0500] holms: dogboy: you probably need to learn what is roles.?
[2013-11-07 20:28:47 -0500] holms: cause i had the same question a week ago
[2013-11-07 20:29:20 -0500] holms: this is attribute. and attributes can be overriden in node an in role. preferebly in role.
[2013-11-07 20:29:25 -0500] holms: take a look at intro http://learnchef.getharvest.com/introduction.html
[2013-11-07 20:29:30 -0500] holms: you won't regret
[2013-11-07 20:31:46 -0500] dogboy: I've done it successfully with a role. I was hoping to do it with a wrapper recipe.
[2013-11-07 20:32:01 -0500] holms: oh so you know more then me then :)
[2013-11-07 20:32:14 -0500] dogboy: I wouldn't go that far! :)
[2013-11-07 20:32:18 -0500] holms: if i were you
[2013-11-07 20:32:30 -0500] holms: i'd take a look at cookbook called logstash
[2013-11-07 20:32:36 -0500] holms: they installing java 7 inthere
[2013-11-07 20:32:52 -0500] holms: you could grab a line from there
[2013-11-07 20:38:55 -0500] dogboy: I'm thinking that using the java community cookbook may be more than I need. I may just do my own small cookbook that just installs the correct java packages and be done with it.
[2013-11-07 20:39:17 -0500] dogboy: And if I want to use a wrapper cookcook, maybe this is the only way to do it.
[2013-11-07 20:39:44 -0500] holms: nah.. usually everbody goes with depedencies
[2013-11-07 20:39:53 -0500] holms: you still don't store them in repo
[2013-11-07 20:40:15 -0500] holms: but yeah for quick manifest.. manually it's better :)
[2013-11-07 20:45:16 -0500] dogboy: Another aspect of chef to learn!
[2013-11-07 20:46:32 -0500] jidar: is there no way to get knife-solo not to ssh into the local server?
[2013-11-07 20:51:00 -0500] holms: jidar: actually i had a problem
[2013-11-07 20:51:02 -0500] holms: with localhost

[2013-11-07 20:51:24 -0500] holms: if you'd add a key to authorized_keys
[2013-11-07 20:51:32 -0500] jidar: that's what I'm doing now :/
[2013-11-07 20:51:32 -0500] holms: knife solo bootstrap 127.0.0.1 should work
[2013-11-07 20:51:46 -0500] holms: i've just ended up in in password request loop before
[2013-11-07 20:51:50 -0500] holms: ))
[2013-11-07 20:52:54 -0500] holms: or wait is it: knife solo prepare 127.0.0.1
