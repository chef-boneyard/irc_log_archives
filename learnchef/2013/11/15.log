[2013-11-15 09:01:12 -0500] forehand: hi
[2013-11-15 09:06:14 -0500] forehand: Best time to ask questions?
[2013-11-15 09:10:22 -0500] taibhse: robwatkin: yeah, just ask and if people can help they will.
[2013-11-15 09:32:24 -0500] robwatkin: I currently have a free opscode account, local chef-repo and Githab chef-repo. Ultimately I want to be able to dynamically create entire (dev, test etc) environments and I'm following some rackspce blog posts on this. However I'm confused about the purpuse of my local chef-repo. When I run "knife role create startmeup" I see the role being created on Opscode server but find nothing in my local 'chef-repo/roles' director
[2013-11-15 09:32:25 -0500] robwatkin: y. Since it's not there, how can I commit these changes to Git?
[2013-11-15 10:00:27 -0500] forehand: looking
[2013-11-15 10:00:54 -0500] forehand: Where did you execute that?
[2013-11-15 10:01:59 -0500] forehand: I don't think roles can be persisted to a repo.  Have you heard of berkshelf?
[2013-11-15 10:09:30 -0500] forehand: I reference it because of your interest in persistence.  Google on.
[2013-11-15 10:29:23 -0500] robwatkin: Yes I did see berkshelf (in passing). Ok so it's not a consistent philosophy. Recipies are saved in the repo but not roles?
[2013-11-15 15:04:55 -0500] bean__: b0c1: did you ever get your problems worked out?
[2013-11-15 22:41:38 -0500] ras__: Hi! I'm trying to knife bootstrap into amazon ec2, but nothing is happening 
[2013-11-15 22:42:29 -0500] ras__: I'm following along a chef tutorial provided by opscode and it suggests inputing the following for their public ami: Knife bootstrap opscode@ec2-54-224-62-26.compute-1.amazonaws.com --sudo -x opscode -P opscode -N "target1"
[2013-11-15 22:42:58 -0500] ras__: there is no error message either it just says bootstrapping and then nothing happens
[2013-11-15 22:43:01 -0500] ras__: any ideas?
