[2013-11-11 04:17:01 -0500] ashmckenzie: Hi, what's the best way to target a specific instance when using Chef.  Example - I want to install PostgreSQL onto two instances and have one operate as the master and the other as the standby.  Hostnames are dbserver1 and dbserver2
[2013-11-11 04:17:15 -0500] ashmckenzie: I have a fair idea how to do it, just looking for best practice :)
[2013-11-11 07:00:34 -0500] Drewch: Can anyone help me with this error when trying to berks upload: Faraday::Error::ConnectionFailed: getaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
[2013-11-11 17:56:22 -0500] ianneub: howdy all. is it possible to check if a LWRP resource exists from a recipe that does not include it directly?
[2013-11-11 18:06:32 -0500] isafarnik: ianneub: That's probably a question #chef can answer better for you. But you'll want to include_recipe that cookbook
[2013-11-11 18:06:52 -0500] ianneub: thanks isafarnik
[2013-11-11 18:07:36 -0500] isafarnik: Ala: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/webpi/blob/17e096264bb6bcaf3c94b93bd54b7b71dfa19193/recipes/install-zip.rb#L21 where "windows" is an LWRP cookbook and is include_recipe--ed so that "windows_zipfile" can be used later in that recipe
[2013-11-11 18:15:46 -0500] isafarnik: ianneub: ^

[2013-11-11 20:17:09 -0500] isafarnik: holms: knife is picky, put -VV at the far end of the command
[2013-11-11 20:17:35 -0500] isafarnik: It's trying to interpret -VV as a subcommand
[2013-11-11 20:23:19 -0500] CPS: holms: what versions are you on?
[2013-11-11 20:23:43 -0500] CPS: oh nm that's probably a better suggestion

[2013-11-11 20:32:51 -0500] isafarnik: In your knife.rb
[2013-11-11 22:22:17 -0500] gmichels: Hi all. Quick question, is there a way to use the cookbook version number (as in metadata.rb) as a variable within a recipe? Or as a default value in attributes/default.rb
