[2013-11-26 02:35:38 -0500] nerolynx_: hi there, I have a bit of problem using knife to bootstrap a Azure virtual machine
[2013-11-26 02:36:27 -0500] nerolynx_: following the doc, I run knife bootstrap <vps_ip> -x <name> -P <password> -r "recipe[nginx]" --sudo
[2013-11-26 02:37:05 -0500] nerolynx_: the prompt returns Bootstraping Chef on <vps_iP>... and then fall silently
[2013-11-26 02:37:35 -0500] nerolynx_: does anyone know what should I do to bootstrap the node properly?
[2013-11-26 02:42:53 -0500] mmzyk: nerolynx_ Might want to ask in #chef where more people are around. That said, I don't know if Azure requires you to have any special ports open or not. 
[2013-11-26 02:43:15 -0500] nerolynx_: Thanks mmzyk
[2013-11-26 02:43:23 -0500] mmzyk: There might be a security issue there like in ec2 where in your security group you need to ensure the port is open so winrm can reach the box.
[2013-11-26 02:43:32 -0500] nerolynx_: I'll check outgoing port in Azure first
[2013-11-26 02:43:33 -0500] mmzyk: I'm not sure if that is the case, but I know that is something that is needed in ec2.
[2013-11-26 02:43:59 -0500] nerolynx_: yup, incoming port is set, but I'll check outgoing policy in Azure
[2013-11-26 02:44:11 -0500] nerolynx_: however, should it give a failure warning though
[2013-11-26 02:44:37 -0500] nerolynx_: all mine said Bootstrap Chef on <ip>... then fail silently?
[2013-11-26 02:45:23 -0500] mmzyk: Yeah, I'm not sure what is happening that would make it fail silently. Ideally it would give you more info. You could try running the command with -v for verbose mode (I think -vvv might make it even more verbose).
[2013-11-26 02:45:55 -0500] nerolynx_: thanks, check the Virtual Box outgoing policy, everything is accepted
[2013-11-26 02:46:20 -0500] nerolynx_: I'll run the verbose mode
[2013-11-26 02:47:46 -0500] nerolynx_: the triple -VVV flag works, it flags the problem properly now, turn out ssh authentication failed for some reason
[2013-11-26 02:48:40 -0500] nerolynx_: yup it works now thanks a lot mmzyk
[2013-11-26 02:49:04 -0500] mmzyk: awesome. glad that helped nerolynx_

[2013-11-26 06:56:45 -0500] linuxbaby: i am stuck with this for past 2 days..
[2013-11-26 06:57:54 -0500] linuxbaby: btw: isued the command 
[2013-11-26 06:57:55 -0500] linuxbaby: gem install chef -v 11.8.2.rc.0
[2013-11-26 06:58:03 -0500] linuxbaby: the latest gem .. of chef
[2013-11-26 06:58:46 -0500] jbz: Do you *need* to use gems etc?
[2013-11-26 06:58:52 -0500] jbz: b/c I'd recommend installing the server using this:
[2013-11-26 06:58:53 -0500] jbz: http://docs.opscode.com/install_server.html
[2013-11-26 06:59:06 -0500] jbz: The method you'd using is a bit outdated
[2013-11-26 06:59:13 -0500] jbz: *you're
[2013-11-26 07:01:47 -0500] linuxbaby: jbz, i tried this method of using the installer also .. and i have another VM running with that ..
[2013-11-26 07:02:03 -0500] linuxbaby: but with that method .. i dod not see any ruby packages installed in my server ..
[2013-11-26 07:02:36 -0500] jbz: the chef omnibus installer doesn't install ruby via package, it should install its own ruby in a sandbox separate from the system ruby.
[2013-11-26 07:02:36 -0500] linuxbaby: so i thought its not doing the perfect install with all required gems and cookbooks for chef server ..
[2013-11-26 07:03:11 -0500] jbz: You don't really want it using system ruby, that gets super complex.  That installer should provide all the ruby Chef Server needs, in a box where only it uses it.
[2013-11-26 07:03:29 -0500] linuxbaby: jbz, thanks for that info.. how can i check that .. if it has its own ruby in the same server ..
[2013-11-26 07:03:35 -0500] jbz: If it runs, it has ruby :-)
[2013-11-26 07:04:13 -0500] jbz: You can probably do it with chef-shell, but I'm not postiive how
[2013-11-26 07:04:19 -0500] linuxbaby: okies.. in the ps o/p i can see all required chef services running .. so i gues it has all ruby and gems required for chef server ..
[2013-11-26 07:04:24 -0500] jbz: Yes.
[2013-11-26 07:04:40 -0500] linuxbaby: jbz, thank you !!
[2013-11-26 07:04:43 -0500] jbz: It should install everything chef server needs.  I'd strongly recommend treating chef-server as a blackbox for now. :-)
[2013-11-26 07:04:47 -0500] jbz: If it works, don't worry about it.
[2013-11-26 07:05:00 -0500] linuxbaby: jbz, okies..
[2013-11-26 07:05:05 -0500] jbz: If you want to do the same thing on a client, you can use the omnibus installer to install a chef-client with its own ruby
[2013-11-26 07:05:18 -0500] jbz: that way, if something you run on the machine needs a different version of ruby, chef-client isn't affected.
[2013-11-26 07:05:39 -0500] linuxbaby: jbz, okies..
[2013-11-26 12:50:26 -0500] pedda: hi there
[2013-11-26 12:50:59 -0500] pedda: i need some help regarding php directives affecting the right php.ini file (not cli/php.ini but apache2/php.ini)
[2013-11-26 12:51:57 -0500] pedda: setting those works, but it results in a modified cli/php.ini .. how do i tell chef/Vagrant to affect the odther php.ini
[2013-11-26 15:57:27 -0500] CPS: i have a question about packaging recipes. I have a lot of recipes that do the same task with different files. I'd like to move the behavior to a single place and call a function and just feed it input. Is there a way to package functions into a file and make it available to recipes?
[2013-11-26 16:22:24 -0500] nirdo: Hi, when using a package directive in a recipe, how does chef-client know which package repository to use or if a repository needs to be added?
[2013-11-26 16:36:24 -0500] rsmitty: nirdo, I believe that the chef-client determines the package manager to use from the ohai data stored in node["platform"].
[2013-11-26 16:37:50 -0500] rsmitty: you can pass the provider you wish to use if the default doesn't work by using the provider attribute
[2013-11-26 16:37:51 -0500] rsmitty: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_package.html
[2013-11-26 18:09:47 -0500] cannonball: Hi all, I've built a fair amount of cookbooks with attributes, resources, and providers.  I feel like I'm starting to get a good handle on things.  However, one thing that is still unclear to me is ip address management.
[2013-11-26 18:10:54 -0500] cannonball: I'm trying to wrap my head around what would be the best way to have a template write all the config files (CentOS 5.x and 6.x) for networking.
[2013-11-26 18:11:41 -0500] cannonball: From what little I've been able to find, I will need to use a data bag, but I've not found a sample data bag definition.
[2013-11-26 18:12:32 -0500] cannonball: Are there any useful tutorials out there which might give me better insight and explanation (and example?) than the generic essentials_databags page on the opscode site?
[2013-11-26 18:19:58 -0500] mattray: cannonball: when you say IP address management, what do you mean? Like nodes needing to find each other?
[2013-11-26 18:24:24 -0500] cannonball: mattray: As an example:   a webserver with 1) an internal address RIP 2) one or more VIP's, depending on its function 3) possibly one more more other internal RIP's, depending upon what it does.
[2013-11-26 18:26:22 -0500] cannonball: We already have an internal DNS server that we (by hand) manage an internal zone, so I would be somewhat duplicating the information, but I'll be adding structure to it:  "For webserver xx, use RIP xx, VIP's xy-xz, and extra RIP yy"
[2013-11-26 18:27:06 -0500] cannonball: The goal is manually install a server via PXE boot, then knife bootstrap it, assign roles, and run chef-client on it.
[2013-11-26 18:27:48 -0500] cannonball: The portion of chef-client which I need to wrap my head around is "figure out what IP addresses shoudl be on this node and configure them all".
[2013-11-26 18:29:25 -0500] CPS: cannonball: i've done something similar writing configuration files containing hostnames
[2013-11-26 18:29:37 -0500] cannonball: I'm watching a Google+ Hangout named "Roles, Environments, Attributes, and Data Bags" right now to see if it gets touched on there.
[2013-11-26 18:29:43 -0500] CPS: i used a databag and broke it down by environment (dev, qa, prod)
[2013-11-26 18:29:52 -0500] CPS: this works because they're mostly static
[2013-11-26 18:31:04 -0500] cannonball: CPS: It sounds like exactly what I'm trying to do.  I'm just not creative enough to translate "put your IP's in a databag" to the files and content that defines that info :-)
[2013-11-26 18:32:42 -0500] cannonball: I haven't had to use data bags yet.  For example, we keep all of our ssl info in a git repo, so that's one "common recommended application" that I've not had to reproduce in Chef.
[2013-11-26 18:33:53 -0500] CPS: ah, they're basically just json objects stored on the server
[2013-11-26 18:34:06 -0500] CPS: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html shows how to manipulate them inside a recipe toward the bottom
[2013-11-26 18:36:44 -0500] cannonball: so do you make one giant subdirectory such as data_bags/ips/$host.json, or separate environments such as data_bags/$env/$host.json ?
[2013-11-26 18:37:33 -0500] cannonball: We probably only have a couple hundred hosts, so it's not terribly large, but it's large enought that I don't want to be lamenting the choice 2 years from now.
[2013-11-26 18:39:19 -0500] cannonball: Or, third option, arrange it such that you have groups of data as data_bags/$env/ips.json  (and make each node be a hash in ips.json) ?
[2013-11-26 18:39:44 -0500] cannonball: I can see benefits to each of these three ways.  Curious if real world experience says one is better than the others.
[2013-11-26 18:41:05 -0500] CPS: i'm not sure my experience counts as real-world yet
[2013-11-26 18:41:39 -0500] CPS: i made one giant data bag for each of our applications
[2013-11-26 18:42:15 -0500] CPS: it's brokend down at the top level by environment, then by geography (since that changes what's in the configs), then by configuration file
[2013-11-26 18:42:45 -0500] CPS: the plus side is you have everything customizable about the application's config in one place, the downside it's a pretty large file
[2013-11-26 18:43:03 -0500] CPS: entirely up to you, however
[2013-11-26 18:45:14 -0500] cannonball: That's a good point: I also have different versions of the website software (only doing the most recent one at this point).  But I'm using logic which basically does if node.roles.include?('something') and node.roles.include?('something_else'), such as "version_4" and "reverse_proxy".
[2013-11-26 18:45:38 -0500] cannonball: ...in various places in my *.rb files.
[2013-11-26 18:45:40 -0500] chip-: cannonball: That sounds like every host becomes a beautiful, unique snowflake.
[2013-11-26 18:46:30 -0500] CPS: lol
[2013-11-26 18:46:33 -0500] cannonball: It's not far from it.  Much of our infrastructure is unique nodes.  Some are load balanced (identical) machines and those are the ones which benefit from ease of replication.
[2013-11-26 18:46:55 -0500] CPS: cannonball: another way to do it would be to add recipes to the runlist of a role
[2013-11-26 18:47:22 -0500] CPS: so you don't have those if/else blocks and can just execute whatever you need for that role
[2013-11-26 18:48:18 -0500] chip-: This is very irc-neckbeardy, so please forgive me, but I would encourage you to think about your architecture in a different way, if at all possible.
[2013-11-26 18:49:06 -0500] geggam: wtf is irc-neckbeardy ? 
[2013-11-26 18:49:08 -0500] CPS: who was that to?
[2013-11-26 18:49:14 -0500] cannonball: Ok, will ponder it.
[2013-11-26 18:49:14 -0500] chip-: to cannonball 
[2013-11-26 18:49:57 -0500] chip-: IRC-neckbeardy is when you get on IRC and ask a question, and some neckbeard not only doesn't answer your question, but lectures you about how you're doing it wrong, and I hate that guy almost as much as I hate being that guy. NEVERTHELESS...
[2013-11-26 18:50:25 -0500] geggam: cannonball,  the way i like to attempt to architect things is in a manner where i can simply shut off any machine and not notice that i did so
[2013-11-26 18:50:34 -0500] geggam: like that ? 
[2013-11-26 18:51:18 -0500] chip-: cannonball: I find that Chef works best when each node is treated as an independent, self-authoritative actor. Rather than a command-and-control console where you push buttons and the agent responds to your commands, think of it as self-configuring agents that consume data from various sources and then adjust configuration to be correct, according to that data.
[2013-11-26 18:51:25 -0500] geggam: chef is a tool that can help me do that ... monit is another.. chef monit nagios and ec2 is all i need 
[2013-11-26 18:51:50 -0500] geggam: that and autoscale... and elb... 
[2013-11-26 18:52:08 -0500] cannonball: My current flow is that all machiens get role[common], which installs a bunch of packages and configures the sysctl, nfs mounts, profile.d/* files, etc.  Second, a role is added to a node based on its general function, such as role[rp] or role[www] or role[db].   The environment [ user, test, live ] is used to configure various things within each of the previous roles.  It sounds like I do not have the ability mentioned by geggam.
[2013-11-26 18:52:47 -0500] cannonball: I haven't gotten to auto-cofniguring the load balancer yet (we use LVS with ldirectord).  This is all on local machines, none of it is on AWS.
[2013-11-26 18:52:49 -0500] chip-: cannonball: So instead of duplicating the data that you have in DNS, consume it instead. Instead of making a unique per-host config, make a generic config that can be used to stamp out as many copies of a host as you want, and the pieces that need to vary between them can either use some outside data source to determine that per-node data, or determine it algorithmically(sp?)
[2013-11-26 18:53:44 -0500] chip-: cannonball: for instance, on AWS, there are cookbooks by which a machine can add or remove itself from Amazon's load balancers from within a recipe by sending API requests during the run.
[2013-11-26 18:53:47 -0500] chip-: etc.
[2013-11-26 18:54:26 -0500] chip-: That's way easier for me to say than for you to do, of course, but it'll help build more scalable & hands-off architecture long-term.
[2013-11-26 18:55:54 -0500] CPS: cannonball: have you looked at templates? i'm using templates to programmatically fill in config files with data bag data
[2013-11-26 18:55:59 -0500] CPS: might be of use
[2013-11-26 18:56:05 -0500] chip-: As to answering the question you actually asked: You'll need a datastore somewhere defining which IP addresses map to which machines, unless you can determine it by algorithm/hostname. That datastore could be on the Chef server, or in ipplan, or anywhere, as long as it can be consumed by each node. It's probably less code to store it at the Chef server.
[2013-11-26 18:56:44 -0500] chip-: If you use a data bag, it'll be a forward-indexed k/v store, a hash-table-in-the-sky sort of thing, but you could search it for your hostname and then pull those values back.
[2013-11-26 18:56:50 -0500] cannonball: "at the Chef server" could be "in a data bag" or "in a series of attributes" etc.
[2013-11-26 18:56:53 -0500] cannonball: right?
[2013-11-26 18:57:21 -0500] chip-: Right.
[2013-11-26 18:57:34 -0500] chip-: I'd discourage you from adding attributes directly to the node, though
[2013-11-26 18:57:58 -0500] cannonball: I think I woudl prefer the data bag, but I'm saying tha tbased on a mediocre-to-incomplete understanding of it.
[2013-11-26 18:58:33 -0500] cannonball: THanks for the feedback all, I'm watching more of the podcasts (The FoodFight Show).
[2013-11-26 18:58:52 -0500] chip-: Data bags are a searchable hash table in the sky.
[2013-11-26 19:00:32 -0500] geggam: chip-, dns server backed in mysql makes a handy tool for automation ;) 
[2013-11-26 19:00:38 -0500] geggam: think powerdns
[2013-11-26 19:00:44 -0500] chip-: geggam: Yes yes!
[2013-11-26 19:00:54 -0500] cannonball: We use bind-dlz, so could get the same result I would imagine.
[2013-11-26 19:01:45 -0500] CPS: geggam: i'm probably going to have to integrate some oracle stuff into my recipes at some point. is there any documentation for doing this?
[2013-11-26 19:01:46 -0500] cannonball: ...but not for internal DNS zones (domainnames and rdns).
[2013-11-26 19:02:11 -0500] geggam: there have been moments where i wonder if im going to automate myself out of my job... but then i talk to my devlopers again and realize they will always break something in a way i cant automate
[2013-11-26 19:04:46 -0500] linuxbaby: guyz.. i am doing chef server installation [fresh] of version 10.12.. our appliance is dependedndent on that ..

[2013-11-26 19:05:32 -0500] linuxbaby: i do not even see a log file for chef server
[2013-11-26 19:05:45 -0500] cannonball: CPS: You use recipes and providers to do that.
[2013-11-26 19:05:46 -0500] linuxbaby: /var/log/chef has only expander and solr logs
[2013-11-26 19:06:03 -0500] chip-: geggam: Sheer geometric explosion in node count means you'll never be out of a job.
[2013-11-26 19:06:20 -0500] cannonball: CPS: The ease it depends if you only do the LWRP or if you do the full raw ruby inheritance stuff.
[2013-11-26 19:06:32 -0500] geggam: not sure about that chip- ... ive been on systems with 15k nodes and 60 petabytes already
[2013-11-26 19:06:36 -0500] chip-: CPS: Yes! They are called LWRP's. http://docs.opscode.com/lwrp_custom_resource.html
[2013-11-26 19:07:48 -0500] linuxbaby: http://pastebin.com/DXeV5XMM  .. this is the error i get with chef-server -V
[2013-11-26 19:07:53 -0500] cannonball: CPS: So if your cookbook is named "internal", and you want to make a resource to generate some $file, I did it in two parts:
[2013-11-26 19:08:12 -0500] linuxbaby: any pointers..
[2013-11-26 19:09:27 -0500] linuxbaby: i am new to chef..
[2013-11-26 19:09:56 -0500] CPS: linuxbaby: line 4 is my guess
[2013-11-26 19:10:17 -0500] linuxbaby: CPS, the ampq .. stuff?
[2013-11-26 19:10:44 -0500] cannonball: 1) Choose a name for your internal function (i.e. "provider").  I'll pick "network".  Assuming you do LWRP, you'll create a cookbooks/internal/resources/network.rb that defines the actions available, and attributes that the provider will use when it's called.
[2013-11-26 19:10:48 -0500] CPS: no gem file found
[2013-11-26 19:11:41 -0500] linuxbaby: CPS, i have merb gems installed
[2013-11-26 19:11:42 -0500] linuxbaby:  gem list --local | grep -i merb
[2013-11-26 19:11:43 -0500] linuxbaby: merb-assets (1.1.3)
[2013-11-26 19:11:43 -0500] linuxbaby: merb-core (1.1.3)
[2013-11-26 19:11:43 -0500] linuxbaby: merb-haml (1.1.3)
[2013-11-26 19:11:43 -0500] linuxbaby: merb-helpers (1.1.3)
[2013-11-26 19:11:45 -0500] linuxbaby: merb-param-protection (1.1.3)
[2013-11-26 19:12:01 -0500] cannonball: 2) Then create the provider at cookbooks/internal/providers/network.rb, and if it's LWRP, you create handlrs for each of the actions that you stated were allowable in the resource file.
[2013-11-26 19:12:50 -0500] cannonball: With those two things in place, you can now access your newly created provider as internal_network() from any recipe which depends on "internal".
[2013-11-26 19:13:26 -0500] linuxbaby: CPS, okies.. i ran bundle init
[2013-11-26 19:13:32 -0500] linuxbaby: now the error is different ..
[2013-11-26 19:13:37 -0500] CPS: progress!
[2013-11-26 19:13:48 -0500] linuxbaby:  chef-server -V
[2013-11-26 19:13:48 -0500] linuxbaby:  ~ Running bootloaders...
[2013-11-26 19:13:49 -0500] linuxbaby: Merb root at: /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/chef-server-api-10.12.0

[2013-11-26 19:13:57 -0500] CPS: i'll look into this LWRP stuff
[2013-11-26 19:14:07 -0500] linuxbaby: does this strike anything ..
[2013-11-26 19:14:46 -0500] cannonball: CPS: It's basically a way of Chef providing you a template system that takes care of all of the boilerplate that has to do with classes and inheritance.  Being a non-ruby guy, it make3s things MUCH easier for me.
[2013-11-26 19:14:52 -0500] chip-: CPS: Essentially the resources file is your header, and the providers file is your source file. There's a DSL for both, with syntax sugar to help you write input validation more quickly.
[2013-11-26 19:15:14 -0500] cannonball: Oooh, I like chip-'s answer better.
[2013-11-26 19:16:30 -0500] CPS: oh so this is for building chef directives like 'execute' and 'template'
[2013-11-26 19:16:48 -0500] CPS: linuxbaby: gist the rest of it
[2013-11-26 19:17:46 -0500] linuxbaby: CPS, http://pastebin.com/Ykr0XuEB
[2013-11-26 19:18:34 -0500] linuxbaby: i guess it has to do something with version of merb* gems.. not sure though
[2013-11-26 19:19:11 -0500] CPS: linuxbaby: ls /opt/chef-server/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/
[2013-11-26 19:19:21 -0500] CPS: make sure merb is in there
[2013-11-26 19:20:30 -0500] linuxbaby: CPS, i do not have anything at /opt
[2013-11-26 19:20:45 -0500] CPS: where is chef server installed?
[2013-11-26 19:21:23 -0500] linuxbaby: i am following https://wiki.opscode.com/display/ChefCN/Bootstrap+Chef+RubyGems+Installation
[2013-11-26 19:21:36 -0500] CPS: chip-: would it be possible to just define ruby functions and include them in a common recipe?
[2013-11-26 19:21:50 -0500] linuxbaby: doing the gem install chef -v 10.12
[2013-11-26 19:23:06 -0500] chip-: CPS: You can put a library of ruby functions in a cookbook at /libraries if you want
[2013-11-26 19:23:16 -0500] CPS: the reason i ask is your server is looking in /usr/lib/ruby/gems which is different from what i have
[2013-11-26 19:23:17 -0500] chip-: CPS: But the sugar is pretty nice.
[2013-11-26 19:23:24 -0500] CPS: i'm not familiar with that guide
[2013-11-26 19:23:52 -0500] chip-: CPS: You can also install gems to Chef's ruby context from with na recipe, and require them if you want to
[2013-11-26 19:24:10 -0500] CPS: chip-: coming from a programmer background i prefer the raw language
[2013-11-26 19:24:21 -0500] CPS: since i'm still not super comfortable writing for chef
[2013-11-26 19:24:57 -0500] chip-: CPS: Chef is just a set of primitives for sysadmin tasks on top of Ruby, so you can just jump out and Ruby it up any time you want to, but there are advantages to staying with the DSL and doing things the chef way.
[2013-11-26 19:25:16 -0500] linuxbaby: CPS, let me chek the installation dir of chef-server
[2013-11-26 19:25:50 -0500] linuxbaby: CPS, i have the merb gems at /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems
[2013-11-26 19:26:24 -0500] chip-: CPS: Full list of all primitives in the Chef DSL, along with complete documentation on each, with usage examples: http://docs.opscode.com/chef/resources.html (TOC down the right-hand side)
[2013-11-26 19:26:59 -0500] CPS: linuxbaby: depending on how you installed chef server it comes packaged with its own version of ruby
[2013-11-26 19:27:21 -0500] CPS: type 'which gem'
[2013-11-26 19:27:47 -0500] linuxbaby: which gem
[2013-11-26 19:27:48 -0500] linuxbaby: /usr/bin/gem
[2013-11-26 19:27:54 -0500] linuxbaby: gem -v
[2013-11-26 19:27:54 -0500] linuxbaby: 2.1.11
[2013-11-26 19:28:36 -0500] CPS: figure out where your chef server install is
[2013-11-26 19:28:38 -0500] CPS: look in there
[2013-11-26 19:29:34 -0500] linuxbaby: okies.. i installed ruby1.9.1 and installed chef as a gem ..
[2013-11-26 19:29:49 -0500] linuxbaby: i think i need to install chef as a package as well
[2013-11-26 19:29:52 -0500] linuxbaby: apt-get
[2013-11-26 19:30:24 -0500] CPS: if you installed chef as a gem you're way outside my realm of experience
[2013-11-26 19:31:10 -0500] linuxbaby: CPS, hmm.. anyway .. thanks for looking in to the issue..
[2013-11-26 19:32:09 -0500] linuxbaby: CPS, one more doubt.. i have an omnibus installer of server .. working fine.. is there a method to installed an old version of chef using omnibus installer
[2013-11-26 19:32:15 -0500] linuxbaby: like chef 10.12
[2013-11-26 19:34:31 -0500] CPS: not sure i understand the question
[2013-11-26 19:36:07 -0500] CPS: chip-: it might make more sense to describe what i want to do. each of my recipes gets a NAS path from a data bag and copies an installer from there locally
[2013-11-26 19:36:33 -0500] CPS: in each recipe i have code to get a list of all the files in the NAS folder and select the first one with "applicationname" in it
[2013-11-26 19:36:42 -0500] CPS: then copy it locally and run it
[2013-11-26 19:37:08 -0500] CPS: seems like a regular ruby function would work well for this
[2013-11-26 19:37:20 -0500] chip-: So you're using a NAS path as your artifact repo
[2013-11-26 19:37:34 -0500] CPS: artifact repo?
[2013-11-26 19:37:53 -0500] chip-: The place where you store all your built/packaged programs.
[2013-11-26 19:38:02 -0500] CPS: yeah
[2013-11-26 19:38:04 -0500] chip-: There are apps for this (apt/yum/maven/etc)
[2013-11-26 19:38:10 -0500] chip-: but an NFS store can work fine.
[2013-11-26 19:38:19 -0500] CPS: i'm on windows so my options are limited
[2013-11-26 19:38:25 -0500] chip-: CPS: I'd put the regular ruby to do that job in a provider file, then provide a resource header to wrap around it.
[2013-11-26 19:38:41 -0500] CPS: and this way is closest to the status quo which is a big selling point
[2013-11-26 19:38:45 -0500] chip-: Yup!
[2013-11-26 19:41:44 -0500] CPS: chip-: provider files are define where?
[2013-11-26 19:41:50 -0500] CPS: and how do you upload them to the server?
[2013-11-26 19:42:03 -0500] chip-: CPS: You make a cookbook to distribute the new functions you want to share.
[2013-11-26 19:42:50 -0500] chip-: CPS: Then in that cookbook, in /resources, you put a file with the header. The header defines the allowed variables to pass in, their allowed types, their default values, and the method names.
[2013-11-26 19:43:13 -0500] chip-: CPS: In /providers, you create an identically-named file. That's your source. There you define the methods.
[2013-11-26 19:43:57 -0500] chip-: Once that's done, recipes from other cookbooks can call that function if the cookbook containing that function has been loaded.
[2013-11-26 19:44:50 -0500] chip-: Lots of examples in the first 3 links under Topic here: http://docs.opscode.com/lwrp_custom.html
