[2013-11-19 16:19:59 -0500] gmichels: Hello everyone, quick question. Is there a way to use the cookbook version available in metadata.rb as a variable in a recipe?
[2013-11-19 17:16:28 -0500] nicgrayson: gmichels: why do you need to do this?
[2013-11-19 17:20:19 -0500] gmichels: nicgrayson: the package to be installed (Windows MSI) has the version number in the name, and I'd like to make that match to the cookbook version
[2013-11-19 17:21:04 -0500] gmichels: nicgrayson: what I'm doing right now is defining a version variable in attributes/default.rb, but it feels redundant as it's available in metadata.rb
[2013-11-19 17:21:17 -0500] nicgrayson: gmichels: i would suggest not doing that. You won't want to update the cookbook every time a new version is released
[2013-11-19 17:21:31 -0500] nicgrayson: gmichels: a version as an attr is the way to do it imo
[2013-11-19 17:21:57 -0500] gmichels: nicgrayson: company policy... cookbook version matches the app version
[2013-11-19 17:22:03 -0500] nicgrayson: gross
[2013-11-19 17:22:53 -0500] gmichels: so the version attr solves the problem, but not in the most elegant way, as every time 2 different places need to be updated with the same information.
[2013-11-19 17:23:15 -0500] gmichels: however is there a way to have the information in metadata.rb available in a recipe?
[2013-11-19 17:23:17 -0500] nicgrayson: i bet there is a way to do it
[2013-11-19 17:23:22 -0500] nicgrayson: looking 
[2013-11-19 17:23:26 -0500] gmichels: thanks
[2013-11-19 17:23:45 -0500] nicgrayson: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13689811/get-deployed-cookbook-version
[2013-11-19 17:23:59 -0500] nicgrayson: looks like run_context.cookbook_collection[cookbook_name].metadata.version will do it
[2013-11-19 17:24:29 -0500] gmichels: thanks! will try it! been searching for hours, but I guess I was using the wrong keywords
[2013-11-19 17:24:45 -0500] nicgrayson: np hf gl
[2013-11-19 17:27:05 -0500] gmichels: nicgrayson: worked beautifully, thanks again
[2013-11-19 17:27:13 -0500] nicgrayson: awesome np
[2013-11-19 18:38:38 -0500] pluma: Are there any resources for open source chef? Everything on learnchef.opscode.com seems to want me to sign up for enterprise.
[2013-11-19 18:50:54 -0500] mmzyk: pluma The idea is to get you started as quicklyu as possible. For up to 5 nodes on the hosted platform is free, so that's why.
[2013-11-19 18:51:23 -0500] mmzyk: That said, after working w/ hosted to get the hang of chef you can take what you learn and apply it to the open source.
[2013-11-19 20:00:18 -0500] pluma: mmzyk, I was looking for something to get me started with chef-solo and vagrant. I managed to connect the dots after remembering having heard about "knife" and using its help command.
[2013-11-19 20:01:13 -0500] mmzyk: pluma cool - also check out docs.opscode.com if you haven't. It's a good reference source for all things knife and chef.
[2013-11-19 20:01:24 -0500] pluma: mmzyk, I can understand why opscode would want people to start with the "real deal" to give them the right idea of what chef is intended for, but even if enterprise is free for a handful of nodes, the docs still feel like a constant upsell.
[2013-11-19 20:02:13 -0500] mmzyk: That's interesting feedback - I don't think learnchef is intended that way (full disclsoure: I work for Opscode).
[2013-11-19 20:02:21 -0500] pluma: Ah, okay.
[2013-11-19 20:02:26 -0500] mmzyk: The idea is to get people up and running as fast as possible using chef.
[2013-11-19 20:02:50 -0500] mmzyk: Granted, we do learn heavily towards chef w/ the server and not so much on chef solo.
[2013-11-19 20:02:56 -0500] mmzyk: s/learn/lean
[2013-11-19 20:03:23 -0500] pluma: Yeah, I figured as much. But I'd rather learn how to use chef-solo and then possibly move to a server once I know whether I need one.
[2013-11-19 20:04:55 -0500] mmzyk: gotcha. We generally feel the server is a better model and comes w/ benefits over chef-solo, but lots of people get lots of use out of chef solo.
[2013-11-19 20:08:17 -0500] pluma: "Add this infrastructure dependency" is kinda off-putting to me. But I guess I'm not the main audience: I'm only looking into chef because I want to implement the next project in a distributed way. I don't already have a huge network topology I want to simplify the maintenance of :)
[2013-11-19 20:10:43 -0500] pluma: (this is also why I'm skeptical of chef enterprise: I may have more than five nodes, but that doesn't mean it's a large project)
[2013-11-19 20:13:01 -0500] mmzyk: well, that's exactly why open source chef exists. You don't have to pay us. :)
[2013-11-19 20:13:01 -0500] mmzyk: Also, you might look into chef zero.
[2013-11-19 20:13:45 -0500] mmzyk: https://github.com/opscode/chef-zero
[2013-11-19 20:13:46 -0500] pluma: https://github.com/opscode/chef-zero ? Looks interesting.
[2013-11-19 20:13:59 -0500] mmzyk: Yeah.
[2013-11-19 20:14:06 -0500] mmzyk: Also see this blog post: http://www.opscode.com/blog/2013/10/31/chef-client-z-from-zero-to-chef-in-8-5-seconds/
[2013-11-19 20:14:14 -0500] mmzyk: It's incorporated into the newest client.
[2013-11-19 20:14:52 -0500] mmzyk: The idea is it's an in memory chef server, so it can do more than chef solo, but still operates locally.
[2013-11-19 20:16:01 -0500] mmzyk: I think it supports concepts like search as well,  which solo doesn't handle (I think, I might be wrong as I haven't used it extensively), but the idea is you can start with chef zero and your cookbooks that work with it will work seemlessly against a chef server as well, if you ever move over.
[2013-11-19 20:16:12 -0500] mmzyk: that doesn't happen necessarily with chef solo.
[2013-11-19 20:16:31 -0500] mmzyk: Not a lot of docs on it at the moment, but the plan is for more to come in the future.
[2013-11-19 20:22:06 -0500] mmzyk: Anyway, certainly ask any questions you have pluma and we'll do our best to answer them.
[2013-11-19 20:25:30 -0500] mmzyk: More chef zero docs http://docs.opscode.com/release_notes.html#chef-zero
[2013-11-19 20:26:50 -0500] pluma: Thanks
