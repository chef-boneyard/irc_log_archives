[2013-11-25 04:54:02 -0500] robawt: hi all, is the best way to download a cookbook 'knife cookbook site download <BLEH>"?
[2013-11-25 04:54:30 -0500] robawt: working through the Test Driven Infrastructure w/Chef book and it seems rather odd I need to download the tgz and untar/zip it every time
[2013-11-25 05:51:58 -0500] chip-: robawt: There is a command that will download/unpack it but it does some ugly git business too, so people tend to avoid it.
[2013-11-25 06:05:04 -0500] robawt: ah hello again chip- 
[2013-11-25 06:05:34 -0500] robawt: ok.  This book is showing me some cool new stuff, but I feel (atleast the earlier chapters) are a bit goofy with how it's constantly doing it
[2013-11-25 06:12:52 -0500] saapas: good morning / evening (?)
[2013-11-25 18:21:07 -0500] fveillette: does anyone user windows_task provider here&
[2013-11-25 18:21:07 -0500] fveillette: ?
[2013-11-25 18:22:14 -0500] mmzyk: I'm sure someone does. Are more direct question about it might be helpful though.
[2013-11-25 18:26:13 -0500] fveillette: i got a method issue when i use it with the attribute start_time or start_day
[2013-11-25 18:26:51 -0500] fveillette: had an error: NoMethodError: undefined method `start_time' for Chef::Resource::WindowsTask
[2013-11-25 18:27:43 -0500] fveillette: any idea someone?
[2013-11-25 18:39:25 -0500] mmzyk: fveillette I don't know that resource in particular and don't see any docs on it, but based on the error my guess is that your attribute name is colliding with a method that it's checking for for some reason. Try renaming the attribute and see if it works.
[2013-11-25 18:44:26 -0500] fveillette: mmzyk hum ok but since it come from opscode i tought this thing was tested
[2013-11-25 18:46:28 -0500] mmzyk: Sure, they are, but that doesn't mean we think of everyway that users are going to use something. :) In this case it's a quirk of ruby and the way it does method lookup *I think*. Like I said, I don't know a lot about this provider. However, it's likely that we have a hook for start_time in their so it's looking for a method with that name instead of your attribute. This is all a guess on my part.
[2013-11-25 18:46:52 -0500] mmzyk: It's part of the blessing and curse of using ruby: it's flexible, which is really nice, but occassionally you hit things like this.
[2013-11-25 18:49:29 -0500] mmzyk: fveillette Disregard all of that. It was just pointed out to me that this is part of the windows cookbook and it's a LWRP there.
[2013-11-25 18:49:53 -0500] mmzyk: I see that it does say start_time and start_day are attributes, so my speculation was way off in this case.
[2013-11-25 18:51:06 -0500] fveillette: adam!
[2013-11-25 18:51:10 -0500] fveillette: i need your help
[2013-11-25 18:51:14 -0500] adamedx: hello :)
[2013-11-25 18:51:17 -0500] adamedx: windows_task?
[2013-11-25 18:51:24 -0500] fveillette: yes
[2013-11-25 18:51:31 -0500] adamedx: what error are you seeing?
[2013-11-25 18:51:34 -0500] fveillette: had an error: NoMethodError: undefined method `start_time' for Chef::Resource::WindowsTask
[2013-11-25 18:51:58 -0500] adamedx: hmm, let me look at the the windows cookbook
[2013-11-25 18:52:03 -0500] adamedx: can you show the recipe?
[2013-11-25 18:52:08 -0500] fveillette: sure
[2013-11-25 18:52:25 -0500] fveillette: windows_task 'PunchToZabbix' do

[2013-11-25 18:52:40 -0500] fveillette: this my call to the provider
[2013-11-25 18:52:50 -0500] fveillette: if i remove the start day or start time
[2013-11-25 18:53:01 -0500] adamedx: looking
[2013-11-25 18:53:10 -0500] fveillette: the task is created with the start time = the time of my run chef :)
[2013-11-25 18:53:49 -0500] adamedx: that looks like it should work, going to try something on my workstation
[2013-11-25 18:54:18 -0500] fveillette: sure
[2013-11-25 18:54:23 -0500] adamedx: you're sure you have latest windows cookbook?
[2013-11-25 18:54:28 -0500] fveillette: 1.11.1
[2013-11-25 18:54:31 -0500] fveillette: yes
[2013-11-25 18:54:39 -0500] fveillette: chef-client 11.4
[2013-11-25 18:54:45 -0500] adamedx: k
[2013-11-25 18:55:01 -0500] fveillette: i come back in few min
[2013-11-25 18:57:32 -0500] adamedx: k, I'm comparing latest cookbook release with what's in git
[2013-11-25 19:05:31 -0500] robawt: hi all
[2013-11-25 19:05:41 -0500] robawt: i notice Berkshelf is used in the tutorials from the site
[2013-11-25 19:05:50 -0500] robawt: is this pretty much a standard way to install cookbooks now?
[2013-11-25 19:06:38 -0500] mmzyk: It's very common in the community.
[2013-11-25 19:37:39 -0500] fveillette: I'm back
[2013-11-25 19:37:49 -0500] adamedx: so far, I can't repro
[2013-11-25 19:37:52 -0500] adamedx: going back to chef 11.4
[2013-11-25 19:38:18 -0500] adamedx: i wrote a different recipe, but was successfully able to run it and get it to configure a task with the correct start time, etc.
[2013-11-25 19:38:42 -0500] fveillette: hum ok
[2013-11-25 19:38:43 -0500] adamedx: so we'll see if 11.4 is the common denominator
[2013-11-25 19:38:52 -0500] adamedx: if that doesn't repro, I will try your exact recipe
[2013-11-25 19:42:21 -0500] adamedx: hmmm, works ok with 11.4
[2013-11-25 19:42:29 -0500] adamedx: so let me try yours then
[2013-11-25 19:47:29 -0500] fveillette: ok
[2013-11-25 19:50:21 -0500] adamedx: ok, so I tried the exact recipe you pasted, it worked for me on chef 11.4
[2013-11-25 19:50:41 -0500] adamedx: at this point, I would still guess that you're somehow using an old version
[2013-11-25 19:50:53 -0500] adamedx: how are you running this -- chef-client talking to your server, or chef-solo?
[2013-11-25 19:53:44 -0500] fveillette: chef-server
[2013-11-25 19:55:07 -0500] fveillette: and i really sure my windows cookbook is the as your i guess
[2013-11-25 19:55:47 -0500] fveillette: as if i remove this the start_time and start day attribute it's working
[2013-11-25 20:11:19 -0500] shyam: Hi, How do I bootstrap AWS EC2 Windows Instance using knife ec2 server create command?
[2013-11-25 20:18:15 -0500] adias_: hello
[2013-11-25 20:18:59 -0500] adias_: we need help in getting  windows node working on EC2 and cannot get WINRM working
[2013-11-25 20:20:08 -0500] shyam: we use knife ec2 command with --user-data for winrm configuration, EC2 instance is creating but bootstrapping is not happening
[2013-11-25 20:21:27 -0500] adamedx: fveillette -- back in a little bit, I'm going to send you something to verify the cookbook version
[2013-11-25 20:21:32 -0500] fveillette: ok
[2013-11-25 20:22:11 -0500] shyam: Using the knife ec2 server create, ec2 windows instances are creating and it is showing an error "waiting for winrm" 
[2013-11-25 20:23:27 -0500] shyam: we verified from the ec2 windows node the winrm configurations but bootstrapping is not happening
[2013-11-25 20:27:02 -0500] mmzyk: adias_ and shyam You both might try asking your questions in #chef - there's a larger base of users there who are more likely to have encountered what your seeing than here in learnchef where is more geared to getting people started w/ chef.
[2013-11-25 20:27:48 -0500] adias_: thanks for the suggestion mmzyk
[2013-11-25 20:28:09 -0500] shyam: mmzyk : Thank you for your suggestion.
[2013-11-25 20:28:17 -0500] mmzyk: np. If I knew the answer I'd just answer your questions directly, but I don't.
[2013-11-25 20:28:31 -0500] shyam: mmzyk: np
[2013-11-25 21:15:25 -0500] adamedx: fveillette, can you add the following to your recipe right after the include_recipe 'windows' line?

[2013-11-25 21:15:37 -0500] adamedx: then re-run it
[2013-11-25 21:15:50 -0500] adamedx: it should log something with cookbook versions at the end
[2013-11-25 21:16:18 -0500] adamedx: like this:
