[2013-11-18 13:46:55 -0500] Breaking_Pitt: [2013-11-18T14:46:28+01:00] FATAL: NoMethodError: undefined method `ignore_failing' for Chef::Resource::Execute
[2013-11-18 15:10:29 -0500] bobbywilson0: anyone active here?
[2013-11-18 15:24:19 -0500] nicgrayson: bobbywilson0: sure you need something?
[2013-11-18 15:25:01 -0500] bobbywilson0: @nicgrayson yeah, so I am trying to overwrite a file, but it remains the same after my recipe runs. https://github.com/meetfm/rsyslog/blob/master/recipes/default.rb#L87-L96
[2013-11-18 15:26:06 -0500] nicgrayson: bobbywilson0: you won't need to delete the file, just use the second file resource call
[2013-11-18 15:26:35 -0500] nicgrayson: bobbywilson0: also i would suggest not forking opscode cookbooks
[2013-11-18 15:26:41 -0500] bobbywilson0: @nicgrayson: yeah I have tried with just the second resource, and the same happens, the file is unchanged
[2013-11-18 15:26:54 -0500] bobbywilson0: nicgrayson: create a new recipe that just does the one thing?
[2013-11-18 15:27:00 -0500] bobbywilson0: er cookbook
[2013-11-18 15:27:21 -0500] nicgrayson: bobbywilson0: what are you trying to do?
[2013-11-18 15:28:45 -0500] bobbywilson0: nicgrayson: there is a bug that exists where ubuntu 12.04 stops logging with rsyslog after logrotate is run, and I found a fix here (http://blog.canadacomp.ca/ubuntu-12-04-64bit-rsyslogd-stops-logging-to-syslog-after-log-rotation/) which is just to edit the file /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog file and change reload to restart, but havevn't had success yet
[2013-11-18 15:29:48 -0500] nicgrayson: ah okay
[2013-11-18 15:30:03 -0500] bobbywilson0: nicgrayson: is there a common way to do such a thing?
[2013-11-18 15:30:56 -0500] nicgrayson: i would just add this to a base cookbook
[2013-11-18 15:31:04 -0500] nicgrayson: so you don't have to edit the upstream
[2013-11-18 15:31:16 -0500] bobbywilson0: nicgrayson: ok
[2013-11-18 15:31:35 -0500] nicgrayson: and i'm not sure your call to file is correct
[2013-11-18 15:31:43 -0500] bobbywilson0: ok
[2013-11-18 15:32:11 -0500] nicgrayson: bobbywilson0: i'll send you a gist
[2013-11-18 15:32:14 -0500] bobbywilson0: thanks
[2013-11-18 15:36:50 -0500] nicgrayson: bobbywilson0: https://gist.github.com/nicgrayson/7529828
[2013-11-18 15:37:15 -0500] nicgrayson: i would recommend always using template over other file resources
[2013-11-18 15:37:21 -0500] bobbywilson0: ah ok, I was curioius of that
[2013-11-18 15:37:24 -0500] nicgrayson: you never know when you might want to change it
[2013-11-18 15:37:36 -0500] nicgrayson: the file resource doesn't 'upload' anything
[2013-11-18 15:38:09 -0500] nicgrayson: bobbywilson0: also the 'mode' attribute to template is confusing to many
[2013-11-18 15:38:14 -0500] nicgrayson: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_template.html
[2013-11-18 15:38:25 -0500] nicgrayson: so look it up here to make sure you have the correct permissions
[2013-11-18 15:38:29 -0500] bobbywilson0: ok thanks
[2013-11-18 15:38:37 -0500] nicgrayson: np
[2013-11-18 15:38:41 -0500] nicgrayson: happy cheffing
[2013-11-18 15:38:53 -0500] bobbywilson0: nicgrayson: I see the major mistake I had was confusing the template param with the path param
[2013-11-18 15:39:28 -0500] nicgrayson: ah np
[2013-11-18 19:58:03 -0500] cptmashek: Hello! Logging into my account brings me to preview.opscode.com but I see no area where I can download the starter kit. Am I missing something? (Thanks!
[2013-11-18 20:00:23 -0500] chip-: cptmashek: Do you have an organization already?
[2013-11-18 20:00:49 -0500] cptmashek: No? It is completely blank, save for the header and sidebar.
[2013-11-18 20:01:26 -0500] chip-: OK.
[2013-11-18 20:06:49 -0500] chip-: cptmashek: sent you a private message.
[2013-11-18 20:07:35 -0500] chip-: cptmashek: If your UI in preview is blank, try signing in to manage.opscode.com and creating an organization, if you don't have one already as part of the sign up process. There (is? was?) a bug where Preview would not generate any UI if the user didn't have an organization.
[2013-11-18 20:07:58 -0500] cptmashek: Yeah, and the manage link doesn't go anywhere in preview
[2013-11-18 20:08:23 -0500] cptmashek: Thank you
[2013-11-18 20:08:29 -0500] chip-: https://manage.opscode.com/login
[2013-11-18 20:08:34 -0500] cptmashek: Already in. :D
[2013-11-18 20:08:39 -0500] cptmashek: Thanks for the help chip-
[2013-11-18 20:08:47 -0500] chip-: Cool. Once you create an org, switch back to Preview. It's better over there. :)
[2013-11-18 20:09:11 -0500] cptmashek: Okay
[2013-11-18 20:09:59 -0500] chip-: Still a beta obviously, but it's marching toward release. Changelog is here, and there's an RSS if you want to track it: https://preview.opscode.com/changelog
[2013-11-18 20:10:40 -0500] cptmashek: Awesome! :D
[2013-11-18 20:11:03 -0500] cptmashek: Recently landed a client that neglected to mention they use chef...
[2013-11-18 20:11:09 -0500] cptmashek: So now it's crash course time.
