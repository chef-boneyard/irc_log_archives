[2013-11-04 18:55:20 -0500] captbaritone: I am currently using Vagrant and Chef Solo to provision a development environment (forked from here: https://github.com/r8/vagrant-lamp). I would like to specify some custom directives for php.ini. The php cookbook says to use node['php']['directives'] (https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/php#attributes) but I'm not sure where I would add that code. Can anyone help a Chef/Ruby noob?

[2013-11-04 18:57:42 -0500] tomduffield: chef.json => { "php" => { "directives" => ... } }

[2013-11-04 18:59:27 -0500] captbaritone: tomduffield: Will that work even though the php cookbook is added from within another cookbook using `include_recipe "php"`?

[2013-11-04 19:00:18 -0500] tomduffield: it should. if you put that code in your Vagrantfile
[2013-11-04 19:00:57 -0500] captbaritone: tomduffield: I really appreciate you taking the time to help me. I'll give that a try.
[2013-11-04 19:04:08 -0500] adamedx: fveillette, can you tell us your registry_key issue?
[2013-11-04 19:04:30 -0500] fveillette: sure
[2013-11-04 19:04:47 -0500] fveillette: i user registry_key to create a key with multiple value
[2013-11-04 19:05:06 -0500] fveillette: when i run this on a server that have the key but not the proper value
[2013-11-04 19:05:11 -0500] fveillette: the value don't get updated
[2013-11-04 19:05:14 -0500] adamedx: hmm
[2013-11-04 19:05:16 -0500] captbaritone: tomduffield Am I correct in assuming I need to change that first "=>" to a "="?
[2013-11-04 19:05:23 -0500] adamedx: can you paste in your example?
[2013-11-04 19:05:26 -0500] tomduffield: chef.json = {
[2013-11-04 19:05:34 -0500] captbaritone: tomduffield Thanks

[2013-11-04 19:05:37 -0500] adamedx: k
[2013-11-04 19:06:20 -0500] adamedx: you could also paste in something with generic values / key paths 
[2013-11-04 19:06:40 -0500] fveillette: i just don'T want to spam in public :)
[2013-11-04 19:06:56 -0500] binamov: gist it :)
[2013-11-04 22:06:34 -0500] AcesWayUpHigh: does the chef-server maintain a copy of the the chef-repo, or is everything stored in the database?
[2013-11-04 22:23:32 -0500] tomduffield: AcesWayUpHigh most everything is stored in a database on the chef-server
[2013-11-04 22:28:32 -0500] AcesWayUpHigh: thanks tomduffield. just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something.
[2013-11-04 23:19:59 -0500] captbaritone: I'm trying to set some php.ini directives for a Vagrant machine via Chef. Here is my current Vagrantfile: https://gist.github.com/captbaritone/7311009 the `vagrant_main` cookbook contains the line: `include_recipe "php"`. Any idea why the ini directives are not getting set?
