[2013-11-08 17:40:33 -0500] a13x212: how do you typically get a databag key onto a node?
[2013-11-08 19:02:30 -0500] CPS: how do i access a node's OS version from a recipe? node["os"] yields only "windows" which is unhelpful
[2013-11-08 19:02:53 -0500] CPS: a13x212: i'm not sure i understand the question
[2013-11-08 20:23:18 -0500] iDVB: Help? I'm trying to bootstrap a node and when I enter in host, sudo, user, pass, nodename and hit enter. It take a moment and then I simply get back "Bootstrapping Chef on MYHOSTNAME" and thats it back to the prompt
[2013-11-08 20:23:34 -0500] iDVB: I can ssh into the node directly with no issue
[2013-11-08 20:23:45 -0500] iDVB: the node is an AWS linux box
[2013-11-08 20:24:34 -0500] iDVB: when I go to Enterprise Chef,.... this node was not added.
[2013-11-08 20:27:14 -0500] iDVB: Is anyone avail for questions?
[2013-11-08 20:28:34 -0500] iDVB: Even turning on Verbose doesnt seem to do anything
[2013-11-08 20:46:55 -0500] iDVB: bueller?
[2013-11-08 20:50:22 -0500] iDVB: Is there a human online that would be able to offer me some direction?
[2013-11-08 22:07:31 -0500] grepory: isn't there an easy way to determine if a machine is virtual or physical in chef? I thought someone told me that once, but I can't remember.
[2013-11-08 23:45:06 -0500] sygyzy: Hi, is it possible to encrypt a data bag after you already created it? Assuming, you didn't use --secret or --secret-file the first time around
