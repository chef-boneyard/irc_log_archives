[2013-07-10 03:46:58 -0400] Creeves: anyone here used the chef-rvm cookbook?
[2013-07-10 08:45:09 -0400] daxroc: Morning all
[2013-07-10 08:45:55 -0400] daxroc: How do chef clients 'call home' is it using standard ports for http/s connections to the restful api ?
[2013-07-10 09:11:49 -0400] pkieszcz: Hi guys i want to include some rpm to my cookbook - how can i write source to get it from <my_cookbook>/files/<recipie>/any.rpm ? what should i put in source for rpm_pakcage source ?
[2013-07-10 09:13:51 -0400] pkieszcz: I don't want to hardcode the path
[2013-07-10 17:52:22 -0400] jleveque: Hi
[2013-07-10 17:52:50 -0400] jleveque: *dougireton blog : When you implement Why-Run, you dont need to call new_resource.updated_by_last_action(true) because the converge_by block does that for you automatically.
[2013-07-10 17:52:50 -0400] jleveque: *opscode wiki : The converge_by method is not included in the previous syntax example because when why-run mode is enabled in a lightweight provider that leverages core Chef resources, the converge_by blocks are already defined by the core Chef resources.
[2013-07-10 17:53:00 -0400] jleveque: How to interpret that :  when you use whyrun, and use_inline_resources, you don't need either converge_by nor  new_resource.updated_by_last-action(true) ??
[2013-07-10 17:53:52 -0400] jleveque: This is about LWRP and load_current_ressource > I am very confused about how load-current-ressource works
[2013-07-10 17:58:14 -0400] jleveque: Can someone reexplain with other words than those of the wiki  how load_current_resource works ?
[2013-07-10 18:57:36 -0400] tplaner: hey guys, is there a guide on how to upgrade a Vagrantfile to correct FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::CookbookNotFound: Cookbook runit not found errors
[2013-07-10 19:09:24 -0400] behemphi: @tplaner are you using berkshelf?
[2013-07-10 19:09:49 -0400] tplaner: behemphi: negative
[2013-07-10 19:10:07 -0400] behemphi: So in your Vagrant file there is a setting for the cookbook path
[2013-07-10 19:10:14 -0400] behemphi: I cannot bring it to mind
[2013-07-10 19:10:22 -0400] tplaner: yep
[2013-07-10 19:10:33 -0400] tplaner: chef.cookbooks_path
[2013-07-10 19:10:44 -0400] behemphi: Here is it:
[2013-07-10 19:10:45 -0400] behemphi:     # This path will be expanded relative to the project directory
[2013-07-10 19:10:45 -0400] behemphi:     chef.cookbooks_path = "cookbooks"
[2013-07-10 19:10:50 -0400] behemphi: jynx :-)
[2013-07-10 19:11:01 -0400] behemphi: note the relative expansion though
[2013-07-10 19:11:05 -0400] tplaner: =], so previously in 10.x it was working fine
[2013-07-10 19:12:02 -0400] tplaner: I read this page: http://docs.opscode.com/breaking_changes_chef_11.html where it mentions the exact error, but I'm not exactly sure the solution
[2013-07-10 19:12:10 -0400] tplaner: http://docs.opscode.com/breaking_changes_chef_11.html#non-recipe-file-evaluation-includes-dependencies **
[2013-07-10 19:13:57 -0400] behemphi: ah, I suspect that the fix is to put runit directly in the run_list
[2013-07-10 19:15:33 -0400] tplaner: sorry, but is that a recipe?
[2013-07-10 19:15:57 -0400] behemphi: runit is a cookbook
[2013-07-10 19:16:05 -0400] behemphi: let me look up that syntax
[2013-07-10 19:16:38 -0400] behemphi: chef.add_recipe "runit"
[2013-07-10 19:16:46 -0400] behemphi: the add_recipe is a bit of a misnomer
[2013-07-10 19:16:59 -0400] behemphi: when you spec just the cookbook name, the default recipe gets run
[2013-07-10 19:17:05 -0400] behemphi: under the covers
[2013-07-10 19:17:06 -0400] tplaner: and the cookbooks are loaded in order?
[2013-07-10 19:17:10 -0400] behemphi: yes
[2013-07-10 19:17:11 -0400] tplaner: or recipes
[2013-07-10 19:17:24 -0400] behemphi: recipes are if they are specified in the run_list
[2013-07-10 19:17:35 -0400] behemphi: otherwise the order is likely specified in the default recipe
[2013-07-10 19:17:40 -0400] behemphi: with include_recipe
[2013-07-10 19:17:49 -0400] behemphi: mantra for Chef:  "Order Matters"
[2013-07-10 19:18:31 -0400] tplaner: hmm, that didn't fix it =\
[2013-07-10 19:19:46 -0400] behemphi: same error?
[2013-07-10 19:20:21 -0400] behemphi: I ask b/c if there is another dependency then it might be another cookbook
[2013-07-10 19:21:48 -0400] tplaner: yeah same error
[2013-07-10 19:22:01 -0400] tplaner: I just do a vagrant reload right?
[2013-07-10 19:22:40 -0400] behemphi: I have found that I sometimes need to halt, destroy and up
[2013-07-10 19:22:45 -0400] behemphi: but I am not sure why
[2013-07-10 19:24:22 -0400] behemphi: also check that the runit cookbook is in your cookbook path
[2013-07-10 19:29:11 -0400] tplaner: hmm, same error, how do I add it to the cookbook path?
[2013-07-10 19:29:43 -0400] behemphi: It would be in the same diredtory as your other cookbooks
[2013-07-10 19:30:34 -0400] tplaner: ahh, yeah thats the issue, I didn't download the runit repo
[2013-07-10 19:30:47 -0400] behemphi: rockin!
[2013-07-10 19:30:52 -0400] tplaner: hopefully this works
[2013-07-10 19:30:53 -0400] tplaner: lol
[2013-07-10 19:32:24 -0400] droy: hi all, just curious....do most of you manage starting/stopping your nodes from command line using knife ec2, or do you use something like AWS Cloudformation and bootstrap Chef on the instances on startup?
[2013-07-10 19:32:59 -0400] behemphi: We have a ghetto orchestration layer that wraps knife rackspace
[2013-07-10 19:33:19 -0400] behemphi: so that it handles DNS records, load balancers, sys monitoring, et al
[2013-07-10 19:35:54 -0400] droy: ok
[2013-07-10 19:36:10 -0400] droy: and what do you to monitor the nodes?  Dashboard?
[2013-07-10 19:36:20 -0400] droy: or some homegrown app?
[2013-07-10 19:37:01 -0400] behemphi: We use CopperEgg (I highly recommend)
[2013-07-10 19:37:14 -0400] behemphi: We plan to use Loggly for log analysis
[2013-07-10 19:37:32 -0400] behemphi: as an example of "et al"
[2013-07-10 19:38:00 -0400] droy: Splunk Storm is also a great service
[2013-07-10 19:38:01 -0400] behemphi: CopperEgg also is our probes, but you could think of something like Pingdom too
[2013-07-10 19:38:06 -0400] droy: if you're familiar with splunk
[2013-07-10 19:38:11 -0400] behemphi: really, anything with an API
[2013-07-10 19:38:23 -0400] behemphi: I played with it in depth and even started a cookbook for it
[2013-07-10 19:38:38 -0400] behemphi: but the splunk forwarder is _not_ devops friendly
[2013-07-10 19:38:51 -0400] droy: ah ok
[2013-07-10 19:38:55 -0400] behemphi: and I had a number of performance and uptime issues with the service itself
[2013-07-10 19:39:15 -0400] behemphi: that said, I think if I had some Splunk exp in my past I might have pushed through.  
[2013-07-10 19:39:42 -0400] behemphi: Note on scripts for orchestration:  I wrote them in bash ....
[2013-07-10 19:39:46 -0400] behemphi: learn from my mistake :-)
[2013-07-10 19:39:56 -0400] droy: noted :)
[2013-07-10 19:39:56 -0400] behemphi: I _wish_ I had used Ruby or Python
[2013-07-10 19:40:05 -0400] tplaner: behemphi: is there a way to force all dependent cookbooks to be loaded in 11.x? I'm getting another missing cookbook
[2013-07-10 19:40:06 -0400] droy: we are moving to chef
[2013-07-10 19:40:09 -0400] droy: and i'm leading the charge
[2013-07-10 19:40:23 -0400] droy: so i just need to know what's involved
[2013-07-10 19:40:27 -0400] behemphi: @tplanar Berkshelf is what you want there
[2013-07-10 19:40:42 -0400] behemphi: it comes with a number of opinions and really changes the way you might think about a cookbook
[2013-07-10 19:40:50 -0400] tplaner: is that the goto method of managing configs?
[2013-07-10 19:41:24 -0400] behemphi: Berkshelf is where most in the community seem to be moving.
[2013-07-10 19:41:39 -0400] behemphi: Jamie WInsor gave a keynote at Chefconf, sec
[2013-07-10 19:42:06 -0400] behemphi: Here is a link
[2013-07-10 19:42:07 -0400] behemphi: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYt0E84kYUI
[2013-07-10 19:42:10 -0400] tplaner: cool, I'll investigate it! thanks a lot for your help behemphi 
[2013-07-10 19:42:30 -0400] behemphi: there is some PG13 language so might wanna use headphones
[2013-07-10 19:43:10 -0400] behemphi: @droy, if you have not watched that video I suggest you do to
[2013-07-10 19:43:24 -0400] behemphi: most people coming from the dev side of devops really get it
[2013-07-10 19:44:25 -0400] behemphi: Bryan Berry's Devops anywhere blog is also amazing
[2013-07-10 19:44:50 -0400] behemphi: but the best resource is by far: 
[2013-07-10 19:44:52 -0400] behemphi: http://foodfightshow.org/
[2013-07-10 19:46:20 -0400] droy: thanks behemphi
[2013-07-10 19:48:19 -0400] behemphi: np, happy cheffing
