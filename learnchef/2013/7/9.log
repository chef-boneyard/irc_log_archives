[2013-07-09 17:35:18 -0400] Chris_____: Hi!  I was wondering if someone could help me with an issue.  When I installed the knife-esx plugin for chef, I started to get the following message whenever I run any knife command (it was not there before I installed the plugin).   "D, [2013-07-09T12:30:27.731654 #35069] DEBUG -- : Shutdown completed cleanly" Could someone please help me disable that message?
