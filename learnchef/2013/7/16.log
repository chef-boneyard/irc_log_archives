[2013-07-16 21:40:10 -0400] tplaner: anyone around who I can bounce some general workflow with vagrant/chef off of?
[2013-07-16 21:44:22 -0400] behemphi: shoot
[2013-07-16 21:44:34 -0400] behemphi: < ducks
[2013-07-16 21:44:37 -0400] tplaner: lol
[2013-07-16 21:45:24 -0400] behemphi: disclaimer:  While I have been using chef over 2 years now.  I am just now (last 3 months) using Vagrant, Berkshelf, etc
[2013-07-16 21:47:03 -0400] tplaner: well, currently I'm envisioning an environment which a vagrant config is stored within a repo for a project (this is straight foreword) -- however at the same time, where do you store the chef cookbooks which are called by the vagrant file so that all of the dev's can access them?
[2013-07-16 21:47:30 -0400] tplaner: it doesn't seem logical to also have all of those cookbooks in the repo
[2013-07-16 21:47:31 -0400] behemphi: are you using Berkshelf?
[2013-07-16 21:48:00 -0400] tplaner: I am not currently, but could be
[2013-07-16 21:48:11 -0400] behemphi: So we are
[2013-07-16 21:48:24 -0400] behemphi: Berkshelf wants a repo per cookbook
[2013-07-16 21:48:26 -0400] tplaner: but that leads to my next question, wouldn't all of the dev's then have berkshelf installed?
[2013-07-16 21:48:39 -0400] behemphi: so the Vagrant file that is stored there is specific to testing that cookbook
[2013-07-16 21:48:59 -0400] behemphi: using test kitchen the guest comes up, converges and runs the test
[2013-07-16 21:49:32 -0400] behemphi: I just wrote a ghetto gem to string together "knife cookbook test" , "foodcritic" and "test kitchen" as a "suite"
[2013-07-16 21:49:51 -0400] behemphi: We are going to try and avoid roles
[2013-07-16 21:50:15 -0400] behemphi: Using cookbooks in their place, that repo's vagrant file will converge a full web server, say 
[2013-07-16 21:50:28 -0400] behemphi: Finally we have a "central repo" for our data bags and such
[2013-07-16 21:50:44 -0400] tplaner: interesting
[2013-07-16 21:50:47 -0400] behemphi: that Vagrant file will bring up a full cluster (the thing a customer sees)
[2013-07-16 21:50:57 -0400] behemphi: run all our tests
[2013-07-16 21:51:16 -0400] tplaner: how is that done?
[2013-07-16 21:51:16 -0400] behemphi: and, eventually, the system, integration and functional tests on the full stack itself
[2013-07-16 21:51:24 -0400] behemphi: You mean in the vagrant file?
[2013-07-16 21:51:30 -0400] behemphi: (multiple machines?)
[2013-07-16 21:51:31 -0400] tplaner: like how does the full cluster get brought up?
[2013-07-16 21:51:36 -0400] behemphi: sec
[2013-07-16 21:51:38 -0400] tplaner: through knife?
[2013-07-16 21:51:52 -0400] behemphi: Note the change of tense first
[2013-07-16 21:52:02 -0400] tplaner: oh
[2013-07-16 21:52:03 -0400] behemphi: that is the goal we are currently working tworads
[2013-07-16 21:52:06 -0400] tplaner: you haven't gotten there yet
[2013-07-16 21:52:07 -0400] tplaner: lol
[2013-07-16 21:52:09 -0400] tplaner: yeah
[2013-07-16 21:52:14 -0400] behemphi: but I do have an answer to your question
[2013-07-16 21:52:23 -0400] tplaner: we're looking for more of a continuous integration type setup
[2013-07-16 21:52:30 -0400] behemphi: us too
[2013-07-16 21:52:46 -0400] behemphi: though just getting our feet in the pool there too so to speak
[2013-07-16 21:53:17 -0400] tplaner: yeah
[2013-07-16 21:53:20 -0400] tplaner: this is all very confusing
[2013-07-16 21:53:35 -0400] tplaner: because it seems to mainly be built for managing large setups with tons of servers
[2013-07-16 21:55:03 -0400] behemphi: phooey I cannot find the link my collegue gave me yesterday
[2013-07-16 21:55:20 -0400] behemphi: but you can pretty easily stand up a multiple box cluster with Vagrant
[2013-07-16 21:55:32 -0400] behemphi: Thus build and test automagically
[2013-07-16 21:55:39 -0400] tplaner: yeah
[2013-07-16 21:55:43 -0400] behemphi: Vagrant also as a Rackspace plugin (AWS too)
[2013-07-16 21:56:10 -0400] tplaner: yeah I was fooling with that, but again I'm not really sure how to "deploy" so to speak
[2013-07-16 21:56:10 -0400] behemphi: So we are looking at the RS side since that is where our cloud is to do this final testing bit 
[2013-07-16 21:56:24 -0400] tplaner: we use RS as well
[2013-07-16 21:56:49 -0400] behemphi: We are just getting started with Travis but spider sense is telling us that might be trouble for a full stack test :-)
[2013-07-16 21:57:01 -0400] behemphi: In terms of a full build, your asking a great question.  
[2013-07-16 21:57:21 -0400] behemphi: In today's world I have a really simple script that will setup a full stack
[2013-07-16 21:57:38 -0400] behemphi: I know I can use such a thing in Jenkins
[2013-07-16 21:57:39 -0400] tplaner: yeah
[2013-07-16 21:57:46 -0400] tplaner: it seems too bloated
[2013-07-16 21:57:59 -0400] tplaner: jenkins that is
[2013-07-16 21:58:01 -0400] behemphi: but the CI services like Cloudbees and the like I just don't know
[2013-07-16 21:58:06 -0400] behemphi: here is another twist
[2013-07-16 21:58:19 -0400] behemphi: The full integration will not kick off with each commit or push
[2013-07-16 21:58:30 -0400] behemphi: we will do our unit testing on the appliaiton
[2013-07-16 21:58:37 -0400] behemphi: and some sort of config sub set
[2013-07-16 21:58:46 -0400] tplaner: so only one branch?
[2013-07-16 21:58:46 -0400] behemphi: but also want to do some sort of nightly build
[2013-07-16 21:59:04 -0400] behemphi: that would do more of the full stack testing over the course of about an hour or so
[2013-07-16 21:59:25 -0400] tplaner: what type of app are you creating?
[2013-07-16 21:59:27 -0400] tplaner: lol
[2013-07-16 21:59:47 -0400] tplaner: an hour of tests seems like a lot
[2013-07-16 21:59:51 -0400] behemphi: Right now it is a pretty standard MVC tightly coupled web app.  So that is the lense we are viwing the new problem through
[2013-07-16 22:00:03 -0400] behemphi: It is becoming a loosely coupled group of API servers
[2013-07-16 22:00:15 -0400] tplaner: ha
[2013-07-16 22:00:18 -0400] tplaner: ah*
[2013-07-16 22:00:43 -0400] behemphi: the hour is for building 5 or so cloud machines, running all chef testing, unit tests, functional tests and systems tests
[2013-07-16 22:01:12 -0400] tplaner: building probably takes up a substantial amount of that time
[2013-07-16 22:01:14 -0400] behemphi: We are really only lookng at CI from that perspective right now.  CD is a problem we will crack after learning what we don't know
[2013-07-16 22:01:20 -0400] tplaner: what backend is it?
[2013-07-16 22:01:23 -0400] behemphi: y, right now RS is really slow
[2013-07-16 22:01:33 -0400] behemphi: backend?  you mean data store?
[2013-07-16 22:01:38 -0400] behemphi: MySQL
[2013-07-16 22:01:43 -0400] tplaner: no, like programming language
[2013-07-16 22:01:45 -0400] tplaner: ruby or php?
[2013-07-16 22:01:49 -0400] tplaner: or python i guess
[2013-07-16 22:02:03 -0400] behemphi: python
[2013-07-16 22:02:10 -0400] tplaner: interesting
[2013-07-16 22:02:19 -0400] behemphi: python + django + celery
[2013-07-16 22:02:21 -0400] timewarrior: Hi, everyone.. need some help please.. will take a minute... can someone help please
[2013-07-16 22:02:28 -0400] behemphi: mysql rabbitmq nginx uwsgi
[2013-07-16 22:02:56 -0400] timewarrior: I see things like node[:lein][:user] in the recipe.. which is the best place to define attributes like these..
[2013-07-16 22:03:28 -0400] behemphi: @timewarrior usually in the attributes file of your cookbook
[2013-07-16 22:03:31 -0400] tplaner: behemphi: thanks for chatting / input, I'm off for a little
[2013-07-16 22:03:54 -0400] behemphi: peace tplaner, hope all that rambling made some sense.  Would love some feedback if you think of something
[2013-07-16 22:04:32 -0400] timewarrior: @behemphi - thanks... so if I have a cookbook "foo" with recipe default.rb which is referring to say node[:lein][:user]
[2013-07-16 22:04:41 -0400] timewarrior: where does the attributes file go
[2013-07-16 22:04:46 -0400] timewarrior: in the cookbook
[2013-07-16 22:04:51 -0400] behemphi: if you are in cookbooks/recipes
[2013-07-16 22:05:03 -0400] behemphi: it would go in ../attributes/default.rb
[2013-07-16 22:05:07 -0400] behemphi: in the most basic sense
[2013-07-16 22:05:21 -0400] timewarrior: awesome.. got it..
[2013-07-16 22:05:23 -0400] timewarrior: thanks a lot..
[2013-07-16 22:05:25 -0400] behemphi: chef will read that file and merge your attrs automagically
[2013-07-16 22:05:29 -0400] timewarrior: am new to chef..
[2013-07-16 22:05:33 -0400] behemphi: note the precedence and order 
[2013-07-16 22:05:37 -0400] behemphi: sec
[2013-07-16 22:06:46 -0400] behemphi: Here you are timewarrior http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_attributes.html#attribute-precedence
[2013-07-16 22:07:36 -0400] timewarrior: awesome.. chef can be a bit overwhelming in the start, especially when I am using clojure which isn't that common..
[2013-07-16 22:07:38 -0400] timewarrior: thanks a lot behemphi
[2013-07-16 22:07:56 -0400] behemphi: np, happy cooking :-)
[2013-07-16 22:08:19 -0400] timewarrior: one more question..
[2013-07-16 22:08:32 -0400] timewarrior: suppose if someone is creating a cookbook on github, so that others can use it
[2013-07-16 22:08:49 -0400] timewarrior: in that case attributes shouldn't be checked in right, because everyone might want to customize it
[2013-07-16 22:08:57 -0400] timewarrior: or should it be defined and they can be overridden somewhere else
[2013-07-16 22:09:27 -0400] behemphi: Not true.  Note the link above.  So in the shared cookbook like this one:
[2013-07-16 22:09:28 -0400] behemphi: http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_attributes.html#attribute-precedence
[2013-07-16 22:09:31 -0400] behemphi: sorry
[2013-07-16 22:09:36 -0400] behemphi: this one
[2013-07-16 22:09:36 -0400] timewarrior: ok.. will give it a try
[2013-07-16 22:09:37 -0400] behemphi: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/leiningen
[2013-07-16 22:09:54 -0400] behemphi: the file will have default['foo']['bar']
[2013-07-16 22:09:59 -0400] behemphi: attr file that is
[2013-07-16 22:10:11 -0400] behemphi: in the cookbook your writing to wrap that up (implement it)
[2013-07-16 22:10:16 -0400] timewarrior: this is the old version.. the latest version is here https://github.com/runa-labs/chef-leiningen
[2013-07-16 22:10:36 -0400] behemphi: you would put, for example, override['foo']['bar'] if you wanted to set its value to something different
[2013-07-16 22:10:59 -0400] timewarrior: if you look at https://github.com/runa-labs/chef-leiningen there is no attributes file there
[2013-07-16 22:11:31 -0400] timewarrior: so is the expectation there for people to download the source code, and add their own attributes folder, or to over ride them somewhere else
[2013-07-16 22:12:23 -0400] behemphi: What i am gonna say is called the application cookbook pattern
[2013-07-16 22:12:35 -0400] behemphi: that link you posted is to an "applicaiton cookbook"
[2013-07-16 22:12:46 -0400] behemphi: it is meant to be implemented by a wrapper cookbook
[2013-07-16 22:12:47 -0400] timewarrior: ok
[2013-07-16 22:12:55 -0400] behemphi: so I work at Feedmagnet
[2013-07-16 22:12:59 -0400] behemphi: and I want to install nginx
[2013-07-16 22:13:07 -0400] behemphi: I go get the nginx community cookbook
[2013-07-16 22:13:16 -0400] behemphi: the I write my own fm_nginx cookbook
[2013-07-16 22:13:26 -0400] behemphi: it is almost exclusively an attr file
[2013-07-16 22:13:39 -0400] behemphi: that overrides the settings that control hwo nginx is installed and configured 
[2013-07-16 22:13:59 -0400] behemphi: you can do this by saying in the recipe of the wrapper cookbook:
[2013-07-16 22:14:08 -0400] behemphi: include_recipe 'nginx::default" for example
[2013-07-16 22:14:13 -0400] timewarrior: ok.. so e.g. I can create a oracle_java cookbook, which will be a separate cookbook just for oracle java
[2013-07-16 22:14:27 -0400] behemphi: I am looking at the code of the link you give (not familiar with leiningen)
[2013-07-16 22:14:40 -0400] behemphi: I don't see where this is referencing any attributes
[2013-07-16 22:15:05 -0400] behemphi: so you would include its default recipe in your run_list
[2013-07-16 22:15:08 -0400] timewarrior: https://github.com/runa-labs/chef-leiningen/blob/master/recipes/default.rb
[2013-07-16 22:15:10 -0400] timewarrior: on line 30 and 31
[2013-07-16 22:15:35 -0400] behemphi: Sorry I was looking at the LWRP
[2013-07-16 22:15:35 -0400] timewarrior: because I do not have attributes defined, this cookbook is failing on install 
[2013-07-16 22:15:37 -0400] behemphi: I see it now
[2013-07-16 22:15:41 -0400] behemphi: yep
[2013-07-16 22:15:51 -0400] behemphi: so in your wrapper cookbook you would defin them in the attr file
[2013-07-16 22:16:04 -0400] behemphi: I know it is a big mind bending but here is the reson
[2013-07-16 22:16:37 -0400] behemphi: if runa-labs updates the cookbook with new goodness, you can download and use it with little to know work (i.e. manage upstream changes more easily)
[2013-07-16 22:16:45 -0400] timewarrior: ok.. I should create a wrapper cookbook, referencing this cookbook and set the attributes in my cookbook pl-leiningen
[2013-07-16 22:16:59 -0400] behemphi: if you change the base cookbook then you will have to sort all that out if/when the app cookbook changes
[2013-07-16 22:17:07 -0400] behemphi: yes
[2013-07-16 22:17:07 -0400] timewarrior: yea.. got it..
[2013-07-16 22:17:15 -0400] behemphi: I hope all that helps a bit
[2013-07-16 22:17:33 -0400] timewarrior: one final thing.. this page says usage below https://github.com/runa-labs/chef-leiningen
[2013-07-16 22:17:42 -0400] timewarrior: so basically in the recipe in say pl-leiningen I will use the code to use this
[2013-07-16 22:17:57 -0400] behemphi: actually that is only part of the truth
[2013-07-16 22:18:06 -0400] behemphi: at any point in the chef run you can call that lwrp
[2013-07-16 22:18:28 -0400] behemphi: so if the context makes more sense in a recipe from a cookbook that runs later, you can call it
[2013-07-16 22:18:40 -0400] behemphi: so the answer to your question is "yes and mroe"
[2013-07-16 22:18:44 -0400] behemphi: *more
[2013-07-16 22:19:25 -0400] timewarrior: e.g. on that page the usage seems to be for deploying code, so to use that I can either run a cookbook.. what other ways can I do it
[2013-07-16 22:20:16 -0400] behemphi: right, the default reciep on line 28 is installing leiningen
[2013-07-16 22:20:31 -0400] behemphi: the lwrp described there is doing some sort of deploy as best I can tell
[2013-07-16 22:20:36 -0400] behemphi: so that seems right
[2013-07-16 22:20:51 -0400] behemphi: again, no experience with Lieningen at all 
[2013-07-16 22:20:56 -0400] timewarrior: yea.. so basically if in create my wrapper cookbook and define attributes this will install leiningen
[2013-07-16 22:21:13 -0400] timewarrior: then once installed it can deploy my code, which is what the usage below is describing
[2013-07-16 22:21:29 -0400] behemphi: yes
[2013-07-16 22:21:43 -0400] timewarrior: anyways will figure it out.. you have been really helpful.. really appreciate that...
[2013-07-16 22:21:55 -0400] behemphi: sure, good luck
[2013-07-16 22:22:18 -0400] behemphi: Gotta pay my debts from when I was getting started
[2013-07-16 22:22:20 -0400] behemphi: :-)
[2013-07-16 22:22:44 -0400] timewarrior: thanks.. I am really liking chef till now..
[2013-07-16 22:22:50 -0400] timewarrior: its a bit of work, but will pay off
