[2013-07-03 03:10:54 -0400] Creeves: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Build+A+Rails+Stack
[2013-07-03 03:11:20 -0400] Creeves: this guide uses the application cookbook and configures what recipes are used inside a data bag
[2013-07-03 03:11:34 -0400] Creeves: am I right to believe doing it like that isn't convention anymore?
[2013-07-03 03:12:34 -0400] Creeves: "As of version 2.0.0 of this cookbook, the recipes using configuration stored in the apps data bag are fully deprecated and removed. Version 1.0.4 of this cookbook is the last release where these recipes were available."
