[2013-07-11 01:58:00 -0400] WayneYe: could not find recipe default for cookbook application_ruby
[2013-07-11 01:58:20 -0400] WayneYe: can anyone tell me how come this issue happens again and again?

[2013-07-11 13:51:52 -0400] tplaner: hey, I managed to upgrade from chef 10 to chef 11 and I've been able to get everything working except for 1 of my cookbooks which needs to exec a command on startup, for some reason the command doesn't appear to be getting exec'd, and I'm not sure how to debug
[2013-07-11 22:56:58 -0400] chakatz: I'm trying to find ways to list all the IP addresses on a node
[2013-07-11 22:57:01 -0400] chakatz: This works: chef > iface_name="eth1" => "eth1"  chef > node["network"]["interfaces"][iface_name]["addresses"].keys[1] => "10.28.16.20"
[2013-07-11 22:57:19 -0400] chakatz: And this works: chef > node["network"]["interfaces"].keys => ["lo", "eth0", "eth1"]
[2013-07-11 22:57:36 -0400] chakatz: So why doesn't this work?: chef > node["network"]["interfaces"].keys.each { |iface_name| node["network"]["interfaces"][iface_name]["addresses"].keys[1] } => ["lo", "eth0", "eth1"]
[2013-07-11 22:57:53 -0400] chakatz: I was expecting the last example to return the IP addresses for each interface. Is there a way to get that to work?
