[2013-07-08 00:59:51 -0400] acabrera: Trying to install chef server 
[2013-07-08 00:59:58 -0400] acabrera: Unable to tell what port it's on
[2013-07-08 11:02:41 -0400] algesten_: Hi. In a bash-stanza I try to evalulate out a group id, but it happens too early (the user is not created yet). So I try to get my head around the DelayedEvaluator but struggle to figure out the syntax.
[2013-07-08 11:02:46 -0400] algesten_:     group lazy { Etc.getpwnam(user).gid }
[2013-07-08 11:02:53 -0400] algesten_: This is not right, it seems.
[2013-07-08 11:03:08 -0400] algesten_: [2013-07-08T12:55:14+02:00] FATAL: NoMethodError: undefined method `lazy' for Chef::Resource::Bash
[2013-07-08 13:49:05 -0400] AndrewSmith: Is the chef server down I cant seem to use knife?
[2013-07-08 14:59:03 -0400] rep0st1: so i'm trying to pass a json string to knife bootstrap "{"ohai": {"disabled_plugins": ["passwd"]}}" but it seems i keep running into a parser error. 
[2013-07-08 14:59:06 -0400] rep0st1: is the syntax correct?
[2013-07-08 15:25:16 -0400] pkieszcz1: Hi guys - i'm stuck
[2013-07-08 15:25:22 -0400] pkieszcz1: at mysql database creation 
[2013-07-08 15:25:42 -0400] pkieszcz1: i wanted to write my own cookbook which will configure a few items for me
[2013-07-08 15:26:36 -0400] pkieszcz1: e.g. mysql - i want to create database in my reciepie i got mysql_database 'foo' do;   connection mysql_connection_info   action :create; end
[2013-07-08 15:26:46 -0400] pkieszcz1: and it fails to Cannot find a resource for mysql_database on centos version 6.4
[2013-07-08 15:31:09 -0400] UForgotten: pkieszcz1: you would need a cookbook that has a definition for mysql_database
[2013-07-08 15:31:18 -0400] UForgotten: otherwise chef has no idea what a mysql_database is.
[2013-07-08 15:34:15 -0400] pkieszcz1: ok so should I put
[2013-07-08 15:34:26 -0400] pkieszcz1: something like include_recipie 'database::mysql' ?
[2013-07-08 15:34:33 -0400] pkieszcz1: i got the opscode database cookbook
[2013-07-08 15:35:30 -0400] pkieszcz1: now i got uninitialized constant Chef::Recipe::Opscode
[2013-07-08 15:40:24 -0400] UForgotten: I think you add depends "mysql" to your cookbook's metadata.rb if the cookbook is called mysql
[2013-07-08 15:40:53 -0400] UForgotten: I believe that works for chef-solo, not sure about chef client
