[2013-07-31 11:45:32 -0400] ogny: i couldn't understand what is chef
[2013-07-31 11:45:46 -0400] ogny: could somebody tell me about what is it 
[2013-07-31 11:58:28 -0400] ogny: or can you give a link for getting understand 
[2013-07-31 11:58:50 -0400] ogny: http://docs.opscode.com/
[2013-07-31 11:58:59 -0400] ogny: i found
[2013-07-31 20:50:07 -0400] timothysabat: hi all, I've used chef for a while now, but upgrading to 11 from 10 has confused me a bit.  I'm using chef solo and i'm trying to set attributes inside of a cookbook called "base" to shadow nginx's attributes.  the nginx recipe is not seeing the attributes set in "base"
[2013-07-31 20:50:18 -0400] timothysabat: is there something new going on with chef 11 that did not happen in 10?
[2013-07-31 20:51:56 -0400] nathenharvey: timothysabat: there were some changes to the way attributes work with Chef 11.

[2013-07-31 21:05:24 -0400] timewarrior: Hi all, whats the best way to run a shell command as the deploy user in before_restart while deploying. thanks
[2013-07-31 21:06:58 -0400] timewarrior: I see people using execute, system, bash and run
[2013-07-31 21:07:27 -0400] timewarrior: system is executing as root, so doesn't make sense.. execute is still using the home directory of root so that is problematic too..
[2013-07-31 21:27:53 -0400] timewarrior: anyone here
[2013-07-31 21:33:39 -0400] timewarrior: does anyone know the difference between bash and execute
[2013-07-31 21:36:42 -0400] timewarrior: this channel is useless
[2013-07-31 21:40:38 -0400] nathenharvey: timewarrior: the difference between bash and execute resource is that the bash resource will use the Chef::Resource::Script::Bash provider.  execute will sort out the best provider to use based on the platform
[2013-07-31 21:40:59 -0400] timewarrior: ok.. thanks nathen..
[2013-07-31 21:41:18 -0400] timewarrior: I am trying to run a shell command with unprivileged user while deploy, which is the best way to do that
[2013-07-31 21:42:14 -0400] timewarrior: with execute 'npm install" I am getting Error: EACCES, mkdir '/root/.npm' . apparently its still using the environment variables from the root user and using the $HOME from there
[2013-07-31 21:42:14 -0400] nathenharvey: have you tried setting the user and group attributes in the resource?
[2013-07-31 21:42:38 -0400] timewarrior: this is what I am trying
[2013-07-31 21:42:39 -0400] timewarrior: execute "npm install" do
[2013-07-31 21:42:39 -0400] timewarrior:       cwd DEPLOY_SERVICE_WEB_DIR
[2013-07-31 21:42:40 -0400] timewarrior:       user DEPLOY_USER
[2013-07-31 21:42:41 -0400] timewarrior:       action :run
[2013-07-31 21:42:42 -0400] timewarrior:     end
[2013-07-31 21:46:15 -0400] nathenharvey: hmmm....what about setting a new HOME environment?  environment {"HOME" => "/home/#{DEPLOY_USER}"}
[2013-07-31 21:46:34 -0400] nathenharvey: not sure if that work or if npm install has some option that you could pass to it?
[2013-07-31 21:46:59 -0400] timewarrior: trying this
[2013-07-31 21:49:24 -0400] timewarrior: this is the way to set environment, right
[2013-07-31 21:49:25 -0400] timewarrior: environment({"HOME" => "/home/#{DEPLOY_USER}"})
[2013-07-31 21:50:02 -0400] nathenharvey: environment is an attribute so not sure you need those parentheses
[2013-07-31 21:50:29 -0400] timewarrior: if i put this 
[2013-07-31 21:50:30 -0400] timewarrior:       environment {"HOME" => "/home/#{DEPLOY_USER}"}
[2013-07-31 21:50:36 -0400] timewarrior: I get an error of ruby syntax
[2013-07-31 21:51:22 -0400] nathenharvey: yeah, looking at the docs, it includes the ()
[2013-07-31 21:51:37 -0400] timewarrior: sorry missed this part..
[2013-07-31 21:51:42 -0400] timewarrior: should I use the ()
[2013-07-31 21:51:50 -0400] nathenharvey: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_execute.html - see section "Run a command which requires an environment variable"
[2013-07-31 21:52:15 -0400] timewarrior: yea.. it does seem to require then..
[2013-07-31 21:52:20 -0400] timewarrior: thanks a lot, really appreciate your help
[2013-07-31 21:52:33 -0400] nathenharvey: you bet.  Did that solve the issue?
[2013-07-31 21:52:36 -0400] timewarrior: I thought there was an easier way to do this 
[2013-07-31 21:52:46 -0400] timewarrior: it has moved to the next stage.. node is really weird..
[2013-07-31 21:53:09 -0400] nathenharvey: OK.
[2013-07-31 21:53:10 -0400] timewarrior: basically when install a node package it gets executed as root but take over the .npm on deploy user's directory as root..
[2013-07-31 21:53:19 -0400] timewarrior: and then later on it creates more problems
[2013-07-31 21:57:29 -0400] nathenharvey: hm.  the #chef channel may have better advice for you and/or the mailing list - http://lists.opscode.com
[2013-07-31 22:03:34 -0400] timewarrior: thanks,, trying the chef channel
[2013-07-31 22:06:38 -0400] timothysabat: Hi, I wrote in earlier, and I'm still having trouble.  I wrote up the issue here: https://gist.github.com/tsabat/a8f27ae6ac7d1fd3b6f7  could someone look that over and help me?
[2013-07-31 22:06:59 -0400] timothysabat: been working with Chef for a few years now, but I just made the switch to chef 11
[2013-07-31 22:07:14 -0400] timothysabat: somehow I think my attributes are being overwritten in a weird way
