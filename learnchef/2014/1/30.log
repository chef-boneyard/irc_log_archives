[2014-01-30 15:55:59 -0500] CPS: is there a practical limit to the number of nodes a chef server can manage using open source chef server?
[2014-01-30 16:01:49 -0500] jonlives: CPS: not really - if you run out of grunt on a single server box you can scale out bits of it. anecdotally, we're on well north of 1500 nodes on one server
[2014-01-30 16:09:28 -0500] CPS: anybody have a link to some documentation about chef clients? not the executable, but the clients that you see on the web ui

[2014-01-30 23:41:00 -0500] aneel: hi. is this an appropriate place for asking some (i hope) simple chef-server/berkshelf questions
[2014-01-30 23:41:01 -0500] aneel: ?
[2014-01-30 23:45:42 -0500] resno: aneel: so ive never seen anyone respond here actually
[2014-01-30 23:45:49 -0500] resno: i think asking in #chef is best
[2014-01-30 23:45:53 -0500] aneel: heh. thanks, resno
[2014-01-30 23:46:20 -0500] aneel: oddly, logging in to irc prompted me to discover the answer to my question
[2014-01-30 23:46:26 -0500] resno: heh
[2014-01-30 23:46:41 -0500] aneel: because when i tried to formulate the exact question, it struck me what i was doing wrong
[2014-01-30 23:47:01 -0500] resno: heh, well thats alwawys good
[2014-01-30 23:47:08 -0500] resno: let me ask you, how did you learn chef?
[2014-01-30 23:47:15 -0500] resno: using docs or books or else?
[2014-01-30 23:48:17 -0500] aneel: i watched the webinar for a basic start, and have been doing a lot of web searches to figure out what (little) else i know
[2014-01-30 23:48:43 -0500] aneel: a lot of the docs are hard for a beginner, because they assume a lot of other knowledge
[2014-01-30 23:48:58 -0500] aneel: "berks is just like bundler for cookbooks!"... okay, what's bundler?
[2014-01-30 23:49:18 -0500] resno: ya, requires a small intro to ruby
[2014-01-30 23:50:30 -0500] aneel: thanks for the #chef pointer. i'll try there, if i get stuck again
[2014-01-30 23:52:39 -0500] resno: no problem
