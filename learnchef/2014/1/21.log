[2014-01-21 04:14:29 -0500] FireBeyond: Going through the Chef Fundamentals screencast. Out of curiosity, how does the self hosted Chef Server WebUI compare to the Hosted?
[2014-01-21 10:49:58 -0500] chrisC_: Hello
[2014-01-21 10:50:28 -0500] chrisC_: I'm trying to locate ORGANIZATION-validator.pem and USER.pem according to http://docs.opscode.com/chef/migrate_to_hosted.html
[2014-01-21 10:50:41 -0500] chrisC_: but I can't seem to find these files
[2014-01-21 10:51:03 -0500] chrisC_: where exactly on the Organization view can I find the "ORGANIZATION-validator.pem" file?
[2014-01-21 11:01:15 -0500] chrisC_: Ok, apparently it can be done via 'reset key', the docs are not up to date, I guess
[2014-01-21 11:01:17 -0500] chrisC_: bye
[2014-01-21 13:02:48 -0500] jabberwocky: anyone out there have xperience with the application cookbook? running into this problem with chef 11.8.2

[2014-01-21 13:08:49 -0500] zencha0s: Hello everyone. Anyone feels like helping me cook nginx from source. I successfully cooked it, but when I try to specify modules, I get dependency issues.
[2014-01-21 13:15:35 -0500] zencha0s: I want to cook the "http_gzip_static_module" module. But chef cannot find this cookbook: Cookbook http_gzip_static_module not found. If you're loading http_gzip_static_module from another cookbook, make sure you configure the dependency in your metadata.
[2014-01-21 13:16:51 -0500] zencha0s: Do I need to add: depends "nginx::http_gzip_static_module", to my metadata.rb? I haven't had much luck doing this.
[2014-01-21 13:41:05 -0500] zencha0s: nor does adding this to my metadata.rb work: depends "http_gzip_static_module"
[2014-01-21 13:41:21 -0500] zencha0s: oh the woes... I'll try again tommorrow
[2014-01-21 18:36:22 -0500] CPS_: how do i access files stored in a cookbook's files folder in a recipe?
[2014-01-21 18:37:18 -0500] rep0st: @CPS_: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_cookbook_file.html
[2014-01-21 18:38:05 -0500] CPS_: the actions for that resource aren't what i need
[2014-01-21 18:38:13 -0500] CPS_: i've got an MSI i need to execute
[2014-01-21 18:38:18 -0500] rep0st: oo
[2014-01-21 18:38:23 -0500] CPS_: i need the file path
[2014-01-21 18:38:32 -0500] CPS_: to run msiexec on it
[2014-01-21 18:40:54 -0500] rep0st: hm i'm not very familiar with windows but in linux land. I would use the cookbook_file resource to drop it off locally on the machine and then use an execute resource in order to execute it if it were a perl script or some binary
[2014-01-21 19:16:40 -0500] jabberwocky: anyone out there succesfully using application_python?
[2014-01-21 19:21:07 -0500] CPS_: is there a way to get the path for a recipe's files directory?
[2014-01-21 20:15:38 -0500] CPS_: can someone explain to me what the cookbook_file does and what it's purpose is? i'm having some trouble getting it to do what i want and I want to make sure i'm using the right resource
[2014-01-21 21:57:20 -0500] joe_k: has anyone gotten a Windows 2012R2 machine bootstrapped over WinRM?
