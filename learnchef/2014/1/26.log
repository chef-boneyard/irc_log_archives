[2014-01-26 01:20:09 -0500] cnk_: I worked through the Quick Start material and am now wanting to start in on my own setup - starting with Vagrant. I would prefer to leave the Quick Start stuff alone so I have it for reference. But I am puzzled about how to get a fresh start. If I download another copy of the starter kit, it wants to reset (regenerate) all my keys. I tried to move global info in ~/.chef/knife.rb but then I couldn't talk to the Opscode chef server from

[2014-01-26 01:21:01 -0500] cnk_: So, how do a start again in a new directory without losing my reference code? 
[2014-01-26 04:28:58 -0500] ohmygoshjosh: Hello, I'm attempting to bootstrap a server for the first time.  The node I'm bootstrapping can't authenticate to the server.  When knife shows me the relevant config, some of the settings are wrong, but I don't know how to change the config used by boostrap.  Any ideas?

[2014-01-26 19:44:55 -0500] jblack: Is there a way to tell librarian to use my chef server as a source for one cookbook, much in the way that I can use git as a source? 
[2014-01-26 19:45:13 -0500] jblack: I suppose I could use site-cookbooks/mycookbook and make that a git repo
[2014-01-26 19:52:13 -0500] jblack: Ahh, the documentation isn't quite as clear as it could be. :path can be a standalone source that's not git
