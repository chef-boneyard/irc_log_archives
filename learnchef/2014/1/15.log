[2014-01-15 04:34:59 -0500] drgeb: all of a sudden when running vagrant up it seems to take an awful long time and stuck on [Berkshelf] Using aws (1.0.0) 
[2014-01-15 04:35:10 -0500] drgeb: how can I solve this issue ? 
[2014-01-15 04:37:53 -0500] drgeb: adding config.berkshelf.enabled = true to my Vagrant file to see if this helps
[2014-01-15 05:28:55 -0500] brucelee: yo
[2014-01-15 05:29:02 -0500] brucelee: anyone here want to work together and learn chef
[2014-01-15 05:29:04 -0500] brucelee: get iptables setup and running :p
[2014-01-15 19:01:35 -0500] sbrink: hello?
[2014-01-15 19:02:28 -0500] CPS: people are around, just ask your question
[2014-01-15 19:33:32 -0500] fede_: Hi, I am new to chef and having problem running a ruby script as a service resource because is not using the correct ruby version. Since the service resource doesn't have a way to set env variables how can I specify which ruby version it should use?
[2014-01-15 19:33:55 -0500] fede_: This is the service:
[2014-01-15 19:34:10 -0500] fede_: service "vidgenie_daemon" do
[2014-01-15 19:34:10 -0500] fede_:   start_command "/home/ubuntu/processing/vidgenie-daemon/bin/vidgenie_daemon start"
[2014-01-15 19:34:10 -0500] fede_:   stop_command "/home/ubuntu/processing/vidgenie-daemon/bin/vidgenie_daemon stop"
[2014-01-15 19:34:12 -0500] fede_:   action [ :start ]
[2014-01-15 19:34:14 -0500] fede_: end

[2014-01-15 19:39:22 -0500] pedda: seems as if by the help of rvm exec it's possible to run a script with a certain version of ruby
[2014-01-15 19:40:29 -0500] pedda: further examples: http://rvm.io/set/do
[2014-01-15 19:41:04 -0500] fede_: I am using rbenv, and I have already tried rbenv exec but it says "command not found"
[2014-01-15 19:48:13 -0500] pedda: what about providing the bin path to a certain ruby version ?
[2014-01-15 19:48:46 -0500] pedda: like this: start_command "/home/ubuntu/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p194/bin/ruby /home/ubuntu/processing/vidgenie-daemon/bin/vidgenie_daemon start"
[2014-01-15 19:50:08 -0500] pedda: btw you should rather ask in #ruby or even #rbenv (if this chan exists) for this
[2014-01-15 20:01:43 -0500] fede_: ok, thanks pedda I will try that
[2014-01-15 20:02:05 -0500] pedda: i hope this helps :) 
[2014-01-15 20:02:20 -0500] pedda: i never did code any line of ruby beside vagrant script though :P
[2014-01-15 22:24:42 -0500] rayIntuit: for chef/git/lib/deploy_revision to work with revision, I had to change "fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master" (.git/confog) to fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*. Is this git.rb bug?
[2014-01-15 22:24:51 -0500] rayIntuit: or I am doing it wrong. 
[2014-01-15 22:28:46 -0500] rayIntuit: am I at the right place to ask this question?
