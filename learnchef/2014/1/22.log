[2014-01-22 13:47:39 -0500] CPS_: is there a way to check if a registry key exists using chef on windows?
[2014-01-22 19:49:09 -0500] chip-: CPS: The registry_key resource will let you create, create_if_missing, delete, or delete+all subkeys, but it doesn't have a method for querying the existence of a key.

[2014-01-22 19:49:30 -0500] chip-: You can ensure that a key exists and has a particular value before continuing.

[2014-01-22 21:40:34 -0500] clayb: Does anyone have any advice?
[2014-01-22 22:04:38 -0500] teshian: This is probably a dumb question, but I tired doing node.set["create_admin_user"]["admin_user]=node.run_state["admin_user] and i didn't set any values. I know node.run_state["admin_user] has data because I am saving it to a file on the local disc and it worked
[2014-01-22 22:39:12 -0500] teshian: What is the order that things are executed in a recipe, I am seeing stuff out side a ruby block being executed before stuff in a ruby block, even though the ruby block is before the other stuff
[2014-01-22 22:45:13 -0500] chip-: teshian: Chef has a two-phase run. There's a compile phase and an execute phase. Good explanation here: http://erik.hollensbe.org/2013/03/16/the-chef-resource-run-queue/
[2014-01-22 22:46:29 -0500] teshian: Chip: thanks
