[2014-01-13 01:41:18 -0500] zanshin: I understand there are two schools of thought about roles. Right now I am using them to encapsulate the attribute settings to deploy applications to a Tomcat server. However, there is no clean way to version them. I am strongly considering making a cookbook to deploy the app. What's anyone's thinking on this.
[2014-01-13 11:33:28 -0500] mark_1234: Hi All. I've built my own cookbook for nginx and haproxy. Both are working which is great. Both nginx and haproxy also have config check tools built into themselves. And I don't know the best way to have chef run the config check tool so that before a config goes live, chef can at minimum run the config check tool to have an idea if it should go ahead and restart? So people do this and how might they do this? For example running, "nginx -t"

[2014-01-13 17:02:47 -0500] mattray: CPS: mote people use separate lines

[2014-01-13 21:06:40 -0500] greglu: I saw on the status page ( http://status.opscode.com/ ) that there were issues with the hosted chef search today. Would this explain why I'm not seeing a newly created node on the status page?
