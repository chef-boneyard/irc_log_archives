[2014-01-24 06:33:29 -0500] cnk: I am using a couple of different resources to learn chef. So for now I would like to have a separate node for each tutorial I have worked through. I am using the Opscode hosted chef server and mostly see the nodes I want. But I am a little confused about how to relate them to local directories on my work station. 
[2014-01-24 06:34:00 -0500] cnk: can I / should I have a separate directory for each kind of node?
[2014-01-24 06:34:38 -0500] cnk: the README from the starter kit I downloaded sort of implies I should have one global chef-repo directory in ~/chef-repo 
[2014-01-24 06:34:49 -0500] cnk: and it says the should be under version control
[2014-01-24 06:35:10 -0500] cnk: But I kind of wanted each set of configuration to be in it's own git repo
[2014-01-24 06:42:34 -0500] brucelee: you can do that
[2014-01-24 06:42:40 -0500] brucelee: it doesnt need to be in /chef-repo
[2014-01-24 06:42:51 -0500] brucelee: so when you upload using knife
[2014-01-24 06:42:58 -0500] brucelee: you might have to tell knife where to look for the cookbooks
[2014-01-24 06:43:08 -0500] brucelee: im not sure if it by default searches in ~/chef-repo/cookbooks
[2014-01-24 06:43:18 -0500] brucelee: so now i have a question guys!!!
[2014-01-24 06:43:35 -0500] brucelee: what happens when i use template without declaring a source?
[2014-01-24 06:47:44 -0500] brucelee: yep
[2014-01-24 06:47:46 -0500] brucelee: it is
[2014-01-24 06:47:46 -0500] brucelee: :)
[2014-01-24 07:18:59 -0500] cnk: So reading the first paragraph on http://docs.opscode.com/config_rb_knife.html I thought that if I put some config options in ~/.chef/knife.rb and then said nothing about them in ~/chef-repo/.chef/knife.rb that the options in the first file would be available to me when I did knife cookbook create X from within ~/chef-repo/ But I got the global defaults like YOUR_EMAIL in my metadata.rb
[2014-01-24 07:19:25 -0500] cnk: Are the docs out of date? or am I misreading the precidence
[2014-01-24 07:29:12 -0500] cnk: I really think ~/.chef/knife.rb is not getting read. I get output from 'puts "in knife.rb"' when it is in ~/chef-repo/.chef/knife.rb but nothing when I do something similar in ~/.chef/knife.rb
[2014-01-24 11:13:08 -0500] ragusource: Hey guys is it possible to have multiple not_if guards?
[2014-01-24 11:31:59 -0500] ragusource: Why would this not work: not_if "git branch | grep -q #{node['phalcon']['version']}"
[2014-01-24 11:48:44 -0500] rosstimson: @ragusource Surely you're mixing Chef/Ruby with shell stuff there, how does it know how to interpret that?
[2014-01-24 11:49:58 -0500] ragusource: rosstimson: hey
[2014-01-24 11:50:28 -0500] ragusource: http://pastie.org/8663368
[2014-01-24 11:50:32 -0500] ragusource: I'm trying to do this.
[2014-01-24 11:50:55 -0500] ragusource: I only want the execute block to work, if that command doesn't work.
[2014-01-24 11:51:20 -0500] ragusource: it seems to be translating it fine, i see this in the chef output: not_if "git branch | grep -q 1.2.4"
[2014-01-24 11:55:05 -0500] rosstimson: @ragusource Hmm, if it translates fine then maybe I'm wrong. TBH I have not used not_if before, what error do you end up getting?
[2014-01-24 11:55:25 -0500] ragusource: the command seems to always run
[2014-01-24 11:56:06 -0500] ragusource: for example
[2014-01-24 11:56:10 -0500] ragusource: vagrant@precise64:~/cphalcon$ git branch | grep 1.2.4
[2014-01-24 11:56:11 -0500] ragusource:   v1.2.4
[2014-01-24 11:56:23 -0500] ragusource: that's when i manually run the command on the machine
[2014-01-24 11:56:37 -0500] ragusource: exit code for the command = 0, so success.
[2014-01-24 11:56:50 -0500] ragusource: So from what I understand, the command block should not execute.
[2014-01-24 11:58:19 -0500] ragusource: I'm thinking, maybe the not if is not running in correct dir
[2014-01-24 11:59:48 -0500] rosstimson: @ragusource If it wasn't running in the correct directory I would have thought you'd see some sort of error about there not being a Git repo.
[2014-01-24 12:00:21 -0500] ragusource: the command runs in the correct dir, but i'm not sure about the test.
[2014-01-24 12:00:41 -0500] ragusource: I was correct.
[2014-01-24 12:00:46 -0500] ragusource: I changed it to this: not_if "cd /home/vagrant/cphalcon && git branch | grep #{node['phalcon']['version']}"
[2014-01-24 12:01:03 -0500] ragusource: and that works as intended.
[2014-01-24 12:02:02 -0500] rosstimson: @ragusource Glad it worked. Weird that cwd before the test wasn't taken into account. I'll keep that in mind if I ever need to do something similar.
[2014-01-24 12:02:48 -0500] ragusource: Yep, it's a little gotcha to keep it mind.
[2014-01-24 12:02:57 -0500] ragusource: The cwd applies for the execute block, but not the test.
[2014-01-24 12:03:04 -0500] ragusource: It's understandable, the test could be anything.
[2014-01-24 13:25:54 -0500] k4v: hi, do you guys also use chef for managing windows machines?
[2014-01-24 13:27:18 -0500] ragusource: I've only used it to manage linux machines.
[2014-01-24 18:02:11 -0500] blackice2999: Hi @all and greetings from germany :)
[2014-01-24 18:03:52 -0500] blackice2999: i am relative new on chef and learning currently the various variants to work with cookbooks and roles. My prefered way is by using role-cookbooks and wrapper-cookbooks in combination. Now i had one question. what is common practice for attribute overriding in cookbooks ? using attributes files or use node.override in recipe ?
