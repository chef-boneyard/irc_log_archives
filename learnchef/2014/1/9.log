[2014-01-09 20:44:31 -0500] CPS: what is the syntax to execute a recipe from within another recipe?

[2014-01-09 20:59:15 -0500] pmacklin: I'm having a problem with running npm install from a chef recipe. When I run it from the command line, it finishes fine in under a minute. But when I run it from chef, it hangs.
[2014-01-09 21:00:08 -0500] pmacklin: I redirected the output to a file, and the last thing that comes through is this: 
[2014-01-09 21:00:09 -0500] pmacklin: kerberos@0.0.3 install /home/nodejs/my-app/node_modules/mongoose-q/node_modules/mongoose/node_modules/mongodb/node_modules/kerberos
[2014-01-09 21:00:18 -0500] pmacklin: (node-gyp rebuild 2> builderror.log) || (exit 0)
[2014-01-09 21:00:52 -0500] pmacklin: it will sit like that for 2 hours until chef shellout registers a timeout and it shows a fatal error for that.
[2014-01-09 21:01:41 -0500] pmacklin: am I right in thinking that the || (exit 0) is throwing off the chef shellout provider detecting a successful exit?
[2014-01-09 21:01:47 -0500] pmacklin: and is there anything I can do about it?
[2014-01-09 21:02:55 -0500] pmacklin: ps -e will show npm is still running when chef-client is still running, and interrupting chef-client will cause npm to disappear from the process list.
[2014-01-09 23:25:57 -0500] pmacklin: took my problem to stack overflow, if anyone is feeling expiditious: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21032634/chef-client-hanging-on-npm-install-at-node-gyp-rebuild
