[2014-02-05 10:40:45 -0500] guus_: Hi all - feedback from someone who just completed the #learnchef quickstart: W00t! Apart from that, two minor details:
[2014-02-05 10:41:51 -0500] guus_: 1) on https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/chef-repo/, a line reads: "You should now see two folders: apt and apache2." In reality, there were more folders than those two.
[2014-02-05 10:43:16 -0500] guus_: 2) and just under that, the same page reads: "We leveraged the power of the Community Site to install three cookbooks," <-- didn't I just install two, not three cookbooks?
[2014-02-05 10:44:41 -0500] guus_: C'est a. Excellent 101 course guys!
[2014-02-05 10:51:45 -0500] orbitalmedia: is this the place for a chef n00b?
[2014-02-05 10:54:02 -0500] orbitalmedia: i downloaded the chef starter guide - trying to run "knife client list" but getting "Invalid signature for user or client 'myuser' - anyone know what this might be?
[2014-02-05 10:56:44 -0500] proppen: I sometimes see attribute examples in ruby but I don't fully understand how to convert it to json. For example how would the node.json look for the attribute example for smtp here? https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/fail2ban
[2014-02-05 11:47:48 -0500] proppen: ok, I experemented a bit and added it to http://pastebin.com/5dNhmDWN if some search leads here for someone else
[2014-02-05 11:58:56 -0500] guus_: I am running into an issue while walking through the "Bash -> Chef" Starter Use Case. The Use Case tells me to install three cookbooks in the Chef Server (apache2, mysql, php). The first one was already in, mysql did not give any problems, but trying to install the php cookbook caused an unexpected GIT error: http://pastebin.com/q0PAXBeY
[2014-02-05 12:00:32 -0500] guus_: It should be noted that I'm not familiar with GIT at all, although I am puzzled by the references to files that don't relate at all to the cookbook I'm trying to install. 
[2014-02-05 12:17:53 -0500] proppen: guus_: You've probably added files that is'nt committed. "git status" might give you some clues
[2014-02-05 12:20:58 -0500] guus_: proppen: thanks, I figured as much. What confuses me is that I did not (manually) add or modify any files between the two "knife cookbook site install XYZ" calls. The first one executed without incident, the second one is causing the problem.
[2014-02-05 12:26:11 -0500] proppen: I stopped using knife to download cookbooks but I vaguely remember that I had this kind of problems quite often. Unfortunately I cant remember the remedy but I can recommend Berkshelf. Probably not what you want to hear but anyway :)
[2014-02-05 12:31:18 -0500] guus_: Heh, I'd love to hear anything. Not being familiar with Chef, GIT, Ruby et al does make things quite an adventure. What is this Berkshelf you are speaking of?
[2014-02-05 12:45:12 -0500] proppen: here some good examples http://berkshelf.com/. You define a file named "Berkshelf" which states the cookbooks you want. Since each cookbook should have it's dependencies in its metadata it will also install dependencies

[2014-02-05 17:45:46 -0500] kbarry: Looking for some help with Chef executing a Powershell script.
[2014-02-05 18:17:11 -0500] bean: kbarry: whats your problem with it? :O)
[2014-02-05 18:17:14 -0500] bean: :)*
[2014-02-05 18:23:46 -0500] kbarry: bean: Give me a few minutes, I think i may have been executing faulty logic :)
[2014-02-05 19:27:07 -0500] kbarry: bean:  I can't get to execute any part of my powershell script
[2014-02-05 19:27:14 -0500] bean: hmm
[2014-02-05 19:27:18 -0500] bean: does chef error at all?
[2014-02-05 19:27:28 -0500] bean: can you pastebin the code that calls the script?
[2014-02-05 19:44:59 -0500] kbarry: no errors whatsoever, lemme pastebin it,
[2014-02-05 19:45:02 -0500] kbarry: just a minute
[2014-02-05 19:49:50 -0500] kbarry: bean: http://pastebin.com/6b1CmWww
[2014-02-05 19:52:03 -0500] bean: kbarry: try setting a 'cwd' on the script?
[2014-02-05 19:52:09 -0500] bean: it might not know where you want to put it
[2014-02-05 19:52:23 -0500] kbarry: Its a powershell command.
[2014-02-05 19:52:29 -0500] bean: i'm aware.
[2014-02-05 19:52:43 -0500] bean: nvm
[2014-02-05 19:53:42 -0500] bean: hmm, i'm not sure why it'd be failing. What chef version are you on?
[2014-02-05 19:53:55 -0500] kbarry: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_powershell_script.html
[2014-02-05 19:53:59 -0500] kbarry: hmmm....
[2014-02-05 19:54:03 -0500] kbarry: chef server?
[2014-02-05 19:54:22 -0500] kbarry: (never been asked that question before, and i don't really know how to answer it)
[2014-02-05 19:54:27 -0500] kbarry: (very new to chef)
[2014-02-05 19:57:27 -0500] bean: kbarry: can you show me some sort of log output of the chef that ran?
[2014-02-05 19:57:39 -0500] kbarry: sure

[2014-02-05 20:01:09 -0500] bean: alright
[2014-02-05 20:01:11 -0500] bean: so it says it ran
[2014-02-05 20:01:18 -0500] bean: but you dont see it actually working?
[2014-02-05 20:02:29 -0500] kbarry: correct,
[2014-02-05 20:02:32 -0500] kbarry: it says it ran,
[2014-02-05 20:02:40 -0500] kbarry: but nothing in the script is actually happening,
[2014-02-05 20:03:02 -0500] kbarry: I actually have it writing to a file, just to see if that worked, on the first line of the script
[2014-02-05 20:03:12 -0500] kbarry: but its not working
[2014-02-05 20:04:39 -0500] kbarry: Do you have powershell in any recipes?
[2014-02-05 20:05:41 -0500] kbarry: So, lets start from the beginning here,
[2014-02-05 20:05:52 -0500] kbarry: I created a new recipe in an existing cookbook by
[2014-02-05 20:05:57 -0500] kbarry: creating a newtext file,
[2014-02-05 20:06:10 -0500] kbarry: and renaming it to searchindexmove.rb
[2014-02-05 20:06:32 -0500] kbarry: then copied in sections of a working recipe (the powershell portions, atleast)
[2014-02-05 22:05:23 -0500] sparrow_: here's a question I have, is it possible for a Chef Node to continue chef configuration after reboot?
[2014-02-05 22:51:20 -0500] ndr_y: sparrow_ - You should be able to run chef-client any number of times and get the same result.
[2014-02-05 22:51:26 -0500] ndr_y: So, yes.
