In the example they use an exe hosted my M$. I have the install media, but not sure what executable to ref. Anyone have experience or know who I can ask about this?

[2014-02-08 16:40:43 -0500] hilbertglm: I am new to Chef.  I have installed the community Chef server and got my cookbooks to run on a chef client.   When I added a new role, it wasn't added to the run list.  When I run "knife node show artie", the results do not match what the server has.  I even deleted a role using the web application and it doesn't show there, but it still shows in the "Run List" output from the knife command.  Any idea how to get things back in sync?
[2014-02-08 17:09:37 -0500] hilbertglm: In addition to knife being out-of-sync with the webui, I am getting a 404 when I try to select the node from the "Status" tab.  It is starting to looking like database corruption to me.  Any thoughts?
