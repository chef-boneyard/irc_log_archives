[2014-02-07 16:41:55 -0500] tehnef: I'm newly learning chef over the past couple of months...??I'm pulling back on roles in order to spend time later creating a role cookbook that will be versioned, and I'm noticing for the first time that "knife node show" doesn't show all the cookbooks I'm using in the "Recipes:" field. Is this normal?
[2014-02-07 16:57:24 -0500] jbz: tehnef: is the node *executing* the missing roles?
[2014-02-07 16:57:35 -0500] jbz: Sorry, I mean missing recipes
[2014-02-07 17:24:03 -0500] tehnef: jbz: yeah
[2014-02-07 17:24:47 -0500] tehnef: It appears to be matching now
[2014-02-07 17:25:07 -0500] jbz: hm, weird
[2014-02-07 17:25:33 -0500] tehnef: I guess I should have waited for the chef-server to update itself? I had just completed a chef-client on the node and figured the chef server would have returned correct results within a minute or two
[2014-02-07 17:27:33 -0500] jbz: it's possible the search index hadn't been updated
[2014-02-07 17:27:34 -0500] jbz: maybe?
[2014-02-07 17:31:18 -0500] tehnef: Yeah, I would that that had to be it
[2014-02-07 17:31:52 -0500] tehnef: I have the chef server running on an m1.small, so maybe it was just being slow due to stealing
[2014-02-07 17:33:04 -0500] jbz: quite possible
[2014-02-07 17:38:54 -0500] tehnef: Another question :) ... I've created a databag called users, put a user in it, and set its groups to include sysadmin, but the opscode users cookbook doesn't seem to actually create the user. It creates the group, but not the user.
[2014-02-07 17:39:01 -0500] tehnef: From the readme, it appears that the user should be created as well
[2014-02-07 17:39:29 -0500] tehnef: I'm sure I'm missing something embarrassingly simple
[2014-02-07 17:50:52 -0500] orionNebula: have you looked at chef-client log?
[2014-02-07 17:51:11 -0500] orionNebula: am assuming that action :create is still the default behavior for the users recipe
[2014-02-07 22:51:57 -0500] timtos: I have a basic question. I read the following in the documentation:
[2014-02-07 22:52:07 -0500] timtos: The chef-repo is located on a workstation and should be synchronized with a version control system, such as git. All of the data in the chef-repo should be treated like source code.
[2014-02-07 22:52:44 -0500] timtos: Ok. If I now add roles, environments and so forth with knife everything is clear and easy. 
[2014-02-07 22:52:57 -0500] timtos: I will upload it to the server and commit the changes...
[2014-02-07 22:53:33 -0500] timtos: But if I use the webinterface to do stuff like that... - how to get the new environment or role or whatever in the central repository?
[2014-02-07 22:53:40 -0500] timtos: How to sync that
