[2014-02-21 11:43:01 -0500] mivaho: I did a knife bootstrap on a virtual centos 6 test server on my local PC yesterday. After booting it up again this morning chef-client isn't started had to do it by hand. Did I mis something?
[2014-02-21 11:56:31 -0500] ocholetras: client by default isnt configured as a daemon
[2014-02-21 11:56:36 -0500] ocholetras: you need to run it by hand
[2014-02-21 11:59:46 -0500] mivaho: So if you have a few hundred nodes you need to do them all by hand?
[2014-02-21 12:00:58 -0500] mivaho: And everytime again after a reboot?
[2014-02-21 12:16:06 -0500] mivaho: I see there distro specific files in /opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/chef-11.10.2/distro/ so maybe I my way of bootstraping was wrong
[2014-02-21 12:55:33 -0500] mivaho: Is there an easy "knife bootstrap undo nodename" command?
[2014-02-21 20:43:23 -0500] CPS: is there a way to use template files external to the cookbook?
[2014-02-21 20:52:07 -0500] jbell05: Anyone on to answer a (simple hopfully) question about search & nodes?
[2014-02-21 20:52:30 -0500] jbell05: I'm trying to build a recipe that will auto-cluster NTP nodes on the same IP network...
[2014-02-21 20:52:47 -0500] jbell05: so the nodes auto-tag themselves based on their own IP from within the recipe...
[2014-02-21 20:53:03 -0500] jbell05: and then search for similarly tagged nodes...
[2014-02-21 20:53:10 -0500] jbell05: taggedPeers = search(:node, "tags:#{peersTag}")
[2014-02-21 20:53:32 -0500] jbell05: ^^ This works, but gives me the whole node object.. which is useful, but I can't seem to extract useful information out of it.
[2014-02-21 20:54:01 -0500] jbell05: I know that the nodes have properties (like tags, roles, and most importantly hostname and IP, but I can't seem to get any data out of the node objects that the search returns.
[2014-02-21 20:54:09 -0500] jbell05: ... should I ask this on #chef instead of #learnchef?
[2014-02-21 20:56:18 -0500] hybridpollo: you may have a faster response over in #chef... I'm 2 day n00b to chef so I'm just here lurking while doing howtos and reading articles about it.
[2014-02-21 20:58:21 -0500] CPS: out of curiosity has anyone done full AD setups with single signon using chef before?
