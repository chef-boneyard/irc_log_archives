[2014-02-06 01:10:04 -0500] hamux: hello, can someone please tell me how I can install sinatra gem on a node? I know about rubygems cookbook, but not sure where I need to put the instructions for it to install the gem. I tried passing it as an attribute but no luck
[2014-02-06 01:13:27 -0500] allaire: hamux: gem_package resource
[2014-02-06 01:13:34 -0500] allaire: hamux: docs.opscode.com/resource_gem_package.html
[2014-02-06 01:14:22 -0500] hamux: allaire: thanks. do I put the code in the role?
[2014-02-06 01:14:36 -0500] allaire: hamux: Resources goes into recipes mostly
[2014-02-06 01:14:38 -0500] hamux: or should I create a cookbook and put it in a recipe?
[2014-02-06 01:14:47 -0500] hamux: allaire: alright
[2014-02-06 01:14:59 -0500] hamux: allaire: i'll give it a go, thanks
[2014-02-06 01:15:13 -0500] allaire: Pleasure :)
[2014-02-06 01:22:48 -0500] hamux: allaire: you're a champ
[2014-02-06 12:13:41 -0500] vanchester: Oh, nice channel.
[2014-02-06 12:13:45 -0500] vanchester: Hello everyone. What it can be if chef-client doesn't run by interval? Manually it works. Node "interval" attribute is set.
[2014-02-06 14:31:01 -0500] monvillalon: I need to remount the root partition with cal enabled, does anybody know how?
[2014-02-06 14:45:29 -0500] fveillette: anyone can help me winth windows_task provider?
[2014-02-06 15:02:51 -0500] fveillette: anyone can help me winth windows_task provider?
[2014-02-06 18:27:12 -0500] sigje: Hey folks
[2014-02-06 18:27:27 -0500] sigje: say you have a service, which supports a number of micro services
[2014-02-06 18:27:35 -0500] sigje: the microservice is driven by a config
[2014-02-06 18:28:04 -0500] sigje: if I wanted to be able to hand over that config management to the folks who depend or create the micro service
[2014-02-06 18:28:38 -0500] sigje: what would the best way to handle that? I was imagining cloning off the skeleton private cookbook and modify to have a default template
[2014-02-06 18:29:47 -0500] sigje: I'm not sure if the whole wrapper cookbook is appropriate there though.
[2014-02-06 19:49:52 -0500] timtos: Hello everybody! I have a little problem using chef but it is keeping me busy for a long time now. Trying to install a package I often receive: undefined method `arch' for Chef::Resource::Package. The node I run chef-client on is running centOS.
[2014-02-06 19:50:35 -0500] timtos: Currently I am experiencing this error while trying to install openjdk: Error executing action `install` on resource 'package[java-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64]'
[2014-02-06 19:51:29 -0500] timtos: As I could not find anything current on the web, I wanted to try my luck here! Has anyone experience with this kind of error?
[2014-02-06 19:52:23 -0500] timtos: The command in the cookbook/ recipe: package "java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel.x86_64" 
[2014-02-06 19:53:01 -0500] timtos: That was how I started: Now I am using: 
[2014-02-06 19:53:03 -0500] timtos: package "java-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64" do
[2014-02-06 19:53:09 -0500] timtos:     action [:install]
[2014-02-06 19:53:14 -0500] timtos:     options "--nogpgcheck"
[2014-02-06 19:53:19 -0500] timtos: end
[2014-02-06 19:53:35 -0500] timtos: Does not help unfortunately...
[2014-02-06 19:57:53 -0500] timtos: (executing "yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64" on the console is working as expected.)
[2014-02-06 20:15:56 -0500] timtos: Removing ".x86_64" helps...
[2014-02-06 20:16:59 -0500] timtos: Why is chef failing here?
[2014-02-06 20:20:44 -0500] sigje: Do you often receive the error or always receive the error?
[2014-02-06 20:29:04 -0500] timtos: Always (at least for the packages I tried) when I try to install something with an architecture in the name. If one knows that this is "not allowed" than it is ok but the error message is a little bit misguiding... :)
[2014-02-06 20:29:36 -0500] timtos: If yum can install it, why not chef?
[2014-02-06 20:30:27 -0500] timtos: That's what I don't understand. I read the "package" is not doing much. More or less only a wrapper for the different yums and apt-gets out there.
