[2014-02-25 03:53:33 -0500] norman: all,  I'd already installed the chef-server 11.0.10, and today  I try to install the 11.0.11 , but there are lots of conflict info, such as  file /opt/chef-server/embedded/service/erchef/lib/rabbit_common-0.0.0/ebin/rabbit_misc.beam from install of chef-server-11.0.11-1.el6.x86_64 conflicts with file from package chef-server-11.0.10-1.el6.x86_64
[2014-02-25 03:53:41 -0500] norman: how can I fix them?
[2014-02-25 12:51:32 -0500] artesuave1: hi guys
[2014-02-25 12:51:53 -0500] artesuave1: trying to bootstrap a ubuntu client, but getting the following error
[2014-02-25 12:51:54 -0500] artesuave1: Invalid signature for user or client 'armlock-validator'
[2014-02-25 12:52:31 -0500] artesuave1: I've checked the key and it's the same on the server a on my Chef enterprise account 
[2014-02-25 14:32:29 -0500] micgo: artesuave1: is your armlock.validator.pem file in your .chef directory? also, is it pointing to the correct location in your .chef/knife.rb ?
[2014-02-25 17:13:44 -0500] tc2010: Hmm...does learnchef.com explain changes needed to Chef install to allow remote access to the server?
[2014-02-25 17:14:17 -0500] tc2010: Hello, by the way. :)
[2014-02-25 17:17:41 -0500] tc2010: Checking out learnchef now, but I'm having issues logging into Chef  webui externally (not via localhost).  I can get to the login screen, I enter password, but am redirected back to login screen.  If I go through localhost, it works fine.  So, I'm missing a config somewhere. Any help would be appreciated.
[2014-02-25 17:20:20 -0500] tvanhens: hi, does anyone know of a resource/tutorial/blog I could read/work through that I could pick up the basics of TDD/BDD for setting up chef-provisioned vagrant machines with custom cookbooks
[2014-02-25 19:49:03 -0500] CPS: when chef runs, it downloads everything to C:\chef\cache\ right
[2014-02-25 19:49:08 -0500] CPS:  nowhere else?
[2014-02-25 19:51:15 -0500] CPS: mmzyk: is there somewhere to file feature requests?
[2014-02-25 19:52:36 -0500] medieval1: correct...just to the cache dir
[2014-02-25 19:52:40 -0500] mmzyk: You can always open a ticket at tickets.opscode.com
[2014-02-25 20:15:44 -0500] trev_: So I'm trying to build a vagrant base box with chef on it.  Do I need to have a chef server?  And if I don't use one, what do I do about the validation.pem file?
[2014-02-25 20:25:16 -0500] micgo: trev_: have you seen the bento project? You can use the veewee definitions to build base boxes with chef pre-installed -> https://github.com/opscode/bento
[2014-02-25 20:26:32 -0500] trev_: ah cool, that might be what I need.
[2014-02-25 20:26:36 -0500] micgo: also, if you don't want to use a chef server on your vagrant VMs, you can try out chef-solo -> http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/chef_solo.html
[2014-02-25 20:27:23 -0500] trev_: right, but I keep getting an error about not having a validation.pem file.
[2014-02-25 20:29:20 -0500] micgo: is this a box that already exists that you are provisioning against? Or are you still in the "making a box" phase?
[2014-02-25 20:30:36 -0500] trev_: I was downloading an Ubuntu raring box, and I had something in the vagrant file to install chef using omnibus
[2014-02-25 20:32:20 -0500] micgo: ahhh I would suggest using the bento definitions then You can also just download one of the boxes we pre-build that are linked in the README file also check out vagrant-omnibus so you never have to worry about installing chef again -> https://github.com/schisamo/vagrant-omnibus
