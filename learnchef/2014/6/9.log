[2014-06-09 01:38:52 -0400] fbrier: I have the open source chef server installed, along with a workstation and several nodes.  I set up a lamp_server role as described in the Instant Chef book and assigned it to both Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Fedora 20 nodes.  I've run into a number of issues, but the latest one with Fedora20 was raised here in the IRC: http://community.opscode.com/chat/learnchef/2013-05-18
[2014-06-09 01:40:33 -0400] fbrier: The other person experienced this error on Centos 6.4.  Mine occurred on Fedora 20.  Aren't cookbooks supposed to work on distros that the chef-client(s) are available on?
