[2014-06-04 08:29:32 -0400] bursy_: Hi, I've got a learners question. I'm using Chef but have only managed a few basic wrapper cookbooks using chef-solo, vagrant and berkshelf. I'm now trying to write a cookbook that has dependencies on application and application_java to deploy a WAR file. But each time I run it, I get "uninitialized constant Chef::Resource::ApplicationBase". Now looking at what Berkshelf is doing when it resolves it's dependancies, it's using an 
[2014-06-04 08:30:16 -0400] bursy_: it's using an old version of application_java - "Using application_java (1.1.0)". The latest is 3.0.0, and I can indeed see references to ApplicationBase in the old version but not the new. Can anyone tell me why Berfshelf is making this decision? I've tried forcing the version to 3.0.0 in metadata.rb but then I get a different error. Thanks.

[2014-06-04 08:40:45 -0400] ocholetras: ?
[2014-06-04 08:41:17 -0400] ocholetras: 1st check that is a cookbook version problem. 
[2014-06-04 08:41:41 -0400] bursy_: Thanks I'll try that now.

[2014-06-04 09:48:45 -0400] bosphorus: I am new to chef and I am trying to figure out how it works
[2014-06-04 09:50:11 -0400] bosphorus: I wonder how do nodes know about each other
[2014-06-04 09:50:50 -0400] bosphorus: for example if I have 2 app servers (app1 and app2) and a load balancer lb1
[2014-06-04 09:51:11 -0400] bosphorus: how is the load balancer going to know if I run 3rd app server (app3)
[2014-06-04 10:17:05 -0400] bursy_: Hey ocholetras, I tried the berks update and (after resolving an SSL error) it works! thanks, been banging my head against that for ages...
[2014-06-04 10:24:42 -0400] ocholetras: bursy_: np!
