[2014-06-03 13:48:17 -0400] george_m__: hi guys...how can I deploy/install interactive apps with Chef?
[2014-06-03 20:10:40 -0400] Seedling: is there any way to have the node attributes in hosted-chef override the environment and cookbook attributes?
[2014-06-03 20:17:43 -0400] mattray: Seedling: what are you trying to do? override attributes in your Environment should be sufficient, or is there something else?
[2014-06-03 20:40:47 -0400] Seedling: Hi Mattray
[2014-06-03 20:41:51 -0400] Seedling: I'm trying to have a set of defaults bound to the environment but allow users with their own nodes within the env to overide them. If I use node.default in the cookbook attributes the JSON doesn't populate in the attributes for the node, if I used node.normal they do but then they aren't respected if they are changed there.
