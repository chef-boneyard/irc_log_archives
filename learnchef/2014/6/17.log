[2014-06-17 07:15:57 -0400] antu: Hi ! I am trying to configure Chef client-server setup. Commands like 'Knife client list' or 'Knife user list'  works fine. But I am getting 'Connection Refused' error while uploading the cookbook  Any idea on what could be wrong ? Thanks..
[2014-06-17 13:20:05 -0400] orweinberger: I've provisioned a server using a knife plugin for ec2 and added some recipes to the 'run-list'. The server is up and the receipes were installed correctly. Now I would like to install some more recipes on that already-provisioned server. How can I do that?
[2014-06-17 14:00:52 -0400] teshian: I am banging my head against the wall with installshield. I already have a chef install working for the QA and lab machines, but I need something like installshield for end user on premise installs for customers. Are there any good resources on the best way to do something like a 1 click install using chef-solo chef-zero, that coiuld replicate an install shield installer?
[2014-06-17 14:07:22 -0400] jonlives: teshian: you might want to check out the windows_package resource in https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/windows
[2014-06-17 14:08:16 -0400] teshian: @jonlives I am already using the windows cookbook, was there something specific in there about producing something like a .exe installer?
[2014-06-17 14:09:03 -0400] jonlives: teshian: not producing the installer no, just how to use them with chef
[2014-06-17 14:09:08 -0400] jonlives: ie, to use an existing installer.
[2014-06-17 14:09:40 -0400] jonlives: teshian: oh! I think I misunderstood what you were asking - you want to produce an installer for the chef run?
[2014-06-17 14:09:45 -0400] teshian: thanks, I have that working for a bunch of dependacies like the Visual C++ runtime
[2014-06-17 14:09:49 -0400] jonlives: you might end up having to produce a VM image or something
[2014-06-17 14:11:28 -0400] teshian: my install is overly complex, windows host, with a .net application then 2 VMs that needs to install 2 linux VMs for storage and database
[2014-06-17 14:11:40 -0400] teshian: Not my choice, but trying to make it work
[2014-06-17 19:28:45 -0400] betina: Hi all... hope someone can guide me to find the solution of my problem.... I need to process all files under a specific folder, search for a string and replace it with another string... What I dont know is how can I add a ruby block in my recipe to process all files individually?
[2014-06-17 19:29:10 -0400] teshian: give me a second
[2014-06-17 19:31:26 -0400] teshian: You could do something like
[2014-06-17 19:31:30 -0400] teshian: %w[ access 
[2014-06-17 19:31:30 -0400] teshian: aliases 
[2014-06-17 19:31:32 -0400] teshian: client_access 
[2014-06-17 19:31:33 -0400] teshian: helo_access 
[2014-06-17 19:31:35 -0400] teshian: recipient_access 
[2014-06-17 19:31:36 -0400] teshian: sasl_passwd
[2014-06-17 19:31:38 -0400] teshian: transport 
[2014-06-17 19:31:39 -0400] teshian: virtual
[2014-06-17 19:31:41 -0400] teshian: vmailbox
[2014-06-17 19:31:42 -0400] teshian: ].each do |file|
[2014-06-17 19:31:44 -0400] teshian:   cookbook_file "/etc/postfix/#{file}" do
[2014-06-17 19:31:45 -0400] teshian:     source file
[2014-06-17 19:31:47 -0400] teshian:     owner "root"
[2014-06-17 19:31:48 -0400] teshian:     group "root"
[2014-06-17 19:31:50 -0400] teshian:     mode 00644
[2014-06-17 19:31:51 -0400] teshian:     notifies :restart, "service[postfix]", :delayed
[2014-06-17 19:31:52 -0400] teshian:   end
[2014-06-17 19:31:53 -0400] teshian: end
[2014-06-17 19:31:53 -0400] teshian: and list the files in the %w, 
[2014-06-17 19:32:25 -0400] teshian:  oops sorry i have to run, I have a meeting
[2014-06-17 19:33:01 -0400] binamov: so this codeblock from teshian will just drop the files 
[2014-06-17 19:35:19 -0400] binamov: you can probably do what you need with this https://github.com/someara/line-cookbook betina 
[2014-06-17 19:40:53 -0400] betina: perfect, I will take a look at it! Thanks!
[2014-06-17 19:41:06 -0400] binamov: if you get that list of files you can use the .each method over the list and iterate over the replace_or_add resource of the line-cookbook, similar to what teshian suggested
[2014-06-17 19:41:11 -0400] binamov: betina
[2014-06-17 19:51:26 -0400] someara: I'd recommend managing entire files with template resources over line editing btw
[2014-06-17 19:53:14 -0400] binamov: do you have an alert for someara someara :) ?
[2014-06-17 19:53:33 -0400] someara: irccloud has it built in =)
[2014-06-17 19:56:57 -0400] binamov: but yeah betina best to manage the entire file
[2014-06-17 19:58:12 -0400] betina: thanks, actually, I wan to disable some .repo files that come with my redhat image
[2014-06-17 19:58:18 -0400] betina: *I want
[2014-06-17 19:59:39 -0400] betina: so my idea was to process all files under /etc/yum.repo.d/ and replace the "enable=1" to "enable=0"
[2014-06-17 19:59:52 -0400] binamov: ah, hold on
[2014-06-17 20:00:23 -0400] binamov: use this instead https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/yum betina 
[2014-06-17 20:01:57 -0400] binamov: yum_repository 'CentOS-Media' do
[2014-06-17 20:01:58 -0400] binamov:   action :delete
[2014-06-17 20:01:59 -0400] binamov: end
[2014-06-17 20:02:55 -0400] betina: ok let me try it
