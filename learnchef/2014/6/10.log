[2014-06-10 11:05:07 -0400] djlee: Hi all, in Vagrant i use "chef.add_recipe" for each piece of software/package i need such as php, nginx, mongodb. So each one is an individual recipe. In opsworks it seems to support a CSV of recipe names which mimics this kind of setup. However, nearly all the tutorials for opsworks on google, seem to say that you should only place recipe in opsworks setup which im presuming means that they "include_recipe" for all 
[2014-06-10 11:05:08 -0400] djlee: their packages, from a sort of master proxy recipe. Should i just ignore them and configure opsworks with multiple recipes like i do the vagrantfile

[2014-06-10 21:07:10 -0400] dcrosta: hi all. I have an execute resource with a not_if that is a shell command. the shell command returns 1 (non-true) when i want the execute to run, and 0 when i want it not to run (I believe this is the sense that chef imparts to not_if with a shell cmd). however, when i try to run it, it's not running my execute regardless of the exit status of the not_if
[2014-06-10 21:07:18 -0400] dcrosta: (i can put this all in a paste somewhere if it will help)
[2014-06-10 21:07:39 -0400] dcrosta: (and this is Chef 10.x, in case that matters)
