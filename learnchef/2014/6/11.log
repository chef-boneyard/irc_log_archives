[2014-06-11 03:43:54 -0400] jimmyhillis: hey, anyone around to answer a question or two for me? I've been using chef for a few months and I have one question I can't seem to find the answer for regarding multiple apps/sites on a single node
[2014-06-11 13:58:36 -0400] HardFu: hi there, I have a question
[2014-06-11 13:59:15 -0400] HardFu: I'd like to copy a static file into a particular folder (/etc/rsyslog.d) with chef
[2014-06-11 13:59:23 -0400] HardFu: do I need a whole cookbook for that?
[2014-06-11 13:59:39 -0400] HardFu: the file only has one line which is static/non-configurable
[2014-06-11 14:00:04 -0400] HardFu: and afterwards, chef needs to restart rsyslog
[2014-06-11 23:18:09 -0400] mburns: I'm writing an LWRP that creates a service entry & json config file (a node attributes Hash that gets exported to disk as json). Other cookbhooks can call one of two providers (add_backend, add_context) of this LWRP to insert some json blob into the larger config json.
[2014-06-11 23:19:54 -0400] mburns: I'm not sure how best to handle any of 3 providers updating the data structure and *then* writing out the config && reloading the service. Do each of the 3 provider's actions need to have that logic, or can it be consolidated?
[2014-06-11 23:20:28 -0400] mburns: finding good LWRPs to use as an example is tricky :-/
[2014-06-11 23:21:07 -0400] mburns: It's for the Bud TLS terminator, if anyone is curious. https://github.com/indutny/bud
