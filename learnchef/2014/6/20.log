[2014-06-20 14:51:56 -0400] yebyen: Hey, I did some playing with chef-solo and I'm looking at kitchen... I'm trying to figure out, is there a "rubygems.org" or "bundler" equivalent whose job is to resolve and install dependencies?
[2014-06-20 14:52:26 -0400] yebyen: I noticed that a new github project for chef cookbook does put cookbooks/ into .gitignore
[2014-06-20 14:52:46 -0400] yebyen: and kind of assumed there must be some system for that, or is it chef-server I'm thinking of
[2014-06-20 16:29:33 -0400] jwele: How can I tell chef to install all the dependencies of a cookbook? When I provision a vagrant box using chef 10.x It seems to pull the dependencies automatically but when I use chef 11.x it seems to not install the dependencies automatically
[2014-06-20 17:01:44 -0400] yebyen: jwele that is the same question I asked thiss morning
[2014-06-20 17:01:52 -0400] yebyen: except I never used chef 10.x
[2014-06-20 17:02:10 -0400] yebyen: I just kind of assumed there was a tool to install dependencies automatically
[2014-06-20 17:02:25 -0400] yebyen: did you find an answer?  is it a specific tool
[2014-06-20 17:23:19 -0400] jwele: yebyen: I was recommended to use berkshelf but I don't understand berkshelf enough/can't find enough examples to get it working 
[2014-06-20 17:24:27 -0400] jwele: yebyen: All the docs I read on berkshelf seem to be talking about using berkshelf to create cookbooks but I just want to auto install the dependencies.
