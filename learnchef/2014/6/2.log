[2014-06-02 11:14:21 -0400] nachoes: Is it possible to have chef only execute tasks on clients in a given timeperiod?
[2014-06-02 16:53:55 -0400] grubernaut: Running `knife configure initial` connecting to opensource chef-server to generate a knife.rb config file. Yet `knife configure ` attempts to generate a new user, of which I already have a user and already have the private key for that user. Any ideas? 
[2014-06-02 18:42:51 -0400] grubernaut: Running Open-Source ChefServer, uploaded a cookbook via knife to my chef-server. Added the cookbooks recipe to my node's run-list. Then running the cookbook throws this error: "The following cookbooks are required by the client but don't exist on the server:" Should I upload the cookbook that is required, or is there a way to resolve dependencies of cookbooks? 
[2014-06-02 18:58:26 -0400] fdrolet: does your cookbook depend on other cookbooks?
[2014-06-02 18:59:11 -0400] fdrolet: when you install a community cookbook with site install, for example, knife cookbook site install chef-client, all dependencies are installed
[2014-06-02 18:59:18 -0400] fdrolet: then knife cookbook upload -a
[2014-06-02 19:11:58 -0400] grubernaut: yes, sorry for delay @fdrolet
[2014-06-02 19:12:14 -0400] grubernaut: it depends on apache and one other cookbook
[2014-06-02 19:13:26 -0400] fdrolet: so did you "knife cookbook site install apache2" in your repo?
[2014-06-02 19:13:51 -0400] grubernaut: no I didn't. I just have my written cookbook inside of my chef-repo
[2014-06-02 19:16:47 -0400] grubernaut: @fdrolet When I run "knife cookbook upload -a" now it throws that there are missing cookbooks which are currently being uploaded and cannot be found on the server
[2014-06-02 19:17:06 -0400] fdrolet: I don't know any way to automatically install dependencies from your own cookbooks...
[2014-06-02 19:17:46 -0400] grubernaut: So I have to manually download each cookbook into my chef-repo in order to use cookbook dependencies that I have stated? 
[2014-06-02 19:18:02 -0400] fdrolet: I think so, yes
[2014-06-02 19:18:04 -0400] grubernaut: manually -> "knife cookbook site install apache2"
[2014-06-02 19:18:09 -0400] fdrolet: yup
[2014-06-02 19:18:51 -0400] fdrolet: if these community cookbooks have dependencies though, those will be installed automatically
[2014-06-02 19:18:57 -0400] grubernaut: darn.. Would be nice if knife could hook into berkshelf to resolve cookbook dependencies 
[2014-06-02 19:19:22 -0400] fdrolet: maybe it could be done, haven't digged into berkshelf yet
[2014-06-02 19:24:48 -0400] fdrolet: @grubernaut still have problems with knife configure (your previous question)?
[2014-06-02 19:25:51 -0400] grubernaut: @fdrolet na, I was able to solve that with a new private key generator. But thank you. :) 
[2014-06-02 19:26:02 -0400] grubernaut: I'm looking through berkshelf now and it seems possible. 
[2014-06-02 19:26:16 -0400] fdrolet: cool
[2014-06-02 19:27:17 -0400] fdrolet: I'd like to hear how it is done if you get to it
[2014-06-02 19:29:38 -0400] grubernaut: @fdrolet I'll let you know if I ever get it figured out
[2014-06-02 19:30:52 -0400] fdrolet: @grubernaut thx!
[2014-06-02 19:31:05 -0400] grubernaut: NP! :) 
[2014-06-02 19:32:15 -0400] grubernaut: got it :) 
[2014-06-02 19:32:42 -0400] grubernaut: @fdrolet do you have berkshelf installed in your cookbook? And dependencies added to metadata.rb? 
[2014-06-02 19:39:19 -0400] fdrolet: @grubernaut no i did not, just read http://berkshelf.com/, seems pretty simple
[2014-06-02 19:39:35 -0400] fdrolet: haven't installed chef-DK yet
[2014-06-02 19:39:46 -0400] fdrolet: *i just read
[2014-06-02 19:40:46 -0400] grubernaut: yeah, it's not too bad. Chef-dk really helped me out a lot. It's kind of labeled as a "beginner tool" I guess, but I like it that it keeps all my chef binaries in a "bottle" 
[2014-06-02 19:42:16 -0400] grubernaut: But with berkshelf, I just had to edit `.berkshelf/config.json` correctly, then run berks upload from my cookbook directory and it resolved all dependencies for that cookbook. 
[2014-06-02 19:42:22 -0400] grubernaut: :winning: 
[2014-06-02 19:42:45 -0400] fdrolet: nice, I'll check this out
[2014-06-02 19:45:20 -0400] fdrolet: apparently you can also have the "metadata" keyword in the cookbooks Berksfile and it will get dependencies info from metadata.rb
[2014-06-02 19:49:56 -0400] grubernaut: yupp. that's how I have mine setup. As metadata.rb looks a whole lot nicer. 
[2014-06-02 19:50:43 -0400] grubernaut: and if you do `berks cookbook new_cookbook` it will create a much nicer cookbook skeleton for test-kitchen. Which will allow for easier test integrations 
[2014-06-02 19:57:52 -0400] fdrolet: I'm just starting to get a hang of all the different tools that can be used... not so simple but seems worth the while
[2014-06-02 20:01:59 -0400] grubernaut: it definitely does seem worth the while. Which is why I hopped onto irc in the first place. Usually the community has a better way of doing things other than me banging my head on a wall for hours. 
[2014-06-02 20:38:53 -0400] eyeball_: hey guys noob here. i get ERROR: OpenSSL::PKey::RSAError: private key needed. every time i run a knife command. 
[2014-06-02 20:41:31 -0400] grubernaut: @eyeball_ it's because you don't have a private key to authenticate to your chef-server. I just had this same issue as well. Do you have a .chef directory inside of your chef-repo? 
[2014-06-02 20:41:42 -0400] eyeball_: yes
[2014-06-02 20:42:12 -0400] eyeball_: i have my validator.pem and chef-user.pem certs in there.. 
[2014-06-02 20:42:16 -0400] grubernaut: and inside of the .chef directory you have knife.rb, admin.pem, chef-validator.pem, and <node>.pem? 
[2014-06-02 20:42:36 -0400] grubernaut: and you have those pem files explicitly declared in your knife.rb file? 
[2014-06-02 20:42:48 -0400] eyeball_: well not the node.pem
[2014-06-02 20:42:57 -0400] grubernaut: well, like eyeball__.pem
[2014-06-02 20:43:11 -0400] grubernaut: or whatever the name of the node you are connecting to the chef-server with. 
[2014-06-02 20:43:30 -0400] grubernaut: And you have the paths correctly specified in knife.rb
[2014-06-02 20:44:16 -0400] eyeball_: i follow. i'm actually just setting things up for the first time. I got OSS chef up and running on a box. i'm trying to configure my local workstation. I don't actually have any nodes running yet. I was just running knife client list
[2014-06-02 20:44:56 -0400] grubernaut: right, but your local workstation is "labeled" as a node. 
[2014-06-02 20:45:03 -0400] grubernaut: I believe that's correct. 
[2014-06-02 20:45:48 -0400] grubernaut: I have "<username>.pem" in my .chef directory with my user's private key inside that file. 
[2014-06-02 20:46:04 -0400] eyeball_: here's a gist of my knife.rb
[2014-06-02 20:46:06 -0400] eyeball_: https://gist.github.com/rjonesaereo/f7311a5247de4f1be512
[2014-06-02 20:47:30 -0400] grubernaut: cool, and knife.rb is inside of your .chef directory? And your pem files are specified with the correct paths in the knife.rb file? 
[2014-06-02 20:48:10 -0400] eyeball_: yes it's inside chef-repo/.chef/
[2014-06-02 20:48:34 -0400] grubernaut: the pem files or knife.rb? 
[2014-06-02 20:49:21 -0400] eyeball_: knife.rb..  there's currently nothing else in that directory 
[2014-06-02 20:49:25 -0400] grubernaut: now the tricky part. When you created the rjones user, did you copy the private key and add that key into chef-rjones.pem without a new line at the end of the file? 
[2014-06-02 20:49:55 -0400] eyeball_: hmm good question
[2014-06-02 20:49:56 -0400] eyeball_: looking
[2014-06-02 20:50:30 -0400] grubernaut: The private key, not the public one. Should be a whole lot longer than the public key. If not, you can always click "Edit" on your user, and generate a new private key to grab. 
[2014-06-02 20:51:38 -0400] eyeball_: i'm looking at it in vim and i don't see an extra line
[2014-06-02 20:51:56 -0400] eyeball_: ah
[2014-06-02 20:51:57 -0400] eyeball_: i see
[2014-06-02 20:52:02 -0400] eyeball_: that's the public key
[2014-06-02 20:52:31 -0400] grubernaut: :) there ya go. 
[2014-06-02 20:52:57 -0400] grubernaut: If you lost your private key, you can generate a new private key in the "Edit" section
[2014-06-02 20:53:39 -0400] eyeball_: nice
[2014-06-02 20:53:40 -0400] eyeball_: thanks
[2014-06-02 20:54:55 -0400] grubernaut: No prob :)
