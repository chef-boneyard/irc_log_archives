[2014-06-26 02:08:26 -0400] echostyle: I want to stay DRY and make sure i'm properly  building/recording my infrastructure scaffolding... Though i'm not sure which tool to start with. (vagrant, chef, berfsfile,etc) Is there a global workflow/prcoess
[2014-06-26 02:08:39 -0400] echostyle: or should i just jump straight into chef
[2014-06-26 10:58:23 -0400] jyoti_bhanot_: Hi 
[2014-06-26 10:58:34 -0400] jyoti_bhanot_: I have just started using chef 
[2014-06-26 10:58:45 -0400] jyoti_bhanot_: and i am stuck
[2014-06-26 10:59:16 -0400] jyoti_bhanot_: I want to set the hostname 
[2014-06-26 10:59:22 -0400] jyoti_bhanot_: of an ec2 instance 
[2014-06-26 10:59:27 -0400] jyoti_bhanot_: how to do that using chef 
[2014-06-26 12:32:26 -0400] binamov: echostyle i find that it's easier to start with just chef, then build on top once i understand how core chef works
[2014-06-26 12:35:05 -0400] echostyle: thanks for the response
[2014-06-26 14:01:23 -0400] philax: hey binamov thanks for asking!  unfortunately not :(
[2014-06-26 14:01:48 -0400] binamov: that's cool. where's your node btw? local? ec2? philax 
[2014-06-26 14:05:57 -0400] philax: the workstation is a local virtualbox.  the node is a vm on my local network
[2014-06-26 14:25:08 -0400] binamov: alright, philax telnet node 5985 works? can you show us the bootstrap command you're using? keep mentioning my name to get my attention
[2014-06-26 14:29:39 -0400] philax: yeah binamov, telnet to the node on 5985 connects.  i've tried a few variations.  right now I just tried knife bootstrap windows winrm -N atestnode IPHERE -r 'role[windows]' -x DOMAIN\USER -P passwordhere --bootstrap-version=11.10.04
[2014-06-26 14:30:18 -0400] binamov: and where does it get stuck philax ?
[2014-06-26 14:30:42 -0400] philax: it simply says "Waiting for remote response before bootstrap" and then waits ...
[2014-06-26 14:30:59 -0400] philax: it never seems to timeout, it simply waits.  I have to Ctrl+C to kill it
[2014-06-26 14:31:25 -0400] binamov: r u chefdk or omnibus philax ?
[2014-06-26 14:31:39 -0400] philax: I installed chef via omnibus, then installed the chefdk
[2014-06-26 14:32:03 -0400] binamov: so you have both :) ?
[2014-06-26 14:32:30 -0400] philax: uhh... yes? :)  did I misunderstand?  I thought chefdk was in addition to the chef omnibus
[2014-06-26 14:33:03 -0400] binamov: chefdk has all the omnibus things in it
[2014-06-26 14:33:42 -0400] philax: oh!  hmm...  are you thinking this could this be causing a conflict?
[2014-06-26 14:33:42 -0400] binamov: try this: /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem list knife-windows and then try this: chef gem list knife-windows
[2014-06-26 14:34:26 -0400] philax: both return local gem knife-windows 0.6.0
[2014-06-26 14:35:50 -0400] binamov: run the bootstrap command with -VV and share with us in a gist/pastebin philax ?
[2014-06-26 14:35:58 -0400] philax: gladly!
[2014-06-26 14:36:08 -0400] binamov: shout my name when ready
[2014-06-26 15:31:14 -0400] philax: hey binamov, I created a gist including the previous commands showing both gem list responses as well.  https://gist.github.com/philax/b8f340aa2f7ef9d2cec6 
[2014-06-26 17:32:32 -0400] binamov: philax "knife bootstrap windows winrm --help" suggests having IP/FQDN as the first argument, can you reformat your command and try again? update the gist and shout my name when done?
[2014-06-26 17:50:35 -0400] philax: Hey binamov!  I've tried that before as well with the same behavior.  see https://gist.github.com/philax/4da4e9ad44d31955de5a for the new test and output
[2014-06-26 17:54:32 -0400] philax: updated the original gist as well
[2014-06-26 18:39:35 -0400] binamov: philax it's the credentials you're passing with -x and -P, they must be wrong... from our end I'll make sure that the error message is unambiguous about it
[2014-06-26 18:39:49 -0400] binamov: i tested, i get the same thing as you do with wrong creds
