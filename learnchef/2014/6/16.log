[2014-06-16 12:52:38 -0400] shay-: Hi, I have a recipe where I have some cookbook_file and a variable storing its version. Now I want to reuse these files in a different cookbook, but how can I read the version number from the version variable?
[2014-06-16 15:03:09 -0400] Scrivener: Anyone know if it's possible to run a recipe (in a chef solo setup) from a script?

[2014-06-16 23:28:00 -0400] rbowlby: is that right?
[2014-06-16 23:28:25 -0400] rbowlby: just getting started here and attempting to discern the appropriate vagrant dev workflow
