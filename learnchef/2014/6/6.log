[2014-06-06 02:23:42 -0400] kdp: I have kind of a strange question. Is there a list of packages that are required and their versions for chef to be installed or when chef is installed? If that makes sense.
[2014-06-06 02:24:32 -0400] kdp: Meaning like from yum 
[2014-06-06 05:46:37 -0400] ashmckenzie: hi, are multiple actions supported? e.g
[2014-06-06 05:46:37 -0400] ashmckenzie: user 'test' do
[2014-06-06 05:46:38 -0400] ashmckenzie:   action [ :create, :lock ]
[2014-06-06 05:46:39 -0400] ashmckenzie: end

[2014-06-06 18:05:28 -0400] jdsdsa: is this a learning channel
[2014-06-06 18:05:39 -0400] jbz: indeed
[2014-06-06 18:06:37 -0400] jdsdsa: i am here to learn
[2014-06-06 18:06:48 -0400] jdsdsa: about bash
[2014-06-06 18:09:34 -0400] jbz: oh
[2014-06-06 18:09:36 -0400] jbz: heh
[2014-06-06 18:09:43 -0400] jbz: this channel is for Chef
[2014-06-06 18:09:49 -0400] jdsdsa: who is Chef?
[2014-06-06 18:10:44 -0400] jbz: Chef is the software package that this channel is dedicated to
[2014-06-06 18:10:47 -0400] jbz: getchef.com
[2014-06-06 18:20:52 -0400] jdsdsa: does anyone know bash?
[2014-06-06 18:27:07 -0400] retr0grad3: @jdsdsa I'm also new here, but I think this channel is focused on Chef. If you want to learn about Bash I always direct people to http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/ or http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/ which are both translation-friendly.
[2014-06-06 22:28:20 -0400] atiniir: i have a quick (i think) question about chef-client and the chef-client::windows_service recipe if someone has a mo 
[2014-06-06 22:28:29 -0400] atiniir: i'm trying to set the interval and can't seem to sort it out
[2014-06-06 22:28:58 -0400] atiniir: i've tried at the role level with {"defaults":{"chef_client":{"interval":15}},"overrides":{}} 
[2014-06-06 22:29:41 -0400] atiniir: and at the node level with {"chef_client":{"interval":25},"tags":[]}
[2014-06-06 22:29:50 -0400] atiniir: but the interval on the node is still 1800 (default)
