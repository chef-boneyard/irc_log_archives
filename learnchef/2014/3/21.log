[2014-03-21 02:19:29 -0400] himanshu: How can I pass values to questions asked during apt-get install mysql like the value for root password?
[2014-03-21 02:45:02 -0400] iFire: himanshu: not familiar with chef, but you'd get it from an encrypted bag right?
[2014-03-21 02:45:35 -0400] iFire: So you'd use the ruby erb variables <%= variable_name %>

[2014-03-21 09:52:38 -0400] iFire: What's the best way to learn chef that doesn't require me to watch videos?
[2014-03-21 13:13:34 -0400] medieval1: iFire: there are some "text" tutorials around the interwebz. Can also just "jump right in". Get access to 3 nodes. Install OpenSource Chef Server on one. Use the second to run knife (management node) and the third to be your target node that is to be managed by chef.
[2014-03-21 13:17:10 -0400] medieval1: himansu: You can preseed your answers. https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed
[2014-03-21 13:21:27 -0400] iFire: medieval1: that was a subtle request for links
[2014-03-21 14:03:07 -0400] thebowski: I have been running into an issue.  I'm using chef to set up a tunnel, and then configuring the computer to forward traffic through it.  In order to do so, I need to get the IP address of the server on the tunnel interface.  When I try to use node[:network][:interfaces][TUNNEL_INTERFACE][:addresses].keys[1] it fails to compile/deploy on the chef node with the error "undefined method [] for nil:nilClass", presumably because the tu
[2014-03-21 14:03:22 -0400] thebowski: Presumably because the tunnel interface doesn't exist in ohai before it gets to that point in the recipe.
[2014-03-21 14:04:39 -0400] thebowski: Does anyone know how I could get the IP either without using ohai or make this command wait until execution time to run?
[2014-03-21 14:09:04 -0400] Shubby: I have this EC2 instance in a very locked down security group, can someone confirm what ports I need to open to allow communication between chef-client and Hosted Chef? I'm assuming UDP 53 so chef-client can resolve api.opscode.com and TCP 443 so the client can talk to the server, but is there anything beside that?

[2014-03-21 14:21:22 -0400] medieval1: thebowski: have you verified that the attr actually exists on node?
[2014-03-21 14:21:51 -0400] medieval1: knife node show -l -Fj <nodename> > node.json
[2014-03-21 14:22:07 -0400] medieval1: then edit/grep node.json for that attr
[2014-03-21 14:22:47 -0400] medieval1: ohai runs before any cookbooks. So if ohai can see it, so can you.
[2014-03-21 14:24:02 -0400] medieval1: shubby: port 80 may be in play as well.
[2014-03-21 14:24:08 -0400] thebowski: Okay, thanks.  I did an ohai reload before calling that line to make sure it was updated.  The tunnel device won't exist until that point in the recipe
[2014-03-21 14:24:30 -0400] thebowski: Or right before I reload ohai, that is
[2014-03-21 14:25:17 -0400] Shubby: medieval1: I guess I'll have to test it -- I also saw in some discussion from 2011 that I may need to allow traffic to https://s3.amazonaws.com as well, which would also be TCP 443, but I'm trying to restrict it to as few IP addresses as possible 
[2014-03-21 14:25:29 -0400] medieval1: sure...we have a couple of those "double run" type of recipes where on the second run of chef-client, attrs are present where on first run they aren't without going thru a lot of hoops
[2014-03-21 14:26:37 -0400] medieval1: thebowski: bottom line is that if that attr is set via ohai then that info will be saved and you should be able to see if that attr exists after a run of chef-client
[2014-03-21 14:27:51 -0400] thebowski: Would ohai action :reload update ohai with any new changes to the system?
[2014-03-21 14:28:06 -0400] medieval1: not really sure...have never played with that.
[2014-03-21 14:28:47 -0400] thebowski: Okay, thank you.  Do you know of any examples where chef-client needs to be run twice that I could look at?  I'm not finding anything on google.
[2014-03-21 14:28:48 -0400] medieval1: can also consider creating your own node.normal attr with tunnel info from recipe that actually sets up the tunnel.
[2014-03-21 14:29:42 -0400] medieval1: no examples per se. Just the fact that on very first run of chef-client on a node ... setup stuffs...then subsequent chef-client runs will have access to those created resources.
[2014-03-21 14:29:54 -0400] thebowski: Ah, okay
[2014-03-21 14:30:05 -0400] medieval1: they usually stem from chicken-n-egg type of scenarios
[2014-03-21 14:30:22 -0400] thebowski: nathan
[2014-03-21 14:30:25 -0400] thebowski: lol
[2014-03-21 14:30:26 -0400] thebowski: oops
[2014-03-21 14:30:41 -0400] medieval1: there are tips-n-tricks about using exec blocks to execute code during compile-time...
[2014-03-21 14:30:41 -0400] thebowski: Well, thanks for all the help I'll check those thingso ut
[2014-03-21 14:30:44 -0400] jbz_: thebowski: one common situation - when you use the chef-client cookbook to set up the chef-client service, it will generally quit and restart in order to pivot to the 'service managed' chef
[2014-03-21 14:31:04 -0400] medieval1: +1 ^^^
[2014-03-21 14:31:40 -0400] jbz_: So e.g. if you install chef via a bootstrap, that first run does setup stuff like remove the registration pemfile, set up chef-client as a service, and then pivot to that service.
[2014-03-21 14:32:35 -0400] thebowski: Ah.  I'm very new new to chef and just trying to get my recipe to work on a node I've already set up.
[2014-03-21 14:34:12 -0400] jbz_: thebowski: ah yes.  So I would recommend you just have a test in the recipe to see if that attribute exists, and if not, to just skip that section.  Then the next chef run, it will be there, and it shoudl work.
[2014-03-21 14:34:36 -0400] jbz_: Probably a good practice anyway - you don't want the chef converge to fail if the tunnel doesn't happen to be up, b/c if it does, then it won't be able to bring the tunnel up - as you found.
[2014-03-21 14:35:27 -0400] jbz_: This is a personal view, but I'm much more concerned with resilient eventual convergence than everything getting done on the same run.
[2014-03-21 14:36:40 -0400] thebowski: I can't just run chef-client twice because it fails to compile.  I'll try adding the check, though I'm not  sure if that will allow it to compile.  Just getting it to work would be nice.
[2014-03-21 14:38:47 -0400] jbz_: what fails to compile?
[2014-03-21 14:38:59 -0400] jbz_: you mean the chef-client run fails?
[2014-03-21 14:40:40 -0400] jbz_: If you're getting what you said, the "undefined method [] for nil:nilClass" error - that's why you have  test to see if that attribute is populated.  If it's not, your recipe should just skip that operation for that run.
[2014-03-21 14:40:42 -0400] thebowski: Never mind, adding the check fixed it.  Thank you very much.
[2014-03-21 14:40:47 -0400] jbz_: Most welcome.
[2014-03-21 14:41:59 -0400] medieval1: yey
[2014-03-21 14:49:02 -0400] Shubby: ok, yes, knife bootstrap tries to wget the Chef package from an S3 bucket, so I'll need to allow that connectivity outbound
[2014-03-21 14:55:13 -0400] Shubby: but after installing chef-client on the node, I'm not sure that connectivity to S3 is still required, which is good for me
[2014-03-21 14:55:43 -0400] medieval1: yeah..I don't believe it is either
[2014-03-21 14:57:14 -0400] ocholetras: how do you acces attribute names with a dot?
[2014-03-21 14:57:24 -0400] ocholetras: ie vlan interfaces eth2.726
[2014-03-21 14:57:29 -0400] ocholetras: O_o
[2014-03-21 14:59:30 -0400] rushed: chef solo: user creation working but without keys, can you specify id_rsa & id_rsa.pub in a user's data bag?
[2014-03-21 15:01:47 -0400] jbz_: ocholetras: putting it in dubquotes doesn't work?  e.g. ["network"]["interfaces"
[2014-03-21 15:02:02 -0400] jbz_: er,  ["network"]["interfaces"]["eth2.726"]
[2014-03-21 15:02:14 -0400] ocholetras: im getting the attribute name from a node attribute
[2014-03-21 15:02:48 -0400] ocholetras: i think that "'#{variable}'" should work
[2014-03-21 15:04:01 -0400] Shubby: dammit I bootstrapped this new node using the wrong knife.rb and now it's on my personal hosted chef account :|
[2014-03-21 15:05:46 -0400] Shubby: I bring shame and dishonor to my family
[2014-03-21 15:08:55 -0400] Shubby: apparently deleting /etc/chef/* and re-bootstrapping the node works, so yay, and stuff
[2014-03-21 15:39:25 -0400] medieval1: shubby: ha! Yep...and don't forget to delete the node record from your personal acct. #goodHouseKeeping
[2014-03-21 15:46:53 -0400] Shubby: medieval1: yep, done that, but thanks :)
[2014-03-21 15:47:14 -0400] medieval1: +1
[2014-03-21 17:36:04 -0400] ecsyle: Is anybody using librarian-chef? I am running into some major issues that I cannot resolve. 
[2014-03-21 17:36:18 -0400] ecsyle: I get a ton of conflicts now when I try to update or install
[2014-03-21 20:31:50 -0400] Shubby: so this is probably a simple question but I can't figure it out
[2014-03-21 20:32:01 -0400] Shubby: I'm trying to use this cookbook: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/timezone-ii
[2014-03-21 20:32:27 -0400] Shubby: in the instructions, it says to set the "tz" attribute to my desired timezone and then add the recipe to my run list
[2014-03-21 20:32:38 -0400] Shubby: but I don't understand how to set the tz attribute
[2014-03-21 20:34:06 -0400] Shubby: the instructions mention a bit of JSON, I just don't know where I would enter it
[2014-03-21 20:36:15 -0400] Shubby: attributes/default.rb has a line that says: default.tz = 'UTC'  -- but I feel like I shouldn't be modifying it
[2014-03-21 20:37:16 -0400] Shubby: then there is a templates/default/timezone.conf.erb with this line: <%= node[:tz] %> -- but again it doesn't look like something I should change
[2014-03-21 20:39:28 -0400] CPS: https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vc-sdk/visdk41pubs/ApiReference/timezone.html
[2014-03-21 20:40:54 -0400] Shubby: oh I know what my timezone is and how to format it, what I don't understand is how to tell that particular cookbook what timezone I want it to set
[2014-03-21 20:42:12 -0400] CPS: there's a usage section in the readme
[2014-03-21 20:42:29 -0400] Shubby: yep, I'm looking at it, that's the part I'm stuck on
[2014-03-21 20:42:32 -0400] Shubby: I'm really new to this
[2014-03-21 20:43:07 -0400] CPS: you need to set that attribute on your node. there's dozens of ways to do that
[2014-03-21 20:43:38 -0400] CPS: attribute files, roles/environments, node-specific attribute edits
[2014-03-21 20:46:02 -0400] Shubby: I'm sure it's dreadfully easy but I'm not having any luck with it
[2014-03-21 20:46:21 -0400] Shubby: it wants that "tz" attribute which appears to be custom since ohai doesn't know it by default
[2014-03-21 20:46:56 -0400] Shubby: I don't really care at this point which way to do it among the dozen or so ways to do it, so long as I understand how to create it
[2014-03-21 20:48:05 -0400] CPS: well, how you do it depends on your situation. for me, we have 4 data centers in 4 different timezones and a role for each of them. it would make sense for me to set the tz attribute there
[2014-03-21 20:48:30 -0400] CPS: if you're just doing chef with a few servers, you could probably just set the attribute manually and be fine
[2014-03-21 20:49:49 -0400] CPS: you can edit node attributes in the web UI
[2014-03-21 20:50:04 -0400] CPS: or create a small JSON file and use it as an attribute file http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_attribute_files.html
[2014-03-21 20:50:37 -0400] Shubby: ah, yes, I figured out how to edit attributes in the UI, but it's an attribute that doesn't exist and I couldn't figure out how to create one from scratch
[2014-03-21 20:51:01 -0400] Shubby: I only have one timezone to worry about and it's only one server for now, but I'll want it on every server in the future, and that'll be dozens
[2014-03-21 20:51:55 -0400] CPS: do you have any environments?
[2014-03-21 20:52:03 -0400] CPS: or are you just using _default?
[2014-03-21 20:52:26 -0400] Shubby: let's just say I'm using _default, I do have environments but I inherited this account and I'm trying to clean it up by starting from scratch
[2014-03-21 20:52:48 -0400] Shubby: so I'd rather not use any of the stuff lying around (plus that way I can learn along the way since I'm a novice)
[2014-03-21 20:53:21 -0400] CPS: the web UI json editor isn't super easy to use, but you can click on the root 'json' and edit it manually
[2014-03-21 20:55:48 -0400] Shubby: ok, I couldn't find that in the new/preview management UI but I see it in the current one
[2014-03-21 21:07:47 -0400] Shubby: ok, I think that did it -- chef-client returns an error when I run it but it looks like I have this tz attribute in place now
[2014-03-21 21:12:03 -0400] Shubby: ok, it works :) now to figure out how to set it in the environment
[2014-03-21 21:17:53 -0400] Shubby: well, thanks for the help, time to go home
