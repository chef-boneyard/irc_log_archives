[2014-03-20 12:36:28 -0400] sunveer: I want to connect to MySQL and then create database.  Can I do this with Chef?
[2014-03-20 12:38:05 -0400] Er00: yep
[2014-03-20 12:38:19 -0400] Er00: you probably want the mysql and database cookbooks
[2014-03-20 12:38:32 -0400] Er00: wait, you already have mysql?
[2014-03-20 12:38:44 -0400] sunveer: yes.
[2014-03-20 12:38:47 -0400] Er00: then you don't even need to worry abotu installing it, should just be able to connect using database cookbook
[2014-03-20 12:39:40 -0400] sunveer: Ok. thanks.  let me try.
[2014-03-20 12:41:12 -0400] Er00: if you grab the mysql and database cookbooks, then create a recipe of your own that includes database::mysql and mysql::client
[2014-03-20 12:41:32 -0400] Er00: then just connect and create a database in that recipe
[2014-03-20 12:41:36 -0400] Er00: :)
[2014-03-20 12:43:31 -0400] sunveer: ok.   Is there no resource like "file" to create database.  Can't I create everything from my side like I had created a cookbook to install apache server.
[2014-03-20 12:44:54 -0400] Er00: I'm not sure what you mean by that, sorry :/
[2014-03-20 12:46:38 -0400] sunveer: Are there no commands like :  database "db" do action :create name "example" end  with which I can create db, without using other cookbooks.
[2014-03-20 12:46:57 -0400] Er00: no, you need to use those cookbooks to interface with your db
[2014-03-20 12:47:41 -0400] sunveer: ok
[2014-03-20 12:47:50 -0400] sunveer: thanks.
[2014-03-20 12:51:30 -0400] sunveer: Is there any tutorial on creating DB with Chef?
[2014-03-20 12:51:42 -0400] sunveer: I am  unable to find a clean process.
[2014-03-20 12:52:13 -0400] Er00: I'm not sure, but if you like I can PM you some snippets of code from my recipe?
[2014-03-20 12:52:57 -0400] Er00: actually I'll just pastebin it, 2s
[2014-03-20 12:53:53 -0400] Er00: http://pastebin.com/uTVkHWxn
[2014-03-20 12:54:07 -0400] Er00: that sets up the connection, then creates a db with that connection
[2014-03-20 12:55:00 -0400] sunveer: Thanks for the code.
[2014-03-20 12:55:19 -0400] Er00: Hope it helps :)
[2014-03-20 12:55:49 -0400] sunveer: Yes, I can understand how to work now.
[2014-03-20 12:55:54 -0400] sunveer: Thanks again.

[2014-03-20 17:02:18 -0400] thebowski: I have been running into an issue.  I'm using chef to set up a tunnel, and then configuring the computer to forward traffic through it.  In order to do so, I need to get the IP address of the server on the tunnel interface.  When I try to use node[:network][:interfaces][TUNNEL_INTERFACE][:addresses].keys[1] it fails to compile/deploy on the chef node with the error "undefined method [] for nil:nilClass", presumably because the tu
[2014-03-20 17:03:50 -0400] thebowski: So my question is, how can I get the information on that specific interface?  I tell ohai to reload it's info beforehand.
[2014-03-20 17:25:43 -0400] if_then_: thebowski: you got cut-off there, presumably the what?
[2014-03-20 17:27:00 -0400] thebowski: Presumably because the tunnel interface doesn't exist in ohai before it gets to that point in the recipe.
[2014-03-20 17:27:28 -0400] thebowski: If it checks the attributes before it's run, there will be no tunnel interface set up.
[2014-03-20 17:31:31 -0400] thebowski: Any ideas? 
[2014-03-20 17:41:02 -0400] thebowski: Anybody?
[2014-03-20 18:30:53 -0400] medieval1: have you ensured that ohai actually does create that attribute?
[2014-03-20 19:45:23 -0400] rellis: Hello all. I'm trying to set my timezone using chef's timezone-ii cookbook. When I run "knife node edit nodename" and insert the "tz" setting it just says "Node not updated, skipping node save" and my change is removed.
[2014-03-20 20:06:23 -0400] if_then_: thebowski: The ohai resource is used to reload the Ohai configuration on a node.. http://docs.opscode.com/ohai.html#ohai-resource
[2014-03-20 20:08:59 -0400] thebowski: That's what I was using it for, I reloaded the configuration because I figured it would be necessary after it had changed.
[2014-03-20 20:09:35 -0400] if_then_: And it wasn't collecting the new interface information..
[2014-03-20 20:10:17 -0400] thebowski: I don't believe it even got to the point where it was running, it was a compilation issue.

[2014-03-20 20:11:31 -0400] thebowski: tun_ip = node[:network][:interfaces]["tun0"][:addresses].keys[1]
[2014-03-20 20:11:56 -0400] if_then_: thebowski: Take a look at https://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef10/Evaluate+and+Run+Resources+at+Compile+Time
[2014-03-20 20:16:22 -0400] thebowski: Thank you.  That seems to imply that resources are usually evaluated and run at runtime, in which case I shouldn't have an issue.  Very strange.
[2014-03-20 20:19:33 -0400] if_then_: You may also need to specify the ohai resource to eval at compile time too
