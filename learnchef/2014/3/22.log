[2014-03-22 05:30:03 -0400] jimmyhillis: Hey everyone. I have, what I think is a simple, question about overall for a chef-server/node based setup and I can't seem to read something that clears it up for me.
[2014-03-22 05:30:29 -0400] jimmyhillis: I have multiple VMs which need same server setup (a Python/Pyramid application) which I have a custom cookbook for (say pyramid-cookbook for example)
[2014-03-22 05:30:51 -0400] jimmyhillis: Each of the nodes (i.e. sites) need to provide that cookbook it's own attributes (name, database, etc.)
[2014-03-22 05:31:07 -0400] jimmyhillis: Where do these attributes go? Do I need to create another cookbook for EACH site (site-pyramid-cookbook) which sets default attribtues or is there a better way that I don't understand? I've read a lot of information about attributes and precendence but nothing explains the overall structure for me.

[2014-03-22 22:01:32 -0400] mikemar10: katie: you most likely need to run an apt-get update
[2014-03-22 22:01:34 -0400] katie: do you know why that is hpning?
[2014-03-22 22:01:43 -0400] mikemar10: it's likely looking for a package that is no longer available

[2014-03-22 22:03:00 -0400] mikemar10: katie: in your recipe at the top if you include the apt recipe then it should make sure an apt-get update is issued before you use the apt resource
[2014-03-22 22:03:03 -0400] mikemar10: katie no problem :)
[2014-03-22 22:03:15 -0400] mikemar10: to include the recipe just put "include apt" at the top of your recipe
[2014-03-22 22:04:11 -0400] katie: ok thank you mikemar10
[2014-03-22 22:04:17 -0400] mikemar10: you're welcome!
