[2014-03-15 19:38:16 -0400] yodin: I am busy writing my own Chef recipe and its purpose is to install apache2, and to add 1 line to the end of the httpd.conf file. The problem is that I get an error that httpd.conf does not exist, so it fails and apache2 isn't installed. If I remove the code to append to httpd.conf then apache2 does get installed. So it seems that it evaluated my recipe BEFORE installing apache2. I need it to install apache2 first.
