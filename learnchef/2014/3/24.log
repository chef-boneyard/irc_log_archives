[2014-03-24 12:11:39 -0400] quatrix: Hi, I have a LWR add_service "name", that creates a file in conf.d/ for each add_service call, so, add_service "a", add_service "b", creates two file, "a" and "b", If I comment out add_service "b", the "b" file of course still remains there. what's the best way to go about solving it?
[2014-03-24 15:14:48 -0400] CPS: how would i go about installing an rpm from a custom source?  what attribute would that be?
[2014-03-24 15:36:08 -0400] medieval1: cps: there is a "repositories" cookbook that may help. I don't deal with RPMs presently though so other than use a shell LWRP I'm not gonna be much help.
[2014-03-24 15:36:49 -0400] CPS: got a link?
[2014-03-24 15:38:06 -0400] medieval1: http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/repository
[2014-03-24 15:39:31 -0400] CPS: thanks
[2014-03-24 15:39:56 -0400] medieval1: the one we use in-house started from community 2+ years ago...ours is drastically different than this now. :) We are debian based.
[2014-03-24 15:44:50 -0400] thebowski: Hello, I'm having some difficutly running chef-client on a recently bootstrapped node.  When I do, it fails to synchronize cookbooks, coming back with an error connecting, stating "Your chef_server_url may be misconfigured, or the network could be down".  The server was able to SSH and set up chef on the client, and I can ping and access the chef-server webpage with lynx from the client.  The server URL is correct.  What can I do
[2014-03-24 15:45:09 -0400] Er00: Have you tried updating the version of chef server you're running?
[2014-03-24 15:45:12 -0400] Er00: I've had that before with a not
[2014-03-24 15:45:14 -0400] Er00: *node
[2014-03-24 15:45:29 -0400] Er00: when other nodes would work fine with that server, one threw an error I *think* was that (this was a month or so ago)
[2014-03-24 15:45:37 -0400] Er00: might be worth checking you're on latest version and trying again
[2014-03-24 15:46:06 -0400] thebowski: Okay, thanks, I'll check that out.  It seems like it should be considering it was bootstrapped half an hour ago.
[2014-03-24 15:46:57 -0400] Er00: When I had it (if indeed it was the same error) it was from a node I bootstrapped from that server, I still have no idea why it was broken but updating the server definitely helped
[2014-03-24 15:47:23 -0400] medieval1: check your /etc/chef/client.rb file and ensure that the URL for chef server is correct.
[2014-03-24 15:47:45 -0400] medieval1: Also, check to ensure that in /etc/chef you have a valid client.pem file. Also ensure that perms on that file are 0600
[2014-03-24 15:49:06 -0400] thebowski: Thanks, I'll do so
[2014-03-24 15:59:50 -0400] thebowski: Looking at my /etc/chef folder on the client, the knife.rb file has "validation_client_name" set to "chef-validator", but the file in my chef folder is "validation.pem".  Is this incorrect?
[2014-03-24 16:02:13 -0400] medieval1: hmmm...sounds like the bootstrap process did not complete correctly.
[2014-03-24 16:02:26 -0400] medieval1: ps -eaf | grep chef-client
[2014-03-24 16:02:33 -0400] medieval1: is it actually running?
[2014-03-24 16:02:59 -0400] medieval1: note the default is a daemon process that will run every so often (splay + interval)
[2014-03-24 16:11:41 -0400] thebowski: It is running.
[2014-03-24 16:13:26 -0400] thebowski: How would my chef folder look different if bootstrapping completed fully?
[2014-03-24 16:18:28 -0400] thebowski: The chef file and knife.rb look the same on a node that I have that works as on the node that I have that doesn't.
[2014-03-24 16:19:28 -0400] thebowski: The IP used is the same in both instances, and the file is still named "validation.pem"
[2014-03-24 16:22:01 -0400] medieval1: hmmm...from client node try knife node list
[2014-03-24 16:22:32 -0400] medieval1: should see a client.rb and client.pem file
[2014-03-24 16:24:09 -0400] thebowski: I can't use knife commands from either of the nodes, but on my administraion vm, it lists both nodes.
[2014-03-24 16:24:23 -0400] thebowski: The working one and the non-working one
[2014-03-24 16:28:30 -0400] no_name: anyone have a good reference for setting up a Chef Workstation on Windows? 
[2014-03-24 16:28:33 -0400] no_name: stuck on my knife configure --initial
[2014-03-24 16:59:04 -0400] Nukepuppy: anyone have a good example of how to fail not finding a data bag safely?
[2014-03-24 16:59:43 -0400] Nukepuppy: like if data bag doesn't exist  do this instead.. in my example im trying to use a wildcard cert in 90% of cases
[2014-03-24 16:59:57 -0400] Nukepuppy: if it isn't found (which is ok i would think) to use some self signed testing certs included in files/
[2014-03-24 17:07:10 -0400] medieval1: thebowski: hmmm..ok. Something doesn't seem right on your client node. Take a look thru /var/log/chef/client.log and see if there is a clue. Can also do a sudo chef-cleint -l debug 
[2014-03-24 17:09:13 -0400] medieval1: no_name: are you following http://docs.opscode.com/install_workstation.html perchance?
[2014-03-24 17:09:36 -0400] medieval1: and more specifically: http://docs.opscode.com/install_windows.html
[2014-03-24 17:09:50 -0400] thebowski: Thanks
[2014-03-24 17:10:11 -0400] no_name: medieal1 yes that's the one
[2014-03-24 17:10:38 -0400] no_name: I've just gotten a linux workstation (ubuntu) set up and connected to Chef Server, so I know that the pems' and my Chef Server are valid
[2014-03-24 17:12:01 -0400] medieval1: Nukepuppy: I do things like: vals = data_bag_item("data-bag-item", "data-bag") || []
[2014-03-24 17:15:09 -0400] medieval1: or on the data bag itself: dbag = data_bag("data-bag-name") || []
[2014-03-24 17:24:02 -0400] Nukepuppy: hmmm didnt know chef understood || 
[2014-03-24 17:24:06 -0400] Nukepuppy: i should look into it
[2014-03-24 17:26:18 -0400] medieval1: it's just ruby :)
[2014-03-24 17:45:33 -0400] Nukepuppy: || [do stuff here?]   
[2014-03-24 17:47:19 -0400] CPS: Nukepuppy: check if the data bag object is nil?
[2014-03-24 17:50:37 -0400] Nukepuppy: i tried that it would just tell me the data bag [] could not be loaded
[2014-03-24 17:50:55 -0400] Nukepuppy: i thought it had the logic sound but didnt run
[2014-03-24 17:53:14 -0400] Nukepuppy: http://pastebin.ca/2678819    that stuff failed miserably.. i did try other variations of nil checking
[2014-03-24 17:56:34 -0400] CPS: Nukepuppy: if ssl is nil then ssl['cert'] will throw an exception
[2014-03-24 18:23:58 -0400] Nukepuppy: should i just then do a check of   if ssl == nil   do some stuff here?
[2014-03-24 18:24:58 -0400] CPS: yeah
[2014-03-24 18:25:12 -0400] CPS: .nil? is a more ruby way to check
[2014-03-24 18:31:43 -0400] Nukepuppy: ok i could try that up see how it does diff
[2014-03-24 19:02:27 -0400] CPS: we've got a website that hosts compiled WAR files with timestamps in the name, in order by timestamp. how would i going about downloading the most recent file?
[2014-03-24 19:11:40 -0400] PapaSier_: hi, i am specifying dependencies in my metadata.rb. however, my cookbook has recipes for different types of servers. web servers depend on php for example, and search servers depend on java. so if my runlist is myproject::search i don't want chef to think it depends on php
[2014-03-24 19:12:15 -0400] PapaSier_: does this mean i need to split my cookbook into multiple cookbooks?
[2014-03-24 19:14:45 -0400] jbz_: PapaSier_: IMO, a 'web server' either uses a different cookbook or different role than a 'search server'.
[2014-03-24 19:15:43 -0400] jbz_: PapaSier_: I try to treat cookbooks as individually useful (atomic) bits of functionality.  So, e.g., this cookbook can install and manage Apache.  A web server either has a wrapper (role) cookbook or a chef role that *includes* the apache cookbook, and all relevant attributes.
[2014-03-24 19:16:46 -0400] PapaSier_: jbz_: right, so i think my issue is i'm trying to make a cookbook to fulfil a role, whereas i should just be using a role, right?
[2014-03-24 19:18:16 -0400] jbz_: PapaSier_: yes.  Or a wrapper cookbook, depending on your use pattern.
[2014-03-24 19:18:17 -0400] jbz_: But either way
[2014-03-24 19:18:32 -0400] jbz_: you should have individual cookbooks which do specific things
[2014-03-24 19:18:47 -0400] jbz_: and then assemble those into a stack using another entity which doesn't contain much functionality, just aggregates them.
[2014-03-24 19:18:56 -0400] jbz_: I use roles.  Other folks use wrapper cookbooks.
[2014-03-24 19:19:13 -0400] jbz_: That has two major advantages:
[2014-03-24 19:19:27 -0400] jbz_: 1) your cookbooks are (more) reusable in other places, times, and use cases
[2014-03-24 19:19:42 -0400] jbz_: 2) those 'pieces' of functionality probably in many cases have community cookbooks you can just slap in there.
[2014-03-24 19:24:21 -0400] PapaSier_: it seems to me the "roles" concept is more correct
[2014-03-24 19:24:45 -0400] PapaSier_: but chef is famous for having many ways to achieve the same thing, so i'm not sure
[2014-03-24 19:29:07 -0400] geggam: if chef / opscode would get off their butt and make roles versioned we could use them correctly 
[2014-03-24 19:29:24 -0400] geggam: until then we have to use cookbooks as roles so we can track changes
[2014-03-24 19:30:24 -0400] PapaSier_: geggam: i don't understand. by versioned i presume you mean something other than managed by your source control?
[2014-03-24 19:31:02 -0400] geggam: when you upload a role to chef ... how do you know what version is in chef ? 
[2014-03-24 19:31:16 -0400] geggam: see the recipes all pretty with  a version  ? 
[2014-03-24 19:31:39 -0400] geggam: i know what i have in git.. how does one verify that with the chef server ? 
[2014-03-24 19:32:19 -0400] PapaSier_: oh right, i see what you mean. i'm too noob to appreciate the impact of that, but i understand now what you're talking about
[2014-03-24 19:32:38 -0400] geggam: if prod has role FOO and staging and role FOO ... how do you do changes to roles in staging without FOOBARRING prod ? 
[2014-03-24 19:33:42 -0400] PapaSier_: right
[2014-03-24 19:33:50 -0400] geggam: its a design flaw folks work around by creating cookbook roles
[2014-03-24 19:48:25 -0400] medieval1: Chef is versioning roles and data bags...supposedly later this year for that functionality. Was talked about at last ChefSummit.
[2014-03-24 19:49:59 -0400] medieval1: PapaSier_: the original idea with cookbooks and recipes was that a cookbook would be general and recipes would provide the specifics. Cookbook == apache; recipes, web-server, tomcat, proxy, what-not.
[2014-03-24 19:50:41 -0400] medieval1: but yes true, just as with *any* language, more than one way to accomplish a task. And not any one way is necessarily better than another, just different.
[2014-03-24 19:51:30 -0400] medieval1: For instance, we have an icinga cookbook. Recipes include icinga-server, icinga-client, active-checks, ha-icinga, etc.
[2014-03-24 19:51:51 -0400] PapaSier_: right, i've somewhat picked up on that theme just by looking at good examples. e.g. mysql::server mysql::client. however, before i knew about roles (or maybe they're quite new) i saw plenty of ugly examples of "role cookbooks". now things are looking much cleaner to me
[2014-03-24 19:51:53 -0400] medieval1: We have associated roles which include the appropriate recipes in the role run list
[2014-03-24 19:52:07 -0400] medieval1: ahh...
[2014-03-24 19:52:40 -0400] medieval1: roles have been around for a long time. seems there was a lot of pushback in the early days though. "ROLES are EVIL!!!" 
[2014-03-24 19:52:56 -0400] medieval1: no idea why...I personally love them...and yes, would be MOST awesome if they were versioned.
[2014-03-24 19:53:32 -0400] medieval1: We also have the model of "one role per server"
[2014-03-24 19:53:44 -0400] medieval1: so for any node, the run_list only contains a single role
[2014-03-24 19:53:49 -0400] PapaSier_: one role per server type?
[2014-03-24 19:53:53 -0400] medieval1: yes
[2014-03-24 19:54:08 -0400] medieval1: Icinga-Server, Nova-Compute, Swift-Object, etc
[2014-03-24 19:54:22 -0400] PapaSier_: right, i'm doing that too, cool
[2014-03-24 19:54:45 -0400] medieval1: once you get your head wrapped around that model...it actually works pretty well.
[2014-03-24 19:54:59 -0400] PapaSier_: so server-app, server-search, server-loadbalancer?
[2014-03-24 19:55:14 -0400] medieval1: all our top level roles for instance contain the same two "sub-roles", Basenode and Monitoring
[2014-03-24 19:55:20 -0400] medieval1: right
[2014-03-24 19:55:54 -0400] PapaSier_: ok, i've seen that in action too in other folks' examples
[2014-03-24 19:56:11 -0400] medieval1: we used to be VERY heavy into attributes as well. Mostly in the ENV...but have since moved to having most of that data in data bags now.
[2014-03-24 19:56:27 -0400] medieval1: and going to chef 11 is a big plus in that area with regards to performance
[2014-03-24 19:56:41 -0400] medieval1: our ENVs now contain very little data...as they should.
[2014-03-24 19:57:07 -0400] medieval1: which has greatly enhanced our automate deploy work
[2014-03-24 19:57:14 -0400] medieval1: automated*
[2014-03-24 19:57:14 -0400] PapaSier_: ok wow, data bags has been on my reading list for a while now. thanks for the pointer
[2014-03-24 19:57:21 -0400] medieval1: np
[2014-03-24 19:57:49 -0400] PapaSier_: two other nagging topics for me are berksfile and chef-server (i'm using chef-solo)
[2014-03-24 19:58:21 -0400] medieval1: and note that its not an either-or situation...data bags work very well with attributes...just gotta have a "bigger picture" and "future picture" mentality :)
[2014-03-24 19:58:42 -0400] medieval1: chef-solo has become better...I'm still not a fan though. :-)
[2014-03-24 19:58:50 -0400] PapaSier_: actually, i'm using capistrano (with hardcoded ip addresses of my nodes) to bootstrap chef-solo, then chef-solo does the actual provisioning. (it felt pragmatic at the time)
[2014-03-24 19:58:54 -0400] medieval1: setting up and using a chef-server is actually quite easy.
[2014-03-24 19:59:11 -0400] medieval1: oh sure
[2014-03-24 19:59:28 -0400] medieval1: plus in our envirionment...berkshelf really doesn't buy us anything.
[2014-03-24 20:00:01 -0400] PapaSier_: i've just never seen chef-server in action, so i don't know what it does
[2014-03-24 20:00:42 -0400] medieval1: I have jenkins jobs that can spin up a Nova instance and install chef-server on it...and having chef manage itself on that instance. Other jobs to spin up Nova instances, bootstrap them and then assign a role...and ta da.
[2014-03-24 20:01:00 -0400] medieval1: with chef-solo, *YOU* are chef-server
[2014-03-24 20:01:14 -0400] medieval1: so..more organic in nature :)
[2014-03-24 20:01:32 -0400] medieval1: with chef-server, it becomes your CM for all things chef
[2014-03-24 20:01:45 -0400] medieval1: you upload your cookbooks, roles, envs, data bags.
[2014-03-24 20:02:09 -0400] PapaSier_: ok, i'm trying to imagine what that looks like. it sounds like it makes spinning up server instances really simple
[2014-03-24 20:02:36 -0400] medieval1: your nodes (clients) are then configured to use that server..so when chef-client runs, it communicates with the server to get all resources necessary to satisfy it's run_list/env datum.
[2014-03-24 20:03:17 -0400] medieval1: well...yes and no...depends on your defs of terminology. :)
[2014-03-24 20:03:50 -0400] medieval1: 3 parts to the equation: 1) chef-server 2) management workstation ... aka knife 3) node(s)
[2014-03-24 20:04:00 -0400] PapaSier_: sounds pretty great. so need to have one server somewhere outside of your collection of nodes that sort of rules them all?
[2014-03-24 20:04:11 -0400] medieval1: exactly
[2014-03-24 20:05:00 -0400] PapaSier_: cool. considering a cloud server starts at about $15 per month, would your chef server really be one of those? 
[2014-03-24 20:05:02 -0400] CPS: it's worth pointing out that your workstation can also be a node
[2014-03-24 20:05:28 -0400] medieval1: yep!
[2014-03-24 20:05:37 -0400] medieval1: although my "workstation" is my Macbook :)
[2014-03-24 20:05:57 -0400] PapaSier_: ok, i've never thought about doing that. but i do use vagrant
[2014-03-24 20:06:07 -0400] medieval1: which I actually manage with chef-server...just a different chef-server than what I use for the rest of my work bits
[2014-03-24 20:06:29 -0400] medieval1: things just work on OS X so have not had a need to play with vagrant
[2014-03-24 20:06:56 -0400] medieval1: although lately I've been playing with it...need to understand all the "getting started" stuff to better help folks out. :)
[2014-03-24 20:07:45 -0400] geggam: encrypted databags are my new friend
[2014-03-24 20:08:05 -0400] PapaSier_: i don't get your last comment, i don't use vagrant because i can't set up an environment on my os x, i do i because it gives me a virtual machine which matches exactly what i have in production in order to run my code locally
[2014-03-24 20:09:37 -0400] medieval1: EDBs are cool..a bit of a PITA to actually use..but cool nonetheless. We have a few hundred of them.
[2014-03-24 20:09:57 -0400] geggam: we being ? 
[2014-03-24 20:10:33 -0400] medieval1: PapaSier_: yes, understand. For us, I can just spin up a VM or nova instance to perform work upon. So no need for vagrant to do "local" work. Yes, we're spoiled here. :)
[2014-03-24 20:10:52 -0400] geggam: hp  cloud
[2014-03-24 20:10:59 -0400] geggam: heh... used to work at autonomy
[2014-03-24 20:11:21 -0400] medieval1: I'm a Principal Engineer with HP, HP Labs. I work on HP Cloud. Have been for 3+ years now.
[2014-03-24 20:11:45 -0400] geggam: yeah.. your real name with the hostmask and a quick linked in search
[2014-03-24 20:11:52 -0400] medieval1: ha! :)
[2014-03-24 20:12:04 -0400] geggam: nokia here .... ex Y! / HP 
[2014-03-24 20:12:18 -0400] medieval1: :)
[2014-03-24 20:18:37 -0400] PapaSier_: slight change of topic. i've just seen there is a chef resource called cron, which got me thinking, if you've got 10 application servers and you deploy the same cronjob to each, how do you deal with all 10 executing the same cronjob at the same time?
[2014-03-24 20:19:59 -0400] CPS: PapaSier_: little different (on windows), but we use the number in the hostname to change the time the job runs
[2014-03-24 20:20:23 -0400] CPS: 6:00AM + hostname# times 5 minutes
[2014-03-24 20:20:48 -0400] CPS: more or less, so everything runs between 6 and 7am
[2014-03-24 20:21:14 -0400] PapaSier_: so you h1, h2, h3 would fire off at 0600, 0605, 0610 respectively?
[2014-03-24 20:21:40 -0400] CPS: 605, 610, and 615, but yeah
[2014-03-24 20:21:51 -0400] PapaSier_: but that assumes that you have exactly 12 servers (60/5 = 12)
[2014-03-24 20:22:12 -0400] CPS: we wrap it around, so 60 = 6am
[2014-03-24 20:22:46 -0400] CPS: so depending on the fleet we'll have 1-4 servers doing it at the same time, which isn't a problem
[2014-03-24 20:24:01 -0400] PapaSier_: ok, so in short, there is no one way to solve this, it's an issue somewhat specific to the project and the requirements
[2014-03-24 20:24:18 -0400] CPS: correct
[2014-03-24 20:26:15 -0400] CPS: in our case the servers stop taking traffic momentarily, so it'd be pretty catastrophic if all of the sudden the load balancer had nowhere to send traffic
[2014-03-24 20:43:47 -0400] medieval1: so...your recipe is really just "ruby", create an execution block (to run at compile time) to create a random number and use that value as the "minutes" portion of the cron LWRP.
[2014-03-24 20:44:54 -0400] CPS: we're on windows so minus the cron part and you've got it
[2014-03-24 20:45:14 -0400] medieval1: +1
[2014-03-24 20:45:38 -0400] medieval1: Windoze has a 'service manager' though. :-)
[2014-03-24 20:46:02 -0400] medieval1: although...I don't do Windoze anymore ... so I really have no idea what I'm babbling about.
[2014-03-24 20:46:51 -0400] CPS: it calls out to appcmd anyway
[2014-03-24 20:46:53 -0400] CPS: mega hacky
[2014-03-24 20:47:13 -0400] medieval1: heh
[2014-03-24 21:38:47 -0400] tehnef: question: we're not at a point yet where we want to have all our cookbooks in individual repos. thus far i've been putting my entire chef repo into git, minus the sensitive stuff. i just refactored and made it track only my cookbooks directory. bad move?
[2014-03-24 21:41:52 -0400] Nukepuppy: thenef yes :P as mentioned before the hack to only track cookbooks/ directory doesn't help a ton  cause cookbooks/A  still impacts cookbooks/B
[2014-03-24 21:42:28 -0400] Nukepuppy: just start with any new cookbook i think you'll find its easier in end either way just learn how to keep track of it via berkshelf / berksfile properly to point to private cookbooks and it will be a big help
[2014-03-24 21:42:38 -0400] Nukepuppy: hacking it up is going to bite you sooner than later
[2014-03-24 22:13:05 -0400] medieval1: We have a few repos which contain several cookbooks. That's really more a personal choice IMHO. For the sensitive data, take a look at EDB as that is how we handle that for git.
[2014-03-24 22:14:19 -0400] medieval1: For us Berkshelf just adds more moving parts/complexity that has no value-add. We live/work in a segregated network and live by the mantra of Thou Shall Not Install from the Interwebz. :)
[2014-03-24 23:40:55 -0400] torenware: I'm using the Chef Fundamentals Module 3, using the Vagrant option for the "target1" node.
[2014-03-24 23:41:34 -0400] torenware: Nathan didn't cover using "knife bootstrap" with Vagrant, and sure enough, I get an error before chef installs on the node.
[2014-03-24 23:42:21 -0400] torenware: dpkg: error: requested operation requires superuser privilege
[2014-03-24 23:43:06 -0400] torenware: I used the Vagrant file unmodified, and vagrant up brings up a precise64 instance.
[2014-03-24 23:44:01 -0400] torenware: But I've tried knife adding the identity file, the port used by Vagrant, and as seems to be shown in the tutorial, -x vagrant -P vagrant.
[2014-03-24 23:44:58 -0400] torenware: knife starts, talks to my node, downloads the .deb for chef client, and has an error once it tries to install.
[2014-03-24 23:45:31 -0400] torenware: Do I need to call knife in a different manner, or do I need to modify the Vagrant file somehow?
[2014-03-24 23:54:48 -0400] smacfarlane: torenware:   It  looks like you're missing the --sudo option for the 'knife bootstrap'.    
[2014-03-24 23:56:30 -0400] torenware: Let me see...
[2014-03-24 23:59:24 -0400] torenware: @smacfarla -- yep, missed the --sudo arg.  Good eyes, that.
