[2014-03-26 15:39:06 -0400] fmasi: hello I am new to chef, started messing with it a few days ago, I was wondering if any of you knows how to get node['ipaddress'] from ohai in reverse format ?
[2014-03-26 15:48:03 -0400] Nukepuppy: these guys have some examples with data bags.. i would ignore the data bags.. make a test file somewhere and use their logic in chef to make the reverses http://blog.networksaremadeofstring.co.uk/2013/10/01/a-brief-look-at-some-datasift-platform-automation-elements/
[2014-03-26 15:49:50 -0400] fmasi: Nukepuppy, thx will take a look, I also thought about using http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/ipaddr/rdoc/IPAddr.html
[2014-03-26 15:49:55 -0400] fmasi: and populating it with ohai
[2014-03-26 15:49:59 -0400] fmasi: it has a revers method
[2014-03-26 15:50:11 -0400] fmasi: i don't code in ruby but started learning yersturday
[2014-03-26 15:50:35 -0400] fmasi: lets hope i know sufficient  by now :)
