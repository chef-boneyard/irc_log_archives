[2014-03-04 03:35:08 -0500] RicoShen: any body there?
[2014-03-04 03:35:42 -0500] RicoShen: can anybody see my msg?
[2014-03-04 03:40:47 -0500] jbz: Cheers
[2014-03-04 03:40:55 -0500] jbz: RicoShen: yes.
[2014-03-04 03:41:09 -0500] RicoShen: hello
[2014-03-04 03:43:49 -0500] RicoShen: guys, I meet an issue when using chef to run a java Hello World program, "Could not reserve enough space for object heap" error poped up. If I locally run the HelloWorld , it's ok.Has anyone here met this issue before? or anyone have idea on this?
[2014-03-04 03:45:35 -0500] jbz: uhwhy are you using chef to run a java program?  Confused.
[2014-03-04 03:48:38 -0500] jbz: Are you trying to start a java service on a machine?
[2014-03-04 03:49:10 -0500] RicoShen: wait a moment, call
[2014-03-04 03:57:11 -0500] RicoShen: actually, I use chef to run a bat in the client machine, the bat contains "java HelloWorld". when I use chef to bookstrap, the "Could not reserve enough space for object heap"  error occur. 
[2014-03-04 03:57:39 -0500] RicoShen: but if I remote to the machine and run th bat, it passed
[2014-03-04 03:59:22 -0500] RicoShen: you're right, I'm trying to start a java service on the machine, I found this error. so I replace the java service with a Java HelloWorld program. the error still occur. so I believe there's nothing wrong with the Java service.
[2014-03-04 04:04:36 -0500] RicoShen: my chef server is : win7 64-bit virtual machine. my chef client is : windows server 2012 64-bit ec2 instance.
[2014-03-04 04:41:51 -0500] RicoShen: could anyone take a look at my issue? thanks
[2014-03-04 15:32:25 -0500] grvgr: hi guys!
[2014-03-04 15:32:55 -0500] grvgr: is there a way to search nodes based on tags? i'm trying `knife search node "tags:disabled"` but no joy. :(
[2014-03-04 15:33:53 -0500] grvgr: oh it works now! there was some delay in search being updated i guess. thanks anyway. :)
[2014-03-04 19:42:13 -0500] mhenrixon: grvgr: the solr index takes some time to rebuild/reindex after updating stuff
[2014-03-04 19:42:49 -0500] grvgr: mhenrixon: yea. that's what i thought. thanks.
[2014-03-04 19:43:38 -0500] grvgr: i should've realized this sooner, since i was fixing indexing delay on my solr server just a while ago. but it started working before i realized. :)
[2014-03-04 21:30:43 -0500] euphy: is it possible to add a run list to an environment?
[2014-03-04 22:45:18 -0500] micgo: euphy: Nope. Run lists are only on nodes and roles
