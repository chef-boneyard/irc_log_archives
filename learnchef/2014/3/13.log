[2014-03-13 00:29:20 -0400] tippet:  @sethvargo , when is the book due out?
[2014-03-13 07:56:17 -0400] madhatter: Hello
[2014-03-13 12:21:42 -0400] madhatter: I am trying to install chef via omnibus on my arch linux boxes. But the omnibus keeps running off the road... The Error raised is empty. :/ Any ideas what might be wrong? I am followin this howto: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Chef#From_Source
[2014-03-13 13:31:02 -0400] madhatter: Now I have been able to install the chef-installer script, but the installed tools do not seem to work. Lots of errors about missing ruby gems. I thought the omnibus way is that everthing necessary is included
[2014-03-13 13:48:56 -0400] madhatter: Ok. Now it seems to work so far. Only that all binaries are in /opt/chef/embedded/bin. /opt/chef/bin is empty. Is this normal behavior?
[2014-03-13 17:20:27 -0400] onxis: ...is there any compelling reason why someone would go with Chef over Puppet these days?
[2014-03-13 17:21:36 -0400] onxis: I get the Chef came about from scale issues w/ Puppet that are no longer issues.  Puppet Manifest language is well kinda useless outside of Puppet
[2014-03-13 17:22:02 -0400] onxis: I <3 Ruby
[2014-03-13 17:22:50 -0400] onxis: Considering Razor + Chef
[2014-03-13 17:23:10 -0400] onxis: But the natural choice appears to be Razor + Puppet
[2014-03-13 17:23:11 -0400] Neso_: Hi, I'm trying to download the Starter Kit, but I get: We are sorry, but something went wrong. Console screenshot: http://cl.ly/image/1a2H2X1Z0j3Q
[2014-03-13 17:23:46 -0400] Neso_: Any suggestions?
[2014-03-13 18:41:49 -0400] tatlar: Can anyone help with the apache2 cookbook on RHEL?
[2014-03-13 19:35:03 -0400] trahma: I am convinced that there is some protocol other than standard messaging being used in this channel
[2014-03-13 19:40:24 -0400] jbz: EEP OPP ORK AH AH
[2014-03-13 19:55:18 -0400] trahma: I KNEW IT
[2014-03-13 19:55:24 -0400] trahma: BA WEEP GRA NA WEEP NINIBONG
[2014-03-13 20:00:03 -0400] Chazzly: Is there a way to use cookbook version constraints to exclude a cookbook from an environment.  ex. I'm added a new cookbook to a "Base" role, but only want it to got to the Sandbox env, not Dev.
