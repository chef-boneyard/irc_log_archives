[2014-03-03 00:30:07 -0500] sentinal8473: hello, using the application_python cookbook, the migrate stage seems to run python manage.py syncdb in the wrong directory, has anyone else seen this ?
[2014-03-03 11:51:32 -0500] sentinal8473: if i have questions re application_python and django which are chef related, where would the best place to ask these be ?
[2014-03-03 16:43:47 -0500] duncan-nc: hello, I just start converging my node for the first time, following the guide on https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/converge/ -- and it gives me the error "Missing Cookbooks: apt, aliases, apache2" -- vagrant up --no-color seemed to execute fine, but the bootstrap fails
[2014-03-03 16:55:15 -0500] duncan-nc: I was directed to this channel to ask questions regarding Chef, am I in the right place?
[2014-03-03 17:00:24 -0500] duncan-nc: knife client list shows two items, duncan-starter, and remotelabs-validator
[2014-03-03 17:00:45 -0500] duncan-nc: knife cookbook list shows nothing
[2014-03-03 17:02:27 -0500] duncan-nc: knife bootstrap localhost --ssh-user vagrant --ssh-password vagrant --ssh-port 2222 --run-list "recipe[apt],recipe[aliases],recipe[apache2]: --sudo -- produces the error:  "Error Resolving Cookbooks for Run List"
[2014-03-03 17:02:59 -0500] duncan-nc: missing cookbooks: apt, aliases, and apache2
[2014-03-03 17:07:30 -0500] duncan-nc: anyone?
[2014-03-03 17:08:39 -0500] duncan-nc: can anyone even see what I'm writing here?  do I have to register in order to be seen?
[2014-03-03 17:09:24 -0500] Er00: duncan-nc: I can see what you're writing :)
[2014-03-03 17:09:30 -0500] duncan-nc: Er00: thanks
[2014-03-03 17:09:57 -0500] Er00: it looks like you need to download those cookbooks
[2014-03-03 17:10:05 -0500] Er00: you can do that using knife cookbook site download
[2014-03-03 17:11:37 -0500] duncan-nc: Er00: thanks, tried that command and got ERROR: knife encountered an unexpected error, This may be a bug in the 'cookbook site download' knife command or plugin.  Exception: NoMethodError: undefined method 'gsub' for nil:NilClass
[2014-03-03 17:12:08 -0500] Er00: try cookbook site install instead? Although I suspect that'll give the same error
[2014-03-03 17:12:29 -0500] Er00: if so, you might need to manually download (I have no idea what's giving that error, but manually downloading should workaround it I would think)
[2014-03-03 17:12:41 -0500] duncan-nc: ERROR: Please specify a cookbook to download and install.
[2014-03-03 17:13:17 -0500] duncan-nc: ok, I'll look up manually downloading, thanks for the assistance
[2014-03-03 17:13:39 -0500] Er00: Sure :)
[2014-03-03 17:13:56 -0500] Er00: you'll need to specify the cookbook btw
[2014-03-03 17:14:05 -0500] Er00: so cookbook site install apt
[2014-03-03 17:14:07 -0500] Er00: for example
[2014-03-03 17:16:48 -0500] duncan-nc: that did seem to run and download files, although it did return an errorcode after committing changes :ERROR: Mixlib::ShellOut::ShellCommandFailed: Expected process to exit with [0], but recieved '1' 
[2014-03-03 17:16:54 -0500] duncan-nc: i'll try that for the other missing cookbooks
[2014-03-03 17:17:46 -0500] duncan-nc: same error on apache2, and says nothing added to commit but untracked files present
[2014-03-03 17:18:51 -0500] duncan-nc: same error on the bootstrap command after trying to manually install those two cookbooks as well, and knife cookbook list still doesn't show anything
[2014-03-03 17:26:13 -0500] duncan-nc: ok I halted the vagrant VM and redid the steps where I upload the cookbooks to git and now it seems to be working
