[2014-03-18 16:08:54 -0400] KaaK: I'm contemplating using chef across an intrinsically unreliably network. Does any one have experience/thoughts/information on how well the chef server handles chef clients that frequently disappear for minuets or more?
[2014-03-18 16:12:48 -0400] geggam: handles it fine... icall that shitty network the cloud
[2014-03-18 16:15:14 -0400] KaaK: geggam: thanks!
[2014-03-18 16:18:56 -0400] geggam: KaaK, the initial bootstrap is important... after that it really doesnt matter
[2014-03-18 16:21:57 -0400] KaaK: geggam: I think I plan on handling the bootstrap with cloud-init -- also, a tangential question. Bandwidth is a concern on this shitty network, is chef pretty lightwieght? E.g. does it use on the order of 10k/day, 100k/day, 1000k/day ect?
[2014-03-18 16:23:10 -0400] geggam: depends totally on your deployment KaaK 
[2014-03-18 16:23:26 -0400] geggam: if you host the files in chef then chef uses the bandwidth
[2014-03-18 18:54:13 -0400] aalmenar: Are there any recomendations to start a chef-repo while using own cookbooks and comunnity cookbooks ?
[2014-03-18 18:54:23 -0400] aalmenar: specially about testing and so on..
[2014-03-18 19:20:57 -0400] jbean: hello
[2014-03-18 19:21:24 -0400] jbean: trying to complete the tutorial at https://learnchef.opscode.com/quickstart/converge/
[2014-03-18 19:21:41 -0400] jbean: running the bootstrap command doesn't seem to work 
[2014-03-18 19:21:45 -0400] jbean: simply says 'Bootstrapping Chef on localhost'
[2014-03-18 19:21:48 -0400] jbean: and exits
[2014-03-18 19:22:26 -0400] jbean: ssh into the vagrant box, none of the aliases commands work -- what am i missing
[2014-03-18 19:25:04 -0400] jbean: anyone
[2014-03-18 19:27:50 -0400] jbean: fuck you all and fuck chef
[2014-03-18 19:56:30 -0400] madhatter: Nice
[2014-03-18 21:13:49 -0400] real_ate: I'm having some trouble uploading cookbooks with berkshelf
[2014-03-18 21:14:33 -0400] real_ate: saying that i'm not authenticated but things seem to work for knife uploads
[2014-03-18 22:00:02 -0400] tcpsyn: evening
[2014-03-18 22:33:15 -0400] dstynchula: anyone know how to use become_node in chef-shell? 
[2014-03-18 22:33:31 -0400] dstynchula: I've tried every method I can think of and nothing seems to work.
