[2014-03-19 13:23:04 -0400] efeldhusen: just curious, I'm doing some cleanup on an existing chef server that we use a single shared git repo for our cookbooks, nodes, etc... and we don't have a lot of the environments, roles, nodes, and I was going to download those from the chef server. What's the best practice format for those files json or ruby?
[2014-03-19 16:18:20 -0400] Cail: does chef support Windows XP? I see that it definitely supports Windows but it doesn't seem clear which versions it will support.

[2014-03-19 18:30:47 -0400] CPS: does anyone have any experience using winrm to bootstrap windows nodes?
[2014-03-19 18:31:46 -0400] medieval1: efeldhusen: you will want to save those as json files. 
[2014-03-19 20:37:18 -0400] real_ate: right... so... i've got a bit of a pro question, does anyone know how to change the contents of the client.rb file during a knife bootstrap
[2014-03-19 20:37:45 -0400] real_ate: i'm trying to look into distro files but i can't see any good examples of them, and the ones in the core libs are CRAZY complicated
[2014-03-19 20:40:15 -0400] thebowski: Hello, I have a question about getting information from a chef node.  I need to get a node's IP address on a specific device, but ohai only records the IP of the node on the internet.  To use chef's ifconfig you have  to provide the IP of the device you're trying to configure, so I can't do it that way.  How should I get this information short of using a bash script?
[2014-03-19 20:57:16 -0400] thebowski: Is anyone actually here?
[2014-03-19 21:03:30 -0400] jbz_: thebowski: 
[2014-03-19 21:04:15 -0400] jbz_: thebowski: ohai should (if you're running on linux, e.g.) populate an attribute named ['network']['interfaces'] with a list of the interfaces on the box, and if they have IP addresses assigned, those IP addresses.

[2014-03-19 23:04:04 -0400] erichs: Hi! I'm fairly new to chef. Writing a recipe to attach an AWS EC2 volume to a node if it is not attached. What I want to do is, at client run time, parse the JSON output from the `aws ec2 describe-volumes` command, and, based on the JSON output, conditionally run an execute block that issues a `aws ec2 attach-volume` command. I don't currently understand how to structure my recipe, using ruby_block and
[2014-03-19 23:04:07 -0400] erichs: execute resources, to accomplish this. Any ideas?
