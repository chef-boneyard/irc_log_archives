[2014-03-28 14:37:56 -0400] real_ate: I'm taking an influence from a gist and have commented with the error here: https://gist.github.com/ctgswallow/3409231#comment-1201220

[2014-03-28 19:10:53 -0400] Shubby: Could someone clarify something for me regarding runlists and the "depends" setting in a cookbook's metadata? I'm trying to set a node's timezone using the timezone-ii community cookbook and the way I did it was to create a custom cookbook which I called "tz-us-east" where I added a depends "timezone-ii" line in the metadata.rb, and then I'm setting the timezone via an attribute file 
[2014-03-28 19:11:15 -0400] Shubby: the problem I'm having is it only works if I actually include timezone-ii in the runlist, but I thought having the "depends" setting would automatically invoke it 
[2014-03-28 19:25:41 -0400] medieval1_: Shubby: the depends clause makes the resources of the included item available for your cookbook's use. It does not execute those resources. If you need it to execute, then yes, it must be in your run_list. Does that make sense?
[2014-03-28 19:27:14 -0400] Shubby: ok, yes, thanks medieval1_ -- I guess I was trying to only execute custom cookbooks with dependencies on community cookbooks I would keep on the server but not touch, but given what you're saying, I might as well just delete my little custom cookbook and modify the community cookbook
[2014-03-28 19:28:16 -0400] medieval1_: that is certainly doable. :)
[2014-03-28 19:28:51 -0400] medieval1_: However, the cookbook-wrapper approach seems to be gaining in popularity which is where you're headed.
[2014-03-28 19:29:02 -0400] medieval1_: either way though will work...totally your preference
[2014-03-28 19:29:09 -0400] Shubby: does it make sense though? I realize Chef lets you do things in a lot of different ways, but I'm from the sysadmin world and I'm all about best practices
[2014-03-28 19:29:52 -0400] medieval1_: also, you'll find out that in most cases, you won't actually need to modify the cookbook (recipes). You just need to supply the appropriate attribute(s).
[2014-03-28 19:30:11 -0400] Shubby: right, that's what I meant, that's how the timezone-ii cookbook works
[2014-03-28 19:30:30 -0400] Shubby: the recipes are completely generalized and I only need to set the tz attribute to what I want in attributes/default.rb
[2014-03-28 19:30:46 -0400] medieval1_: yep. And that's how those cookbooks are used the majority of the time so you'd be good with that. It's still a "best practice"
[2014-03-28 19:30:54 -0400] Shubby: alright
[2014-03-28 19:31:00 -0400] medieval1_: sure...or in your role file...or env file :)
[2014-03-28 19:31:20 -0400] Shubby: yeah I'm getting there
[2014-03-28 19:31:32 -0400] Shubby: it took me a few hours to get this working in the first place
[2014-03-28 19:31:49 -0400] medieval1_: I would personally not modify attributes/default.rb. I would put the appropriate attribute(s) in the role or env
[2014-03-28 19:31:55 -0400] medieval1_: I hear ya :)
[2014-03-28 19:32:21 -0400] Shubby: I agree though, it totally makes sense to have the timezone in an environment
[2014-03-28 20:42:33 -0400] someara: use UTC like dog intended
[2014-03-28 20:42:43 -0400] someara: *protip
