[2014-03-11 17:52:00 -0400] ASTF: Hello all.  I am working through the youtube webinar series and have hit a snag on part 5.  On CentOS, chef-client runs without s hitch, but on Debian, I am getting a compile error on line " 12>> package node["package_name"] do". Error: "You must supply a name when declaring a package resource."
[2014-03-11 17:52:49 -0400] ASTF: Any suggestions are appreciated.
[2014-03-11 17:57:14 -0400] ASTF: Ah, I bet I know why. I dont have a "debian" statement in the attributes switch.
