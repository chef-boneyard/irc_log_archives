[2014-04-20 20:53:49 -0400] frege: hey guys
[2014-04-20 20:54:24 -0400] frege: I'm trying to learn chef solo but not sure if it's worth it for my current size
[2014-04-20 20:54:47 -0400] frege: I only have one server and I use vbox for my dev
[2014-04-20 20:55:14 -0400] frege: but I found chef to be great since I can use it for Vagrant and my server and in the future if I want to use AWS
[2014-04-20 20:55:34 -0400] frege: do you think I should invest time in making my chef repo now?
