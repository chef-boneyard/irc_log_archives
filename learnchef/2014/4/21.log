[2014-04-21 19:59:08 -0400] Scrivener: Hey chefs
[2014-04-21 19:59:37 -0400] Scrivener: I'm trying to execute a command at some point during deployment to AWS Opsworks, and it is as follows:
[2014-04-21 20:00:00 -0400] Scrivener: run "cd=#{release_path} && pkill -f 'stuff' "
[2014-04-21 20:00:21 -0400] Scrivener: For some reason, even though pkill runs just fine at the command line, chef complains because
[2014-04-21 20:00:28 -0400] Scrivener: " Expected process to exit with [0], but received '' "
[2014-04-21 20:01:09 -0400] Scrivener: I am trying to get chef to ignore this by forcing this line's exit status, by appending "|| true" and "; exit 0" to it, but they're not making a difference.
[2014-04-21 20:01:16 -0400] Scrivener: Chef still complains that it didn't exit with status 0
[2014-04-21 20:01:28 -0400] Scrivener: How can I make it ignore the exit status of this command?
