[2014-04-04 15:35:15 -0400] dappleman: is anyone around to help me think through a bug I'm getting with the database community cookbook?
[2014-04-04 15:36:19 -0400] dappleman: it looks like a mysql gem isn't getting installed, or something
[2014-04-04 15:36:23 -0400] dappleman: here's the pastebin

[2014-04-04 16:41:58 -0400] Nukepuppy: i ran into that yesterday! it sucks its totally broken right now
[2014-04-04 16:42:05 -0400] Nukepuppy: i had to specificy the older database one
[2014-04-04 16:42:34 -0400] Nukepuppy: i was gonna look at trying to fix it but.. i needed to move on a project so i just used the 2.0.0 version in my Berksfile
[2014-04-04 16:42:49 -0400] Nukepuppy: cookbook "database", "= 2.0.0"   
[2014-04-04 16:43:03 -0400] Nukepuppy: the newer version added a ton of breaking changes and new dependencies which some dont work as you ran into it
[2014-04-04 16:43:45 -0400] Nukepuppy: if you look down dependency chain they added some weird stuff that is now 0.0.1 version and what not.. not sure how it made it to master branch but it is what it is
[2014-04-04 16:45:36 -0400] Nukepuppy: also i had to lock down a couple more things like the mysql cookbook due to it now depending on the newer database cookbook version =/ quite messy situation
[2014-04-04 16:46:58 -0400] Nukepuppy: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql-chef_gem/  is the culprit i beleive
