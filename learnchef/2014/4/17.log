[2014-04-17 13:32:04 -0400] nagnewb: Hello all. Is there a way to have the chef-client install as a service on a CentOS box aside from the rbel6 repo?
[2014-04-17 21:31:55 -0400] phil_s_stein: Is there a way to bootstrap a node while pointing at a local binary server? i.e. bootstrapping from a network that cannot seehttps://www.opscode.com? 
[2014-04-17 22:04:59 -0400] Steakfest: I've been working with chef for  a couple months now.  got some recipes under my belt, but there is something I just don't quite understand yet.  If I have a recipe that needs to restart a service after it executes, what is the proper way to make sure that that recipe has the service resource it needs.  without worrying about inadverdently redefining the service if it happens to be defined by another service already.
[2014-04-17 22:05:25 -0400] Steakfest: is it a service resource with a "if not already defined" wrapped around it?
[2014-04-17 22:08:05 -0400] Steakfest: my use case is this.  I have a recipe that needs to make sure apache is restarted when it's done.  sometimes my recipe is run as part of a bigger run list, and the service is already defined, and it works great.  But other times I need to run just that single recipe, and it doesn't work, but if I manually define the service in the recipe, i get an error.

[2014-04-17 23:05:53 -0400] coandco: I'm attempting to set up the open-source Chef 11.0.12 server on my Ubuntu 12.04 box
[2014-04-17 23:06:12 -0400] coandco: I installed the .deb and ran chef-server-ctl reconfigure
[2014-04-17 23:06:29 -0400] coandco: but when I try to run chef-server-ctl test, it fails with an SSL error
[2014-04-17 23:06:47 -0400] coandco: Creating client pedant_admin_client...
[2014-04-17 23:06:47 -0400] coandco: Exception during Pedant credentials setup

[2014-04-17 23:07:58 -0400] coandco: It's apparently attempting to connect to localhost:443, and nginx is running, but openssl complains about "no peer certificate available"
[2014-04-17 23:08:11 -0400] coandco: Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong?
[2014-04-17 23:17:49 -0400] dstynchula: ahh
[2014-04-17 23:17:52 -0400] dstynchula: coandco
[2014-04-17 23:17:56 -0400] dstynchula: cd chef-repo
[2014-04-17 23:17:58 -0400] dstynchula: :)
[2014-04-17 23:18:29 -0400] coandco: ah -- chef-server-ctl needs to be run from a particular directory?
[2014-04-17 23:18:34 -0400] dstynchula: yes
[2014-04-17 23:18:55 -0400] dstynchula: any of the knife commands or chef commands need to be run from the directory contianing the .chef folder
[2014-04-17 23:19:04 -0400] dstynchula: or, maybe you can add .chef to PATH
[2014-04-17 23:19:14 -0400] coandco: That... seems like something that would be good to have up on the quickstart guide on the Chef website
[2014-04-17 23:19:29 -0400] coandco: was following http://www.getchef.com/blog/2013/03/11/chef-11-server-up-and-running/
[2014-04-17 23:19:33 -0400] dstynchula: I could be totally wrong, and I wont claim to be an expert
[2014-04-17 23:19:50 -0400] dstynchula: I just saw nobody had answered you and I had a sec watching paint dry(installing OS)
[2014-04-17 23:20:04 -0400] coandco: I do appreciate the suggestion, either way
[2014-04-17 23:20:16 -0400] dstynchula: and it sounds like what happens to me when I run a knife command from outside of my chef repo.
[2014-04-17 23:20:46 -0400] dstynchula: the .chef folder has your validator.pem and the client.rb
[2014-04-17 23:21:02 -0400] dstynchula: which contain instructions for the clients to access your chef servers.
