[2014-04-14 17:54:05 -0400] gwaldo: Is it me, or did Chef used to invoke the default recipe of a cookbook when you included any recipe from that cookbook?
[2014-04-14 18:04:54 -0400] CPS: if that was the case my cookbooks probably wouldn't work. I don't have default recipes
[2014-04-14 18:40:03 -0400] gwaldo: Thanks, CPS.  My brain is stupid, apparently.
