[2014-04-22 08:20:02 -0400] arkonova: Hi guys, one beginner question I can't find any useful info about: Should the chef-repo be global to a workstation (~/chef-repo) or should/can it be specific to a given project (~/some-path/chef-repo)?
[2014-04-22 09:43:37 -0400] Er00: It can be specific to a given project
[2014-04-22 09:43:55 -0400] Er00: it's kinda up to you how you want to do it
[2014-04-22 10:26:23 -0400] arkonova: Er00: Thanks!
[2014-04-22 10:27:46 -0400] arkonova: But then, why knife config doesn't have a environment_path and role_path?
[2014-04-22 10:28:54 -0400] Er00: I don't think you ever refer to roles and environments like that
[2014-04-22 10:28:58 -0400] Er00: you create them, and can create them from files
[2014-04-22 10:29:04 -0400] Er00: but you'd specify where the file is relative to your working directory
[2014-04-22 10:29:16 -0400] arkonova: does knife expects a relative environments and roles directory?
[2014-04-22 10:29:31 -0400] Er00: what sort of commands are you thinking of that would use those directories?
[2014-04-22 10:30:30 -0400] arkonova: I'm trying to get how I can have all project specific assets, such as roles, in a single project repo. And not have project specific files in the global chef-repo.
[2014-04-22 10:30:53 -0400] arkonova: Hoping I'm clear ;-)
[2014-04-22 10:31:13 -0400] Er00: Roles and environments you create on the server from files but you can specify where those files are
[2014-04-22 10:31:20 -0400] Er00: unlike cookbooks which you refer to by name directly
[2014-04-22 10:31:28 -0400] Er00: so knife needs to know where the cookbook directory is
[2014-04-22 10:31:40 -0400] Er00: so when you say cookbook upload mysql it knows where to look for that mysql folder
[2014-04-22 10:32:31 -0400] arkonova: Okay
[2014-04-22 10:32:44 -0400] arkonova: I think I see how to do that cleanly
[2014-04-22 10:34:44 -0400] arkonova: Er00: Thanks, I'll get some practice with that
[2014-04-22 15:06:56 -0400] ps-chef: newby question with windows and chef: how do you run a chef cookbook with elevated permissions? like  (powershell_script "Enable execution of PowerShell scripts for x86" do   code <<-EOH  Enable-PSRemoting -Force  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy bypass -force -scope LocalMachine  EOH end)
[2014-04-22 20:27:23 -0400] wafflestew: does anyone know what the command would be for my recipe to define a specific listening port for an nginx install? i have a basic recipe setup and have successfully installed it on one node, but want to change the port
[2014-04-22 21:02:42 -0400] medieval1: wafflestew: I believe that would be done with an attribute. It's been a while since I've used that cookbook though.
[2014-04-22 21:03:35 -0400] medieval1: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nginx/search?q=port&ref=cmdform
[2014-04-22 21:07:25 -0400] wafflestew: thank you
