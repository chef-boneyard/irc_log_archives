[2014-04-08 13:56:41 -0400] pcort42: how are people testing cookbooks and stuff locally. I've seen a lot about vagrant and berkshelf, but that's been depreciated, and I can't really figure out what I should be using :( don't wanna provision VM's all my day
[2014-04-08 14:08:16 -0400] Nukepuppy: it still works for me
[2014-04-08 14:08:42 -0400] Nukepuppy: also test kitchen was never depreciated so that works just fine
[2014-04-08 14:09:13 -0400] Nukepuppy: and test kitchen lets you do actual automated tests not just manual verificactions.. so its probably better in general
[2014-04-08 14:15:28 -0400] pcort42: @Nukepuppy do you use vagrant as well?
[2014-04-08 14:29:40 -0400] pcort42: well, after poking around at test-kitchen, it doesn't support windows which is what I need.. :(
[2014-04-08 14:29:54 -0400] pcort42: so I guess berkshelf-vagrant is what I have to use
[2014-04-08 15:04:23 -0400] Nukepuppy: pcort42.. i use windows all the time
[2014-04-08 15:04:34 -0400] Nukepuppy: it works just fine for me
[2014-04-08 15:04:53 -0400] Nukepuppy: git bash + the right test kitchen / kitchen-vagrant berkshelf etc etc
[2014-04-08 15:05:11 -0400] Nukepuppy: i use permanent vms to help me manage the git stuff.. i just use 'windows' as the hypervisor for virtualbox
[2014-04-08 15:05:44 -0400] Nukepuppy: i just mount the windows stuff which is technically the storage + hypervisor.. for just kitchen converge etc
[2014-04-08 15:06:00 -0400] Nukepuppy: maybe you mean it doesnt launch windows VMs
[2014-04-08 15:06:02 -0400] Nukepuppy: dunno
[2014-04-08 18:54:23 -0400] drag00n__: has anyone tried the knife plugin for chef yet? Im getting weird ruby errors http://pastebin.com/9nM9Yb44
