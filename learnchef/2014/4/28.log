[2014-04-28 16:57:10 -0400] codesilverback: I'm trying to troubleshoot 401s on hand-rolled web requests to manage.opscode... any suggestions?
[2014-04-28 17:09:07 -0400] mattray: codesilverback: If it were me I'd probably familiarize myself with one of the existing libraries for doing such things
[2014-04-28 17:09:21 -0400] mattray: and take that learning back to my hand-rolled requests
[2014-04-28 17:09:42 -0400] mattray: there's ruby, python and java at least, more out there

[2014-04-28 17:34:23 -0400] codesilverback: the docs make it look easy, but I can't get it working at all
[2014-04-28 17:37:55 -0400] mattray: codesilverback: what language is your internal tool?
[2014-04-28 17:38:31 -0400] codesilverback: c##
[2014-04-28 17:38:35 -0400] codesilverback: .net
[2014-04-28 20:28:29 -0400] codesilverback: Is there a way to see connection attempts to hosted chef?  
[2014-04-28 20:28:42 -0400] codesilverback: I'm trying to debug some 401 issues with hand-rolled web requests.
