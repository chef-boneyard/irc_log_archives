[2014-04-10 06:56:06 -0400] ostrev: hello beginner cooks, if i wanted to use just an LWRP from a cookbook, is it enought to depend on the cookbook and not include_recipe it?
[2014-04-10 07:15:35 -0400] ufk__: how do i create a new chef repository ? i'm watching the learn videos now and it seems that it comes with enterprise edition. how do i create it in chef open source ?
[2014-04-10 07:20:28 -0400] ufk__: found it
[2014-04-10 09:02:18 -0400] ufk__: chef server is on port 443?

[2014-04-10 12:16:17 -0400] PleasureTown: Anyone else had this error lately? SSL validation of HTTPS requests is disabled. HTTPS connections are still encrypted, but chef is not able to detect forged replies or man in the middle attacks.
[2014-04-10 12:41:32 -0400] CPS: is it possible to declare a variable in one recipe of a cookbook and have it be visible in another recipe within the same cookbook?
[2014-04-10 12:47:36 -0400] PleasureTown: CPS: I just wrote an answer.. but then I read it and figured it was wrong
[2014-04-10 12:47:41 -0400] PleasureTown: :)
[2014-04-10 13:01:16 -0400] ocholetras: CPS if that is the case, probably you need to put that content on an attribute. And you can define it right the way
[2014-04-10 13:02:33 -0400] ocholetras: *on the way
[2014-04-10 13:04:54 -0400] CPS: i'm getting the impression my attr file isn't formatted correctly for chef to do what i want https://gist.github.com/anonymous/10379976
[2014-04-10 13:05:18 -0400] CPS: not that "override" is the name of the attribute I'm using, not defining it as an override attribute
[2014-04-10 13:05:25 -0400] CPS: note*
[2014-04-10 14:13:39 -0400] CPS: what is the purpose of json_attribs in client.rb? it seems like anything you put in there gets applied once and never removed if that option is turned off
[2014-04-10 16:06:50 -0400] montjoy: how do I install an ohai plugin and run it on the same chef run?  is that even possible?
[2014-04-10 16:17:36 -0400] montjoy: ok found the same question in older IRC logs.  sounds like I either have to bootstrap it or else live with a failure on the first run.  Lame.  Factor/Puppet handles this better.

[2014-04-10 17:42:54 -0400] atiniir: people present here? :)
[2014-04-10 17:46:56 -0400] CPS: yes
[2014-04-10 17:48:25 -0400] montjoy: just very quiet
[2014-04-10 17:52:16 -0400] atiniir: cool
[2014-04-10 17:52:32 -0400] atiniir: not sure if here or chef is my best bet for this so i'm cross-posting
[2014-04-10 17:53:00 -0400] atiniir: just a question about enterprise licensing. i understand the licensing is per node. i'm trying to clarify if those nodes can be split across server instances
[2014-04-10 18:02:44 -0400] whiteadam: atinlir: I think nodes are anything that chef-client is installed on
[2014-04-10 18:02:49 -0400] whiteadam: i may be wrong
[2014-04-10 18:03:50 -0400] atiniir: whiteadam thanks

[2014-04-10 19:34:48 -0400] mallu_: hi, is anyone usuing knife bootstrap?
[2014-04-10 19:39:43 -0400] mallu_: no one?
[2014-04-10 19:45:02 -0400] CPS: sadly, no
[2014-04-10 20:19:46 -0400] montjoy: @mallu i've used it a tiny bit
[2014-04-10 20:20:58 -0400] montjoy: with ec2
[2014-04-10 20:22:35 -0400] not: Hi, I'm looking for information on how to uninstall chef from my mac.
[2014-04-10 20:22:45 -0400] binamov: mallu_ i use knife bootstrap. come ask here http://bit.ly/Opscode_OH
[2014-04-10 20:26:00 -0400] mallu_: binamov: can you please tell me if it is possible to upgrade current chef-client while bootstrapping? 
[2014-04-10 20:26:20 -0400] montjoy: http://www.getchef.com/chef/install/
[2014-04-10 20:27:11 -0400] montjoy: oh uninstall nm
[2014-04-10 20:27:38 -0400] mallu_: our vms comes with ver 11.4 and I want to upgrade it to 11.10 while boot strapping 
[2014-04-10 20:27:53 -0400] binamov: mallu_ come ask here http://bit.ly/Opscode_OH
[2014-04-10 20:28:11 -0400] mallu_: I'm at work.. can't do hangout
[2014-04-10 20:28:15 -0400] mallu_: sorry
[2014-04-10 20:28:31 -0400] montjoy: @binamov - why hangouts instead of IRC?
[2014-04-10 20:29:02 -0400] binamov: montjoy we run office hours once a week where you can ask those questions f2f
[2014-04-10 20:29:37 -0400] binamov: mallu_ bootstrapping implies installing chef-client; your boxes are already bootstrapped?
[2014-04-10 20:29:42 -0400] mallu_: binamov: appreciate the invitation... but can't use it while at work
[2014-04-10 20:30:05 -0400] mallu_: well.. our VMs comes with chef-client pre-installed
[2014-04-10 20:30:13 -0400] binamov: ah i see, gotcha
[2014-04-10 20:30:51 -0400] mallu_: what we want to do is, while registering the client to chef server we want to upgrade client to a specific version
[2014-04-10 20:30:59 -0400] binamov: mallu_ i would say use omnibus_updater http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/omnibus_updater and pass it as firstboot during bootstrap?
[2014-04-10 20:31:47 -0400] mallu_: I tried that the issues is it terminate the chef-client during the install
[2014-04-10 20:33:01 -0400] mallu_: that is a built-in thing in omnibus_updater... 
[2014-04-10 20:33:26 -0400] mallu_: when others see the error they might freak out
[2014-04-10 20:34:27 -0400] mallu_: we are using omnibus_updater for upgrading via a script .. the script capture the exception and ignore it so no one see the error
[2014-04-10 20:35:20 -0400] mallu_: is it possible to run a script with bootstrap? it it can then I can use our script to upgrade
[2014-04-10 20:37:46 -0400] mallu_: binamov: what does --bootstrap-version do? I'm specifying the version I want to install but it seems like --bootstrap-version is not doing anything!
[2014-04-10 20:38:59 -0400] binamov: mallu_ you tried --botstrap-version on a node without chef-client installed already?
[2014-04-10 20:39:26 -0400] mallu_: no.. on a VM with older version of chef-client 
[2014-04-10 20:39:55 -0400] binamov: mallu_ so my guess is that --bootstrap-version is used to select chef-client version to install, ignored if cc is already installed
[2014-04-10 20:40:33 -0400] mallu_: binamov: the ideal solution would be --bootstrap-version but I would be happy if I can do a post-install 
[2014-04-10 20:40:54 -0400] mallu_: Thats what I'm seeing with bootstrap
[2014-04-10 20:42:03 -0400] mallu_: I tried calling a script in chef-full.erb but it is not working either  https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/knife/bootstrap/chef-full.erb#L72
[2014-04-10 20:42:09 -0400] binamov: mallu_ use the execute resource to run a script during a chef-client run http://docs.opscode.com/resource_execute.html
[2014-04-10 20:44:44 -0400] mallu_: call execute resource in chef-full.erb?
[2014-04-10 20:46:02 -0400] binamov: i was thinking in a first-run recipe of your choice
[2014-04-10 20:47:42 -0400] binamov: mallu_ ideally, you upgrade your vm image or take chef-client out of the image completely, let the bootstrap process install it
[2014-04-10 20:49:43 -0400] mallu_: yes.. I completely agree.. we are hoping to avoid going down the path... the issue with calling omnibus_updater is "By default the omnibus updater will kill the chef instance by raising an exception." this could freak out the techs and open unnecessary tickets   
[2014-04-10 20:53:53 -0400] binamov: mallu_ easiest way not to freak out techs: give them a warning that you will be killing chef instances ;)
[2014-04-10 20:54:07 -0400] mallu_: :)
[2014-04-10 20:57:29 -0400] mallu_: so i guess there is no easy solution for us :(
[2014-04-10 21:03:23 -0400] binamov: omnibus_updater is easy,  using a custom bootstrap template that runs your script is fairly easy too. i'm surprised the latter didn't work for you @mallu_ 
[2014-04-10 21:23:42 -0400] mallu_: maybe I'm doing it wrong 
[2014-04-10 23:05:14 -0400] whiteadam: .ignore quit
