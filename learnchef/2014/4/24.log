[2014-04-24 00:58:39 -0400] randingo: hi, (i'm not sure which channel to ask/discuss this topic, here or #chef).  My question is in regards to development of recipes with multiple developers.  Me and a couple of my coworkers are working on a product that includes chef, a particular cookbook, and a bunch of recipes.  We each work on a separate recipe within the same cookbook, and separate VM instances.  When I 'knife upload  <cookbook>'; and the coworker executes 'chef-client
[2014-04-24 00:59:57 -0400] randingo: I'm wondering what our options are.  Currently we use Git to push changes and communicate a change and a pull is recommended, before uploading the cookbook again.
[2014-04-24 01:00:37 -0400] randingo: For me, new to chef, I would prefer to upload the cookbook at whim.
[2014-04-24 01:00:47 -0400] randingo: To test my changes.
[2014-04-24 01:00:54 -0400] randingo: Thoughts?
[2014-04-24 17:06:12 -0400] whiteadam: Does anyone know if there's a bootstrap command to make chef-client a daemon by default?
[2014-04-24 17:29:41 -0400] jbz: whiteadam: not that I'm aware, because the method of doing so varies so widely depending on the target OS.  There is a chef-client cookbook, though, for that very purpose - so you could bootstrap it with that cookbook in its initial runlist.
[2014-04-24 17:30:27 -0400] whiteadam: jbz: yeah, that's what I just found. Do you know if the chef-client cookbook sets the daemon, interval, and splay by default?
[2014-04-24 17:30:52 -0400] whiteadam: jbz: If so, I could just include it without making a wrapper and it would be magical.
[2014-04-24 17:31:12 -0400] jbz: yes, it does - check out its attribs file:  https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-client/blob/master/attributes/default.rb
[2014-04-24 17:31:33 -0400] jbz: er although
[2014-04-24 17:31:39 -0400] jbz: I think it might default to cron rather than daemon mode
[2014-04-24 17:32:33 -0400] jbz: oh, no, i'm wrong.
[2014-04-24 17:32:36 -0400] jbz: It defaults to daemon.
[2014-04-24 17:32:45 -0400] jbz: At least I think it does lol I haven't configured it in a while.
[2014-04-24 17:33:09 -0400] whiteadam: haha, yah, I just made a wrapper and am going to just bring it up and see what's up in vagrant
[2014-04-24 17:39:11 -0400] whiteadam: jbz: definitely doesn't like those defaults
[2014-04-24 17:39:22 -0400] whiteadam: Error executing action `start` on resource 'service[chef-client]'
[2014-04-24 17:39:25 -0400] jbz: hm
[2014-04-24 17:39:36 -0400] jbz: what os are you installing on?
[2014-04-24 17:39:40 -0400] whiteadam: cent 6.5
[2014-04-24 17:39:44 -0400] whiteadam: Might be ghosts.
[2014-04-24 17:39:48 -0400] whiteadam: or it doesn't like init
[2014-04-24 17:39:54 -0400] jbz: shouldn't have a problem with init
[2014-04-24 17:59:40 -0400] whiteadam: ah, it was because it hates chef-solo I guess. Worked fine on an actual server
[2014-04-24 19:55:20 -0400] jwoo_: hello all, got a question on the deploy resource
[2014-04-24 19:55:54 -0400] jwoo_: the user for cloning the repo, can it be a nologin? or does it assume it is a system user that can be logged in
[2014-04-24 21:47:44 -0400] mrj: Can someone tell me if this error is a network connectivity OR a config error? It's not specific at all; ERROR: Network Error: getaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
[2014-04-24 21:47:58 -0400] mrj: its sounds like it's not getting the ip/fqdn sent to the command
[2014-04-24 22:04:23 -0400] mrj: figured it out.. had to update chef to match knife i guess
