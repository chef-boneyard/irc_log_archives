[2014-04-09 15:07:08 -0400] zebrarage: hey learncheffers...does someone know the magic to specify a range with gem_package? I couldn't find it in the docs, and my code is hardcoding it to a single version...instead of <= number
[2014-04-09 15:07:40 -0400] zebrarage: gem_package "nokogiri" do
[2014-04-09 15:07:41 -0400] zebrarage:   version "#{node['nokogiri']['version']}"
[2014-04-09 15:07:41 -0400] zebrarage: end
[2014-04-09 15:08:52 -0400] zebrarage: maybe just an option?
[2014-04-09 15:51:09 -0400] medieval1: you mean something like "~> 1.5.3"
[2014-04-09 15:51:37 -0400] medieval1: which is >= 1.5.3 AND < 1.6.0
[2014-04-09 16:03:23 -0400] zebrarage: yeah..just didn't see an example of the syntax but I'm testing it now
[2014-04-09 16:25:53 -0400] PleasureTown: What's everyone wearing?
[2014-04-09 21:14:56 -0400] PleasureTown: Hey all, I'm having an issue getting Vagrant to register properly with the chef server via omnibus. Has anyone experienced the issue where it registers, but then if you run chef-client it tries to check against localhost?
