[2014-04-16 13:19:34 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: hi, I'm learning chef. Installed all software in windows and it worked last week. not yesterday. reinstalled all software. now getting error that my *.pem is not readable. I checked it is not. What permissions does the /chef-repo/.chef/me.pem need?
[2014-04-16 13:22:04 -0400] CPS: zxdcwec4f32: mine has read+execute, read for Users, and everything but special permissions for SYSTEM and Administators
[2014-04-16 13:23:09 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: thanks. new to linux also, where do I find what permission number that is? (ex., 0644 or 0700,...)?
[2014-04-16 13:23:27 -0400] CPS: thought you said you were on windows?
[2014-04-16 13:23:28 -0400] teshian: man chmod ?
[2014-04-16 13:23:32 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: right
[2014-04-16 13:23:47 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: I am but I use cygwin so I assume I can chmod there
[2014-04-16 13:23:52 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: maybe not thought
[2014-04-16 13:24:10 -0400] CPS: no clue if that'd work, honestly
[2014-04-16 13:24:24 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: okay, will look at it - many thanks
[2014-04-16 13:24:43 -0400] CPS: 775 would be the equivalent i think
[2014-04-16 13:26:42 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: thanks
[2014-04-16 13:26:58 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: looks like windows says I have and the system have full control
[2014-04-16 13:27:13 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: wierd
[2014-04-16 13:29:11 -0400] teshian: WIndows inherits from the parent directory unless you sepecifically set it to something else
[2014-04-16 13:29:15 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: ERROR: Your private key could not be loaded from c:/chef/chef-repo/me.pem - Check your configuration file and ensure that your private key is readable
[2014-04-16 13:29:37 -0400] teshian: Are you running as Adminsitrator?
[2014-04-16 13:29:41 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: I have chmod it and ls -la to check it
[2014-04-16 13:30:03 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: under windows/file permission, it has full control
[2014-04-16 13:30:06 -0400] CPS: could be the command window is running as another user or with lower authorityt
[2014-04-16 13:30:34 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: ahh, good point
[2014-04-16 13:31:40 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: just ran the cmd as admin, same error
[2014-04-16 13:32:14 -0400] CPS: check the folder permissions
[2014-04-16 13:32:32 -0400] CPS: could be it can't get into the folder
[2014-04-16 13:35:44 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: chenged the folder FROM read-only
[2014-04-16 13:36:17 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: still error. It indicated to check my configuration file. is that the vagrantfile? If so, it only list the validaotr.pem, not me.pem
[2014-04-16 13:36:35 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: and it is the wrong number for the validotor
[2014-04-16 13:36:52 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: chould I change it and the validator reads the me.pem?
[2014-04-16 13:39:32 -0400] zxdcwec4f32: I think I just need to delete all and start over
[2014-04-16 14:59:59 -0400] CPS: sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure breaks, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/10889389
[2014-04-16 15:00:07 -0400] CPS: my chef server is down now, kind of a big deal
[2014-04-16 16:21:18 -0400] CPS: how do i restore backed up cookbook/client info from a copy of the chef-server directory?
[2014-04-16 18:28:32 -0400] phil_s_stein: Hello. I'm running through the tutorial at https://learnchef.opscode.com/create-your-first-cookbook. How do I do Step 5 (Create the run list) without an account at opscode.com?
[2014-04-16 18:31:34 -0400] teshian: if you don't have free enterprise account then you will need to install chef server locally
[2014-04-16 18:32:10 -0400] phil_s_stein: I've done that. 
[2014-04-16 18:32:40 -0400] phil_s_stein: After pushing the first cookbook, I am getting errors on the server though.
[2014-04-16 18:33:18 -0400] teshian: Double check the hostname, I had issues, it throws errors if the hostname doesn't match what it thinks it should be
[2014-04-16 18:33:26 -0400] phil_s_stein: ok, thanks.
[2014-04-16 18:33:49 -0400] phil_s_stein: so step 5 on that tutorial is just creating a run list for the node, right?
[2014-04-16 18:34:23 -0400] teshian: yes
[2014-04-16 18:34:30 -0400] phil_s_stein: I should be able to create my own run list on the node and populate it with my new recipe.
[2014-04-16 18:35:13 -0400] teshian: It pulls that from the server
[2014-04-16 18:35:40 -0400] phil_s_stein: Where "that" is my new recipe, right?
[2014-04-16 18:35:47 -0400] teshian: So you use the webserver for your local chef server or you use knife node edit <nodename>
[2014-04-16 18:36:22 -0400] phil_s_stein: "knife node edit", interesting. 
[2014-04-16 18:36:46 -0400] teshian: when i edit a cookbook I run knife cookbook upload -a to load all cookbooks to the chef server
[2014-04-16 18:38:24 -0400] teshian: When I first started I used the opscode chef server so I could play around with chef on a couple machines, then once I wanted to do more than a couple machines I installed the server locally
[2014-04-16 18:38:53 -0400] phil_s_stein: I do have a server, workstation, and a node up and running.
[2014-04-16 18:39:11 -0400] phil_s_stein: Now I'm just trying to figure out how to work with the,
[2014-04-16 18:39:14 -0400] phil_s_stein: *them.
[2014-04-16 18:41:24 -0400] teshian: I was just suggesting that so you don't have to worry about the chef server bit at the start, the local server and the client certs are a pain to setup especially when you are new to chef
[2014-04-16 18:41:53 -0400] phil_s_stein: Gotcha. I plowed through that part ok, I think. 
[2014-04-16 18:42:28 -0400] phil_s_stein: My machines don't have direct external access, so remote server was a no go.
[2014-04-16 18:57:49 -0400] phil_s_stein: Thanks for the help teshian. I used "knife node run_list add NODENAME 'recipe[apache_test::default]'" then ran 'sudo chef-cleint' on the node and everything worked.
[2014-04-16 18:57:52 -0400] phil_s_stein: Very nice.
[2014-04-16 18:59:10 -0400] teshian: Cool, I am still learning as well
[2014-04-16 18:59:23 -0400] teshian: just used it to setup 26 machines 
[2014-04-16 18:59:32 -0400] teshian: my receipes are a little hacky
[2014-04-16 19:02:14 -0400] phil_s_stein: So people just generally do the work on the workstation, then tell the clients to run chef-client (or cron job that)?
[2014-04-16 19:02:24 -0400] phil_s_stein: the server is semi-set and forget?
[2014-04-16 21:45:34 -0400] dth465yeytr: hi. Using chef to start up ec2 instances. How can I I have it NOT automatically try to ssh in to the server?
