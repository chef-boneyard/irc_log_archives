[2014-05-30 01:47:47 -0400] ddreggors: I want to remove override attributes that were set in a role. The role has been removed, how can I determine which attributes the role added
[2014-05-30 01:51:38 -0400] ddreggors: I may have several roles on a given server, some of these roles override attributes. If I remove a role, I then want to remove the attributes and any config files the recipe created as a result of that attribute. I have an undefined action that will do the removal of attributes and files as long as you pass it an attribute name. What I need is a way in code to determine what attribute was overridden in a role that has already been removed
[2014-05-30 01:52:21 -0400] ddreggors: sorry undefine action
[2014-05-30 01:54:04 -0400] ddreggors: one thought was to match normal attributes to override attributes, and undefine any overrides or role_overrides that do not also exist in normal (last run state) however my normal shows nothing in it ( {} )
[2014-05-30 03:34:03 -0400] ddreggors: anyone know how an override_attribute in a role can become a normal attribute after client run?
