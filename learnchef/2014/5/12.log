[2014-05-12 15:11:58 -0400] saasuser: Recently I started working on Chef - 
[2014-05-12 15:13:46 -0400] saasuser: when I tried to install knife vspheregem install knife-vsphere - received an error  - unable to install
[2014-05-12 15:13:57 -0400] saasuser: anyone has any suggestions to resolve this issue
[2014-05-12 15:14:24 -0400] saasuser: clang: error: unknown argument: '-multiply_definedsuppress' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future] clang: note: this will be a hard error (cannot be downgraded to a warning) in the future make: *** [yajl.bundle] Error 1
[2014-05-12 15:15:08 -0400] saasuser: Thanks for your time and insight on this issue
[2014-05-12 15:43:33 -0400] mmzyk: sassuser I dont know anything about knife vsphere, but you must be installing on a mac since its complaining about clang. It must be trying to compile something locally on your box and its using an argument that clang doesnt recgonzie.
[2014-05-12 15:45:04 -0400] mmzyk: er, saasuer ^
[2014-05-12 15:45:22 -0400] mmzyk: Its likely if you use gcc it will work, would be my guess.
[2014-05-12 15:47:03 -0400] mmzyk: See point 3 in this point for how to install gcc 4.2 on a mac using homebrew: http://new-bamboo.co.uk/blog/2013/10/24/3-quick-tips-for-coding-with-os-x-10-9-mavericks
[2014-05-12 19:43:00 -0400] joco: Hi I have been looking at chefspec for testing but getting a failure when .upcase being applied to a string in the attributes file.  Does chefspec support ruby in attribute files?
[2014-05-12 19:54:10 -0400] rke3: Hello all. I'm trying to use a chef cookbook_file resource on a per environment basis. Is this possible? ie I want to deploy a specific file when environment=qa. Is there a different resource I should be using?
[2014-05-12 20:06:01 -0400] mmzyk: joco Ask that in #chef, someone will probably know there.
[2014-05-12 20:08:11 -0400] mmzyk: rke3 Im not sure you can use a resource on a per environment basis.
[2014-05-12 20:08:12 -0400] CPS: rke3: you can use ruby if blocks
[2014-05-12 20:08:15 -0400] joco: mmzyk - thank you
[2014-05-12 20:08:20 -0400] CPS: i've done it
[2014-05-12 20:08:45 -0400] mmzyk: ah, that makes sense CPS - check what environment the resource is being run in.
[2014-05-12 22:27:09 -0400] rke3: CPS: Thanks. I think I get you.
