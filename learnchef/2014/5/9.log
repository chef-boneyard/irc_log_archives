[2014-05-09 12:38:20 -0400] thebowski: Hello, I've been having some difficulty using the Apache2 default recipe.  I've changed the attributes file so that it should run the default site, but it still does not.  I've changed every instance in the attributes file so that it should run the default site regardless of what system it's running on, but it still does not.  I noticed this line in the chef-client log: "
[2014-05-09 12:38:26 -0400] thebowski: Processing execute[a2dissite default] action run (apache2::default line 34)
[2014-05-09 12:39:56 -0400] thebowski: That line states that the default recipe is running a script that disables the default site, but the line referenced has nothing to do with the script.  In fact, "a2dissite" only appears in the default recipe once, to change the permissions.  Execute also only appears once as well, and does not run a2dissite.  Does anyody have any idea how I can enable the default site, and prevent it from being disabled when the default script i
[2014-05-09 12:40:07 -0400] thebowski: Also, is anybody else actually here?
[2014-05-09 13:10:13 -0400] thebowski: Is anybody here that may be able to help me with an issue I've been having with the default apache2 recipe?
[2014-05-09 13:25:35 -0400] thebowski: Hello, would anybody be able to help me with an issue I've been having with the Apache2 default recipe?  I can't seem to enable the default site despite enabling it in the attributes file.
[2014-05-09 14:12:14 -0400] thebowski: Hello, would anybody be able to help me with an issue I've been having with the Apache2 default recipe?  I can't seem to enable the default site despite enabling it in the attributes file.
[2014-05-09 14:41:33 -0400] mmzyk: thebowski Can you give a link to the recipe youre using?
[2014-05-09 14:43:25 -0400] Shubby: thebowski: I don't know if I can be useful since I'm quite new with Chef but I just set up a blank CentOS VM, bootstrapped it and put apache2 in the run list, made sure that default_site_enabled attribute was set to true, put an index.html in /var/www/html and it seems to work
[2014-05-09 14:43:59 -0400] thebowski: https://github.com/onehealth-cookbooks/apache2/blob/master/recipes/default.rb
[2014-05-09 14:44:25 -0400] Shubby: afaik if you use a default site, it should drop a 000-default file in /etc/httpd/sites-enabled
[2014-05-09 14:44:45 -0400] thebowski: I made sure that all of the default_site_enabled attributes were set to true.
[2014-05-09 14:45:23 -0400] thebowski: During the chef-client run log, I get this line: [Fri, 09 May 2014 14:00:40 +0000] INFO: Processing execute[a2dissite default] action run (apache2::default line 34)
[2014-05-09 14:45:41 -0400] mmzyk: thebowski and what do you see when you try to access the default site?
[2014-05-09 14:46:52 -0400] thebowski: I get an apache2 404 page saying "/" could not be found
[2014-05-09 14:47:00 -0400] Shubby: ah, so that sounds like it's working
[2014-05-09 14:47:04 -0400] Shubby: there's just no index.html
[2014-05-09 14:47:13 -0400] thebowski: There is, but the site isn't enabled
[2014-05-09 14:47:38 -0400] thebowski: There's no link in "sites-enabled", and if I run the command "a2ensite default" it works
[2014-05-09 14:48:27 -0400] thebowski: It does appear in "sites-available" of course
[2014-05-09 14:49:59 -0400] Shubby: so the recipe can't turn it on but if you enable it manually after the chef-client run, it works fine?
[2014-05-09 14:50:24 -0400] thebowski: Also, line 34 in the apache2 default recipe doesn't do anything of the sort, and  I have no idea where it's getting that execute command.  I also tried setting the "apache_site 'default' do; enable true; end" so it would be a constant
[2014-05-09 14:50:46 -0400] thebowski: Apparently.  If I run the command in bash in a recipe that executes after that point, it works.
[2014-05-09 14:51:35 -0400] mmzyk: I think its likely the line numbers being reported are likely wrong, so I wouldnt put too much stock in line 34, fyi.
[2014-05-09 14:52:47 -0400] mmzyk: It seems like this section of the readme on the apache2 cookbook might be relevant: https://github.com/onehealth-cookbooks/apache2#apache_site
[2014-05-09 14:52:51 -0400] thebowski: Yeah, the only place "execute" appears is unrelated to "a2dissite", and the only place "a2dissite" appears is setting permissions on the file/creating it.  So apparently that's not even in the default recipe.  I've tried to find it.
[2014-05-09 14:53:09 -0400] mmzyk: Sorry if youve already seen it, Im not very familiar with this cookbook, so learning some as I go.
[2014-05-09 14:54:31 -0400] thebowski: No problem, that's how the default recipe is supposed to enable the default site, but it doesn't.
[2014-05-09 14:55:16 -0400] mmzyk: https://github.com/onehealth-cookbooks/apache2/blob/master/recipes/default.rb#L179-L186
[2014-05-09 14:55:32 -0400] mmzyk: That seems relevant to your troubles perhaps.
[2014-05-09 14:57:15 -0400] Shubby: so https://github.com/onehealth-cookbooks/apache2/blob/master/definitions/apache_site.rb seems like the piece of code that's failing to do its job here
[2014-05-09 14:57:32 -0400] Shubby: line 34 is the same as in your chef-client log
[2014-05-09 14:58:20 -0400] mmzyk: excellent find Shubby, that seems to be exactly it.
[2014-05-09 14:58:51 -0400] Shubby: it seems pretty straightforward though, and having just seen it work, I don't know why it isn't working for him :|
[2014-05-09 14:58:55 -0400] mmzyk: And its getting if the enabled attribute is true or not from here: https://github.com/onehealth-cookbooks/apache2/blob/master/recipes/default.rb#L185
[2014-05-09 15:00:41 -0400] thebowski: Yeah, I even tried hardcoding it to true and it didn't work.  So weird.  Maybe I should just try downloading the cookbook again, thought it doesn't seem like it should make a difference.
[2014-05-09 15:01:05 -0400] mmzyk: Where did you try hardcoding it?
[2014-05-09 15:01:16 -0400] thebowski: The apache2 default recipe.
[2014-05-09 15:02:21 -0400] thebowski: then I had a recipe that ran after the apache2 default that only ran that command again and reloaded apache, still no luck.
[2014-05-09 15:03:17 -0400] Shubby: are you using Hosted Chef?
[2014-05-09 15:04:02 -0400] thebowski: I have a local chef server I've set up
[2014-05-09 15:04:28 -0400] mmzyk: I wonder if your hitting an attribute precence issue.
[2014-05-09 15:05:38 -0400] thebowski: It should have been when it was hardcoded to true.
[2014-05-09 15:05:50 -0400] thebowski: *shouldn't
[2014-05-09 15:07:11 -0400] Shubby: and just to get this out of the way... if you run: $ knife node show YOUR_NODE_NAME -a apache.default_site_enabled 
[2014-05-09 15:07:14 -0400] Shubby: it does return true?
[2014-05-09 15:07:56 -0400] thebowski: One minute, trying it out.
[2014-05-09 15:18:31 -0400] ssd7: thebowski: Any luck?
[2014-05-09 15:18:43 -0400] thebowski: It shows false.
[2014-05-09 15:18:57 -0400] Shubby: I'll admit I was hoping for that
[2014-05-09 15:19:08 -0400] thebowski: Well, it gives something to work on at least.
[2014-05-09 15:20:11 -0400] Shubby: is your node perhaps part of an environment that's overriding your attempt to set it to true?
[2014-05-09 15:21:35 -0400] thebowski: I haven't set up any environments, I'm using the default and don't have any environment specific attributes
[2014-05-09 15:22:15 -0400] ssd7: Well, it showing up false likely means it is a much easier problem than if it had shown up as true :).  Shubby's question is a good one.  I would also check knife node show -Fj -l YOUR_NODE_NAME and then check out if that attribute is set at non-default precedence levels anywhere.
[2014-05-09 15:22:17 -0400] Shubby: it was worth a shot
[2014-05-09 15:24:48 -0400] thebowski: What should I be looking for in that?
[2014-05-09 15:25:40 -0400] ssd7: thebowski: So, the various attributes are broken up into hashes according to their precedence level
[2014-05-09 15:26:20 -0400] ssd7: thebowski: I would search for "default_site_enabled" and see (1) does it show up multiple times, (2) if so, which hash is it under (default, normal, or override?)
[2014-05-09 15:26:42 -0400] ssd7: The hunch being that somehow that attribute also got set at the "normal" level of precedence
[2014-05-09 15:26:59 -0400] ssd7: meaning that nothing you are changing in attribute files matters
[2014-05-09 15:31:48 -0400] thebowski: It's only in there once, and it's set to false.  It's under "apache"
[2014-05-09 15:32:49 -0400] ssd7: thebowski: OK, and if you look further up that apache is under default?
[2014-05-09 15:34:25 -0400] thebowski: Yes, it is.  
[2014-05-09 15:35:31 -0400] ssd7: Alrighty then.  And you said you changed it to true in the attribute file in the cookbook?
[2014-05-09 15:36:48 -0400] thebowski: Yes, I changed all of the occurences to true.
[2014-05-09 15:38:14 -0400] ssd7: So, I only ask because I've done this myself 100 times
[2014-05-09 15:38:20 -0400] ssd7: did you definitely upload your changes
[2014-05-09 15:39:07 -0400] Shubby: I hate when that happens
[2014-05-09 15:39:35 -0400] Shubby: uuuh why isn't it working WORK DAMN YOU WORK... ... oh.
[2014-05-09 15:40:48 -0400] ssd7: if that isn't it, please put: puts debug_value(:apache, :default_site_enabled)
[2014-05-09 15:40:55 -0400] ssd7: right here: https://github.com/onehealth-cookbooks/apache2/blob/master/recipes/default.rb#L183
[2014-05-09 15:41:18 -0400] ssd7: and then post what it prints to the log
[2014-05-09 15:41:42 -0400] thebowski: god damnit that's probably it
[2014-05-09 15:42:36 -0400] mmzyk: heh. I think weve all failed to upload changes a million times if that ends up being it.
[2014-05-09 15:44:08 -0400] thebowski: So much wasted time :(
[2014-05-09 15:44:52 -0400] mmzyk: Dont worry about it. One day well have out how to make a system that doesnt need us to remember to upload things. Until that day, it happens.
[2014-05-09 15:45:52 -0400] ssd7: Would be cool if chef had something where you could drop it in your PS1 and it would give you hints about whether you need to upload
[2014-05-09 15:46:01 -0400] thebowski: I always remembered when I wasn't using my chef-server as the work station.  Oh well.
[2014-05-09 15:46:03 -0400] ssd7: I think that would be more difficult in the Berkshelf world
[2014-05-09 18:03:19 -0400] devjj: What is the best way to manage apt packages? I have a recipe that installs some initial packages, but say I want to add another one later. Do I just add it to the list? This doesn't seem to have any effect when I try it.
[2014-05-09 18:06:30 -0400] Shubby: devjj: that's how it should work, you just add it to the list of packages you want installed and it should do it at the next chef-client run
[2014-05-09 18:06:51 -0400] devjj: Shubby: Can you think of any reason it wouldn't? I'm trying to add git and it's not picking it up.
[2014-05-09 18:06:53 -0400] Shubby: provided you're specifying the right package name and it's not already installed (and possibly other things)
[2014-05-09 18:13:14 -0400] Shubby: for something common like git, I don't see why doing something like package "git" do action :install end wouldn't work (with carriage returns where appropriate)
[2014-05-09 18:13:47 -0400] devjj: That's what's stumping me. Granted, I'm doing this in vagrant. I wonder if there's some silly thing, since vagrant (so far as I can tell) is crap.
[2014-05-09 18:16:15 -0400] Shubby: so just to be safe... if you type: $ vagrant ssh  (to access the VM shell) and then type: $ git version
[2014-05-09 18:16:28 -0400] devjj: Yeah, it's not there. Tried that.
[2014-05-09 18:16:35 -0400] Shubby: okay
[2014-05-09 18:16:36 -0400] devjj: I'm doing a vagrant reload --provision now.
[2014-05-09 18:16:58 -0400] Shubby: you'll probably want to start by looking at your chef client log
[2014-05-09 18:17:21 -0400] Shubby: see if the bit about adding the git package appears in there and what happens when it gets to that point
[2014-05-09 18:17:53 -0400] Shubby: at least that's what I would do (disclaimer: I'm pretty new at Chef)
[2014-05-09 18:18:52 -0400] devjj: Yeah, I looked there. When it gets to running my apt installs it just skips past as though everything is there.
[2014-05-09 18:18:54 -0400] devjj: It's so strange.
[2014-05-09 18:20:21 -0400] Shubby: can you find a line in there that says something like: package[git] action install (up to date) ?
[2014-05-09 18:22:15 -0400] devjj: Someone else broke the recipe. *smh*
[2014-05-09 18:22:22 -0400] devjj: Nothing to see here. Move along. Thanks so much for helping.
[2014-05-09 18:22:40 -0400] Shubby: :)
[2014-05-09 18:22:44 -0400] Shubby: freaking saboteurs
[2014-05-09 18:23:13 -0400] devjj: Eh, this stuff is brittle. I'm not liking Chef much, mainly because they seem to be terrible at setting good practices and explaining how everything coalesces.
[2014-05-09 18:23:23 -0400] devjj: It's all "pay us pay us pay us"
[2014-05-09 18:24:21 -0400] mmzyk: I dont think that its all pay us pay us. At least, we try not to make it that way. I do work at Chef, to be clear. One of the engineers.
[2014-05-09 18:24:51 -0400] mmzyk: So perhaps Im biased, but what is giving you that impression devjj?
[2014-05-09 18:24:56 -0400] Shubby: I have nothing to compare it to, my main source of frustration is that while the community overall is helpful, I hate that your only options for support are the mailing lists, IRC and, uh, Twitter, I think (aside from their paid support offerings which are fine)
[2014-05-09 18:25:06 -0400] Shubby: I would love nothing more than an actual forum
[2014-05-09 18:25:41 -0400] mmzyk: Shubby You aware of leanchef.com ?
[2014-05-09 18:25:51 -0400] mmzyk: Its not a forum, but might prove useful.
[2014-05-09 18:26:03 -0400] Shubby: yep, familiar with it
[2014-05-09 18:26:04 -0400] devjj: mmzyk: I concur with everything Shubby just said. It's mainly the lack of clear examples. You give us lots of tiny, isolated examples, but there is very little that ties it together. The "learn chef" 6-week course took me all of 3 hours to grok. Then... nada. Google all day long.
[2014-05-09 18:26:26 -0400] mmzyk: Theres also a fair amount on Stackoverflow, but of course it can be hard to determine what is up to date and what isn't.
[2014-05-09 18:26:45 -0400] devjj: For example, something as simple as an example repo with a Vagrantfile that spins up a small cluster for Ruby apps, PHP apps, etc. Basic things like "here's one way to tie it all together" stuff.
[2014-05-09 18:27:07 -0400] mmzyk: devjj Thats fair criticism.
[2014-05-09 18:27:12 -0400] Shubby: a wiki would be nice, as an alternative to a forum
[2014-05-09 18:27:36 -0400] mmzyk: Shubby We used to have a wiki, but it was hard to update and was replaced by the docs site.
[2014-05-09 18:27:52 -0400] devjj: The early emphasis on Chef Server is asinine, frankly. In terms of just getting something running so you can iterate and learn that way, that's such a bad workflow. Having to manually delete nodes *and* clients from the server, etc, while you're still learning. It's so painful.
[2014-05-09 18:28:04 -0400] mmzyk: devjj So, were actively working on trying to make that better for you. A lot of that is going to land at learchef.
[2014-05-09 18:28:25 -0400] mmzyk: Historically, weve allow the community to define and set best practices, but its come with the detriment you talk about.
[2014-05-09 18:28:35 -0400] devjj: mmzyk: And my point is that for a mature product at version **11**, that it's taken this long is just silly.
[2014-05-09 18:28:44 -0400] mmzyk: So were starting to try and be more assertive.
[2014-05-09 18:29:10 -0400] mmzyk: chefdk is one step in that direction, although doesnt address exactly your points.
[2014-05-09 18:29:19 -0400] mmzyk: More is in the works.
[2014-05-09 18:30:04 -0400] devjj: That's good to hear, but it's pretty late in the game. I'm doing fine coming along, but it feels mired in corporate marketing decisions, honestly.
[2014-05-09 18:30:16 -0400] devjj: The current state of affairs, I mean.
[2014-05-09 18:30:56 -0400] Shubby: I should give chefdk a try, I keep hearing about Berkshelf and Foodcritic and don't know what they are (and that's on me for not taking the time to research either, since they seem to be big deals)
[2014-05-09 18:31:04 -0400] mmzyk: As far as Chef being at 11, thats an interesting tale in and of itself. Up until 10, Chefs numbering scheme was different. It was 0.8, 0.9, etc. and peopel complained it didnt have the perception of a point one So what happened was the numbers just shifted infront of the decimal.
[2014-05-09 18:31:10 -0400] devjj: In a little over a week I've gone from 0 to a running 5-instance Vagrant environment configured with Chef solo. If that's the case for me, why is it taking you guys so long to put out even basic real world examples?
[2014-05-09 18:31:31 -0400] mmzyk: devjj Resources.
[2014-05-09 18:31:32 -0400] devjj: mmzyk: Yeah. "Corporate marketing decisions" right?
[2014-05-09 18:31:44 -0400] mmzyk: No, not really - more of startup finding its way.
[2014-05-09 18:32:22 -0400] devjj: mmzyk: Funny. I was just reading about how much you guys have raised. Resources wouldn't appear to be an issue.
[2014-05-09 18:32:43 -0400] devjj: Hell, you could offer a bounty for the public to do this for you. Anything would be better than the glacial pace you're keeping.
[2014-05-09 18:32:46 -0400] mmzyk: Sure. Money isnt the issue at this point. Its people.
[2014-05-09 18:33:13 -0400] mmzyk: Well, we just hired several people to work on learnchef full time, so hopefully it gets better.
[2014-05-09 18:34:14 -0400] mmzyk: It is what it is. I dont really have excuses for it. Weve been an engineering focused company for a long time and we relied on the community to help new people out. That only scales so much and now were trying to fix that.
[2014-05-09 18:34:25 -0400] Shubby: wanna hire me? I'm smart and charming and since I'm also learning Chef, I can point out the flaws in the learning mechanisms
[2014-05-09 18:34:26 -0400] Shubby: :)
[2014-05-09 18:34:40 -0400] devjj: mmzyk: No offense, but that feels like a copout. Rails relied on the community and it did just fine.
[2014-05-09 18:34:43 -0400] mmzyk: Sure - we have lots of open positions, feel free to apply.
[2014-05-09 18:34:46 -0400] devjj: So have many, many other projects.
[2014-05-09 18:35:31 -0400] mmzyk: devjj Youre right. It wasnt a focus for a long time and we know we neglected it. Weve started trying to address it, but to your point we let it languish too long.
[2014-05-09 18:35:53 -0400] devjj: Anyway, I'll stop bitching. I know it's not *your* doing and believe you guys are trying to make it better. Just a very frustrating experience right now.
[2014-05-09 18:36:19 -0400] devjj: Last thought: Go to docs.opscode.com. Try to look at that page from the eyes of someone who doesn't work there and is just getting started.
[2014-05-09 18:36:52 -0400] mmzyk: Yeah, the docs site is horrible if youre new to Chef. It serves as a great reference page if you know what youre doing, but absolutely sucks if you dont.
[2014-05-09 18:37:15 -0400] mmzyk: Thats the hole learnchef is trying to fill, but its not there yet, as weve discussed.
[2014-05-09 18:41:18 -0400] mmzyk: This isnt really helpful, but since I just thought it, all of the docs.opscode site is on github: https://github.com/opscode/chef-docs
[2014-05-09 18:42:43 -0400] mmzyk: We also working on a new community site that is entirely open sourced: https://github.com/opscode/supermarket
[2014-05-09 18:42:47 -0400] mmzyk: Its not yet live.
[2014-05-09 18:42:53 -0400] mmzyk: Just some FYIs.
[2014-05-09 18:44:04 -0400] Shubby: if there's a forum in there ( la phpBB), I will be very happy
[2014-05-09 18:45:02 -0400] mmzyk: Sorry, that doesnt exist as far as I know.
[2014-05-09 18:45:12 -0400] Shubby: I am now sad
[2014-05-09 18:46:02 -0400] mmzyk: Oh, right Shubby, you asked about Foodcritic, Berkshelf, etc. Go look at ChefDK. Those are various tools for working with Chef and cookbooks that have been developed by the community and ChefDK is a tool to integrate them together in one package with a defined workflow.
[2014-05-09 18:46:46 -0400] Shubby: thanks! how does it integrate with Hosted Chef, since that's what I use?
[2014-05-09 18:47:46 -0400] Shubby: I haven't used Chef Solo at all but I've gotten the distinct feeling (perhaps mistakenly) that some of the development tools are aimed squarely at Chef Solo
[2014-05-09 18:48:37 -0400] mmzyk: So it should all work just fine with hosted Chef. 
[2014-05-09 18:49:14 -0400] Shubby: I'll give it a shot!
[2014-05-09 18:49:19 -0400] mmzyk: Im not sure what would be aimed at just chef solo.
[2014-05-09 18:50:01 -0400] Shubby: well, I can't really explain it nor do I have any evidence or examples, so don't mind me
[2014-05-09 18:50:22 -0400] Shubby: it's just a "feeling" I've had, perhaps derived from my complete lack of understanding of certain concepts I keep coming across
[2014-05-09 18:52:03 -0400] mmzyk: Well, feel free to ask about them here and Ill try to answer.
[2014-05-09 18:52:41 -0400] Shubby: thanks :) I won't waste your time with things I can look up myself, I'll rather ask when there's something I can't wrap my mind around
[2014-05-09 18:53:35 -0400] mmzyk: Well, part of having a seperate learnchef irc room is for people to ask any questions they want, even the basic ones.
[2014-05-09 18:56:18 -0400] Shubby: I really need to start by reading http://misheska.com/blog/2013/06/16/getting-started-writing-chef-cookbooks-the-berkshelf-way/ and I bet it'll make sense afterward (just to take the Berkshelf example)
[2014-05-09 18:56:45 -0400] mmzyk: Okay.
[2014-05-09 18:56:55 -0400] Shubby: I do appreciate the offer though!
[2014-05-09 19:08:01 -0400] Shubby: well, actually I do have a question now... I'm working on a server build for a website, and I need the build to install git (got that working) and then use git to clone a private repo -- at this time I'm struggling with the authentication piece
[2014-05-09 19:08:47 -0400] grubernaut: I have a chef-server running locally, and one node running locally all through libvirt (QEMU + Ubuntu 12.04). What is a better, and faster way to provision more nodes as a proof of concept for using chef that is better than our current method of preseeding a libvirt install of ubuntu and then running an ansible playbook? I would love to be able to do this as fast as test-kitchen can bring up a VM, but that's not practical for a production envi
[2014-05-09 19:11:20 -0400] mmzyk: Shubby authentication for what?
[2014-05-09 19:11:29 -0400] Shubby: ah, sorry, I meant for Github.com
[2014-05-09 19:11:42 -0400] Shubby: I usually use git with private keys but I'm using a service account with just a username and password and no matter what I do, I can't get it to authenticate to GitHub.com to grab that stupid repo
[2014-05-09 19:11:51 -0400] Shubby: (even via shell)
[2014-05-09 19:13:00 -0400] mmzyk: Im not sure without digging deeper - maybe look at the community site and see if there is a git or github cookbook that might offer clues? Although I wont vouch for how well it is written.
[2014-05-09 19:13:37 -0400] mmzyk: grubernaut Im not entirely certain what youre asking with that question. What is the scenario youre looking to accomplish?
[2014-05-09 19:13:42 -0400] Shubby: I didn't think of looking for a github cookbook, but the git cookbook is what I'm already using, all it does is install git or git server
[2014-05-09 19:14:06 -0400] Shubby: (plus it installs an ancient version of git but I blame CentOS/yum for that)
[2014-05-09 19:16:00 -0400] grubernaut: mmzyk:  currently, we spin up new vms, but ssh'ing into a hypervisor (libvirt), running a preseeded install of ubuntu, then running an ansible playbook to get the vm up to a certain state. This takes a lot of time, and a lot of hands-on work for each new VM that we bring up. I was wondering what everyone used in production for bringing up new vms quickly? 
[2014-05-09 19:16:13 -0400] mmzyk: Yeah, Id suggest looking for a cookbook to access github, or ask your question in #chef, as it is very likely someone where knows how to do exactly what you want, Shubby.
[2014-05-09 19:17:19 -0400] mmzyk: grubernaut Gotcha. That is a great question for #chef where youre likly to find a diversity of opinions on that. If youre into living on the edge a bit you might check out https://github.com/opscode/chef-metal
[2014-05-09 19:17:33 -0400] Shubby: yeah I haven't tried asking there, I figure cloning a repo to a node shouldn't be akin to string theory :)
[2014-05-09 19:18:06 -0400] Shubby: (and I did find http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/github but it has no documentation and looking at the code it doesn't look like it'll do what I need)
[2014-05-09 19:18:33 -0400] mmzyk: The #chef room is friendly, its just sometimes the Q&A gets super deep and technical, which is why learnchef exists, to be a less hectic environment to ask questions.
[2014-05-09 19:20:23 -0400] grubernaut: mmzyk:  Thank Ya. :) I'll ask in #chef. I would want to avoid vagrant if I could. As well as containers. Which is why we are currently rolling with LibVirt and QEMU so we have actual disk images that we can manipulate should something go wrong. 
[2014-05-09 19:21:54 -0400] mmzyk: grubernaut Okay. Yeah, chef-metal has a variety of provisioners, but its ungergoing a lot of active development and is currently subject to rapid change. Im not sure, since you dont want vagrant, what else to offer, but its not my area of expertise. 
[2014-05-09 19:22:42 -0400] grubernaut: mmzyk:  thank you for the help :) vagrant is great for dev testing but I'm hesitant about using vagrant in production just yet. 
[2014-05-09 19:23:07 -0400] mmzyk: Yeah, I dont blame you on that one.
[2014-05-09 19:24:20 -0400] grubernaut: heh one command and it's all gone. networking is different as well. 
[2014-05-09 19:38:47 -0400] mmzyk: grubernaut I was reading over in #chef, but some other options to make you aware of: there is knife ec2 which can do provisioning in AWS. Not what you want, but might be helpful in some instances.
[2014-05-09 19:38:59 -0400] mmzyk: Also, foreman as chef support now, so you might check that out.
[2014-05-09 19:39:59 -0400] grubernaut: mmzyk:  that's all good for development. But the company I am with wants everything sealed up tight. Everything done in-house. which is fine and all, just wish I could provision vm's faster haha
[2014-05-09 19:40:23 -0400] grubernaut: If I could ```vagrant up``` a full VM on libvirt that would be perfect. 
[2014-05-09 19:40:59 -0400] mmzyk: well, thats all Ive got. As someone with a dev background and little ops, youve gone out of my league.
[2014-05-09 19:41:48 -0400] grubernaut: lol I got thrown in the middle. I'm a natural dev, but stuck in an ops position. Trying to include my favorite of both worlds, but it's frustrating sometimes :) 
[2014-05-09 19:41:54 -0400] grubernaut: ty for the help though. 
[2014-05-09 19:42:04 -0400] mmzyk: grubernaut Let me drop some chefconf videos your way that might be useful, although I have no idea
[2014-05-09 19:42:05 -0400] mmzyk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR20EFb4mCY&index=50&list=PL11cZfNdwNyMmx0msapJfuGsLV43C7XsA
[2014-05-09 19:42:32 -0400] mmzyk: ^ that seems directly relevant to your interestests. 
[2014-05-09 19:43:10 -0400] mmzyk: Here is the foreman one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtR0mCeisbs&index=62&list=PL11cZfNdwNyMmx0msapJfuGsLV43C7XsA
[2014-05-09 19:43:20 -0400] grubernaut: mmzyk:  nice, iPXE.. that might work. I'll have to do some more research. 
[2014-05-09 19:43:58 -0400] mmzyk: Here are all the ChefConf 2014 videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11cZfNdwNyMmx0msapJfuGsLV43C7XsA
[2014-05-09 19:44:11 -0400] mmzyk: Might be more in there, so look through as you have time.
[2014-05-09 19:44:39 -0400] grubernaut: mmzyk:  will do! thank you a bunch! :)
