[2014-05-08 20:00:21 -0400] RazaR: I have a very noobish bootstrap question and it's probably related to my lack of knowledge of custom template files. The bootstrap process will install the rpm from the internal URL but the process cannot create the client on the chef-server. It thinks the chef_server_url is localhost when I have it defined in the knife.rb as my.chef.server.....
