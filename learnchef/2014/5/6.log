[2014-05-06 22:10:37 -0400] devjj: I'm having issues with apt timing out on my Chef runs. Any tips?
[2014-05-06 22:12:02 -0400] devjj: This is in a Vagrant VM.
[2014-05-06 22:13:17 -0400] teshian: proxy server?
[2014-05-06 22:14:04 -0400] devjj: teshian: I could try that, but it doesn't seem like it should be this slow.
[2014-05-06 22:14:30 -0400] devjj: It's taking apt >10M to pull 32MB. I'm on a slow connection right now (5Mbps) but even that should be more than enough.
[2014-05-06 22:14:46 -0400] teshian: you may want to do a sanity check on your dns, just to make sure it is working, you might be getting odd timeout issues
[2014-05-06 22:15:44 -0400] teshian: what is your host OS?
[2014-05-06 22:15:54 -0400] devjj: OS X, VMware provider
[2014-05-06 22:16:36 -0400] devjj: Mavericks to be more specific.
