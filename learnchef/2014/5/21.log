[2014-05-21 10:52:14 -0400] aandy: is it possible to use something similar to "include_attribute" but for node json - that is, say i have two recipes in a cookbook, and want to have two node json's which have the same variables, but different recipe, then i'd have to c/p the json part with node variables (and edit two places), right? nested json is kind of what i'm hinting at
[2014-05-21 10:52:24 -0400] aandy: (chef-solo)
[2014-05-21 11:10:02 -0400] aandy: or should i rather link to an "attributes" json in the config (json_attribs), and have a couple of json files simply stating the different run_list's?
[2014-05-21 11:21:58 -0400] aandy: hmm, no, they override eachother. i'm wondering what the best/common way to do this is 
[2014-05-21 11:29:56 -0400] aandy: ah, i didn't notice the -o option in chef-solo, sorry! :)
[2014-05-21 12:07:39 -0400] aandy: ah my coworkers will love me when i leave them in charge with the servers, fully equipped with chef for managing. not because i've made it easy for them to take over, but because i've aliased these to the chef client cmd: such, very, many, much etc. so now when they make changes, they edit a json file, and do # many restart, # such config etc. ;)
[2014-05-21 12:07:48 -0400] aandy: well, i'm trying to make it "fun" anyway
[2014-05-21 14:24:21 -0400] aandy: if i have data_bags/pw/test.json is there an obvious reason why key = data_bag_item("pw", "test") would fail with "Can't convert Array into String" ?
[2014-05-21 15:09:01 -0400] aandy: anyone? i've tried running it under ruby2.1 aswel (as suggested here https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sensu-users/GYnZnJmtg-s ), but it gives the same error
[2014-05-21 15:14:21 -0400] aandy: ARGH ffs. missing data_bag_path was the reason. wish there had been a more verbose error than "array to string failed" lol. or even just a mention on google. anyway, if any of you ever see that error, now you know
[2014-05-21 15:25:21 -0400] mmzyk: aandy That one seems to pop up every now and then. The error is likely not so helpful b/c of rubys very dyamic nature, so narrowing down what is wrong is difficult.
[2014-05-21 15:27:51 -0400] aandy: mmzyk: i agree on the stack level. i was just thinking maybe the chef utilities checked for config defaults (e.g. if cookbook_path has no value), but i guess that'd make a long list of vars to check
[2014-05-21 15:28:47 -0400] mmzyk: I dont know if something like Foodcritic checks what you want or not.
[2014-05-21 15:30:04 -0400] aandy: it's more of a setup issue, when chef is installed. just took a while before i encountered the error, so i didn't link it with improper chef-setup at first :)
[2014-05-21 15:30:18 -0400] aandy: but foodcritic looks nice, i'll check that out, thanks
[2014-05-21 15:33:04 -0400] mmzyk: aandy Check out the chef-dk - it bundles a lot of tools together to make then easy to use. I think it includes foodcritic
[2014-05-21 15:33:54 -0400] mmzyk: aandy Yeah, it does include foodcritic. Heres a handy link to check it out: http://www.getchef.com/downloads/chef-dk
[2014-05-21 15:35:00 -0400] aandy: neat
[2014-05-21 15:41:26 -0400] Shubby: hi there -- I'm trying to write a small config file with a single line, the line is made up of a static string as well but I need to add in the content of an encrypted data bag item so the line reads: DB_PASSWORD = '(my database password)'
[2014-05-21 15:41:43 -0400] Shubby: so in my recipe I'm just using a template method, and my template reads: DB_PASSWORD = '<%= node['enrollapidbpw'] %>'
[2014-05-21 15:42:06 -0400] Shubby: and finally I have an attribute which reads: default['enrollapidbpw']= Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("keys", "dbpw")
[2014-05-21 15:42:26 -0400] Shubby: ...and that didn't work, instead of writing the actual db password in the config file, it wrote: DB_PASSWORD = '#<Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem:0x00000003800108>'
[2014-05-21 15:42:37 -0400] Shubby: what did I do wrong? :)
[2014-05-21 15:45:35 -0400] jonlives: Shubby: check out the example at http://docs.opscode.com/chef/essentials_data_bags.html#decrypt :)
[2014-05-21 15:50:14 -0400] Shubby: jonlives: I guess I'm either confused (I'm new to Chef and Ruby) or the example doesn't completely cover what I'm trying to do, I've used encrypted data bags to an extent but never written a file containing a mix of static content and the content of a data bag item
[2014-05-21 15:50:52 -0400] Shubby: so for example I know how to grab the contents of a data bag item and write it as-is to a file with nothing else in it (e.g. a private key)
[2014-05-21 15:51:28 -0400] Shubby: but in this case I have this DB_PASSWORD = '' string which is not in the data bag, and I need to insert the contents of the data bag item between the quotes 
[2014-05-21 15:51:59 -0400] jonlives: Shubby: I'd recommend decrypting the key in your recipe and passing it to the template as a variable, otherwise you're storing the decrypted key in your node attribs
[2014-05-21 15:52:24 -0400] jonlives: Shubby: examples of using variables with templates here: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_templates.html
[2014-05-21 15:56:56 -0400] Shubby: struggling with the syntax in the examples but let me try 
[2014-05-21 16:07:37 -0400] Shubby: no luck... I got rid of what I had in attributes/default.rb and now have this bit of code in my recipe: http://puu.sh/8VjU4.png
[2014-05-21 16:07:53 -0400] Shubby: credentials.py.erb reads: DB_PASSWORD = '<%= @dbpw %>'
[2014-05-21 16:08:17 -0400] Shubby: and after running chef-client, the file still ends up reading: DB_PASSWORD = '#<Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem:0x00000001f41748>'
[2014-05-21 16:11:05 -0400] Shubby: ok, I figured it out
[2014-05-21 16:11:17 -0400] Shubby: in my snippet of code, instead of :dbpw => enrollapidbpw , it needs to read :dbpw => enrollapidbpw["privkey"] 
[2014-05-21 16:11:28 -0400] Shubby: thanks
[2014-05-21 16:13:57 -0400] zr2d2: Hi, I'm having trouble using the application and django lwrp
[2014-05-21 16:14:42 -0400] zr2d2: my recipe is at https://gist.github.com/zr2d2/f36e4190d92c8be9a862
[2014-05-21 16:15:18 -0400] zr2d2: but after it runs, supervisor tells me my app is stoped
[2014-05-21 16:28:03 -0400] mmzyk: zr2d2 Im not aware of the application resource? Is that coming in from an lwrp somewhere?
[2014-05-21 16:28:15 -0400] mmzyk: Its possible you just need to tell it to start your application.
[2014-05-21 17:00:04 -0400] alexbst: Shubby - https://github.com/albertsj1/chef-ebs/blob/master/recipes/volumes.rb has an example of decrypting databag contents
[2014-05-21 17:00:57 -0400] Shubby: nice, thanks alexbst!
[2014-05-21 17:01:25 -0400] Shubby: I got my thing working but I already learned something from the code you just linked
[2014-05-21 17:04:29 -0400] alexbst: I already stole that implementation to do my own https://github.com/atrull/cassandra_priam_cookbook/blob/master/recipes/awscredentials.rb - you can see it mixing in to a template nicely.
[2014-05-21 17:22:58 -0400] zr2d2: mmzyk: it's an opscode cookbook https://github.com/poise/application
[2014-05-21 17:25:31 -0400] mmzyk: Ah, I think it used to be an Opscode cookbook. Opscode, now Chef, gave maintainership to a lot of different groups as we were getting overwhelmed trying to keep them up and not doing a good job.
[2014-05-21 17:25:37 -0400] mmzyk: That looks like coderanger maintains it now.
[2014-05-21 17:25:56 -0400] mmzyk: He can frequently be found in the #chef room, especially later in the day westcoast time.
[2014-05-21 17:26:10 -0400] mmzyk: Ill take a look though, now that I know where its coming from.
[2014-05-21 17:26:31 -0400] zr2d2: mmzyk: thanks
[2014-05-21 17:38:15 -0400] mmzyk: zr2d2 So the only thing that I think might be off, and I dont have experience with this cookbook/lwrp, but based on reading the examples in the repos, it looks like the gunicorn block might need to be inside the django block.
[2014-05-21 17:38:26 -0400] mmzyk: Thats all Ive got - if thats not it, Im not sure what is.
[2014-05-21 17:39:30 -0400] zr2d2: mmy, I'll try that
[2014-05-21 17:44:38 -0400] zr2d2: mmzyk
[2014-05-21 17:45:11 -0400] zr2d2: : nope "
[2014-05-21 17:45:12 -0400] zr2d2: undefined method `gunicorn' for Chef::Resource::ApplicationPythonDjango
[2014-05-21 17:45:12 -0400] zr2d2: " when i move it inside
[2014-05-21 17:48:22 -0400] mmzyk: yeah, I think I was wrong and what you had was right, the more I look at it.
[2014-05-21 17:50:01 -0400] mmzyk: Im not sure zr2d2. I think ask in #chef. Perhaps something on your system is causing it to not restart.
[2014-05-21 17:50:11 -0400] zr2d2: mmy, no response from codranger yet, says he's in there though
[2014-05-21 17:50:44 -0400] mmzyk: He does have a day job. :) You might ask more generally why, when using the application resource, you might not be seeing your app start. 
[2014-05-21 17:50:55 -0400] mmzyk: Are there any errors anywhere?
[2014-05-21 17:52:10 -0400] zr2d2: yeah, it looks like the gunicorn resource is trying to create a virtualenv in a folder that doesn't exist yet
[2014-05-21 17:54:32 -0400] mmzyk: I know little about python and less about django and gunicorn, but Id suggest looking into that. :)
[2014-05-21 17:55:17 -0400] zr2d2: yeah, makes sense, I'm in the same boat
[2014-05-21 17:56:56 -0400] mmzyk: So, I dont know if gunicorn is supposed to create that virualenv or where its coming from, but it might be something you setup with some of the attributes on the application cookbook or django.
[2014-05-21 18:04:12 -0400] zr2d2: if i take out the gunicorn resource, it looks like the virtualenv is created fine
[2014-05-21 18:04:16 -0400] zr2d2:  python_virtualenv[/apps/django/shared/env] action create
[2014-05-21 18:04:17 -0400] zr2d2:   * directory[/apps/django/shared/env] action create
[2014-05-21 18:04:17 -0400] zr2d2:     - create new directory /apps/django/shared/env
[2014-05-21 18:04:18 -0400] zr2d2:     - change owner from '' to 'root'
[2014-05-21 18:04:18 -0400] zr2d2:     - change group from '' to 'root'
