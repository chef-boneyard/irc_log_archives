[2014-05-01 02:40:41 -0400] duallain: Is there a good chefy way of declaring that some arbitrary block of code (execute/ruby block) does something?  Like 'this block makes directory x/y/z'.  Or this shell command made installed package A.
[2014-05-01 18:00:57 -0400] Qapf: Heya! I had a quick question about modifying the chef-server installer. I'd like the chef webui not to be proxied by nginx, but I would still like it running. 
[2014-05-01 18:01:46 -0400] Qapf: default['chef_server']['lb']['upstream']['chef-server-webui'] = [ "127.0.0.1" ] is the attribute that is used by nginx.conf.erb to create the entry in the file, but the precise logic is that it iterates over all the elements in upstream to produce the file. I've tried a few different things to try to unset this attribute
[2014-05-01 18:01:53 -0400] Qapf: but my ruby syntax is not the strongest 
[2014-05-01 18:03:25 -0400] Qapf: would anyone know how to remove that object in the configuration declarations in chef-server.rb?
[2014-05-01 21:21:52 -0400] mmzyk: Qapf asking all the touch questions today.
[2014-05-01 21:21:59 -0400] mmzyk: You using open source or enterprise?
[2014-05-01 21:22:08 -0400] mmzyk: s/touch/tough
[2014-05-01 21:22:15 -0400] Qapf: open source
[2014-05-01 21:22:28 -0400] Qapf: i resorted to just nuking the line in /opt/chef-server/embedded/cookbooks/chef-server/attributes/default.rb
[2014-05-01 21:22:34 -0400] Qapf: which is ugly, and i hate 
[2014-05-01 21:23:04 -0400] mmzyk: well, you should be able to set the value to nil in your chef-server.rb
[2014-05-01 21:24:18 -0400] mmzyk: Its likely you need to set it as: lb[upstream][chef-server-webui] = nil
[2014-05-01 21:24:35 -0400] Qapf: let me get back to there, one moment.i remember trying similar syntax and having it not work
[2014-05-01 21:27:17 -0400] mmzyk: Qapf there is also a long list of settings that you might find useful here: http://docs.opscode.com/config_rb_chef_server_optional_settings.html
[2014-05-01 21:27:34 -0400] Qapf: thats the list i've been working from, its been a huge help
[2014-05-01 21:27:36 -0400] mmzyk: I dont think it includes absolutely every single one, but it has most of them.
[2014-05-01 21:28:10 -0400] Qapf: this is one of those not on the list. i liked the old chef 10 behavior where webui was not published where api was published and i wanted to get it back.
[2014-05-01 21:29:06 -0400] mmzyk: Do you want the webui at all?
[2014-05-01 21:29:15 -0400] Qapf: i do, i just want it on another port
[2014-05-01 21:29:26 -0400] Qapf: and not fronted by nginx
[2014-05-01 21:29:48 -0400] Qapf: so the easiest thing to do is just wipe it from the nginx config. problem solved. 
[2014-05-01 21:31:20 -0400] Qapf: so my irc client chewed on your text a bit, so did you mean 'upstream' or ''upstream ?
[2014-05-01 21:32:19 -0400] mmzyk: yeah, it should be quoted.
[2014-05-01 21:32:29 -0400] mmzyk: I mistyped it.
[2014-05-01 21:32:35 -0400] Qapf: cool, so my entry is lb['upstream']['chef-server-webui'] = nil
[2014-05-01 21:32:49 -0400] mmzyk: yeah. give that a try.
[2014-05-01 21:32:51 -0400] Qapf: and i get back 
[2014-05-01 21:32:51 -0400] Qapf: NoMethodError
[2014-05-01 21:32:52 -0400] Qapf: -------------
[2014-05-01 21:32:52 -0400] Qapf: undefined method `[]=' for nil:NilClass
[2014-05-01 21:34:59 -0400] mmzyk: huh. Im not sure then.
[2014-05-01 21:35:16 -0400] mmzyk: Maybe this holds a key for you: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef-server/blob/master/files/chef-server-cookbooks/chef-server/attributes/default.rb#L190
[2014-05-01 21:35:39 -0400] Qapf: i ended up circling this for a bit, trying different syntax to unset the line
[2014-05-01 21:35:56 -0400] Qapf: in the end, I used my friend sed and just removed it before i run reconfigure
[2014-05-01 21:36:11 -0400] mmzyk: gotcha.
[2014-05-01 21:36:22 -0400] mmzyk: So, the chef-server.rb file is interpreted by mixlib-config.
[2014-05-01 21:36:47 -0400] mmzyk: The syntax there might point you in the right direction https://github.com/opscode/mixlib-config
[2014-05-01 21:38:58 -0400] Qapf: thank you, i'll give it a read
[2014-05-01 22:55:00 -0400] Stryder: Any bodies?  
[2014-05-01 22:55:15 -0400] Stryder: Curious to try and get chef-server running on osx.  Thoughts?
