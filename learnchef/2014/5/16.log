[2014-05-16 01:00:45 -0400] jblack: Hi, I'm experienced with chef as a whole, but a little bit new configuring with chef.
[2014-05-16 01:01:20 -0400] mmzyk: jblack Welcome. :)
[2014-05-16 01:01:21 -0400] jblack: I'm trying to make a recipe to install  sp1 on ws2008r1, and it seems as if windows_package isn't passing options to the installer
[2014-05-16 01:01:29 -0400] jblack:  Thank you, mmzyk! 
[2014-05-16 01:01:39 -0400] jblack: pardon, new to configuring -windows- with chef. 
[2014-05-16 01:02:54 -0400] mmzyk: gotcha.
[2014-05-16 01:02:59 -0400] jblack: http://pastebin.com/MqYNP2QZ  is what I came up with, but I ende up with a window named "SPInstall Usage", that lists available switches, one of which is "/quiet   Quit mode (no user interaction or display) 
[2014-05-16 01:03:09 -0400] mmzyk: Im not going to be much help, but perhaps I can point you to some docs.
[2014-05-16 01:03:36 -0400] mmzyk: This will likely be a convenient reference: http://docs.opscode.com/windows.html
[2014-05-16 01:03:38 -0400] jblack: I wonder if options odesn't use the /
[2014-05-16 01:04:27 -0400] mmzyk: http://docs.opscode.com/windows.html#windows-package
[2014-05-16 01:05:52 -0400] jblack: Yeah, I've been friends with that page for the last few days. =) 
[2014-05-16 01:06:30 -0400] jblack: fond it. the install method is :custom. =) 
[2014-05-16 01:06:56 -0400] mmzyk: glad you figured it out. I dont think it was getting close. :)
[2014-05-16 01:08:01 -0400] jblack: I had a hunch I was close. Last night I was able to get an rsyslog on windows to feed fluentd on a more proper system. =) 
[2014-05-16 01:08:50 -0400] mmzyk: nice.
[2014-05-16 14:17:36 -0400] waky: Hi, if I have looked correctly chef-client on Windows does not require anything else than the client installed? I am just askin because I get odd EOF error after I do the first chef run on client (using already setup client.pem)
[2014-05-16 14:18:53 -0400] mmzyk: waky It shouldnt, at least not that I know of.
[2014-05-16 14:19:06 -0400] mmzyk: What is the error?
[2014-05-16 14:23:26 -0400] waky: EOFError: end of file reached
[2014-05-16 14:23:40 -0400] waky: this might something to do with our chef server.
[2014-05-16 14:24:10 -0400] waky: I can see that the node was created for the client. But when it tries to GET node data it fails.
[2014-05-16 14:25:28 -0400] mmzyk: Could be. I dont really have anything helpful to point you at at this point.
[2014-05-16 14:27:00 -0400] waky: I started to suspect it would be the pem file format but as the initial connection succeeded (used client.pem instead of validation as I could not get the file from the server)
[2014-05-16 14:31:20 -0400] waky: but I will continue digging
[2014-05-16 23:25:10 -0400] schof: is chef a good solution for automating my aws sqs setup?
[2014-05-16 23:25:40 -0400] schof: there are a tons of queues, permissions, etc. to be configured for our setup.  was thinking we automate this with chef.
[2014-05-16 23:26:04 -0400] schof: but from what i can tell, chef seems to be all about building stuff on server and requires access to the server
[2014-05-16 23:40:58 -0400] vikky: hi all
[2014-05-16 23:40:59 -0400] vikky: I have a node node1 which needs to be in role1.
[2014-05-16 23:41:07 -0400] vikky: role1s run list includes a recipe that has default[node1][attr1]=abc
[2014-05-16 23:41:18 -0400] vikky: in the role1s definition I am including override_attributes{ node1:{ attr1:xyz } }
[2014-05-16 23:41:31 -0400] vikky: and when I apply via chef-client-j role1.json the attr1 value does not get overridden to xyz it stays as abc
[2014-05-16 23:42:24 -0400] vikky: does anyone know why the role override did not work?
[2014-05-16 23:46:04 -0400] vikky: someone anyone?
