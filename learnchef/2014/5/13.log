[2014-05-13 17:14:19 -0400] caddyman67: anyone have any idea why "service: start" command works when running chef-client on local node
[2014-05-13 17:14:35 -0400] caddyman67: however if I bootstrap the same node and run same cookbooks, "service start" doesn't work
[2014-05-13 17:17:21 -0400] caddyman67: so if I run cookbook with "service :start" command on local node, it works, when using bootstrap command from local machine to remote host, it doesn't work, same exact run list
[2014-05-13 17:17:47 -0400] caddyman67: service will stop, but won't start unless I run the cookbook manually on the local node
[2014-05-13 20:14:04 -0400] Premius: quick question guys... can i use a not_if and only_if together?
[2014-05-13 20:16:08 -0400] Premius: like this - not_if {File.exists?(current_path)} && only_if {::Win32: Service.exists?("a service")}
[2014-05-13 20:38:51 -0400] mmzyk: Premius I dont think it works with a &&
[2014-05-13 20:40:51 -0400] mmzyk: that said, I could be wrong. Ive never actually tried it.
[2014-05-13 20:41:22 -0400] Premius: It looks promising..
[2014-05-13 20:41:41 -0400] Premius: first test are succesfull
[2014-05-13 20:41:52 -0400] mmzyk: Ill consider myself wrong then.
[2014-05-13 20:47:30 -0400] Premius: Can confirm it works.. thanks!
[2014-05-13 21:30:14 -0400] devjj: Anyone available to help me with a Java cookbook issue? I'm getting what appears to be a previously known and fixed issue, but the latest version of the cookbook isn't working for me. This is the issue: https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-2996?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:all-tabpanel
[2014-05-13 21:54:41 -0400] dgarstang: Oh good. That prick isn't here.
[2014-05-13 22:32:51 -0400] dgarstang: I must be a total moron because I simply can't find any docs on what 'kitchen test' and 'kitchen converge' do and how they differ.
